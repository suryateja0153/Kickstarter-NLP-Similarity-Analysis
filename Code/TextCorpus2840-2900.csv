These days, the tools to make lightshows has gotten even more accessible with hardware like the Novation Launchpad and Arduino circuitry.When I first got into designing lightshows, I noticed that the process for designing intricate lightshows was more complicated than making the lightshow itself. Lets take a Novation Launchpad for example (this isn't the only hardware this program is meant to support). Its fed certain data in order to know what lights to turn on, or off.Each light on the Launchpad is mapped to a specific MIDI note. I couldn’t believe people took the time and effort to make lightshows using a manual process of placing each and every note mapping, timing them correctly, and going through tons of trial and error to achieve both simple or complex effects. In the case of arduino, theres a ton of manual programming.Heres what a finished Launchpad Lightshow looks like in its raw format. Its rather daunting. And its also very time consuming to make from scratch.In 2013 I made a tool that mimicked a Launchpads LED structure, but it had more colours than what the launchpad supported. About a year later, late 2014, I decided to reboot the project, purchase a Launchpad, and spent a weeks worth of time getting the program to talk to the Launchpad. The result is a program that removes having to worry about what things map to what lights, and brings you closer to an environment that could be compared to stop motion animating. Because the program is meant to mimick your lightshow hardware, anything made in just the editor is also guaranteed to work on the same hardware its meant to control. Song Illustrator even supports more than one device at a time. That currently being the Novation Launchpad. However, I'd like to expand beyond MIDI hardware and to more widespread configurations, such as arduino board LED setupsDespite this program being a big leap forward, its still very far from its goal. The UI isn’t as powerful as it could be, theres still plenty of bugs to work out, and the Launchpad isnt the only device capable of lightshows, The goal is to support any device that could possibly have controllable LEDs.This program will become the no brainer for making lightshows of any kind. A lightshow at its core, is visual. Why should you have to worry about how everything maps in the end?

https://www.kickstarter.com/projects/goatandseed/parklets-for-change?ref=discovery_category_newest,goatandseed/parklets-for-change,"What’s a Parklet?A parklet is a small space serving as an extension of the sidewalk to provide amenities and green space for people using the street. It is typically the size of several parking spaces. Parklets typically extend out from the sidewalk at the level of the sidewalk to the width of the adjacent parking space.HPC and WNU have collaborated to build and use this parklet as a gateway to a program that will be home to an abundance of plant life that we deem good in the diets of being a healthy individual. There will be something alive and growing within the space year around and we will have classes and seminars as well as community events, like art shows, live painting exhibits, food truck weekends, and live performances throughout the summer known as the HPC Presents Summer Series.How much do we need?We are asking for $5,000. We need $40,000. To do 3 more we need $100,000 in order to link communities.How will this better a community?In low-income communities, According to the National Institutes of Health, the unbalanced diet resulting from the consumption of fast food increases the chances of fatal health conditions, such as hypertension, coronary heart disease, diabetes, stroke, and colon cancer. The NIH further states that those who eat fast food more than twice a week have a two-fold increase in insulin resistance. For people with high resistance, insulin does not process effectively, causing abnormal amounts of sugar to circulate in the blood stream. As a result, high blood sugar levels increase the chances of heart disease and diabetes. Between 1972 and 1995, the amount of Americans diagnosed with diabetes doubled, along with the number of fast-food restaurants. If this rate continues over the next 25 years, one in ten Americans will be diagnosed with Type II Diabetes (“Diabetes Improvement”). 60% of families and individuals eat an unbalanced diet (NIH), leading to health issues such as obesity, diabetes, cardiovascular problems and other chronic illnesses. Barriers to increasing the consumption of balanced, nutritional meals include minimal education about healthy food and beverage choices, and in addition, limited access to healthy food and beverage options due to financial restrictions. Strategies to overcome these barriers will include increased access to nutritional education among low-income youth and adults, and increased access to affordable, locally grown fruits and vegetables provided by partnered community gardens throughout Seattle.To obtain increased access WNU and HPC have designed a program called Recovery to Expand This is a very detailed and intense program. It is intended to encourage a lifestyle change among low-income youth. Our program is geared specifically towards students entering high school. Our goal is to teach students how to budget for, purchase, and cook healthy foods within a low-income budget and EBT; in addition, our students will learn how to grow their own fruits and vegetables in consideration of weather patterns in the Seattle area. The purpose of this education is to encourage students to lead environmentally friendly and sustainable lifestyles, and to be healthier, happier people. Our program hopes to facilitate familial involvement when possible, and encourage the whole family to incorporate and adopt the healthy eating habits and lifestyle choices we aim to instill.The foundation will structure the program as follows: 0. Preliminary Orientation: a. Students will attend a preliminary orientation at the Parklet with their parent(s) or guardian(s) b. Students and parent(s) or guardian(s) will receive a brief, but detailed overview of the program, its intentions, and its activities c. Students and parent(s) or guardian(s) will provide via signature written acknowledgment of the programs’ policies, expectations and the expected time commitment 1. Physical Therapy Orientation a. Students will attend a group orientation with our program’s full-time physical therapist (PT). Our PT will discuss the importance of: i. Strength and endurance training for the development of healthy bones, joints, and the secure closure of growth plates ii. Exercises and activities to promote the healthy development of bones, joints, and the secure closure of growth plates b. All students will have the opportunity to meet one-on-one with our PT at least once per term (4 months) to identify problems in their developing bodies i. All student-athletes will have the opportunity to meet one-on-one with our PT at least once per month to preserve the integrity of their bones, joints, and secure the closure of their growth plates ii. Student-athletes meet with our PT more often, as many low-income student-athletes may rely on an athletic scholarship to receive a post-secondary education 2. Nutritional Orientation a. Students will attend a group orientation with our program’s full-time nutritionist. Our nutritionist will discuss the importance of: i. A well-balanced diet, and how each particular food group affects the development of the body and/or brain ii. Identifying what foods are healthy and which are not, including identifying false labeling, e.g. “Fat-Free” foods aren’t necessarily better for you, and in fact may be worse iii. Developing the skills to budget, purchase, and cook food within low-income restrictions, including EBT iv. Developing strategies for healthy snacking, and creating good habits that help to cut-down, not eliminate, junk-food snacking b. Students with dietary restrictions or with family members with dietary restrictions will meet with the nutritionist within these particular groups and learn how to accommodate their specific dietary needs (e.g. vegetarianism, veganism, allergies, intolerances, or gastric diseases) 3. Green-Thumb Orientation a. Students will attend a group orientation with our program’s full-time biochemist. The Parkelt will once again serve as the door opener before bringing students to our partner's, The Urban Buggy, Community Garden located of Yesler in Seattle. Our students will discuss: i. What foods are able to grow in the Seattle area ii. When foods are able to grow in the Seattle area (i.e. what grows during the fall, winter, spring, summer) iii. What goods are best grown at home, and what foods ought to be purchased instead b. Students will learn or revisit their gardening skills with the passing over of each season or when necessary (e.g. heat-wave, drought, floods, etc.) c. Each student will be given a small, square garden space (22ft) to grow their food on premise of the foundation, or designated gardening spaces in communities where such spaces are available 4. Utilizing Skills a. In the final stage of our project, the foundation encourages the students to engage with the variety of skills they have learned: i. Once per week, students will work in their garden space for one hour in exchange for a meal provided by the foundation ii. Twice per month, students and family members will attend a cooking-class that is geared towards low-income food budgets, utilizing EBT and student-grown food.What's the Overall Out Come?The Recovery to Expand program targets the educational portion of chronic illness prevention by educating low-income youth and adults about healthy lifestyle choices and proper nutrition. The Recovery to Expand Program (RTE) includes: physical assessment and physical activity education, diet and nutrition education, and a “green-thumb” education. The RTE Program educates low-income youth and adults about: the necessity of physical activity, age-appropriate and affordable exercises, what proper nutrition is and how to cook nutritionally balanced meals, and what foods to purchase, and if possible, what foods they are able to grow on their own. The RTE Program thereby provides the necessary platforms to implement a lifestyle change among youth and adults, within families and individuals, to prevent the development or further development of chronic illnesses such as obesity and type II diabetes. The RTE Program will be introduced into low-income communities directly, and also to specific patients and patient groups of the specific medical centers with which we are currently partnered.","As with every thing in life, a new project or idea can come with many challenges.In King County alone, which has a total population of 2,044,449(2013), physical inactivity is a significant risk factor for obesity and type II diabetes, both of which elevate risk for cardiovascular disorders, stroke, and sleep apnea and asthma An increase in physical activity, in addition to a balanced, nutritious diet, can prevent these diseases youth and adults. Barriers to increasing physical activity among low-income communities are, primarily, financial limitations due to the increasing expense of participation in youth and adult physical programs (e.g. soccer, baseball, yoga, etc.). In addition, working adults in low-income communities must overcome working schedules that aren’t often accommodating. Strategies to overcome these barriers are the introduction of affordable and flexible physical health assessments and physical health education catered towards the specific needs of low-income youth and adults. Our focus, specifically, is on low-income youth (i.e. students) as they are more easily accessed via schools. We focus, particularly, on low-income youth, as it is easiest to implement changes within a family by introducing youth to activities and games they can do at home, either among friends or family members. By targeting youth, adults can be inspired to incorporate physical activity into playtime with their children, and can therefore accomplish two tasks at once, which is more accommodating to the working adults’ schedule. We can then reach out to the entire household and furthermore help enforce a lifestyle change for an entire household and not just a temporary diet, or activeness. This Parklet Program  addressed by The Why Not Us Foundation's Recovery to Expand Program includes, in addition to its diet and nutritional portions, a physical health assessment and education portion. This portion creates a comfortable environment where children and adults can be assessed for endurance, and strength. In addition, the program measures each individual’s BMI (Body Mass Index) and can, in addition to endurance and strength assessments, compile a list of physical activities and exercises that are age, sex, and body appropriate, as well as implement a food education program that will benefit the individual based on their needs and wants.",https://www.kickstarter.com/projects/goatandseed/uncle-mikes-barbecue-and-cider-bar?ref=discovery_category_newest,goatandseed/uncle-mikes-barbecue-and-cider-bar,"Uncle Mike's Barbecue has been around since 2010. We've served the best of food to the best of people in the great city of Seattle. Uncle Mike had dreamed of feeding the heartiest of smoked goodness to the people of Seattle. With his wife being a vegetarian, Uncle Mike later added 10 vegetarian options to an already popular menu. In 2014, Uncle Mike was diagnosed with cancer and started to look for his successor. In steps Zander Natallanni, who upon the initial offer, decided that this wasn't the right time. Zander wanted to take a year off to travel and see his family, meet a woman to settle down with and start a family. One year later when Zander had completed traveling, and had in fact met that woman, he returned to invite Uncle Mike to the wedding. At this point, Zander was informed that Uncle Mike's offer still stood, and it was one he couldn't refuse. Zander took over the business, relocated to a newly renovated spot in North Seattle (Pinehurst Neighborhood) and has the best landlords a renter can ask for. After months of hard work, we have begun to build the city's first farm-to-table barbecue joint. Our motto is simple: ""Do it right the first time."" Our slogan says the rest: ""In here it's good to eat.""Join us, as we embark on a journey that will see us expand our space from 1700 sq ft. to 3100 sq ft. Uncle Mike's will have sit down fine dining four nights a week and event space available for rent for corporate events. We will double our catering efforts, while transforming our entire menu to local, sustainable and organic foods. What does that mean?All our food will be as locally-obtained as possible, usually within 500 miles of our location. All of our food will be organic.By the end of 2018, we plan to recycle or compost 95% of all materials used and reduce our water waste by 75%.By 2020, we plan to purchase our own farm system and grow 50% of all crops and add farm-raised chickens.FARMING: We will also be growing food in the restaurant space and on the complex property around the building. This will aid in our fight against obesity, diabetes, and hunger, while teaching healthy eating habits and get locals involved in farming knowledge.COMMUNITY CLASSES: Uncle Mike's will be holding cooking classes throughout the coming months of our growth. These classes will teach locals how to smoke meats properly, cook healthy meals and save money. At the same time, they will be switching to organic foods, and more importantly--discovering the importance of family time and bonding. After all, food brings folks together.If we were to achieve $6,000 this would allow for us to complete our 1st stage in our Farm to Table concept with switches of all produce and dairy products within the first 2 months of 2017.$26,000 Allows for us to expand into our next door space with a newly designed kitchen that will extend off our new one and allow for us to focus on local cooking classes and seminars.$40,000 Allows us tocomplete all the stages of our Farm to Table concept including raising our own chickens and eggs, while obtaining the necessary components to continue usage of said products.$100,000 Allows us to do all the above and start our own farming system that would sell to our own restaurant and provide food to local shelters and food banks and create 15 jobs.","Our challenges and risks are quite simple. Not too much, not too soon. We are focused on the simple format of creating a fully functioning farm-to-table restaurant, with a menu unlike any other barbecue spot. We have a big risk with transforming our inventory from national brands to local brands and paying more for those. That will increase our cost of goods by 20%. However, we will save buy going sustainable and using compostable products bought in bulk. We also have a great lease extension that benefits not just the restaurant, but our landlords as well. We have a good price point that grows when we grow."

Please see our website for product updates. We will be making the main plug as the plate system is already in place. The other items will have to wait a bit. We will try to make the retrofit kit for other straps as well.ProMediaGear announces Quick-Release Shoulder Strap, version 2. The new and improved Shoulder Strap System draws on experiences gained in last six years of designing camera equipment. It introduces new options and system compatibility with straps from other vendors.The Plug works on the same principle as a Quick Release hose fitting. A cylinder inside the plug pushes steel balls out, expanding inside a hardened steel fitting (hardened steel is incredibly rigid). Once expanded it's impossible to remove the plug, unless the spring loaded release button is pressed. To prevent accidental release, the button is flush with the casing, and access to it is protected by the strap loop on top.To engage the strap, insert the plug into the female insert inside the bracket plate while pushing the button, then release the button. As the bearing balls expand, the system will be positively locked. Give it a quick tug to confirm a positive lock. To remove simply press the button and pull the plug out.Below are the rewards in this Kickstarter Project.To have a functioning system, you need to select a combination of one of the two plates and one of the four plugs, at minimum.  We also offer two kits that include one of the plates and standard plug (SSP1) and our strap.If you already own a strap that you like, but would like to upgrade to our new QR system, you'll need, a compatible camera plate and one of the plugs.There are four types of plugs: #SSP1 - This is our featured plug that comes bundled with our PMG Strap#SSP2 - Accepts any 1/4""-20 thread mount or anchor, with safety set screw to prevent accidental unscrewing#SSP3 - Designed for straps that are permanently sewed in and not able to loop through the adapter. Our SSP3 has a removable top bar, fits straps up to 1.1 inch wide.#SSP4 - Designed to keep the carabiner or D-ring connection on your strap and just loop it through our system (1/4"" diameter rounded hole)Neoprene padded strap is rated for 15 pound load.Of course once you purchase the SS strap system from us, then it's also compatible with many custom camera plates that PMG has in their arsenal.All ProMediaGear Quick-Release components are sourced and manufactured in The USA. The strap is made of non-skid, shock absorbing neoprene to keep secure on your shoulder. It distributes the weight evenly and adjust to people big and small.Weight tested for durability and piece of mind, it passed our stress tests of four crazy individuals, up to 300 pounds (136KG). The recommended load is 15 pounds or 7KG.We put a lot of effort into this design to ensure that it meets the needs of our customers.  No other system out there offers the same versatility as ours.  The PBX3 universal Arca-type plate allows you to seamlessly integratewith many of our other products, saving you money on future products since you already own a base part (like a handle or flash bracket).If you already own a strap that you are satisfied with, there is no reason to spend money on another one, simply upgrade it with our plug and one of our plates.We are a first company to offer this type of a strap with plate that fits both Manfrotto and Arca-type clamps. The strap system is integrated with our custom Arca style camera plates and L-Bracket (L-plates).  Keep in mind that if you would like to switch the universal plate (PBX3) for any of our custom fitted camera base plates for Nikon, Canon, Panasonic or Sony, you may do so at no additional change (before we ship of course). You can find them at www.ProMediaGear.comWe are turning to Kickstarter to help us determine popularity of the different strap, plug and plate combinations that we offer, once we know the mix, we will use the money raised in this campaign to secure better pricing for strap, tooling, molds and assembly fixtures.This product is sure to make a huge splash once it hits the market, and this is your opportunity to get in on the ground floor. We appreciate your contributions, and we thank you sincerely.","We're using the Kickstarter community to fund our goal of $20,000 to secure lower productions costs.  We've added many improvements to our previous version of the Plug and strive to keep the same price even though costs are higher now.  Potential challenges would be not getting products finished in time, or sourcing strap delays, out of our control.  With our industry experience those should be minimal if at all.

The #BP2 is an innovative Port Protector as well as L-Cage Adapter. We designed multiple prototypes to get to where we are today. We knew that it wouldn't be easy to create something so simple yet so elegant and easy to use.We all know how risky tethering a camera can be, the risk is too high not to take some precautions to protect the camera ports! Replacing a damaged HDMI port is very expensive. While there are other devices on the market, they are designed to only fit single style of camera and offer limited adjust-ability. The Universal L-Cage Port Protector is compatible with all current DSLRs and Mirrorless cameras and will allow you to quickly protect your side ports and also attach a wide range of useful accessories including: External Monitors, Lights, Voice Recorders, Microphones, GPS Adapters etc. The L-Cage Port Protector features 9 UNC 1/4""-20 thread mounts to support your shooting style; so you can start protecting your equipment right away. Adjustable on two axes (fore-aft and side-side), the Universal Port Protector prevents cable snags, plug bumping, and other mishaps that can cause irreparable harm to your fragile camera equipment. There are 9 1/4”-20 port threads with anti-rotation holes too: just attach the #A10 (included) snag protector anywhere that feels right!BP2 Adjusts to fit most types of cameras to protect the ports, takes just few minutes to setup:Timeline:The current #BP2 version doesn't work with Tall Cameras like Nikon D5, or Canon 1Dx, (Canon 5d or Nikon D850 with battery pack) for those a riser piece is needed, see picture above. We've designed and prototypes some versions of it, but currently don't think that would be a major seller. If you can convince us otherwise we can make that too.Right now, we come to you, Kickstarter, for help raising $6,000. At this minimum funding level, we can offer the product to you at lower than retail pricing. We thank you for being an early adopter and helping us lowering material and tooling costs. Please check out our exciting rewards to our contributors!www.ProMediaGear.com","We’ve been in this business since 2009 and have pretty good experience in setting realistic and accurate expectations and always deliver.  However, no matter how well we plan there is always a risk of something going wrong.  Since we control manufacturing of the major part through our sister CNC Machining company the worst that can happen is that the delivery gets delayed a bit due to some unforeseen quality issues.   Some components we source, but through the years we have build a web of reliable partners.  If you want to help us out, the best thing if for you to spread good word about this project! Should we run into any issues that lead to shipping delays, we will be sure to keep everyone up to date.

Europe's Jews are finding themselves between a rock and a hard place once again. With the Holocaust not being more than 100 years old not much has seem to change in what we call the western civilized world.The sanctuarythat many once believed they had now seems more like a mere fantasy than anything else. It is my intention to travel Europe an interview as well as document with photographs and video history's ugliness of what is anti-Semitism.Anti-Semitism can never be summed up in one trip but with today's modern technology the web, film, and photographs I will certainly try my best to capture the true evil behind it. Of a population of over 11 million Jews throughout the world you seem to hear a lot about a people so small and I have to ask myself why that is. What makes them so different or dare I say undesirable to the rest of mankind? What makes the genocide of the 1940s unnoticed in today society with so much violence. I will try my best to document what is anti-Semitism and how it's growing at an alarming rate today in Europe. As well as discover it's ugly roots and how they are blatantly still present.","Europe finds itself in the grip of intense violence when it comes to anti-Semitism. With attacks in Paris, Brussels, and other places sadly one must be careful when digging this kind of work. I have confidence that I will be able to do it and do it successfully.

So far my band includes legendary reggae artists, famous rappers, homeless people, taxi drivers, my mom, and many many more.I've put together some 808 heavy electronic, trap, chill, hip hop beats that I've made, mixed with live instruments, raps from everyday people as well as famous artists, and a collection of over ten years worth of previously unreleased music for my debut album. I make music videos so I record vocals often with artists from all genres. There are unfinished music videos that lack funding to continue.

The origin of Hydropolys 1 remains a mystery. The written music found inside has been translated and recorded by music producer Marko Dragan Zecevic. Though some speculate that the underwater laboratory sprouted upfrom a random cosmological fluctuation according to the multiverse theory, others believe it wasabandoned millions of years ago by an advanced ancient species inhabiting earth. Over the past ten years, the music discovered within Hydropolys 1 has been decoded into an electronic/hip hop/trap/house album with vocal appearances from reggae legends, to #1 chart topping rappers, and everyday people.Some musical collaborations includeIsaac Tetenbaum (bass, keys) a rare musical genius that can swerve on them keyboards like a New Jersey hustler on fire at a casino.Freestyles with 2 homeless people on the streets of LA, fresh off the camera mic remixed into some booty slapping beats.A Tucson cab drivera few legendary rappers/vocalists ... ......all compiled into one album, my best work to date...Hydropolys!!!!!info about the rewards to the right...Feel free to email me directly at MarkoDraganZecevic@gmail.com for any questions or comments.#MarkoDraganZecevic #IShouldTellYaMommaOnYou----","I have a lot to do in terms of mixing/mastering/finishing vocals/recording instruments and simultaneously completing a music video.

Venue, lighting, set design, stage management, director, producer, and cast are all in the works. All we need is the additional funding to make Forbidden Fruit a staged production. Advertising and marketing tools are set to begin in the late Fall, which will allow more time to attract others who are interested in helping to get this play on the stage. There will also be another reading, with a special invited audience from the NY theater community, to bring about more interest, and to have a discussion/talk back regarding the topic of the play. Once this is done, and all the funding needed is raised, then the staged production of Forbidden Fruit will be alive and ready to be received by audiences everywhere.

They will have dishes inside the house made of PVC tubes since they are cheaper and moldable, the reason they are inside is to reduce other dogs from a house other than their own.*Por ultimo todas los perros serán bañados ,alimentados,nombrados y con algún retoque estético ,para verse lo mas presentables posibles para ser entregados a los niños de un albergue infantil,ellos cuentan con el espacio y la autorización para el proyecto ,en caso de que algunos perros no tengan espacio ,se les buscara otro hogar que los pueda recibir--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------* Finally all dogs will be bathed, fed, named and with some aesthetic retouching, to be as presentable as possible to be delivered to children in a children's shelter, they have space and authorization for the project, in case of that some dogs do not have space, they will look for another home that can receive themSi los fondos superan la meta establecida se realizaran las fases bonus:*Una campaña deesterilización lo cual reducirá en gran medida la cantidad de perros callejeros y abandonados ,trataremos de que esta campaña se realice a un nivel mayor ,no solo con los perros rescatados.*Mejoras para las casas,como las ya mencionas sabanas y algunos retoques estéticos a estas .*buscar patrocinadores de marcas mas reconocidas y hacer lo posible por llamar la atención de los medios ,y llevar el proyecto como una mejora de mentalidad,no social.--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------If the funds exceed the established goal, the bonus fases will be made:* A sterilization campaign which will greatly reduce the number of stray and abandoned dogs, we will try to make this campaign to a higher level, not only with rescued dogs.* Improvements for the houses, as you already mentioned sheets and some aesthetic touches to these.* look for sponsors of most recognized brands and their best to call the attention of the media, and take the project as a mentality improvement, not social.En esta sección mostrare algunos avances ,ademas de ciertas ideas para mejorar el proyecto y hacerlo mas eficaz.------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------In this section I will show some advances, in addition to certain ideas to improve the project and make it more effective.Tengo en mente un pequeño trabajo periodístico que hablara sobre la superficialidad que tienen las personas a la hora de tener una mascota ;todos conocemos la historia sobre como se ama a un perro mientras este es pequeño y adorable ,después es botado sin mas porque a crecido .

It is obvious that no, they can not feed them daily, however a street animal does not eat in weeks or months, if these animals receive at least 2 to 3 meals a week, it will be more than enough, otherwise I will be responsible .-The dogs can be violent? yes and that is why they will be studied weeks before preparing them for adoption so we will avoid accidents as much as possible, and part of the work of concintisation is to teach what should and should not be done with a dog.-And if the dogs run away again? the identification collars are going to make search work much easier, there are also natural areas within the radius of their homes, therefore they will not go very far.-The amount of dogs is a problem? , not really, the city is not very big and I know it almost in its entirety I can estimate that the amount does not exceed 40 dogs and that is suggesting a lot",https://www.kickstarter.com/projects/1689295686/hey-i-love-you-too?ref=discovery_category_newest,1689295686/hey-i-love-you-too," It is a literary work that deals with love, basically.It is the story of a teenager like the one we all went through, I have to say that I am a person who finished this stage and although most memories are bitter, there is no need to discard.This work is part of my desire to write and tell a story, in addition to one of my hobbies such as photography, I know that my images can be very amateur, but it is more to preserve the moment that once happened.Well one of the things I want to clarify is the visual style, I know that it is not the most original in the world, but it is a metaphor of the person when he has feelings, I would like to tell more about the meanings and others he deals with, but it would be a unnecessary advancement.However I can tell you that we all have shapes, textures and dimensions that make us unique, sometimes our forms are similar and allow us to connect with those we love.Este es un trabajo hecho con el corazón,con el alma puesta en las memorias de un viaje espero que este trabajo se finalice en condiciones y a su vez me esforzare en no decepcionarlos.Gracias","Regarding the risks and challenges:It is not my first literary work, but it is the biggest and most ambitious (at least for me) so it may have some error or repeat things, but I make sure that both the message and the experience remain intact."

Thank you for visiting our Kickstarter! We're here to secure and build a vibrant, comfortable and safe space to create art and performance in Millerton for dancers, arists, musicians, designers and others.We need your support! Millerton is brimming with incredible and creative folk that need and are searching for space to create. We are envisioning a space to give these exceptionally talented artists a warm, welcoming and affordable space have the ability to create limitlessly. Bright White Productions, Catapult Dance and Nillocworks are partnering to bring this to Millerton.The Saperstein's building is currently for sale and we are trying to either buy the building or raise enough funds to rent the space while continuing raise funds for the purchase of the building. Although the upstairs has been renovated and will need little to no buildout; there is an entire back area and basement with a plethora of discovery, but will need some work to create an even more aesthetically pleasing art space.Bright White Productions is a boutique production company that was conceived in September 2019, by Gina White. The mission of Bright White is to bring together all mediums of art to have support and to be able produce avenues for artists to bring creative vision and fruition to various projects. Gina is also a dancer, with Catapult Entertainment, and an actress, a member of both Sag/AFTRA and Actors Equity. Gina loves to create but has found herself struggling to find a place to dance, move, film and bring creative wellness to the community, due to the lack of affordable teaching, rehearsal and performance space. Gina wants to engage the community wholly as many have approached Gina asked about finding space to dance and create awareness of movement as a form of wellness, education and meditation.Catapult Dance is a company developed by Adam Battelstein, a former dancer with Pilobolus. Catapult currently tours in both Europe and the United States as a shadow dance theatre company. They were featured on America's Got Talent on Season 8 and were finalists in the top 12. Catapult is looking for a home to rehearse, a place for the dancers to stay when rehearsing in town and a creative where they can develop a community involvement project that involves dance as a science and bring workshops and children's dance and movement programs to the community, for locals and traveling tourists alike.Nillocworks is the artistic concept of Collin Culbreth, a member of an extremely talented family of Millerton artists. Collin's vision for the artist's collective is gather together the fine and visual artists in the community and offer fine art classes, gallery showings and special art events, with music and dance. Collin will be the artistic director for the space, serving as the community liaison between the arts community, patrons, sponsors and all artistically related, to the fine art projects in the creative space.","A challenge that we are facing currently is that we would like to have this space open as soon as possible. It takes a village, and that is just what Millerton is! We would like to have programs in place for the onset of the spring and summer, being able to offer lessons, workshops and camps to the community and travelers. The risk is that we may not raise enough money to completely fund the entire purchase of the building. With the kickstarter program we are able to be proactive in creative funding options to use the space while continuing to raise funds for the longevity of the space and the programs developed within.Although the space on the upper floor has been completely renovated, there is still work to be done within the building for the many other programs that the space would like to provide. The funds will be used to create an incredible space for all. A dance floor will need to be built, as well as the purchase of theatrical supplies, to provide an intimate space that can easily be transformed into a performance venue, with lighting and removable partitions.",https://www.kickstarter.com/projects/millertonartscenter/build-out-danceworks-creative-space?ref=discovery_category_newest,millertonartscenter/build-out-danceworks-creative-space,"Help to build out the dance space at DANCEWORKS!Hey there! I'm Gina White and I am the owner and artistic director of the dance studio Danceworks, located in Millerton, New York. The studio space we have found is located at 5916 North Elm Avenue at the intersection of Routes 44 and 22. The space is large enough to begin our classes however we are creating the space from nothing! Inside we have to build out the dance floor space and do some minor cosmetic work to the bathroom and the waiting area.Currently we are under construction! We are in the process of building out our creative space. Our biggest expense is the floor installation. It is critical to have the proper foor installation for the students and for the playing people who will be moving in our creative space. We want it to be the safest and most comfortable space that it can be. Therefore, it is imperative that we have a floor that can ease the impact of the amount tapping, leaping, turning and tumbling that is going to be happening in the space! Your children and your bodies are precious and we want to make sure they are gettting the proper amount of cushion for fun and self-care.","The project scope has gone much  more over budget than what was planned. The timing also has not been to our advantage. The project vision began cultivating the week before Thanksgiving 2019. Soon after were the Christmas holidays and then followed by an ice storm ringing in January 2020, only two weeks before the opening deadline! We are hoping to have our doors open for business by the middle of January, so your help would be extremely beneficial to the studio! Our current expenses are, but not limited to, floor installation, full-length wall mirrors, ballet barres, a remodel of the bathroom, and some mats for tumbling and acrobatics! We have got some money set aside, but we are looking for support to help offset these costs. We'd like to use some money to purchase apparel, for class, of course, but also to have some space built for cubbies, coats, shoes, and dance bags. We'd also like to have an area for leotards, tights and all other Danceworks Spirit Swag!"

My name is Linda and I am the owner of Nona’s New To You Thrift Shop. I got started by collecting clothes for my family. I gathered so much that I was giving away clothes to friends in need.Eventually, people were suggesting that I open a thrift shop. I realized that there are no thrift stores within 2 miles and ifyou don't have transportation or rely on public transportation, it is very difficult to shop forsecond hand clothing and accessories. I look for new or gently used clothing and household items. I am very insistent onacquiring quality items!My passion is to meet and help the community and fulfill the need for a quality, local, and affordable thrift shop!

I nearly gave up, until reading an article about a teenager successfully raising $48,000 towards a home loan. This idea stuck with me for some time.After a few more months of brainstorming, I came up with Funded Life.What Do I Need?In order to setup and run Funded Life properly, I need to subsidise my wage and take time off work to write the software necessary for the website.A marketing strategy will be key in this project, and as such I will need to hire marketing strategists to consult and guide the marketing campaign.","The only foreseeable problem is the programming of the software needed. As this is a specific niche, this software will be one of a kind and will need to go through rigorous testing to make sure it will run smoothlyIn order to alleviate this challenge, i will instigate a beta test with and use feedback to remove any bugs and make improvements."
https://www.kickstarter.com/projects/1486445462/game-physics?ref=discovery_category_newest,1486445462/game-physics,"After graduating from college, I have taken the time to help high school and college students through tutoring. Many of them have great difficulty understanding the concepts behind Physics. And who can blame them? It is a challenging subject. Some teachers are bad at teaching it, and Physics tutors are in short supply. And while the students I have taught come from a variety of families and backgrounds, I've noticed all of them seem to have one thing in common...they love video games. The idea is to create a YouTube channel with the purpose of educating people on the laws of Physics, using video games as examples to show how to solve problems. Much like in the real world, video games adapt the physics in order to make it seem more realistic. The channel will not only be a means to teach the laws, but will answer some of gaming's mysteries that have gone unanswered. If you ever wondered how much force a Goomba experiences when it is being stomped on by Mario, or how fast Foxy runs down the hallway in Five Nights at Freddy's.For the channel to be successful, I will need the proper equipment to effectively animate weekly episodes. That is where Kickstarter comes into play. Funding will go directly to purchasing the necessary equipment including, but not limited to: microphone, camera, drawing tablet, and video making software. In addition to the need equipment, having a pool of funds will be necessary in case there is a video game viewers wish me to solve that I never played. I will make every attempt to find footage needed, but if I must play the game to obtain it, having the funds will be beneficial.","The risks for the project are minimal at best, and mainly fall on my part as the animator.  Potential setbacks would be personal, but I would attempt to shorten the time with any delays that might come up by working late if need be.  I intend to release a video on a weekly basis if not more.  With this in mind I do not entirely think would be entirely too difficult to meet.  I will make sure that all work is backed up in case of any computer failure.",https://www.kickstarter.com/projects/1486445462/real-life-five-nights-at-freddys?ref=discovery_category_newest,1486445462/real-life-five-nights-at-freddys,"Since the Five Nights at Freddy's came out I have wanted to design and construct fully functioning animatronics based on the characters from Scott Cawhton's video game. I finally have some free time on my hands, but no means of funding the project myself.Since I will not be funding it myself, I have decided to give away the animatronic to someone once it is completed, so someone will get it once I am done. The giveaway will be a completely separate from the Kickstarter, so the amount you donate will not improve your chances. I am also giving this away since my wife will not appreciate having one standing in our basement.My hopes for this project is to use this as an outlet to showcase my skills as a robotics engineer,and I would dream of creating the Freddy Gang for the Five Nights at Freddy's movie.I will need approximately $6,500 to cover the cost of the project. The breakdown for the funding is as follows:-$1500 for material and shipping. The robot will be made of a sculpting foam which makes it lightweight yet durable.-$2000 for servos and other mechanical parts. I intend to purchase the top of the line servos for this robot to ensure longevity and functionality.-$1500 for tools and other materials for the construction of the animatronic. This include paints and different sculpting saws.-$1500 for taxes and other fees that might incur during the construction.","The biggest risk to the project is that something fries the circuit or the body part breaks during the assembly.  To overcome, the amount of material that will be purchased will be able to accomodate any mistakes that might be made.  I have worked with powerful robotics before and am fully capable of programming and ensuring that the circuitry is working properly.  Also since there is no metal in the animatronic, the chances of circuits getting fried are kept to a minimum."

It’s okay, we won’t tell anyone. The film will be a self-contained story. However, it has the potential for spin-offs. There are characters who glide in and out of the piece that may in time have more to say for themselves than there will be space for here.

You sure can, baby!As the man says, you can get some cool stuff including these T-Shirts...And these cute badges...Everyone who invests in this film is important, so everyone who invests will get a mention on the 'thank you' screens in the end credits of the film.

It is a punchy little love and crime musical that will get in your head and have you singing the ‘Shins in the Morning’ song to yourself late at night, whilst your wife sleeps quietly next to you unaware of your new obsession. It’s okay, we won’t tell anyone. The film will be a self-contained story. However, it has the potential for spin-offs. There are characters who glide in and out of the piece that may in time have more to say for themselves than there will be space for here. On completion ‘Saucy Horsey’ will be entered into film and animation festivals around the world in the short film/animation category.'Saucy Horsey' will be complete and ready for release by June 2017.Saucy Horsey is a fun project, something that you can show your friends at parties and say...“I helped make that” They will say “Liar!”“I did”“Prove it”You pause the film and show them your name in the credits. You open your jacket and reveal your limited edition 'Orphan Style Ginger Ale', Saucy Horsey  T-shirt. They are clearly impressed.“You are a fine human being, let me buy you a drink”A fun evening should hopefully follow with much merriment and romantic shenanigans. - Your generous investment will help to buy everything needed to build the sets and characters  so I will be able create the puppet and clay animation required to complete the film.- The money will also allow me to buy animation paper, pens, pencils and crazy big crayons so that I can finish the 2D drawn animation. - With your kind donations I will be able to hire a small digital team to help with the scanning, clean up and colouring of the 2D animation. You sure can, baby!As the man says, you can get some cool stuff including these T-Shirts...And these cute badges...Everyone who invests in this film is important, so everyone who invests will get a mention on the 'thank you' screens in the end credits of the film. You can also get a producing credit, access to the production diary, posters, keyrings, the 'Saucy Horsey Rural Beats' album AND you, or one of your loved ones, can be animated into the final film in a background, walk-on or pivotal speaking role.You can also get a hand painted movie artwork canvas for your office.So if you are interested in riding the Saucy Horsey, take a look at the full list of rewards and treat yourself to something flamboyantly frivolous, you perfect person you!Thanks very much for your time and for being ever so very saucy.Benxx","This will be a lot of hard work but I have never been afraid of that. I have set a generous deadline (August 2017 for the finished film) so that I can make a really top notch piece allowing for any trouble along the way. All the animation, set and puppet construction for this film is going to be created by me... so there is no chance of that not getting done as I always know where I am! Up until now I have been very much a one-man film unit, but to complete this project I will require a small team to help colour and scan some of the finished animation. I have already picked the people who I will be using, they are like family and are very keen to be part of the project. They have very settled lives and a strong graphics background so I know I can rely on them to deliver! This saucy battle station will be fully operational when your friends arrive!"

I had it professionally edited and received a positive review from my editor. Everyone who read my manuscript said it should be a movie. This reaction was completely unsolicited by me. After a lot of research I decided to self publish, but then I found a publisher who does it all including a video and radio time. They are also affiliated with Amazon.The company approaches the matter like a partnership. What better way to show commitment to such a project than to provide a portion of the funding. I am working on the cover art and I also intend to create a life size sculpture carved out of foam, hard coated and air-brushed just like the cowboy you see in the picture here. It makes the sculpt light weight and easy to transport. I'll be using it as a prop to attract book readers wherever I go.I have worked in the prop business for years and I know how effective it is in advertising. Just think, if you help me with this it could go worldwide and I will give credit where credit is due. Thank you.","The only risk is that the book won't sell well. The story is original and epic in scope. I set it up to easily become unlimited sequels. A lot of times artwork on the cover can sell the book by itself. I've never had trouble selling my work. All in all I believe the risk to be very low and the potential profit to be high. Lets keep our fingers crossed. By the way, you folks are going to read the book.

The manuscript has been professionally edited and well received. I also hope to raise enough to create a life size sculpture of the main character in the book. It will be used to promote book sales.The cowboy sculpture I made is presented here to show that I can do what I propose.I am also doing the cover art myself and will be making signed copies available.  I don't want to give too much away regarding the book's content because I think most people hate spoilers. Anyway, the story revolves around a guy who is being hunted down by an unknown enemy, which makes it especially hard to deal with since he doesn't know their motivation. What had he done to them? The situation quickly escalates when there's collateral damage. Now my character begins to hunt them in turn. He has the skill set to pull off some amazing things. This may sound like a pretty common plot, but wait until you get a load of the window dressing. I threw in sex, violence , religion , politics and a setting that spans the globe. All I can say is hang on for the ride. I hope you enjoy reading it as much as I enjoyed writing it.","The only perceived risk would be low book sales, but I believe it will sell well. I will do my best to make the cover art attractive  and the story is original and creative.

It's a great, pulpy thriller that starts with the murder of a would-be mob informant. A college student witnesses the murder and goes into hiding. The mob, the cops, a sleazy bounty hunter, a tough-talking P.I., and the masked vigilante known as the Dark Avenger engage in an action-packed race against time to find her.This is intended to be the first full-length Dark Avenger 3-D feature, and it uses the process to it's maximum, with full, deep depth and wild, out of the screen 3-D effect shots. It's being shot using state of the art HD 3-D camcorders and will be released to theaters in both an anaglyphic (red/cyan) 3-D format and in a full digital 3D DCP, as well as being released on 3D Blu Ray.The movie is scheduled to shoot from April 18-May 23, with a big karate fight sequence set to be shot after several additional weeks of rehearsal on June 20. It will film in and around the city of Philadelphia. Most of the actors are trained stage actors and all of them are very talented. I've worked with many of them before, so they're reliable, too.The $25,000 budget I'm asking for is mostly for additional costuming, paying for specific locations--the mob boss's place, for instance--and props including the various weapons used in the film (guns, switchblades, assorted karate weapons). It will also be used for the various blood and gore effects in the movie. Finally, it will also be used to make up DCPs for theatrical showings and film festivals, as well as mastering and making the 3D Blu Ray edition. My plan is to get the film showings not only in film festivals, but by four-walling the movie, specifically targeting midnight showings as I intend for this to be a midnight movie type of production.","The normal risks of any production do apply--need for reshoots, scheduling conflicts, etc. In 3-D it may be slightly exacerbated. However, I have worked in 3-D before with less than ideal equipment so I know the pitfalls. I previously used two Digital 8 camcorders, one hung upside down, to shoot in 3-D. Each shot had to be painstakingly edited with corrections to synching, convergence, and parallax necessary. I will be using an actual 3-D camcorder this time, so the problems inherit previously in the shooting of 3-D will not be present. I also have some very reliable and dedicated actors lined up who will help to ensure the movie stays on schedule. All have been made aware of the schedule and so there should be no conflicts. Even if the film runs over, the cast will ensure it will get done. Proof of that is the two cliffhanger serials I shot, both of which were logistically more difficult than this film and, though they took a while to do, they both got done.",https://www.kickstarter.com/projects/1987433891/star-witness-in-3d?ref=discovery_category_newest,1987433891/star-witness-in-3d,"Star Witness is the third exciting film in the Tales of the Dark Avenger series. In it, a college student witnesses a mob murder and goes into hiding. The mob and the cops race to find her, but her best hope of survival is the masked vigilante known only as The Dark Avenger. This is an exciting, actin filed movie being shot in full HD 3D. This movie will be done like an old style 3D movie, with lots of depth and a respectable amount of out of the screen effects. Think more along the lines of House of Wax or Jaws 3-D. This movie also has a lot of pulpy thrills and comic book style action. It is composed of a talented cast of New York and Philadelphia actors, hardworking professionals who always give every performance their all. As the director, I've directed three cliffhanger serials and am the only person in the world since 1956 to have done so. I've also directed several 3D projects and as such am quite knowledgeable about shooting in 3D.","There's the normal risks associated with any film, most notably budget and scheduling of the actors. On top of which, this is an action heavy film with several extended fistfights. Fortunately, my cast and I have extensive stage combat experience, with many of the cast members involved in my previous serials."

However, our story begins a few months earlier, in the summer of 2012. At the time, Zac was only 12 years old, and Jack was 15. We both played lacrosse, and had begun to build up a reputation for ourselves with regards to custom stringing lacrosse sticks. Even before the birth of JZ Lace, we were incredibly focused on customizability.We had been contacted by a man who was playing for the University of Minnesota at the time who wanted us to string his lacrosse stick for him. Thinking that this would be a great opportunity for us to get our name out into the college lacrosse scheme, we wracked our brains for ideas on how to do so. After a while of brainstorming, Jack remembered the idea of a paracord-design bracelet, and thus JZ Lace was born. Our first ever bracelet, shown below, was University of Minnesota colors, made out of leftover string we had from stringing the lacrosse stick. As you can see, it was incredibly primitive, lacked buckles, but the essential design has not changed to this day.Realizing the potential of such a simple design, we decided to try and pitch the idea to our local sporting goods store, General Sports in Edina, MN. They were all over our idea, but said that in order for them to be willing to carry our bracelets in their store, they needed to have buckles to be more easily taken on and off. We figured our how to attach buckles in the following weeks, and ended up selling our first order of 48 bracelets to General Sports for $384. As 12 and 15 year olds, this was an amazing amount of money.Our bracelets went through several different stages in order to make them as comfortable as possible. While we only ended up selling our bracelets to several General Sports store locations, we did have success in the school communities in the Minneapolis metro area. Both of us have younger siblings, who we fully utilized to help spread the name of our company. Our brothers would come home with lists of color combinations and sizes that other kids wanted from our company. We would make the bracelets that night, and our brothers would bring the kids their custom bracelets the next day. We feel that this sort of interaction really illustrates what our company is all about.This process continued over the past two years until last August, when Jack left for his freshman year at St. Johns University. With our ever more busy schedules, we saw hardly any option in continuing our business with Jack living away from home. So, we chose the logical option pack up shop and call it a day... until this past July. In July we met to discuss the future of our business- or if there was even going to be a future. We decided upon a plan to completely revamp our business. With our consumer base in our hometown basically used up, the only way to continue the business was to expand; we wanted to go big. We planned to first create an amazing website with an online store and seemingly unlimited customizability options-one of our dreams. The project you're viewing right now is our attempt to bring this dream to fruition.Once the website is created, we plan to outsource our bracelet making, most likely overseas, to be able to tailor to large orders from companies all around the country. These orders will be hopefully handled through yes, the very website you're debating about whether or not to fund. However, this eventual dream of a nationwide enterprise is simply unobtainable without an online presence. Below, you'll find a detailed analysis of where every dollar we're asking for is going to go. As we stated in our video, we found a very helpful local company to help us through this process, and we hope that you think this project is worth your donation. Also, please be sure to check out our various social media pages and follow us on there.

But since you've made it this far in the story, we may as well give you all of the details. First, the website:As for the price, we looked around quite a bit for how we would go about doing this. To some, it may seem like we're getting ripped off by this price, but we hope to dispel this thought. We received offers from a multitude of companies, both local and nationwide, and eventually narrowed it down to 5 which we thought would be able to offer what we want done. Most rates ranged from 8-12K for all of the gadgets we deemed necessary, so we were plenty happy to take a $6600 + hosting offer. Also, the company we're working with has many contacts in and around the Twin Cities area and have offered to help us advertise with them. The main reason this site is so expensive is due to our customizability option. With three different customizable parts to a given bracelet, and with upwards of 30 different color options for either of those parts, we have over 27,000 different possible bracelet combinations. One of our dreams for the website was to be able to show an image, CGI or real (it's actually going to be CGI), of what the bracelet is going to look like, so that customers know exactly what they're getting. This, as you could assume, is somewhat expensive. We are also having a bulk ordering/wholesale option on our site that would allow for larger corporations to purchase mass quantities of bracelets for discounted rates (we'll explain how this will come into play later). Included in this form will also be an affiliate program, which will help make up the majority of our marketing (also explained later). In addition to these two pages will be a regular online store for pre-made bracelets of different color combinations that we have chosen. It will be simple and straightforward. Also included in the payment is the optimization of every page on the site for Google search results, and weekly updates to the website to ensure that we rise in the ranks of search results. Obviously SSL and other types of credit card security are required, plus the option to create accounts, store personal info, and create and manage a mailing list. The entire site will also be fully interactive as well as completely designed for both desktop and mobile usage. When you add up the prices for all of these things, $6600 starts to become a much more reasonable price. As for hosting, Bluehost may be a bit much to start out with, but at $25/month, we don't think there are many other cheaper options that provide such good quality. Since the company we are dealing with is also a local company, included in this partnership is the acquaintance, connections, and aid gained from working with somebody who wants to help us grow. We've already met in person with the owner three times, and we've already fostered a relationship that will last for a very long time. If you're still convinced that the money isn't worth it, let us try to sway you one last time. It's important to note that we did attempt to create our own online store in the past, but without proper guidance and professional techniques, it lacked the charisma and customizability that we wanted. Our website is going to be people's way into our company- it will be their first impression, how they view us, etc. It is for this reason that we want our website to be of the absolute highest quality that it can possibly be. Yes, we could probably have made it cheaper without all the bells and whistles with some template-site driven company, but for us, that would defeat the very purpose of making the site. We've dreamed of this website for years, and now that we're finally having the chance to make it a reality, we want to go big. We also want you to know that we did originally look into these companies with templates and such, but none could offer the level of sophistication needed to make our dream come to life. So now, this brings us to marketing and getting our name our after our website is complete. Obviously, our first priority is to just get our website up and running. However, we have several different plans. The company we're working with has a lot of experience with PR and Google Adwords, as well as setting up stores on Facebook. While we have not explicitly decided to work with any of these options, we're leaving them open to work with after we get the site up and running. The main traffic we're hoping to drive however, is through the bulk ordering/wholesale page. We've already spoke with retailers like Target and Hockey Giant, and the common thread is that we need to be able to produce an absolutely massive number of bracelets. We've personally spoken with members of Target's administrative team about producing said quantity of bracelets, and they've pointed us to a company called Platform88, which they says is the way to go with overseas manufacturing. We knew going in that this sort of manufacturing was going to cost a lot of money, and we also knew we wouldn't be able to pay for both the manufacturing and the website. This is where the idea for the Kickstarter comes in. Hopefully, we save some money making our dream website, so the funds we do have can go towards getting our mass production up and running. Once both of these things are solidified, we hope to be dealing with stores such as Target directly from our website. The affiliate program we will be employing will be for friends of ours across the country who will help to spread the word of JZ Lace. They will be trained about our company, and will go into retail stores with a sales pitch prepared, finally pointing the store towards our website, where the store can then place a large order. This affiliate will then be accredited with a commission. The reason our local market ""dried up"" the way it did is simply due to the fact that we sold bracelets to everyone that wanted to buy one. And the crazy thing to think is that these people were buying these bracelets for $15 a piece from retail stores and $8-15 from us or our friends. With the launch of Phase 2 of our business (that's what we're calling this master plan), we plan to be selling bracelets from our website for $5-6, and to other larger businesses for $2-3 so that there isn't any direct competition between our website and any given store carrying our bracelets. It doesn't take much market analysis to realize the potential consumer base increase in a price drop that drastic.As I hope you can see, the website is really just the first stepping stone on a long bridge to success that we've drawn the blueprint for. Once we have the website, our possibilities are endless- but we need to make sure our website can stand up to the scrutiny that any of those possibilities may provide. We strive for absolute transparency, so if there is anything at all that is unclear to you or that you would like to be further informed about, please don't hesitate to contact us at jzlacellc@gmail.com. We will respond to any and all messages. Even if financial reasons prohibit you from donating, we ask that you please help the spread the word! With a relatively minor social media presence, we need all of the help that we can get.","We know that not all companies are successful, especially online, but due to the nature of the risks of our business, we must assume that we would become successful. The truth of the matter is that we have been an incorporated business, run successfully and fluently for the past four years on a relatively small scale, and foresee absolutely no issues with continuing this small scale business style. However, there are a few possible issues that we could foresee with regards to the mass overseas production of our bracelets. Since we have not exactly nailed down which company will be producing our bracelets on the scale of thousands, there is a bit of uncertainty as to how well this is going to end up working out. However, even if this part of our plan doesn't work at all, we will simply not offer the wholesale/bulk ordering option on our website. We foresee very little or no issues with regards to filling orders of regular quantity from our website. If for some reason even those orders start to be too much for us to handle, we have access to several members of friends and family who have helped us in the past and would be more than willing to help with the creation of bracelets. This is of course assuming a complete collapse of the mass production plan. As you can see, we foresee no problems regarding the actual creation of the website. We've already met with the owner of the company which is going to be creating our website three times, and they are very accommodating to whatever we need done. If you have any questions regarding the risks of our future ventures or any questions at all, feel free to send us an email at jzlacellc@gmail.com.

But since you've made it this far in the story, we may as well give you all of the details. First, the website:As for the price, we looked around quite a bit for how we would go about doing this. To some, it may seem like we're getting ripped off by this price, but we hope to dispel this thought. We received offers from a multitude of companies, both local and nationwide, and eventually narrowed it down to 5 which we thought would be able to offer what we want done. Most rates ranged from 8-12K for all of the gadgets we deemed necessary, so we were plenty happy to take a $6600 + hosting offer. Also, the company we're working with has many contacts in and around the Twin Cities area and have offered to help us advertise with them. The main reason this site is so expensive is due to our customizability option. With three different customizable parts to a given bracelet, and with upwards of 30 different color options for either of those parts, we have over 27,000 different possible bracelet combinations. One of our dreams for the website was to be able to show an image, CGI or real (it's actually going to be CGI), of what the bracelet is going to look like, so that customers know exactly what they're getting. This, as you could assume, is somewhat expensive. We are also having a bulk ordering/wholesale option on our site that would allow for larger corporations to purchase mass quantities of bracelets for discounted rates (we'll explain how this will come into play later). Included in this form will also be an affiliate program, which will help make up the majority of our marketing (also explained later). In addition to these two pages will be a regular online store for pre-made bracelets of different color combinations that we have chosen. It will be simple and straightforward. Also included in the payment is the optimization of every page on the site for Google search results, and weekly updates to the website to ensure that we rise in the ranks of search results. Obviously SSL and other types of credit card security are required, plus the option to create accounts, store personal info, and create and manage a mailing list. The entire site will also be fully interactive as well as completely designed for both desktop and mobile usage. When you add up the prices for all of these things, $6600 starts to become a much more reasonable price. As for hosting, Bluehost may be a bit much to start out with, but at $25/month, we don't think there are many other cheaper options that provide such good quality. Since the company we are dealing with is also a local company, included in this partnership is the acquaintance, connections, and aid gained from working with somebody who wants to help us grow. We've already met in person with the owner three times, and we've already fostered a relationship that will last for a very long time.If you're still convinced that the money isn't worth it, let us try to sway you one last time. It's important to note that we did attempt to create our own online store in the past, but without proper guidance and professional techniques, it lacked the charisma and customizability that we wanted. Our website is going to be people's way into our company- it will be their first impression, how they view us, etc. It is for this reason that we want our website to be of the absolute highest quality that it can possibly be. Yes,  we could probably have made it cheaper without all the bells and whistles with some template-site driven company, but for us, that would defeat the very purpose of making the site. We've dreamed of this website for years, and now that we're finally having the chance to make it a reality, we want to go big. We also want you to know that we did originally look into these companies with templates and such, but none could offer the level of sophistication needed to make our dream come to life.So now, this brings us to marketing and getting our name our after our website is complete. Obviously, our first priority is to just get our website up and running. However, we have several different plans. The company we're working with has a lot of experience with PR and Google Adwords, as well as setting up stores on Facebook. While we have not explicitly decided to work with any of these options, we're leaving them open to work with after we get the site up and running. The main traffic we're hoping to drive however, is through the bulk ordering/wholesale page. We've already spoke with retailers like Target and Hockey Giant, and the common thread is that we need to be able to produce an absolutely massive number of bracelets. We've personally spoken with members of Target's administrative team about producing said quantity of bracelets, and they've pointed us to a company called Platform88, which they says is the way to go with overseas manufacturing. We knew going in that this sort of manufacturing was going to cost a lot of money, and we also knew we wouldn't be able to pay for both the manufacturing and the website. This is where the idea for the Kickstarter comes in. Hopefully, we save some money making our dream website, so the funds we do have can go towards getting our mass production up and running. Once both of these things are solidified, we hope to be dealing with stores such as Target directly from our website. The affiliate program we will be employing will be for friends of ours across the country who will help to spread the word of JZ Lace. They will be trained about our company, and will go into retail stores with a sales pitch prepared, finally pointing the store towards our website, where the store can then place a large order. This affiliate will then be accredited with a commission. The reason our local market ""dried up"" the way it did is simply due to the fact that we sold bracelets to everyone that wanted to buy one. And the crazy thing to think is that these people were buying these bracelets for $15 a piece from retail stores and $8-15 from us or our friends. With the launch of Phase 2 of our business (that's what we're calling this master plan), we plan to be selling bracelets from our website for $5-6, and to other larger businesses for $2-3 so that there isn't any direct competition between our website and any given store carrying our bracelets. It doesn't take much market analysis to realize the potential consumer base increase in a price drop that drastic.As I hope you can see, the website is really just the first stepping stone on a long bridge to success that we've drawn the blueprint for. Once we have the website, our possibilities are endless- but we need to make sure our website can stand up to the scrutiny that any of those possibilities may provide. We strive for absolute transparency, so if there is anything at all that is unclear to you or that you would like to be further informed about, please don't hesitate to contact us at jzlacellc@gmail.com. We will respond to any and all messages. Even if financial reasons prohibit you from donating, we ask that you please help the spread the word! With a relatively minor social media presence, we need all of the help that we can get.","We know that not all companies are successful, especially online, but due to the nature of the risks of our business, we must assume that we would become successful. The truth of the matter is that we have been an incorporated business, run successfully and fluently for the past four years on a relatively small scale, and foresee absolutely no issues with continuing this small scale business style. However, there are a few possible issues that we could foresee with regards to the mass overseas production of our bracelets. Since we have not exactly nailed down which company will be producing our bracelets on the scale of thousands, there is a bit of uncertainty as to how well this is going to end up working out. However, even if this part of our plan doesn't work at all, we will simply not offer the wholesale/bulk ordering option on our website. We foresee very little or no issues with regards to filling orders of regular quantity from our website. If for some reason even those orders start to be too much for us to handle, we have access to several members of friends and family who have helped us in the past and would be more than willing to help with the creation of bracelets. This is of course assuming a complete collapse of the mass production plan. As you can see, we foresee no problems regarding the actual creation of the website. We've already met with the owner of the company which is going to be creating our website three times, and they are very accommodating to whatever we need done. If you have any questions regarding the risks of our future ventures or any questions at all, feel free to send us an email at jzlacellc@gmail.com. We WILL respond to any and all inquiries."

With your support and partnership, we will be able to present another spiritual, family-friendly stage play to our wonderful community. Our mission is to provide exceptional and inspirational entertainment that displays our love, passion, gifts, and talents in the Fine Arts, founded on our commitment to excellence bound by our faith in God.As co-founder & Executive Director of SHMPG, I am seeking an opportunity to present “Forgive & Forget” to the world, starting with the Hampton Roads area! SHMPG has assisted four authors in publishing their literary works and I was blessed to write and publish two books as well, “Freedom Time” and “Spirit, Soul, & the Glorified Body”. The success from these published books has allowed me the opportunity to write, direct, and act in my first stage play entitled ""The Art of Love"". Your sponsorship will go towards helping up and coming actors fulfill their dreams and desires to act on stage in front of a live audience. Most importantly, there is no better way to give back to the community than by bringing families together to laugh, cry, learn, and fellowship in a positive environment. Your commitment and support will help bring that to a reality. With your help and support we are confident we can continue to reach our goals of providing inspirational and entertaining stage plays like, “Forgive & Forget”. Your sponsorship would not only contribute to the success of SHMPG, but yourselves as investors and our associates. I look forward to hearing from you and would like to thank you for your time and consideration in sponsoring SHMPG and the community. ","As this is my second production, the biggest challenge we faced from our first production involved trying to replace two actors who feel ill during rehearsals and couldn't commit to the play any more. My goal this time around is to add understudies for the main characters so that the play will not be delayed or we are in a rush to find replacements. We are currently not able to promote the play through local media channels and radio stations until we have enough funding to pay for those advertisements. In the meantime, we promote via social media networks."

We need your help to make this film a reality. Do you enjoy old school kung fu movies? Bone cracking sound effects? The kind with longer takes and wider shots so that you can actually see what is happening during the fight scene? You know, the ones you tried to learn from while in your living room copying the moves and combinations? That's what we are going to make. An old school epic Kung Fu Movie! We aren't just making a movie, we're building a universe. I want to open the Chinaman universe up to other filmmakers as well. Funding this project doesn't just help us make this film, but it also helps Ballistic Blade Entertainment to begin creating additional projects. We have emptied our accounts by putting $20,000.00 into equipment and training for this project. We have been prepping the entire year to shoot this film and now all we need is your help to complete it! Honestly, we can not afford to fail....The TrailerA short fight scene. Chinaman Wu-Ping has located the scroll but meets with opposition along the way.We are a team of current military, ex military and military brats who banded together to create great films. We aren't just some guys who love martial arts. And movies. And martial art movies. Who have been dying to make one for over a decade now. Well....yeah that is kinda the case but that's not all that we are. Most of us are professionally trained martial artists; Capoeira, mantis style kung fu, brazilian jiu-jitsu, and wing chun are some of the styles we are personally familiar with. That's why it is very important for us to sprinkle these martial flavors throughout the film. If you want to see your style in the film, message me! I'll do what I can to add it in. We want to see the distinct styles and fight systems we used to see make a return to the screen. We have experienced filmmakers on our team such as Travis Manning, Edwin Quinones and myself Benjamin N Redic II. We have been working on many different projects over the years and have led quite a few of them as well. Beaux Loy is one of the amazing VFX artists we have joining committed to the project. Check out a sample of his work here and when you've collected your jaw from the floor we can get back to the project description :) There are a couple of experienced local production companies specializing in action that are also willing to lend their talents to the project.The soundtrack will be produced by some really talented local artists. The score will have an Asian hip-hop fusion feel. Dom Apodaca, Alienoise, Detrick Gales who produced the song for the trailer and a few others will be part of the 5 man clan dedicated to the task. This team keeps growing. The Indie film community in Austin is tightly knit and their help will be appreciated. Many members from the local Austin martial arts community will assist with the fight choreography and in making sure that we get an accurate representation of their respective fighting styles. We want to make an exciting movie, but we want to keep a high level of authenticity as well. We really want to show people that you don't have to go to Hollywood to make a good film. This is a chance for us to show that the great state of Texas can produce quality action films as well as any other place in America. This isn't just our movie. It's a movie by Texans more specifically Austinites and we are very proud of that. Here are few key players.The biggest costs to this production will be cast crew and equipment. Our goal is to shoot this film in spring, as the summers are brutally hot in Texas. We intend to make the shooting of this film as efficient as possible. We are aiming for a 30 day shoot. The acting talent needs to be top notch and to do that we need to pay them fairly. We need to hire a solid crew. We need stunt men and equipment to make sure the cast and crew are safe. We also intend to schedule martial art intensives and bring martial artists from out of state if necessary. BJJ, kali, capoeira and TKD instructors have offered to come on board. Wing Chun (Ving Tsun) instructors from the lineage of Ip Man have offered their services to include a bona fide shaolin monk that has been assisting us as well. We are still open to adding as many styles as possible so contact us with suggestions. We have 2 different CG/VFX artist who are going to help with this project. There are 5 different producers of music and score on the team as well. None of this will come cheap so we need your help. We will run this production as lean as possible but we don't want to cut corners. Locations need to be acquired, insurance, and craft services. We have a fair amount of equipment already. We have a few Canon dslr cameras, a go pro hero 3 and a Black Magic Cinema camera. We are still missing a few pieces of equipment that we need to do a project of this magnitude but not much. Funding is where a lot of great projects fail so we need your help. Come join us in bringing this project to life!Our Funding Goals:Raise 30,000.00 - 100,000.00:We will shoot an awesome film with paid cast and crew to make sure time commitments are kept and the project is done well. This will still be difficult to shoot to the best of our ability.In addition to having free reign to put out the best quality possible in Chinaman Wu-Ping we will begin working on turning it into a series that everyone can enjoy. It will also allow us to begin considering other projects. I'm thinking something with swords and sorcery...possibly werewolves....","Once we begin shooting the biggest issue will be the logistics. With all the moving parts and varied schedules we will have to manage, shooting this film will be a challenge even when we are fully funded. There is a chance that we will need to shoot outside the Austin area to complete the film, possibly in Houston, Killeen or other locations.This will prove to be a  task as well as acquiring the necessary distribution.  We want as many people as possible to view the project since we want it to serve as an advertisement that we do excellent work here in Austin.  That will take some hard work considering the quality of the projects already in the market place.  The main risk to the project is being underfunded though.

We are keeping costs as low as possible because while we'd like to assume we'll get major distribution, we have to be ready to handle this ourselves on the back end through VOD or possibly wall to wall theater exhibitions.Our Video Effects team is top notch and working WAYYY below scale...

Some examples of that areNo scenes that could delay filming because of weather We will have all scenes setup at the same time prior to principal filming to start. This way if by some unfortunate any actors do not make it in on time we can quickly move to filming another scene while waiting on others to be ready. Having all scenes set at the same time also allows for a much faster shoot. We do not have the budget to pay cast and crew to wait around while we set up. They need to have all the tools necessary to them in place so they only have to do the scenes one after another with no wasted time.

My name is Hank and I want to be honest and simple with you here. I have few films behind my belt, but it's still so hard to come up with financing for the next projects. So here I am, in front of you and asking for your help.So what I am working on right now is called The Boy With A Knife. It's a thriller written by me and it tells a story about a family of two in the mid 40s, Zoe and Ian, who invite a young traveler - Sebastian to stay at their home with them for a few days while he will be exploring London. But little did they know that Sebastian is not who he seems to be and that he would be one of the most terrifying guests they ever met!Imagine somebody stays at your placefor a few days,using one of those travel websites that let you instantly book a room, there's no harm to it, right? Wrong. There's no check on the person really, anyone can just change their name and present to you someone else. And you never met them before and you have no idea about who they are and what the doexcept for what says on their profile. I have a feeling that after this movie people will look at it very differently. But at the end of the day, movies are an entertainment, and that's what I want to archive with this movie, I want to make a great film without visual effects and entertain people. To distract them from everyday life at least for 90 minutes and submerge into something else.The film takes place in London and as you can imagine it can get really expensive to shoot there. So we need some money to cover the locations and insurance. There are scenes in a nice Victorian house where our heroes live, and some outside to showcase London's local architecture.I'm working with Antonio Gradanti on this film, in fact this is our third collaboration together. He's a great composer and you can check out his music here:https://soundcloud.com/west-town-soundThank you guys and please smash that support button.","The challenge is to reach 3,000 before this campaign ends.",https://www.kickstarter.com/projects/1581318015/outsiders-indie-thriller?ref=discovery_category_newest,1581318015/outsiders-indie-thriller,"First of all, thank you for visiting this Kickstarter campaign. We know there are many out there. My name is Hank Orion, and I'm the writer and director of Outsiders. Welcome to the film. Back in September 2015, I wrote, produced and directed a short film called Outsiders, and now I want to expand it into a feature film (Link to the short film). Outsiders is set in England and it tells a story of a young couple - Josh and Nicole, both in the late 20s. Lucky enough to have met at school, and stayed together since. They've been dating for quite some time now and finally, Josh works out a courage to move to the next stage of their relationship and propose to Nicole. So, when summer comes, and the weather is great, Josh invites Nicole to go with him camping to the beautiful and remote national forest. And she agrees, little did she knew about his true intentions. It starts as a perfect hike outdoors in the wilderness. Campfire, swimming in the lake, stories and foolish acts. But soon they stumble on another hiker, Steve, who seems to have put an eye onto Nicole. That's where things start to go wrong, and Josh finds himself in a position where he has to save his relationship at all costs possible. No matter what.So that's Outsiders. I want to make it feel like one of those thrillers that keep your attention throughout the entire movie. Because for me when I go to the cinema to watch a film and when I get involved in that film completely for ninety minutes that's a well-spent ticket. Movies are supposed to entertain and to distract us from everyday problems, at least for a little while. Please do check out my earlier films too if you have a chance (Link to IMDb).","Every project comes with risks and challenges. The thing is, it's not my first feature film. And I'm confident that me, and my chosen production team will be on top of the production process and overcome any obstacle that arises on our way. We will post regular updates about filming and post-production and be fully transparent with all of our supporters."
https://www.kickstarter.com/projects/1413867571/existence-short-film?ref=discovery_category_newest,1413867571/existence-short-film,"It is a short film (estimated 20/25 minutes) with very little/no dialogue - it is a story that revolves around the lives of two children - best of friends - growing up in the same village and are separated when one is moved away. It is a drama with some coming-of-age features in the storyline.It follows their lives from being toddlers to being elderly - their childhood together, their teenage years apart, re-acquainting, a developing romantic relationship between them, a bitter break-up and re-separation, continuing their lives yet again and finding each other yet again years later. I have to say that there is a lot more to the story than this, but this the general gist of the film overall.I'm the director as well as the scriptwriter. I have worked on-set before and have qualifications in film, and I love to be part of other people's work and to help their work be brought to life - but I thought it was time to do something for myself.It is a small crew that will be required and a small cast as the story is primarily about two people.I am young and I do know that some aspects of the film will be difficult to shoot on this budget, but I do believe this film can be made with the budget of £700 but more money would be advantageous for crew pay, equipment, locations...To anyone that wishes to pledge money towards this filmwill be credited for producing and thanked in the credits.Hopefully, the film will go on to do well and be a success in festivals and competitions. Your name on the credit of a successful short film - and with this success there may be some financial gain (but I'm afraid this is not a guarantee, just a possibility). AndI will be more than happy to answer questions and to send updates throughout the process (pre-production, production, post-production and distribution).If the goal of £700 is reached some point within the next few weeks, I will then be rallying together a crew and cast and hopefully start filming by July/August. I will keep any backers of this project updated.","In making a film there is always a challenge in reliabilty of actors and crew, and in getting locations and equipment, etc. Generally though, this has been well thought through.",https://www.kickstarter.com/projects/1413867571/a-long-way-away-indie-feature-film?ref=discovery_category_newest,1413867571/a-long-way-away-indie-feature-film,"It is a 102-paged script about a hostage situation revolving around three strangers being brought together and trying to get back a loved one. It is a drama, a thriller and also an action film.The film begins at a phone box where all three have been gathered by an ominous villain on the other end of the phone who gives specific instructions throughout the film which they must carry out to get their loved ones released. The whole film is a question of how far would you go to save the ones you love.There are a lot of twists in the film, a lot of drama and some good action scenes.I'm the director as well as the scriptwriter. I have worked on-set before and have qualifications in film, and I love to be part of other people's work and to help their work be brought to life - but I thought it was time to do something for myself.It is a small crew that will be required and four actors. I am young and I do know that some aspects of the film will be difficult to shoot on this budget, but I do believe this film can be made with the budget of £7000 but more money would be advantageous for crew pay, equipment, locations... To anyone that wishes to pledge money towards this film will be mentioned in the credits, and I will be more than happy to answer questions and to send updates throughout the process (pre-production, production, post-production and distribution).If the goal of £7000 is reached some point within the next 7 weeks, I will then be rallying together a crew and cast and hopefully start the process of filming around September/October.I have been passionate about films and filmmaking from a young age, I've been working on this script for some time and I truly believe in this film, and I hope to enter it into festivals around the world in the course of the year 2017.","As it is an independent film, and the film business is a fickle one, there is no guarantees that this film will profit or be a success - if you do pledge money it will be a gamble on your part.There aren't many action scenes, but the scenes that there are may require stunt work which could prove to be difficult - but I ensure that all scenes will be carried out as safely as possible.It is a low-budget film and there will be some financial challenges on my part, but I do believe this film can be done even with a low budget."

I feel passionate about creating something new for space in the dark that gives an entire different experience. The concept of Text Message is to create powerful message by the art itself. I believe each character/text/word had more than one meaning. We may interpret each differently, but those meanings or messages count and make up the text itself. For each character, it has its own glowing message that is only visible in the dark.Text message is not merely an expression of personality, but it motivates us in what we believe in or dream about.Text Message is now on Trendhunter! Check us out and follow at Facebook and Twitter. Please share it with your friends or anyone who might like this project. If you have any questions about Text Message, feel free to discuss them at Crowdfundingforum.com! Addition to our original 8 characters, ""Text Message"" sets goals with 4 new characters that were popularly suggested from supporters. In order to improve this project, I need everyone's help to decide for our next goal! PLEASE TELL US YOUR FAVORITE CHARACTER HERE.The major material that needs to be tested is glowing pigments. I had tried different types of glow in the dark ink, UV ink, and ready-to-use glow in the dark pigment. I finalized my own glow-in-the-dark water-based pigment made with an aqua colored glowing powder. Aqua glowing powder does not merely gives a beautiful glow, it can also extend glowing time up to 10 hours if they are ""charged"" with bright light.Another most appreciated aspect of this project is that it is silkscreen printed by hand with natural tools and materials. Also, a thin layer of texture is printed from this particular printing method.A 100% Recycled 100lb. matte cover paper is used in this project. I wish to choose a type of paper that maximize its recycled content with best performance working with my custom-made pigment. ================================================$12 - One 4x6 Mini Glow of you choice + A set of eight thank you cards.================================================$40 - Four 4x6 Mini Glow of you choice (RETAIL: $12/each) + A set of eight thank you cards.

Each symbol has its own glowing Typography that is only visible in the dark.TypoGlow is not merely an expression of personality, but it motivates us in what we love, believe in, or dream about. It brings fusion of symbolism and typographic art together into a dynamic art project.There are NEW TypoGlow designs now! From the original Language-based symbols, we have designed variety types of symbols to our concept of typographic glowing art. When we reach each stretching goal, more colors can be selected as well! CLICK ON CHART BELOW IF TOO SMALL TO READ!CLICK ON CHART ABOVE IF TOO SMALL TO READ!Inspired by the Chinese Zodiac (or Chinese New Year Animal), I added 2 more Characters: Stallion and Ram. Stallion (or Horse) is the 2014 Year Zodiac Animal and Ram (or Goat) is for 2015!The major material that needs to be tested is glowing pigments. I have tried different types of glow in the dark ink, UV ink, and ready-to-use glow in the dark pigment. I finalized my own glow-in-the-dark water-based pigment made with an aqua colored glowing powder. Aqua glowing powder does not merely gives a beautiful glow, it can also extend glowing time up to 10 hours if they are ""charged"" with bright light.In order to expand more color selections, we will be adding Sea Blue, Green, and Red color glowing powder each time we reach a stretching goal. (View chart above) They each have different properties: Another most appreciated aspect of this project is that it is silkscreen printed by hand with natural tools and materials. Also, a thin layer of texture is printed from this particular printing method.A 100% Recycled 100lb. matte cover paper is used in this project.

These sculptures are inspired by architectural model making techniques, techniques I have learned in undergraduate and graduate architecture school. The sculptures are created by gluing together various sizes of basswood pieces. I call the sculptures Constructions because the artwork is ""constructed"" from small pieces like you would construct a building. But while a building is a free standing object sitting on a horizontal surface (the ground), these sculptures are created to hang on the wall as a painting would.The series is inspired by the long tradition in Western art of the reclining nude. A group of paintings of the reclining nude (a list that includes such works as Titian's Venus of Urbino, Ingres' La Grande Odalisque, Rembrandt's Danae, Goya's Nude Maja, etc) will be studied and will be used as a basis for preparatory sketches and models that will lead to the final sculptures. Photos and scans will be taken that will document the progress of the work and will be posted regularly on my blog.Once the series is completed, photographs of the finished work will be taken, and alongside photographs of preparatory pieces and scans of preparatory sketches everything will be combined into a full color catalog that will document the series. I will also write an essay for the catalog. The catalog will be designed and published by me.The total project will take about five months to complete. Three to four months will be spend in creating about 20-30 sculptures and about two months will be spend on preparing the catalog for publication. Once the catalog is prepared about 1,000 copies will be printed and signed and send to the appropriate donors (the exact number of copies will depend on the number of donors that will receive a copy of the catalog).Progress on the work will be made available in two ways. Frequent updates documenting the work will posted on my blog. The blog will allow interaction of ideas and reactions to the work as it progresses. In addition, a less frequent documentation will also be posted on the website page for this project.(For more information, sample of sculptures from my Construction Series and more in depth discussion about the project please see my website at:http://www.konokopia.com/kickstarter/reclining_nudes.html",,https://www.kickstarter.com/projects/maciekjozefowicz/pattern-squares-a-book-of-visual-puzzles?ref=discovery_category_newest,maciekjozefowicz/pattern-squares-a-book-of-visual-puzzles,"Pattern Squares is a book of original puzzles designed by me.

A portion of this funding will go towards ensuring we have all of the materials to run our camp this year and secure tickets for our members (should they fail to get them in the OMG sale), and the rest will go towards documenting our activities at Burning Man and producing a documentary of them, which will be released for free on Youtube.I am a 3x veteran to Burning Man, and have had the dream to contribute to the community by running a theme camp since I first set foot on the playa.My first year I was blessed to be a guest in the Blue Light District, where I helped Veteran DPW workers with simple construction jobs and got to experience the playa largely with no responsibilities.My second year I worked on a team with the Samadhi Tank Co to bring the first Sensory Deprivation Tank to the playa. We were able to gift 48 people with the experience over the course of a week, and as Lead Manager on-site, helped contribute to our larger camps (Dr. Bronner's UFOam) MOOP-cleanliness.My 3rd year I hosted a friend for his first experience at Burning Man and together we participated in PolyParadise at the Human Carcass Wash and Poly High Tea events. I have had the experience of Burning Man as a guest, Project Lead, community member, participant, and now, Camp Director. The response from people interested in our project has been overwhelming.We know we have a lot of work to do in 3 weeks to get to the playa, and in the end, we're committed to making this happen no matter what."

I've been through many phases. Always have had a passion for music. I thought, for sure the time would come where I'd make millions doing what I love. I think my biggest mistake was trying to fit in. Not that I wasn't good at it, but I was created to be different, to be special, to be me. The moment I started to lose myself, in hopes of acquiring riches, is the same moment that my health decided to take a turn for the worst. In 2010, I developed adrenal insufficiency, to the point where I could no longer perform in front of large crowds. There's something about the excitement that physically drains me. I can only assume this is God's way of telling me to stay true. Out of all the music and songs I've ever done, there's been r and b, gospel rap, secular rap, country, and even blues. A few years ago I put together a heartfelt compilation of songs that were written throughout different stages of my journey, called Love & Inspiration. You may visit my soundcloud page to have a listen, and a free download of the album. With your love and support, I'll be writing and composing a brand new, second compilation of original heartfelt songs (10 tracks). This Kickstarter album will be called Love & Inspiration (The 2nd Compilation). As far as career choices go, I've put music on the back burner. Instead, I'll be focusing on writing and inventing. I currently have a prototype of my first invention, and all proceeds will be going towards the products develpment. All support is an investment in my own personal future and well being, and is greatly appreciated.

It’s been a long time coming. The devil is a liar. Don’t ask me how he’s so good at what he does, all I know is that God is way better. It took me 15 years. I always knew I wanted to live for God, and even thought I was, for the most part, but I was more of an on the fence, luke warm kinda guy. I would smoke weed, quit every now and then, curse, quit every now and then, fornicate, quit every now and then, and so on and so forth. The devil is a liar because he was trying to convince me that I was ok, and that I could continue to live my life that way, without consequence. But the bible says “who God loves He chases”, and I’m so glad He’s never stopped chasing me. I’m becoming mature in my walk, and there is absolutely nothing like it. I don’t feel the pressure of the world anymore. I’m living at home with my parents. I don’t have a girlfriend. I don’t have much money. My car needs to be fixed. I’m disabled, so I don’t have a job, and the only thing that I know for sure I’m pretty good at is rapping… so, by the looks of things, there’s a good chance that I’ll be single and broke for the rest of my life. However, I do not believe that lie, and I refuse to be discouraged because the world is looking down on me. God is working in my life. But yes, rapping is one thing that I know I’m good at, so I’m gonna continue to do it. I have work to do for the uplifting of God’s kingdom. So many souls need to be saved, and I believe that I can reach a great multitude of youth, for Christ’s name sake. I’ve gone by my actual name Collins Vance for pretty much all of my musical ventures, but from now on, I’ll be going by the name ‘Elder’. This kickstarter project will be a Christian rap album, 12 track LP. Now, whether or not the campaign is even successful, I will still be completing this album, Lord willing, and you’ll be able to download it for free from my soundcloud page. The main purpose of this kickstarter is to fund professionalism for the album (mastering, album cover, packaging, etc) , and also have at least 5 quality music videos made. Oh, and I am a prretty good rapper, if I may say so myself, but this will be my best album yet, for sure. I make my own beats, so, I won’t be having to purchase any. I’m not gonna cut any corners on this album. I’ve made Christian rap albums in the past, and 50 year olds enjoyed it… I’m gonna win souls. Please, share this campaign on your Facebook pages, as I do not have one. And please, support this sincere cause with generosity. Lastly, I have samples of myself on soundcloud that you can take a listen to. However, I must inform you that many of the songs are secular, and not Christian, but I want you guys to at least be able to hear some of my work. The songs on soundcloud will be taken down once this campaign ends. Thank you, and God bless.","I totally understand that sometimes problems do occur, and everything doesn't always go as we plan, however, all provisions are in place for the successful fulfillment of each reward.

https://www.kickstarter.com/projects/shirochan/get-jnorth-media-off-the-ground-with-new-equipment?ref=discovery_category_newest,shirochan/get-jnorth-media-off-the-ground-with-new-equipment,"About 2 years ago, after watching several indie films and webseries about gaming, and listening to several podcast of the same subject, I thought to myself, ""Hey, that sounds like fun, why can't I do that, too?"" The simple answer was funding.The basic idea of Jnorth Media is not to get rich, not by any stretch of the imagination. No, we at Jnorth Media simply wish to see the awesome creative ideas we have come to life and share that with the world. As of right now, there are two shows planned to start production once I get the funding to upgrade my equipment (my shopping list I will provide to you my backers as soon as I figure out the most cost-effective means of doing what it is I want to do).The first show is Hazardous Verbal Waste, a news program where I and my cohosts talk about everything geek related. Technology, gaming, entertainment news, nothing's too great or small for us to talk about. The show would be split into three segments: segment one, where myself and my cohosts talk about what we have been up to lately (games played, life stuff, work stuff, etc...); segment two, where we talk about news stories in the technology, gaming and entertainment worlds that interested us or our listeners; and segment three, where we read listener emails and play audio/video submitted by our listeners/viewers.The second show currently being planned is Party Of Evil, a live-play Dungeons & Dragons podcast utilizing the D&D 3.5 rules, with the possibility of upgrading to 5.0 when it is officially released. The first two thirds of this show will be actual gaming, with the last third dedicated to listener submissions.Those are the only two shows planned so far, but there are more to come, and if you pledge at the $100 level, you could see your own show listed here someday.","The most obvious challenge is going to be webhosting for the content of the shows. The easiest way around this, at least for the audio podcasts, is going to be utilizing the fairly easy to understand tools available at PodoMatic.com, where I have had podcasts hosted in the past. For the videocasts/webseries, Youtube is going to be my main hosting tool. Hopefully when I reach my goal, I will have enough to setup premium accounts with both sites so Jnorth Media can produce the best quality content possible, and have it reach the most people. Another challenge will be funding after this campaign ends. For that, I am currently looking into getting a few corporate sponsors to keep the creativity going after the initial launch of Jnorth Media.",https://www.kickstarter.com/projects/shirochan/jnorth-media?ref=discovery_category_newest,shirochan/jnorth-media,"I came up with the idea for JNorth Media while listening to all the great podcasts available through the Smodco network, run by Kevin Smith. I thought to myself that he makes it sound easy enough to record a podcast, why can't I? The only problem was that I had more than one idea for a podcast, so rather than settle on just one, I decided to make two. And of course, as I talked to my friends about the idea, they all kept telling me how they wanted to do a podcast based on subjects they were interested in. Thus JNorth Media was born. But from the start, I realized that to successfully run a podcast network, I would need a few things: a new computer capable of running the latest audio and video editing software, higher quality microphones and a usb audio interface for recording the podcasts (both on the go and in some kind of studio setup), and hosting for all the shows plus a website to act as a central hub for the network. So that is why I am here, asking for your help. Back my project and help a struggling podcast network get off the ground!","Of course no project like this is without challenges. Things like life and work getting in the way of a structured recording schedule, internet connectivity issues, and so on. I will work hard to make sure that these issues do not affect the quality and timeliness of my production schedule, and on the rare occasions where delays cannot be avoided. I will make sure to keep all my listeners in the loop as to what is going on."
https://www.kickstarter.com/projects/lustforglory/the-soniscope-trail?ref=discovery_category_newest,lustforglory/the-soniscope-trail,"It's hard to be band these days. When your goal is to write and record music for a world that no longer buys music, it can sometimes shake ones conviction to their art. Now, imagine being a recording studio these days! Where your art depends on bringing others' art to life, but your business model requires you to charge those who have no budget and will see no revenue from their endeavors.'The Soniscope Trail' will talk to these studio owners/producers. From the unknown, DIY hobbyist to working industry professionals with big name credits. Here, we will follow the independent rock band Lust for Glory as they record their next album in a string of equally independent recording studios throughout the Pacific Northwest (and perhaps beyond). As we document the recording of the songs, we will also talk to people who are making it happen, see the long coveted (often cobbled together) gear and tour the converted houses, churches, garages, sheds, former storefronts and purpose-built rooms that are being used to turn ideas into music.So we'll need to raise funds to pay for the studio time in these places. As well as other recording expenses like tape(or other storage media), travel expenses like gas, food & lodging and production costs for filming.Even with every reasonable effort to limit, avoid or mitigate costs, there are still expenses worth paying for and in many cases, it proves very worthwhile (and timely) to have things done properly the first time. Even at an expense. In its completed form, the full scale of this project will be an episodic internet video series over 12 months, with 3-4 episodes and one song released per month, with a companion releasable DVD and 12 song cd. At its minimum goal, the project should yield at least a 4 episode (at either 1 or 4 episodes a month) with a companion 4 song EP.Between those benchmarks, the project can be easily scaled to meet whatever sliding pledge goal that is attained. And there is even a contingency plan to cover the entire west coast, should we exceed our initial pledge goals by a considerable amount.A formal outline and scope of the project will be finalized after funding is reached and will be released as a Kickstarter update video","The largest risk is falling off schedule. In this projects grandest vision, the 'series run' aspect would see the internet release of 3-4 episodes per month (with an additional video release of the song recorded within those episodes). Logistics poses the biggest threat to the release schedule. And, of course, money helps to facilitate the logistics, so the further past the minimum funding goal we get, the better the chance of avoiding being derailed in that area.Also, creativity comes into play. In any artistic endeavor, for sure. While there is always a risk of the creativity drying up and stalling any creative based project, it is unlikely to be an issue in this case, in that there is a core of songs/song ideas that is slated for use in the project and that would be the largest creative obstacle to be addressed within the context of the video. As it is currently set out, the challenges and obstacles for this project are all manageable at our minimum funding goal. Securing studio time within our scheduling window and the traveling logistics are the top challenges. Sourcing the occasional additional person for camera op will also be a (albeit lesser) challenge in some markets. But again, these are completely manageable under our current production outline.",https://www.kickstarter.com/projects/lustforglory/lady-saturns-tale?ref=discovery_category_newest,lustforglory/lady-saturns-tale,"These are odd times to be a band or musician. You pour your creative heart, sweat, tears and MONEY into recording the deepest musical secrets of your soul, only to find that fans no longer 'buy' or even pay for music.As odd a time as that may seem, now imagine being a recording studio. Your entire business model relies on bands or artists coming in to slap some cash on the barrel head for you to help them track some gold. But, as fans pay less and less for music (even the stuff they like) bands, too, are finding themselves less able to afford such services. Or perhaps, less prone to paying for them when much of that work can be done (to varying degrees of success) 'in-house' by the band themselves. So, as the music industry crumbles all around, how do those whose art form is largely 'invisible' to the end consumer expect to carry on their creativity whatever eventually becomes the music industry's 'new business model'? Well, Lady Saturn's Tale hopes to find that out.In a nutshell: A band records their next album at a bevy of random recording studios- large and small, corporate and independent, thriving and failing- and talks to the producers/studio owners of each facility about their background, what drives them, history of the studio as well as where they think the industry as a whole (and recording as an art form) are heading over the next several years.In the broader view:Lady Saturn's Tale will be a video documentary of a band recording an album, one song at a time- one studio per song. Though, the focus will be less on the band and the songs and more on the given studios that will be featured.At each studio, through the course of recording one of the albums tracks, the film will tour each studio and talk with the studio owner/producer about how they started their recording career, their accomplishments along the way, how they came to start up their studio as well as where they see the state of their art and/or business moving forward in a 'DIY Record Industry' age.The videos will be released in an episodic form on Youtube. Likely in 10-12 minute installments, with an installment devoted to the tour of a given studio, then the next installment features the sitdown interview with the owner. Episodes are expected to be released every 10 days to 2 weeks. There may also be a third video released for each session featuring the song recorded at that studio (hence the option for a 10 day release schedule). Episodic release is anticipated to begin mid-summer, 2019Beyond the individual episodes, a longer form cut of the video portions will be produced and edited as a single, continuous, full length documentary in a DVD format which would be available for submission to film festivals and/or independent screenings as the opportunity presents.In addition, the actual album recorded through the video (Lady Saturn) will be released as a companion piece to DVD.The funding raised here will be used to book session time at the various studios, gas & lodging (when applicable), paying camera people, some video editing, equipment rental and/or purchases as well as any consumables & media required for this endeavor.So, how does a recording studio survive with the ubiquity of recording technology? How to charge to make a product no one buys anymore? Is the recording engineer going the way of of the scribe or typesetter? We aim to touch on all these pressing points and more in our journey. We hope that you will come along for the ride.","Risks and challenges are minimal for this project, and lean towards 'artistic' pitfalls. There is always a chance that the band hits the studio and comes up dry, or can't 'click' in a given environment in order to complete a song. Although such instances will be incorporated into the story arc of the project, there is a remote risk  that, if it happens repeatedly, the video becomes a journal of artistic failure withOUT a companion album versus the project outlined. Granted, that TOO might prove a interesting documentary, it is not what we are shooting for here.To offset any artistic risks like that, all songs will be written prior to any given session, and typically more than one song will be scheduled per studio to ensure a successful session for both the filming and audio recording aspects of the project.Other risks and challenges include logistical concerns.  Primarily for the more geographically distant studios, in that weather and/or other travel concerns can often rear up. However, this band constantly plays throughout the region, and is used to such travel hiccups and can easily accommodate them. The last of the notable risks is the editing and production of the finished discs. While the timeline is structured to avoid any delay to the Rewards distribution, there is always a chance, particularly with the physical production of discs & other merchandise (because that will contracted out to 3rd party vendors) that the schedule may need to be adjusted. But again, the timeline has been structured to minimize that risk (e.g. scheduling to avoid seasonal weather risk).Additionally:Our dollar figure goal is the minimum amount projected to accomplish this project at it's base description. But, anything over the posted goal will allow for a more robust fulfillment of the vision (i.e. further travel radius, higher profile studios, etc) and a broader range of perspective on the recording industry and the plight of young bands and studios in the new millennium. Further, more funding will also help in the distribution of this project to some independent film festivals, which would be a huge boon the overall visibility of this documentary."

We opened a vegan plant-based Cafe the end of 2017 we obtain the building and was operating by the beginning of 2018.We now specialize in making custom entrees for people so if you can't have gluten, salt, bananas, dairy, eggs, or anything else wecustomize your order while you watch to make sure that we put the ingredients that you can eat and of course it's delicious.",The biggest risk is that making sure we get the building secured by October 1st since that's when our lease is up and we have to do the final paperwork.
https://www.kickstarter.com/projects/310973131/splitamericacom?ref=discovery_category_newest,310973131/splitamericacom,"I am most interested in getting as many $1.00 backers as possible.Allow me to be bold: splitAmerica will be the most sought after source for how the people of the United States feel concerning an infinite variety of specific topics. In the very near future, national media outlets will seek to utilize splitAmerica to broadcast questions for which they want America's vote.To put it simply, splitAmerica.com is a website and mobile app that presents one question about ANYTHING on which to vote each day (24-hour increments).  The voting options are binary in nature, meaning the voters can only choose one of two options presented.  For example, a topic could be, “Is Carolina bbq better than Texas bbq?”  The splitAmerica voters will simply choose “Yes” or “No”.   The results of each vote will be displayed at midnight EST each night illustrating the proportional ""split."" So, to use the bbq example, the results could say, ""73% of all voters preferred Texas bbq, leaving 27% preferring Carolina bbq.""Once the amount of users grows to 1 Million per day, there will be a $1000.00 give away each day to one lucky voter chosen at random. As the the number of daily users grows in increments of 1 Million, so will the cash giveaway. So for example, if splitAmerica grows to 10 Million daily followers, the daily giveaway will be $10,000.To make it more interesting, let’s fast forward to November 2016, election day.  Imagine that splitAmerica has gained a tremendously large following in the US, and we are able to conduct a sort of “shadow election” concurrently with the actual election.  The topic for that day could end up being, “Who do you think our next president should be, Trump or Sanders?”  It would be interesting to see how a “vote-for-vote” option would compare to the Electoral College results. Eventually, splitAmerica will become an incredible data source on how Americans feel about a wide array of topics.  As the number of voters increases, so does the accuracy of each outcome. So why do I need your help in funding this? -	The cost for hosting and developing the website is expensive in order to do it right the first time.  -	We at splitAmerica will not charge a membership or subscription fee, so our eventual revenue must be generated by ad-space sales and news outlet usage. However, those sources of revenue will not be viable until we have earned a huge number of follower/voters. Until then, donations and word-of-mouth advertising is our life-blood. -	We require funding to develop a simple and intuitive mobile app for use on smartphones and tablets. - Bringing awareness: We need to purchase marketing tools (stickers, shirts, banner space, etc) - Legal representation. ","Currently, splitAmerica is in 100% design and experimentation phase which is precisely why we need your backing.  When we are successfully funded, the backing received will go towards mitigating the following risks:-  Duplication/imitation:  We will pursue a patent on any and all exclusive concepts required.-  Voting accuracy.  We will need to design a way to truly limit each person to one vote per day so as to maintain the integrity of daily outcomes.-  People could hate splitAmerica, and our number of followers could be too small, making splitAmerica non-viable information source.",https://www.kickstarter.com/projects/310973131/cigararsenal-humidors?ref=discovery_category_newest,310973131/cigararsenal-humidors,"The ProductAt CigarArsenal, we manufacture top-quality cigar humidors made from steel ammunition boxes. We use only the best quality, straight-from-the-mill, Spanish cedar from Central America. Our humidors are highly customized, and every component that we use is of the highest quality, from the wood, to the hygrometer, to the outer tough coating. Not a single shortcut is taken, and that means you get the best home for your cigar.Our humidors are memories coalesced, encapsulated, and preserved forever, and they just so happen to be extremely good at preserving and conditioning your cigars.Product detailsThe ammunition can - We offer three options:1. You can provide one that has sentimental value – The “Battle Proven” model2. We provide a repurposed one that has been used by the military in training – The “Battle Tested” model.3. We provide a brand new one fresh from the manufacturer – The “Battle Ready” model.We currently make humidors in four sizes:“The Fat .50 Ammo can” (Large .50 Cal Ammo Can):  Holds about 130 sticks. “The standard .50” (Standard size .50 Cal Ammo Can):  Holds about 90 sticks.“The standard .30” (.30 Cal Ammo can - travel size):  Holds about 14 sticks.""The 30MM"" (30MM Ammo Can - HUGE):  Holds about 450 sticks.Unless you prefer the original coating, all cans are resurfaced with a proprietary tough coating, making it extremely durable and resistant to scratches, scuffs, and rust. It will not flake or wear at hinges or other moving parts.The Spanish cedar - Our humidors are lined on all six sides with high-quality Spanish cedar straight from a Central American mill. Solid Spanish cedar is the traditional wood of choice for quality humidors due to its incredible ability to resist rot as well as repel termites and other destructive insects. It also exudes soothing aromatic scent that cigar aficionados have come to expect in a quality humidor.The non-marring bottom – Let’s face it, the bottom of an ammunition can is abrasive, and for this reason, we upholster a microfiber buffer so that you can set your humidor on the most delicate of surfaces without worrying about marring.Quality Standard Features – All humidors come with a standard, a high standard:- Engraved plate affixed to the top with anything you want engraved- High quality digital or traditional hygrometer- Boveda humidification packet and with CigarArsenal Spanish Cedar holder.- Spanish cedar removable tray.Customizations – We can add nearly any customization that you want. Believe us, we have seen it all, and we have managed to pull it off with great satisfaction. All customized humidors come with a short biography and thank you letter from the veteran that handcrafted it for you. The following are customization ideas that we have worked with:- Humidification system of your choice- Engraved plate made from melted down expended ammunition brass - Outer coat of almost any color- Affix any badges, insignia, etc.- Recessed installation of unit coins in to the Spanish cedar.- Upholstered inner side-walls (most colors available)About UsTo quote Simon Sinek, “Working hard for something we don’t care about is called stress; working hard for something we love is called passion.""  We want to share our passion with you.We are veterans and supporters of veterans.  Our humidors tell a story, a history through a symbol of sacrifice and service.  Our passion is more than working with our hands to create a meaningful piece of art. Our passion is giving back to the heroes with whom we served during tumultuous times in foreign lands.  Our passion is recognizing our local law enforcement units that are not hailed as heroes as often as they should be.  Our passion is creating and finding meaningful employment for service men and women upon their separation from the military.Why do we exist? This business is for the brothers, sisters, sons, daughters, and parents that never returned.  We want to create products that memorialize them.This business is for the thousands of veterans that commit suicide each year, because the unseen scars are too much to bear, and the ability to adapt to civilian life once again seems impossible.  We want to provide employment with us, a place of purpose for those at risk.  We have been there, and we can relate.This business is for the sacrifice that our heroes make every day.  We want to thank them.This business is for the priceless times when a cigar with buddies was a brief respite from shitty places.  This business is going to provide specialty training and meaningful employment to wounded and disabled veterans.  Our products will be made by veterans for veterans and those who support veterans.This business creates a functional piece of art that memorializes experiences that we love to talk about, and in some cases, the ones we never again mention.We are not a charity. Veterans don’t need charity.  We are a business that operates on a profit, of which a portion is used to train, enable, and employ military veterans and law enforcement.  I want to challenge every business leader in the U.S. to hire veterans… Not because it’s a nice philanthropic charity, but because it makes good business sense.","We constantly strive to eliminate all risks and constraints within our operation.  However, we are are not immune to some of the inherent risks associated with custom manufacturing. We have done an exceptional job sourcing the absolute best components and materials for the best possible piece-prices, and we are proud of that.  However, our operational risk that we are facing at the moment is our ability to scale to the order volume that we experience. If our Kickstarter Campaign is successful, we will be able to take appropriate measures to scale production."

Another to-be-commissioned image will likely be used for the actual cover.""God is too BIG to fit into one religion.""""We are spiritual beings having a physical experience.""- unattributed quotes from the Northern Sun catalogWe are all too similar at the core NOT to be the same entity in spirit. We are, in other words, different physical manifestations of the same spiritual being. Which is why the greatest potential of the human race lies in unity: only by acting as one are we capable of our greatest goods. Yetthe powers that be, the enforcers of the religious, political, andsocioeconomic status quos, derive their strength from controlling the peoplethrough disunity. Caesar was the first to employ this strategy to hisbenefit: Divide and Conquer. We are divided in politics, in spiritualinterpretations, in warring classes and religious and tribal factions. So longas we remain divided, we remain conquered. This book of poems, which I'veentitled ""Love of Wisdom"" based on the Greek root of the word philosophy: 'philo' means love, and sophy, or 'sophia,' means wisdom. For me, the pursuit of spiritual truth, what the Greeks called""gnosis,"" brings this realization of our peaceful union, our embrace of what we all have in common, as being at theheart of mankind's brightest possible future. We all share the one sameuniversal soul that is the source of all of life's energy. Onlyphysically are we independent creatures. It is my sincerest of hopes that this highly spiritually-themed book of poems reaches its own potential inpropelling its readers toward the possession of a similar realization to mine: onlytogether can we reach our greenest pastures and our greatest heights. Therefore only by promoting spiritual, political and socioeconomic theories and concepts that are all-inclusive and universally considerate can one be on the side of the greatest good; the original good that infuses all matter with the energy of life. These poems all share this same critical message: we are all a part of something more than ourselves and we are all in it together, so let us tear-down the barriers of fear and ignorance that keep the majority of us divided for the selfishness of the few! My dream is to make a decent living doing precisely what I am attempting to do through Kickstarter: follow my calling as a philosophical writer fighting for truth and popular progress. I will forever be grateful to all that do me the honor of supporting that dream![See below for poems taken from the collection, for funding plans and for an introduction to some of the many other

streamYou’ll recall you’re all a part of meYour division was a dream~ ~ ~Some say that philosophyHas always been a needless artThat it doesn’t apply to real lifeThat it’s just been theory from the startTo those prepared to pass such judgmentI’ve an opposing metaphor to suggestRegarding the tree that bears the fruits of reasonPhilosophy makes up the roots that support the restFor every structure has a foundationAnd every cell of the tree was similarly designedSo by breaking it down to its most essential partsOne better learns to nurture the tree inside their mind The philosopher seeks these connectionsThat which the branches share togetherHow the roots feed into the trunkHow to grow the tree in any weatherWay down into its roots one early digger dugSearching for the source of all evil and goodHe unearthed the Yin and Yang in everythingBy digging deeper than the others wouldBeneath the roots he unearthed a two-sided seedShedding new light on both Yang and YinAnd marked the first side with the word ‘ignorance’Calling it the source of all sickening sinThe flip side he gave the mark of ‘knowledge’Declaring it the grounds for all that’s goodIdentifying it as the guardian of the treeThe bark protecting every fiber of the woodHe embodied the restless gadflyBuzzing the faces of the proudly pre-supposingHe showed the futility of growing a healthy treeAround a core that’s rotten and decomposingIf tending to the tree had not provided him with powerHis clan of cohorts would not have grown so largeThe politicians would not have been so provoked by fearHe wouldn’t have been brought-up on a made-up chargeThat was some 2,500 years agoBack before the planet was proven roundThe sage sat questioning under the olive treeHis students’ ears glued to his every soundMuch of his art was created in that Golden AgeToday they mostly retrace their classical courseWhen wisdom was spread by words of mouthBefore Plato’s pen gave them everlasting forceNot until you sit where he did, protected by her canopySufferers standing in the heat before your eyesWill you come to love the tree’s tremendous giftsSophia’s shade stripping away all need for guiseFor the feeling of the great inner peace of knowingIs an enrichment that no bounty of gold can gainShielding you from the heats of anger and ignoranceFrom the soaking rains of sorrow, isolation and painIt’s not ego but compassion that compels invitationYou wish for others to taste the tree’s refreshing fruitsAntidotes for despair drip down their chins like nectarThe tree grows from the tending of fresh recruitsPassionate debate is nourishing food for thoughtEspecially when truth rather than ‘winning’ is your aimThe peace of comprehension is the only currencyUnderstanding is the priceless prize in this gameWhen the mind and the heart come togetherSomething more real than all else can be feltEverything that is must come from somethingTherefore into something everything must meltThis reduction all the way to the original seedThat source from which all of life’s energy is derivedBut there is no need to ‘return’ to this eternal placeFor to be alive means we've already arrivedAnd therein a great joy if offeredRealizing that the greatest powers are right here on earthFrom the demons of destruction, disease and addictionTo the angels fostering romance, adventure and birthIn the middle only one thing remains unchangedWhat the graying seer saw as the soul, or “psyche”It’s something that wants you to live your life to thefullestAnd has no desire to command, control or smite theeSo let us stand under the tree of wisdomAnd admire the way her roots feed up to her trunkLet us hang from her splendidly solid branchesAnd gulp the juice from her fruits ‘til we’re drunk!

on what instinct really is: communication with the immortal part of yourself""Victory of the People"" - on the type of political structure necessary for justice to prevail in the west: a purer, truer democracy""A Blank Canvas"" - on how we all start from scratch and 'paint' our own realities from there: our reality is what we make it""Imitating Mother"" - on how technology ultimately wishes to replace nature, but can never overcome it: we imitate Mother Nature's supremacy""Like a Sponge"" - knowledge is power, and ignorance is the source of all evil: to be forces for good we must therefore absorb as much as we can""Love of Wisdom"" - the title poem for the project - rough draft posted above - dedicated to Socrates: how the art of philosophy is undervalued, and is really the practice of finding the common truths rooted in and shared between different interconnected branches of knowledge, feeding the tree of wisdom from the ground up through the trunk""Natural and Not"" - on how all 'sin' is an affront and assault against nature: all actions have an effect; unnatural actions, therefore, have unnatural effects""Taming the Tiger"" - on how one of the greatest challenges presented is the challenge of controlling, or 'taming,' one's sex drive which, if permitted to run wild, can lead to devastating effects: if you make a beast it will bite you""Opened and Closed"" - on how being a true liberal means being liberally-minded; open to new ideas that might better meet the evolving challenges of the day - and on how being politically conservative means closing your mind to those progressive concepts; at least the type of progress that helps everyone""The Bottom Line"" - on how big business in laissez-faire capitalistic systems such as those in place in the west lead inexorably to the subjugation of the working class in service of the ownership classes' bottom line""The Carpenter"" - about the real Jesus Christ, a historical figure: a great spiritual philosopher whose lessons and images have been seized upon by those looking to consolidate power - but his ""Gnostic Gospels"" remain""The Seamless"" - on the interconnectedness of all things (Buddhist)""You are Selfish"" - all motivations are selfish motivations - there is no such thing as being selfless, as even the motivation of feeling good for having done the 'right thing' in helping someone less fortunate, for example, is selfish - it's all about what types of things you're selfish about, and how whether or not those things are exclusively about satisfying yourself or others as well""Drugenomics"" - on the supply and demand that rules all markets, including the pharmaceutical and narcotics markets, and how many narcotics are kept illegal precisely because they are much more profitable that way""Tough Guy Syndrome"" - on how many males in western society are controlled by the notion of being 'manly,' and thus can't be honest with themselves or others on anything that makes them look sensitive or emotional""Realist or Idealist"" - on how the true difference between these two supposedly opposing political stances is a matter of intelligence, courage and conviction is imagining and fighting for something better than the current reality""Freedom Fighter"" - on the very true expression ""one man's terrorist is another man's freedom fighter"" - not an approval of slaughtering innocents, but an attempt to make the western reader realize the plight of those that suffer for opposing the imperialistic advancement of the American Empire in their lands""Patriot and Turncoat"" - on how the greater patriot is the one that fights for the improvement of his or her country and all of its citizens as opposed to accepting the current American Pie good 'ol boy traditions that favor the few""Buyer Beware"" - most consumers think little of their purchases, not considering the fact that their contribution to the demand of any commodity or service is exactly what creates the ongoing supply of that commodity/service""Ego by Addition"" - on how the silencing of the mind and the residing in the heart, such as by meditation, reveals the truest self; the one absent all self-perceived attributes of one's self, which are added after the fact""Signs and Signals"" - on communicating with 'God,' or 'the one spirit that resides within us all;' it will speak to and help guide you, just not with words""Mutually Exclusive"" - on the false but popular notion that such things as science and religion, or science and spirituality, to name the most common example, are mutually-exclusive concepts or phenomena; the truth of either actually depends upon the truth of the other; they are mutually interdependent""House of Cards"" - on the short-sighted and spiritually-shallow foolishness of the life spent in satisfaction of greed and earthly power that falls-away at death - true power is that of spiritual and philosophical knowledge and the resulting peace and satisfactions experienced by the holder of these essential truths""God Is"" - on an interpretation of God not as the man with the flowing beard sitting up in heaven passing judgment, but of 'God' as the universal force of energy that enlivens and binds together every organic being in existencemany other poems planned as well...Funding Plans:With your support I am planning on using the asked-for funds in order to print at least 500 paperback copies of the ""Love of Wisdom"" poetry collection as well as prepare said collection for an 'eBook' offering online. Any funds left-over will go towards a small advertising campaign to promote the 1st draft, and then to additional printings of the paperback and eBook versions of the collection. A few hundred dollars or so will be used to pay a local Sonoma County artist to produce the cover image for the novel, which I already have a detailed idea for.My political affiliations and related philosophies can be viewed at my website: www.socratesproperties.com",,https://www.kickstarter.com/projects/1714708793/love-of-wisdom-philosophy-and-spirituality-in-vers?ref=discovery_category_newest,1714708793/love-of-wisdom-philosophy-and-spirituality-in-vers,"Love of Wisdom encompasses years of my search for truth in matters that I have come to consider of the utmost importance in the evolution of our species. While I the exploration of spirituality and its conqueror, religion, is the foundation of this search, ALL THINGS ARE INTERCONNECTED and, thus, my searching and reading of fellow thinkers has evoked thoughts and, now, verse on all matter of topics. Following are three sample poems I have included so that you might possess a better idea of my writing style, quality, subject matter and bias - critical thought shows there is no such thing as 'unbiased.' I have outlined a good number of the poems that I plan to include in this collection below, including their 'working titles' and themes/subjects, though this is a partial list that grows almost daily.(1st published through the Occidental Center for the Arts' ""Right to Write"" in 2011)Present in every momentIn everything that livesEach moment lived most presentlyIs homage to that which givesReceived and re-gifted Each present made uniqueBy the experience of we that liftA pebble from the creekThat flows from energy into matterBetween the layers of time and spaceAnimating every bodyGiving life to every raceCalling-out through every creatureIn one pure, penetrating voiceAll of you share me equallyOn this you have no choiceFor I need not pass between you From here to there and backBut am already there while hereThe white inside the blackYou have felt me all your lifeWe have always been togetherIt matters not what name you call meBecause our marriage is foreverChrist grew me in his GospelsRumi felt me in trance of song and danceShakespeare wrote me into poetryWhile deep in lust with romanceSocrates rounded me with reasonWhen the myths would not sufficeThe Buddha gulped me upIn a porridge made of riceMoses saw me while crossing the SinaiSuffering so much he could barely seeThey all speak of the same salvationBy following me you can be freeThere is no such thing as nothingNo beginning to time or spaceFrom this eternal spring I sprungNo finish to this raceThe heart is my entry pointFrom pure being into matterThe mind is your go-betweenMe and your rung on the endless ladder I am the ageless guidance counselorAt every student’s orientationThe force of motivationBehind every lesson’s graduation I am a part of every parcelA piece of every partThe infinite within the finiteThe beginning without the startFor when you are without dimensionThere is no confusion, no far or nearBut all of time is lived at onceAnd there is nothing left to fearTo find me quiet your thoughtsThe mind is filled with fear and doubtAnd seek your answers on the insideRather than the outTo dwell in this place of perfect unionLosing all sense of separationIs to live each moment in the fullestFilled with peace and jubilationThis is the center of the circleOur selfless realizationOf a source without restrictionWithout worry or degradationFor when your vessel’s engine quitsAnd you’re sucked back down the streamYou’ll recall you’re all a part of meYour division was a dreamIdle-minded idolatry; uponwhich notion of the spirit did your mind settle?“I have faith that mine isthe one and only answer” said the pot to the kettleSome converting for power andfame; others with only the best of intentionsHonorable mentions to those not trying to win entry to Heaven like it’sa gameBut even the kindest, sincerestrider is to blame when their horse comes up lameThat said, my story begins notwith a list of every possible vanquishing sinBut with a boy, his parents andtheir traditions, his friends and their kinAll the while while the impressionablelittle lad was busy being raisedThe Lord’s name every day wasbeing constantly praisedWhen the harvest was fruitfulthe people would give thanks and singWhen spoiled by blight somberprayers the dark night would bringHis family would gather ‘roundto read from ‘The Book’Father obsessed withinstilling its lessons no matter how long it tookWearing The Lord’s sigil ‘roundhis neck from before he could walkWords from ‘His Book’ on hislips from the time he could talkWading into the future withthe latest religion manifestedSpiritual byways, highwaysand cross-streets congestedWord of mouth east to west,north to south and backCenturies recorded beforepapyrus pages were inked in blackSo please don’t be Religulous, for your analysis isincompleteWith your chin held high,casting your overly-critical eyeDoubt the heavenly reign ofX, Y or Z, prepare to die!So dismissively swift tocondemn ‘the other guy’So quick to presume what isblack and what is wrongBut the White Holy Lightsings in full spectrum songPrepared to plant your flagand declare your occupationWith your forces of reasonbound without hope of emancipationObediently you follow all of‘His Commandments’ and directionsBut cross students ofphilosophy and you won’t pass their inspectionsFor while you claim to holddear and know the One Lord well Ironically you do it whilepreaching distinctions that perpetuate HellLife’s not religious chess; outmaneuveropponents, pawn to rook twoCheck mate!

May and said:Living a commonplace existence is what I most dreadWith an arrogant air May doubled back to say:Everythingthere is to be done has been done beforeThe flies from the East learned how to cipher water from sandThe flies from the North can tap sweet maple sap on demandThe flies from the West say it best to avoid the turbulent shoreThe fliesfrom the South need not sweat ‘til it’s a hundred and fourAll our brothers and sisters have produced a parallelnotion:We flies are like tiny little droplets in a bottomless oceanAnd likely have less than a week until we fly no moreUnder suchcircumstances what good is your ambition?The only smart thing to do is to consume all we canOnly this can be considered a sensible planThe only mission proven to enhance your conditionBut Gadglanced about at the others and gave the reply:I can’t pretend to be satisfied by this one little creekFor something tells me there are other things worthy to seekAnd staying here would mean living an unhappy lieSo withoutanother pause Gad darted away from the frayAnd zoomed over the meadows with the bounded bundles of hayFlying until the morning mist melted into the warming dayBut as the sun approached its apex he became exceedinglyweakAnd so worriedabout the wisdom of having left the creekSuddenly he spotted a structure that he had never beforeseenWhich he entered through a perfectly sized hole in thescreenLeading him to that which his heart had asked him to seekA Labradorlay prone on the first floor of the two story abodeUntil noticing the fly coming close to the freshly fryingmeatWhich the cook had left covered in the seasoned oil to heatThe dog shot to its feet before entering its predator modeAnd chasedthe fly as it flew nearer to the succulent smellKnocking the pan from the stove and straight towards thegroundBoiling sauce dripping onto towels stacked in a neat littlemoundImmediately going up in flames, the home soon resembled hellMeanwhile backnear the creek May was restlessly brewingAn internal discomfort had developed from her earliermeetingGad’s words hammering on her brain with a continuous beatingMaking her question her life and everything she’d been doingSo shecursed the foolish fly that had filled her with doubtVowing to forever stand against all that for which he stoodThe silly searching and wanting of far more than he shouldDismissing him once more she rapidly retraced her routeZooming backtowards the pile she buzzed by a napping bearWho awoke with a start and gave off a tremendous, deafeningroarOne louder than all the wild creatures had ever experiencedbeforeScaring the birds from their nest and the creatures fromtheir lairIncluded amongthem was an uncommonly large, long-eared hareThat sprung from its cover lying within one of the redwood stumphallowsNear to a bobcat creeping towards the creek for somerefreshing swallows That then tracked the rabbit with great stealth and considerablecareUntil aquarter mile or so later the cat laid its intentions bareSpringing suddenly from the wood like an arrow from a bowThe hare blasted into a field with the ravenous bobcat intowPast rows of corn and a sign declaring “Trespassers Beware!”Hot on thehare’s heels the cat then collided with a steedGiving it a scare that prompted an uncontrolled sprintSpringing over the fence and down the dirt road it wentSoon sending its owner off track while unable to leadUntilfinally the steed calmed enough to relinquish commandAt the same moment the horse’s rider saw the billowing smokeAnd with his heart pumping faster an internal presence awokeSteer your steedstraight at the flames was its deliberate demandSo hefollowed his inner voice and rode right at the fireArriving to see the owner hanging helplessly from the roofWho looked down desperately upon hearing pattering hoofThen her grip beganto slip and the situation became direShe felltowards the ground with her face falling firstCalling for a crash that promised a badly broken neckCatching her instead he saved her from certain wreckLess than eleven months later her belly was bound to burst They had ababy girl who showed promise from the startIncredibly smart she grabbed the troubled world by the tailShe taught on the unity of life and the resolute refusal tofailAnd nailed the world back together heart by broken heartSo eventhough May wanted to go against the upsetting flyShe ended up being Gad’s partner in God’s heavenly crime Part of an enigmatic duo dancing from the beginning of timeYin and Yang have a working relationship that will never dieForGad passing May was but a single falling domino Beginning with the one that fell forever agoAnd ending in an infinity that no one shall ever seeThat we go towards with limited minds but hearts that are free(REMEMBER THAT THIS IS A PARTIAL LIST I'LL CONTINUE TO ADD TO)1) MIGHTY APHRODITEOn the love of women and the worshiping of living embodiments of the 'divine feminine incarnate' being central to an enriching life for real, romantic men.2) CONSERVINGWhat does it really mean to be politically conservative? What are you conserving, exactly, aside from anachronistic traditions and the status quo?3) THE JOB INTERVIEWCommentary suggesting that capitalism promotes obsequious cronyism, the destruction of unprotected lands and disadvantaged people and will continue to lead more and more to the western empire's ""globalization"" of the planet.4) VICTORY OF THE PEOPLEOn the U.S. not actually being a democracy; this is propaganda. We are actually a plutocratic republic where most working class people have no true representatives because all 'reps' are white collar class individuals forever indebted to the wealthy, powerful forces that put them in office. Until the people demand the institution of REAL DEMOCRACY, we will never have our victory.5) LOVE OF WISDOMThe title poem is about the art of philosophy itself, how it is under-appreciated, undervalued and generally lost to the modern day, and how it is actually an invaluable discipline for deciphering truth and meaning in all matters of life.6) LIKE A SPONGEOn how the truly educated never stop educating themselves. The wisest individuals continue to thirst for new perspectives and reliable forms of information, as well as methodologies for thought and scientific and theological exploration etc. We should all aspire to be sponges that never stop soaking...7) THE SEAMLESSOn how literally everything is interconnected; separation is an illusion based upon ignorance and a limitation of sensory perception. There are no gaps.8) TOUGH GUY SYNDROMEIt is the observation of this thinker that the vast majority of men in the West have become so ingrained in juvenile perceptions reinforced by society that the male must be entirely tough, insensitive and 'bad ass' in appearance and action. The result is the foolish male that can't admit, for example, his emotional turmoil or even his nature affinity for anything considered 'feminine.'9) YOU ARE SELFISHTo be selfish or to be selfless is an erroneous choice. You are yourself and, therefore, literally everything that you do is motivated by that self. In other words, there is no such thing as a selfless act, for even if you're doing something primarily for the benefit of others, you're doing it because it makes you feel good to do what you perceive as the right thing. This is but one example of how every though and action taken by any one person, duly considered, can be traced back to that person. WE ARE ALL SELFISH. But this is not a problem in and of itself, for one can be selfish about good rewards.10) WORRIED SICKOne of the most important lessons I've learned in my life thus far is knowing when and why to mentally concern myself with things. You do what you are able to do about what you care about and don't concern yourself with those things that lie 100% outside your realm of control; for such concerns are not only illogical but counterproductive, as unnecessary accumulated stress kills.11) TAKING A PROFITOn the misleading notion condoned and proliferated byconservatives that profits are created, when the truth is that profits are a‘zero sum game:’ they are not outpourings of creativity but the effects of thecauses of hard work and the consuming of resources, both of which are utilizedin the cheapest possible manner, as expenses must be minimized in themaximization of profit; the serving of the bottom line is all the matters inbusiness.12) THE BALANCE SHEETHow nature and the all-creating energy behind it that weknow as ‘God’ tracks all; everything is accounted for, even when we aren’tdoing the accounting ourselves. Everything that is created, all wealth andpleasure and satisfaction and anything that might be construed as good musteither be earned or paid for; with few exceptions. As an example of asatisfaction one must pay for, there are many pleasures that can be felt by thebody through the introduction of narcotics which, in interaction with thebrain, produces a chemical reaction which summons the feel-good effects theaddict can gradually come to require in exchange for a cost incurred againstone’s health, the very base of one’s life (see “Natural or Not” below). As anexample of something positive that must be earned, those that love to exerciseoften track their workouts and note their progress, which is a very worthwhilepractice in terms of its motivational and sense-of-reward value. Yet all of theprogress you make is tracked by your body’s response to the exercise you doregardless of whether or not you write down the number of reps: muscles arebroken-down and rebuilt stronger, ligaments are stretched and strengthened,lung-capacity and efficiency of oxygen utilization and the correspondingcapacity of the body to deliver nutrients to the brain and throughout the bodyis increased etc. etc., the effects of all of which positively compound tocreate a more capacious, happier version of you.13) THE NORTH SUNOn the North Star’s use as a guide being analogous to thepotential guiding value of The NorthernSun catalog; a catalog filled not just with bumper stickers but a considerablecollection of wisdom-packed maxims cultivated from some of history’s greatestthinkers.14) NATURAL AND NOTOn the fact that we are all natural beings governed by thelaws endowed with and through Mother Nature and, thus, are subject to unnaturaleffects to be suffered upon ourselves, upon other people, biological beings andthe planet itself when we break those laws. Our natural state, aka our‘health,’ is the vehicle through which we experience all of life. And theplanet is the only home we are guaranteed, and it daily suffers the ills of ourdisorder. 15) EGO BY ADDITIONOn the spiritually-centered idea that, as the Buddhists andthose practiced in meditation might suggest, the truest version of you is yourspiritual self housed very subtly within the heart, and that to be one’s trueself one must be willing to clear one’s mind and senses of anything that cloudsthat true sense of self. These clouds are additions created through one’sinteractions with the transient physical world around him/her. Self-conceptionsnot related to this inner energy one might consider the most essential self butthat are artificially added by one’s mind are, like the confusing clouds,perceptions that are ‘in addition to self;’ these additions accumulate tocreate one’s “ego;” the perceived self.16) FIRST SPARKOn the existential battle related to mutual exclusivity (see“Dynamically Determined” below) where, in contrast to the conventional wisdom,science and spirituality are not nemesis of one-another but are two sides ofthe same coin. Starting with Einstein’s general theory of relativity(E=MC squared) and his own statements on its limitations, this poem expounds thetheory that the spirit is the source of all energy in the all universes, and isthe ‘unknown variable’ explaining mysteries such as the first spark that startsthe heart and the ‘Big Bang Theory,’ which scientists can only explain after the bang itself. 17) ENERGY FIELDSReaders will be able to see a ‘Buddhist theme’ to this andmany of my poems, and that’s not an accident: Buddhism is, for many reasons (including the fact thatthe ‘religion’s’ idol is the spiritual searcher himself, ‘The Buddha,’ asopposed to a conception of ‘God’), one of my favorite theologies, and one ofits core principles is that of inter-connectivity. ‘The Buddha’ knew everythingin the world was interconnected both not just cause and effect but, beneaththat, by the interactions of unlimited sources of energy, or ‘life forms.’18) DYNAMICALLY DETERMINEDUnderlying many of my poems is the exposure of the fallacyof mutual exclusivity: in an ever-evolving world where everything is connectedto everything else, even when those connections aren’t witnessed or understood,there is nothing ‘real’ that can be exclusive of any other real thing. Likewith science and spirituality, the laws of reason dictate that determinism, orthe existence of ‘fate,’ must coexistwith the existence of free will if they possess truth. We are born into historicalcircumstances and with talents that preordain paths that we may choose tofollow in whole or in part and that we’re always remaking.AND THERE ARE AT LEAST 20 MORE PLANNED FOR THE COLLECTION!With your support I am planning on using the asked-for funds in order to print at least 1,000 paperback copies of the ""Love of Wisdom"" poetry collection as well as prepare said collection for an 'eBook' offering online. I am hoping there will be enough left over (printing expense estimations vary) for me to pay a good editor to give my work a 'second look' and an artist to not only create a detailed drawing for the cover but to produce sketches to help tell each poem!",

I was listening to some rap music and I was really focusing in on the beats and how simple they were. I thought that it would be really easy to make them if I just had the proper equipment...within weeks I started the arduous task of becoming a completely self taught producer. After over a decade I have my craft honed down to a science classified as art; like natural fractals my music keeps going and only becomes more mesmerizing the more you look into it. I have over 500 nearly finished tracks that I would like to narrow down to 100 fully-produced marvels of modern music. I don't want to get famous or rich, I just want to share my passion with the world.","I'm currently a sophomore honor student in college earning my AS in business. I'm not just a creative force but I also posess keen business sense and marketing strategies. Since I have the summer off from classes now is absolutely the best time to complete this project. Not only is most of the groundwork already laid, as the tracks just need minor tweaks and mastering, but the venue and mediums to release the albums await with open arms. Some may say that a challenge is competing against other, perhaps more talented musicians but I think people are always interested in hearing something new, unique, and interesting.",https://www.kickstarter.com/projects/1763883467/red-orange-yellow-green-blue-indigo-violet?ref=discovery_category_newest,1763883467/red-orange-yellow-green-blue-indigo-violet,"I've created 7 albums, each named after the colors of the rainbow, to promote diversity through music. Each album will contain a variety of tracks spanning multiple genres to introduce new styles of music. While enjoying these tracks it is my hope that listeners will enjoy listening to different genres of music and learn to spread acceptance to other areas of their lives besides their musical tastes. I need funding to get these songs mastered and get them available for purchase on iTunes. This project is dedicated to sharing the variety of music that is contained in the world and in each of us.","As I have already laid down most of the time-consuming portions of this task such as writing, producing, and editing the music there are only small challenges ahead. If people can be more accepting of different kinds of music, which we all view as very important to us, then perhaps we can let that acceptance spread to other areas of our lives that need it most."

Dance made me feel happy inside, it made me feel alive, beautiful and it bought back a sense of normalcy to my life.  As a dancer and stage 4 cancer survivor I wanted to know and understand more about what I was experiencing so after a long recovery I went back to school to get a degree in holistic health so i could assist others in keeping their good health as well as reclaiming their good health. Its is my passion to share with healing benefits of Belly Dance. Here are a few benefits of the Belly dance and Sensual Movement (Sensual because we are using the senses) that I experienced on my journey to restoring my health and life.The physical benefits of belly dance include helping you to evenly strengthen your core and spine, thus promoting good posture. It increases muscle tone and flexibility, which builds a stronger body. The faster movements are great for your cardiovascular system, increasing blood flow and promoting the flow of oxygen throughout the body. The slower moments elevate self-awareness and muscle control, and can even become a form of meditation. The movements are low impact, which is gentle on your back and joints. Dance helps clear the mind and allows you to let go of stress.The mental benefits include empowerment, relaxation, and creativity. The emotional benefits are: increased self-esteem, contentment, happiness, fulfillment, and feeling of accomplishment.The spiritual benefits are: feeling centered, grounded, and connected to yourself, others, and your higher power.    The Goddess In Motion Training Program is all about Empowering Women .

It is a way to share why we love those we love. For those who want to remain anonymous in sending a rose they can do so.

I have a vision of what I want this single rose GIVE THE GIFT OF LOVE to be and need to find a great web creator.

My name is Michael, and I am a chef and a bit of an entrepreneur. I created my salted balls nearly twenty years ago to the delight of my friends, and annoyance of my parents. Over the years i have perfected my recipe and am now ready to sell them once again at local farmers markets and online!But, to do this I will need funds that I simply do not have. The money raised here will go to securing a booth at the Kenosha harbor open air market, and the cost of ingredients and shipping for my tiered rewards.My salted balls come in 3 flavors: Milk Cocolate, Blueberry, and Caramel. Each is filled with either Vanilla cream, Strawberry Cream, or banana cream.The balls are about the size of a ping pong ball, with the big balls being about the size of a tennis ball.Finally the Mystery Balls. These are flavors I am trying out. There are currently 5 mystery flavors I am testing out!My salted balls are a huge hit at parties and events, and i think you're gonna love my balls too!","I do not foresee any serious hurdles. I have idiot proofed the recipe, so that if for some reason I am not able to make the balls or man the booth, my close friends or family can make them or o;erate the market booth.",https://www.kickstarter.com/projects/mikewoodsgwerin/mobile-kitchen?ref=discovery_category_newest,mikewoodsgwerin/mobile-kitchen,"Hey there! I am trying to raise money for a new mobile catering vehicle. I need to raise $7000 to cover the last part of the cost and if I can get this in seven days or less, I will give a free catering event for up to 20 people to everyone in the continental united states who donates! The longer it takes, the fewer who will get the free catered event. Those with the largest donations get top priority, other gigs will be scheduled around them. If donations exceed $7000 USD, I will throw in nifty bonuses. Once the amount is achieved, I will contact every doner via email to set up the event. I really need this mobile unit. It would double my service area and allow me to go to competitions and events outside my service area.Also, my family would really appreciate it if I stopped talking on and on about how much more business I could get with a mobile kitchen. So, for my family's sake, donate. They need their sanity ;)","Getting funding by the deadline is my biggest risk factor as I might not be able to get this particular food truck. There are 3 more mobile units I'm looking at, this one is the only one I would have to put no work into.Business partners may back out and I will have to make adjustments, particularly to backer rewards. I will honor all backer rewatds earned prior to the change.Reaching donors by deadline could prove another hurdle, but I believe that it won't be a real problem.Life happens, but I am adaptable.

That being said, you're probably even more aware of the fact that live-action anime adaptations are some of the worst things to ever hit Hollywood.Winteresting Entertainment's goal is to make a live-action adaptation short film of Attack on Titan in order to redeem the horrible reputation of the movie. Attack on Titan is a wonderful story about humanity gathering together in order to survive, regardless of the cause. The story in itself is a real inspiration to us because it teaches valuable lessons about teamwork, love, trust in your friends, and it makes you want to go out and protect everything that is near and dear to your heart.All or Nothing - Attack on Titan Live Action is going to be a short film about humanity's heroes, Eeren Jaeger, Mikasa Ackerman, Armin Arlert, Sasha Braus, and Levi Ackerman with the story taking place shortly after the last episode of season 2. Corruption begins to grow within the walls and the military police, along with the king start to treat the people repulsively. The Survey Corps are the only ones left who can protect humanity while fighting against humanity.We plan to start filming as soon as we get all of our gear together. The script for the film is nearly completed. After it's done we have to work on getting everything together. The first 3 weeks we will gather our actors, crew members, and list locations for where we need to film. The 4th and 5th week will be script rehearsal only. The 6th and 7th week will be on site rehearsal. Week 8 and 9 (if needed)we will be filming everything and weeks 10-13will be post production.

Approaching the end, the few people awake watch their timers approach zero...signaling the end of the hour. To their shock and confusion the clocks don’t restart and people don’t wake up. Everyone who was asleep is now stuck in a slumber and as a result will die if they don’t wake up soon. . .. . .And unless the ones awake can find out what's causing this living nightmare...that fate awaits them all.The script for the first episode is nearly completed.

Nel frattempo ha aperto anche l'Art space, un atelier e uno spazio collettivo destinato ad attività artistiche, artigianali e sociali. Christian I.

Our existence could be based on believing that we exist.The former agent (Mario) experiences déjà vus that bring unexpected turns. In this way, situations that seem to resemble each other are repeated, acting people are exchanged and a look at parallel worlds is drawn. These are as diverse as stars in the universe. Is life a single “try and error” scenario, where according to the rules of bonus points and new lives - is played?It is a contemporary fairy tale, with the protagonist embodied by the agent. This was already the hero in my novel ""noman's land or the man without a name"" and he lives on here. Characterized by the desire that life preserves itself and consciousness is not lost, history develops astonishing parallels with a classic video game.We observe and are observed; nothing less than our reality is put to the test here. The questions remain: Who is playing here? Who created (programmed) everything? Also because the ""big experiment"" is always delayed, we ask ourselves which powers are trying to prevent it. Can the protagonist wake up from this dream - or is he caught in a ""video game""? We do not know it! Death also occurs in it, but it no longer plays a major role.Because we don't know what we don't know. We can be creative and develop fantasies because we are not omniscient. It is wildly speculated here that the smallest particles behave strangely and put us in loops of thought and existence.We search for meaning and knowledge while we carry out life without plan - knowing that life does not leave wounded people, but dead people. Is that a sign that we are trapped in a program?Im Labor COVID-19 soll das Doppel-Spalt-Experiment, nach 100 Jahren wiederholt werden. Unsere Existenz könnte darauf beruhen, dass wir glauben zu existieren.Der ehemalige Sicherheitsbeamte (Mario) erlebt Déjà-vus, die unerwartete Wendungen bringen. So wiederholen sich Situationen, die sich zu ähneln scheinen, handelnde Personen ausgetauscht werden und einen Blick auf parallele Welten lenkt. Diese sind so vielfältig wie Sterne im Universum. Ist das Leben ein einziges „try and error“ Szenario, wo nach Gesetzmäßigkeiten von Bonuspunkten und neuen Leben - auf Gedeih und Verderb gespielt wird?Es ist ein zeitgemäßes Märchen, wobei der Protagonist vom AGENT verkörpert wird. Dieser war bereits der Held in meinem Roman ""niemandsland oder der Mann ohne Namen"" und er lebt hier weiter. Geprägt von dem Wunsch, dass das Leben sich selbst erhält und Bewusstsein nicht verloren geht, entwickelt die Geschichte verblüffende Parallelen mit einem klassischen Videospiel.Wir beobachten und werden beobachtet; nichts geringeres als unsere Realität steht hier auf dem Prüfstand. Die Fragen bleiben offen: Wer spielt hier? Von wem wurde alles geschaffen (programmiert)? Auch weil sich das „große Experiment“ immer wieder verzögert, stellen wir uns die Frage, welche Mächte es zu verhindern versuchen. Kann der Protagonist aus diesem Traum aufwachen - oder ist er in einem ""Videospiel"" gefangen? Wir wissen es nicht! Auch der Tod kommt darin vor, spielt aber keine große Rolle mehr.Weil wir nicht wissen, was wir nicht wissen. Wir können kreativ sein und Phantasien entwickeln, weil wir nicht allwissend sind. So wird hier wild spekuliert, dass die kleinsten Teilchen sich seltsam verhalten und uns in Denk- und Daseinsschleifen versetzen.Wir suchen nach Sinn und Erkenntnis, während wir das Leben planlos austragen - in Kenntnis, dass das Leben keine Verwundeten hinterlässt sondern Tote. Ist das bereits ein Anzeichen, dass wir gefangen sind in einem Programm?Ablauf:Dieser „No-Budget“ Film wird 2020, mit ca. 50 Minuten Spieldauer realisiert.Der Trailer zum Film ist schon jetzt bei YouTube abrufbar unter: https://youtu.be/WHBxKkYBBk4Um eine zukünftige kommerzielle Nutzung zu ermöglichen, ist der Einsatz von Premium-Software vorgesehen.

We now wish to grow this part of our business by offering our printer at a very competitive price.2020 printer-capable materials include standard PLA/ABS, various blends of NYLON (strong & low friction), POLYCARBONATE (super strong), PETG or Taulman TECH-G (strong and optically clear), POLYURETHANE / TPU (flexible, rubber like), POM (similar to Delrin), Carbon Fiber and metal infused filaments, glow in the dark plastics, and many others. The list of available thermoplastics for FDM printers continues to grow.Fused Deposition Modeling (FDM) constructs 3D objects by depositing thin layers of heated thermoplastic material. Each new layer thermally fuses to the previous layer resulting in a strong and accurate finished product.Of the various technologies, FDM is arguably the most mature and easiest to set up and use. Quality prints are achievable in most environments.The large selection of low cost thermoplastic materials for FDM printers satisfies a much broaderspectrum of applications than resin based printers (SLA). Also no post-processing equipment is necessary.And last but not least, FDM printing enjoys a huge support community. Countless articles on materials and troubleshooting print problems are easily located.Purchase the optional Raspberry Pi 3 wireless host for standalone and/orwireless network control of your print jobs. The OS and applications are pre-configured on a 16Gb micro SD card. The choices are as follows:STANDALONE OPERATIONFor local operation, connect a HDMI display and USB keyboard & mouse to form a complete manually operated system with maximum control and flexibility. The standalone system also supports file sharing with other computers through your wireless network. The OS for the standalone system uses the Raspbian version of Debian Linux. Also included is the latest version of the popular open-source 'Printrun' printer control software.WIRELESS REMOTE CONTROLThe SD card is pre-loaded with the latest version of 'OctoPi' which is built specifically for the Raspberry Pi SBC allowing multi-node printer control. Please visithttps://octoprint.org/download/ for more information.The Abbycus 2020 is not an idea or a proof of concept. This printer is fully developed, tested, and functional. These printers have been running daily in our shop as a production workhorse since November of 2016 and have undergone numerous improvements.The design has proven itself to be robust, accurate, fast, and reliable. We are now prepared to offer this industrial level 3D FDM printer at a very competitive price here on KickStarter.Funds from KickStarter backers goes toward the following:TODO list:","Due to the complete and proven state of our design, we do not anticipate any significant risks. Anticipated challenges will be in purchasing quantities of materials, developing the manufacturing process, and creating high quality user documentation.",https://www.kickstarter.com/projects/983605709/abbycus-v-series-essential-power-for-the-raspberry-pi?ref=discovery_category_newest,983605709/abbycus-v-series-essential-power-for-the-raspberry-pi,"The Abbycus V series are high quality no-compromise power regulators and parametric measurement tools designed for the Raspberry Pi family of single board computers. The V series was designed primarily for the newly released Raspberry Pi-4 (https://www.raspberrypi.org/products/raspberry-pi-4-model-b/specifications/ ) but is applicable to the Raspberry Pi-3 family as well.The primary purpose of the V series is to generate stable and accurate power from low cost - poorly regulated external power sources such as generic AC adapters (phone chargers), LED strip power supplies, etc. The V series also supports battery sources of different configurations and chemistry types such as lithium or lead-acid (V12 model).What is Essential about having quality power? Computers and their attached peripheral devices have a low tolerance for inaccuracy, noise, and sudden voltage changes. It is essential to use a stable voltage source to prevent unpredictable behavior.There are two models of the V series that address different needs. Both modules stack directly on top of a Raspberry Pi (any model with the 40 pin GPIO header) and conform to the Raspberry Pi HAT (Hardware Attached on Top) specifications https://github.com/raspberrypi/hats .V12 ModelA brief summary of the V8 & V12 Features:V12 ModelThe Raspberry Pi is an amazing SBC, especially given its low price point, but many users power their Pi with substandard power. Raspberry Pi power supplies tend to be cheap AC adapters (AC to DC power converters) and brick supplies which can be purchased for well under $10. These are OK for their intended purpose (charging phones or powering strips of LED's) but computers and their peripheral devices are sensitive to the quality of power (accuracy, regulation, noise, etc.).Also it's important to note that the current output ofa typical low cost AC adapter is usually much less than stated. The common eBay / Amazon AC adapter shown below is rated for 5V @ 3A. The rating is somewhat true: It can output 5V or it can supply 3A, just not at the same time!The negative effects of low cost external power often results in unstable operation and random system crashes, or in some cases cause hardware damage.The V Power modules integrate a high current, high quality 5V step-down (buck) power regulator that inputs power from an external power source (8V to 28V) and delivers stable 5V power with short circuit, over & under voltage, over temperature, and reverse polarity protection.Power from the 5V regulator is distributed to the Raspberry Pi through the GPIO pins. This makes for a robust connection when the system requires significant current.Consider the Raspberry Pi standard power connector: micro-USB (Pi-3) or USB-C (Pi-4). These two connectors are respectively rated at 1.5A and 3A maximum. In either scenario system power consumption can easily exceed the current capacity of these tiny and fragile connectors.The V12 displays 5 'screens' of parametric data. Each screen is scrolled by pressing the power button (short press).If the system detects an error condition the 'Error' screen will show automatically.System Stats 'Screen'Just after power on, the system will display the first 'System Stats' screen. This displays the input voltage (ExtV), the power applied to the cooling fan (0 - 100%), and the temperature of the embedded sensor (ambient or case temperature) in degrees C.Battery SupportIn battery mode the System Stats screen will display a battery icon showing the relative state of discharge and the actual measured voltage. A low battery warning is displayed and if the battery voltage discharges below a preset threshold (default is 8.4V), a safe power down will occur. The user can customize the thresholds for different battery types.An example of a battery pack is shown below and consists of a 3S configuration (3 series connected Lithium 18650 batteries) with load balancing and charge management.The V12 can easily accommodate other configurations.Power Calc 'Screen'The Power Calc screen displays the voltage present at the output of the embedded 5V regulator, the current measured at the output of the 5V regulator, and power consumption in Watts.CPU Metrics 'Screen'The CPU Metrics screen displays the current state of the Raspberry Pi CPU: Temperature in degrees C, clock speed (in MHz), and the CPU core voltage. These values are acquired from the Raspberry Pi in 2 second intervals.Shown below: CPU Metrics displayed while running a CPU stress test. Note the CPU utilization in the 'HTOP' screen is 100% on all 4 CPU cores. Also note that the RPi-4 in this system is overclocked to 1.75 GHz.Error 'Screen'The error screen is displayed when a fault is detected or when the user scrolls to this screen. Errors can occur due to the following:The user can clear the fault by pressing the power button.The V8 and V12 both provide a method for safe power cycling. Power ON to the Raspberry Pi is initiated by pressing and holding the power button for about 3 seconds (long press). After power is applied the Pi begins booting. The Pi will complete booting after a few seconds but if the Pi fails to boot after a timeout, power will be shutoff. This optional behavior can be easily disabled. Also, power on without the need for the power button can be configured (power is applied to the RPi immediately after the HAT is powered up).Power OFF is accomplished in three ways:If power off is initiated by pressing the power button, both the V8 and V12 will start a shutdown sequence. Power will turn off at the completion of the shutdown to prevent data corruption.On the V12 model, the user is warned of impending power down by flashing the green power LED and posting a warning message on the OLED display. Power shutoff can be aborted by the user.The Raspberry Pi-4 needs a proper cooling solution. Earlier Pi-3 models could generally operate with passive cooling but the Pi-4 consumes more power than its predecessors and cannot perform in real world applications without a proper cooling solution.In both V series versions a quality brushless ball bearing DC fan is mounted to the PCB just above the CPU which provides excellent cooling even during extended full stress conditions. The V12 version employs variable speed fan control using either the embedded temperature sensor or the RPi CPU temperature to reduce operating fan noise at normal temperatures.The V12 uses an embedded Arduino compatible micro-controller to perform its duties. The code was developed using the Arduino IDE and the Arduino project is open source as are the Linux (Python) service scripts (both V8 and V12).The Raspbian OS supports the Arduino IDE so users can program the V series directly from the Pi. It simply requires a USB cable to connect to the mini-USB connector on the V12 PCB.The Arduino project and Python scripts are well documented and are installed on the SD card reward option. The source code is also available on Github https://github.com/ . All dependent libraries are open source and do not require licensing.The Python scripts and service units have been tested on Raspbian (Raspberry Pi version of Debian Linux) but should run on any Linux OS that employs the systemd service manager (Ubuntu, Kodi, Kali, etc.).V12 Model OnlyThe next step is to offer a battery pack add-on which (depending on the application) could run the Pi for many hours allowing mobile operation. The battery pack can also function as a UPS (Uninterruptible Power Supply) providing power for short periods of blackout / brownout.Also under consideration are solar or wind chargers that would offer off-the-grid operation.If the SD card reward option was added, all source code and project development environments are installed. Backers will also receive a link to the Github project that contains the latest source code, project files, and documentation.Thank you for visiting the V series essential power solutions project. The V series have never been offered anywhere and our goal is to move our production-ready product to market. We feel that this campaign will give us good exposure and backer funding will enable volume manufacturing and fund a new business direction.Please help back these new products and if you wish to comment or ask questions please send a note and I will respond quickly.Thank you, John Hoeppner","The Abbycus V series are fully functional production ready designs, bills of materials, multiple suppliers, and documentation. No challenges are expected other than normal logistical issues of volume manufacturing and quality control.Funds from backers will be used to purchase quantities of materials, cost of manufacturing, packaging and shipping."

This is the next evolution in collectibles, and your chance to own a piece of some of the rarest, most important comic books and memorabilia the world has ever known!Comic books have been ""officially"" around since the 1930's. The ""Golden Age"" starts in the 1930's with the introduction of comic books, and especially Superman, and runs until 1956. The ""Silver Age"" begins in 1956 with the introduction of The Flash in ""Showcase #4"" and runs until 1970.The ""Bronze Age"" begins in 1970 with ""Conan"" and runs until about 1986/1987.The ""Modern Age"" begins with the publication of ""Batman: The Dark Knight Returns"" and continues to the present, but we have included the Bronze and Modern Ages in one grouping for convenience.I've collected comic books and memorabilia my whole life. Collecting is more than owning something tangible to me -- it's about the powerful emotions and memories that are generated when a simple ""thing"" carries you back in time and makes you feel good.The idea here is that I'll section (cut!) pages from my collection into small specimens, label them, put them into a sealed holder, and share those with you! I'll take flak from some collectors, but I think this is a great way, possibly the only way,for all of us to get hold of what we otherwise would never have an opportunity to enjoy.To belay the fears voiced by some, I can tell you that the specimens from key Golden Age books are coming from ORPHANED pages and incomplete copies. I'm a collector, and understand the horror that might be generated by the thought of complete copies of these Golden Age treasures being sectioned when so few full copies exist. Again, we will be using single pages, or books that are incomplete, ""No-Grade,"" or 0.1 as determined by the major grading houses when it comes to the following Golden Age books: We will not be sectioning complete copies of Action #1, Detective #27, Superman #1, Batman #1, Captain America Comics #1, or Amazing Fantasy #15.Every item in the Comic Book Time Capsules is authentic, identified, and absolutely iconic. We are re-thinking comic collecting to allow a greater number of people to claim a piece of history without investing millions of dollars.NOTE: The companion book will have full photos of the original items included in the Time Capsules, and the CGC, CBCS, or PGX serial number of any item that had one will also be listed.Each Time Capsule will be a handmade, individually numbered, limited edition. The majority of these specimens come from books and pages that have been encapsulated by the most famous grading houses in the industry, including CGC and CBCS.And take a look at this!This is NOT BATMAN! It's ""The Black Bat!"" There was controversy in 1939 when both companies were going to sue each other over stealing the idea! We have the 1939 first appearance of The Black Bat in-hand!Think about it -- there is a growing gap in the ability for anyone to own key editions of important comics. A copy of Action Comics #1, the first appearance of Superman, recently sold for 3.2 million dollars. The last recorded sale (2010) of a high-grade Detective Comics #27, the first Batman, brought over 1.0 million dollars and is now probably in the same price category as the Action Comics #1. A copy of Amazing Fantasy #15,the first Spiderman, sold for 1.1 million dollars!Seriously, who can afford that? Most collectors simply cannot invest such large sums of cash, making ownership of these items an unrealistic pipe dream. In fact, books of this caliber are rarely offered on the market and a collector might have to wait several years, or even decades, before having an opportunity to bid on one.How many of your friends own any piece or portion of any key Golden Age or Silver Age comic book? How many pieces or portions of these issues do you own?Our solution is to gather specimens from the most important, landmark comics and memorabilia into a single, hand-held collection of the coolest stuff ever created.You won't be ""reading"" the comics in the Time Capsule -- you'll be glorying in the fact that you own a real piece of multiple historicbooks, gathered together in one place! This really is a new take on collecting.There will bethree types of Comic Book Time Capsule:Bronze Age, which will include specimens from 1970 to present,Silver Age, which will include the Bronze Age specimens while adding items back to 1956, andGolden Age, which will include everything from the Bronze and Silver Age Time Capsules while adding specimens back to 1934.Also, we will provide a downloadable electronic companion book that will includephotos, descriptions, and a history of what makes each specimen important in the Time Capsules! This booklet will be half the fun as you learn about the amazing items we're including!It's important to note that there will be variations in each Time Capsule. The specimen sizes will differ from unit to unit because we are hand-sectioning the original items, and positioning of specimens will vary slightly due to being hand placed. Truly, each Time Capsule will be absolutely unique!The Golden Age Comic Book Time Capsules start with a specimen from the first regular monthly comic book, Famous Funnies #1 (1934). Next is a fragment from the most important comic book ever printed: Action Comics #1, the first appearance of Superman!HERE ARE THE ITEMS WE INTEND TO INCLUDE:Here's the reality: Even random, single pages of these rare books can sell for over $1,000 each. Our Time Capsules will make great gifts. If it's not a gift for yourself, you know somebody who will think this is the coolest thing on the market! As I'm fond of saying, if you can't own the whole 'Holy Grail,' wouldn't it be cool to own a piece of it?!Each Time Capsule will be housed in a 4 inch by 6 inch acrylic holder, and we plan on upgrading those holders to thicker, 'meatier' versions if we reach certain goals.Also, we are offering some reward levels with a limited number of reprinted key comic books signed by Superman creator Jerry Siegel or Batman creator Bob Kane, who are now both deceased. These books come with Certificates of Authenticity from Dynamic Forces!1) SHIPPING!!! Shipping will be ADDED after the Kickstarter campaign ends! This is the only way we can avoid charging $100 to everyone for international shipments. We are estimating shipping using United States dimensions for a package of 7-inches x 5-inches x 2-inches and with a weight of 1.2 US pounds. This will be an approximate number!2) If we reach our crowd-funding goal we should be able to acquire enough material to make approximately 5,000 Golden Age units, after which the edition will be discontinued. Fragments From History will NOT make any more of these versions of Time Capsules.Not all items in the Time Capsules will be comic books! There are cool things out there that help us follow and enjoy comic history. We will appeal to movie fans and toy collectors by including a sample of fabric from two 1970's Mego superhero action figure costumes, a specimen from an original 1978 Superman movie souvenir program, and samples from an original 1977 Star Wars comic book!These are some of the items that bring back the best memories of my childhood. I hope that you feel the same way.","As with any project of this type, there are always risks and challenges. After all, cities have burned to the ground and islands have sunk into the sea.It is possible that specimens could be destroyed in some sort of disaster.  However, I already own a majority of the most difficult to acquire specimens, so there is little risk associated with lack of availability for those items. I'm also reducing risk by limiting the number of Time Capsules we will create.The greatest risk comes from the availability of certain extremely rare and costly specimens, specifically Detective Comics #27 and Famous Funnies #1. Also, I plan to make the Time Capsules by hand, and things can always go haywire in a manual process.If support for this project significantly overshoots our goal, we'll look at using a manufacturing house to assist in encasing the specimens.In any case, I feel confident that I can manage the risks and bring you a really cool product.INTERNATIONAL SHIPPING ISSUES:We've been trying to figure out how to make the International shipping process go smoothly. As you may be aware, Kickstarter and Interntional shipping are almost not compatible in the same universe.I intend to be compliant with U.S. customs regulations and will check the box marked ""Other"" on the customs form. The text-box on the form will have ""Kickstarter Pledge Reward"" listed in it. Checking ""Gift"" would not be accurate and could cause us legal problems that might put the entire project at risk. The alternative is to NOT ship internationally, but there are too many of you in other countries interested in our project for us to drop you entirely.Also, there are so many import regulations that there is no way a small startup like us can possibly know or review every rule for every country. The Comic Book Time Capsules will be listed under harmonized tariff code HS 9023.00.00. This code is listed thus: ""Description: Instruments, apparatus and models, designed for demonstrational purposes, unsuitable for other uses, and parts and accessories thereof MFN Duty Rate: Free"". We can't guarantee anything  in any way when it comes to the maze that has been created in shipping internationally. Please be aware of regulations in your own countries!NOTE: We have checked shipping costs around the world and the average to ship overseas, even to Canada, is a little over $100 per package.

We are primarily interested in creating handmade sets of cups for coffee service. Your Kickstarter pledge will help us upgrade our kiln shed and streamline production. Our cups are handmade on the pottery wheel and fired in a reduction gas kiln to approximately 2350ºF. We are constantly running glaze and design tests, reflected in the $10 and $100 reward levels. All cup rewards will have various choices (tbd) of exterior glaze and will be glazed with white food safe glaze on the interior. While microwave or oven use is not necessarily recommended, your cup should withstand either of these no problem, if it breaks you can send it back and receive a replacement for only the price of shipping. ","Production challenges are a given with ceramics, we are confident our timeline for delivery of rewards is realistic.

We have recently begun experimenting in producing graphic tile, this lead us in a way to explore production of ceramic clocks. We recently purchased a digital ceramic decal printer to bring much of our graphic production in house. At the same time we had been working on a standard 9"" dinner plate with a modern shape.One of our core beliefs when creating work is that it should look great but it should also serve a function, so when thinking about creating decorative plates it left us wanting something more. This led to the clock, so we sourced USA made clock movements and began prototyping various designs.The Hexaclock design was an organic variation of our experiments with tile and creating graphic clocks. Having created a mold for regular triangle pyramids we realized that when six regular triangle pyramids are arranged to create a hexagon, the shape naturally divides into the hours of a clock.Why Kickstarter? While we have already begun prototyping and producing some clocks we need this funding to cover the materials and costs associated with ramping up production and creating graphics. As well as creating a new website focused on ceramic clocks.","Ceramic production is full of challenges, which must be why it is so rewarding when everything goes as planned.  Even in the most controlled environments heating a material to upwards of 2000 degrees and irreversibly changing its chemical make up has inherent unpredictability.  We custom mix and control our materials all the way through our process to keep that unpredictability at an acceptable level and we are confident rewards will be delivered in a timely fashion."

Starting more than 15 years ago, he began trading for more than fun. Greg was trading from small to big, to even bigger.Starting with a cell phone, Greg traded from one item to the next, until he finally brought home a 1957 Harley Davidson Hummer Motorcycle with more than $15,000.Another trade also started small and progressed for more than 6 months, including a car and boat, before the final trade was made. Greg ended up with a 2007 Vengeance Motorcycle worth $20,000.In 2012, bartering and trading became more than a hobby. Greg made more money trading that working his full-time job.""I was teaching friends and family to trade when I realized the need for a comprehensive training manual ... I've spent more than 2 years working on this book ... documenting trades ... editing ... re-editing.""The book is written and we need your help getting it published and marketed. After several months of searching, a reputable and well-recommended publishing company has been selected.""I sent the manuscript to several publishers and was thrilled when offers were returned. I realized the book was more than adream. It would become a reality. Unfortunately, the publishers wanted more control than I was willing to give and I wasn't willing to give up my baby.""Self-Publishing became an option when we found Kickstarter and learned how crowdsourcing worked.Printing cost are only a small portion of the expenses, professional editing, marketing, bulk shipping, and more can cost tens of thousands of dollars.But ... the hard part is complete. The book is written. Now it's time to get it printed.Below is are a few pages from different sections of the book.Bartering is nothing new. In fact the barter system predates currency as a medium of exchange.Early humans had few needs and it’s believed they were pack-like, providing for their needs themselves.  They wore and ate what they hunted.  They gathered what they needed.  They were self-sufficient, but as populations increased, they traveled long distances to find food, shelter and other needs, but these groups had little or no interaction with other groups.  Gradually, as more groups formed and grew larger, interaction started. This paved the way for the system of trading for food, clothing and other basic needs. After thousands of years of nomadic life, people began settling down. They started growing plants and keeping farm animals. As cultivation and farming flourished, people started developing other skills too, tool making, carpentry, pottery, weaving, etc.  These goods enabled a system of trade to develop between the groups.  A farmer may trade livestock for woven goods and hunters may trade skins for spears.  With no coins, “money” or other currency, bartering and trading was the only form of commerce and the system flourished worldwide. As people began traveling to sell their goods or services, “trade routes” were established between distant groups and civilizations.Historians estimate this system of trading predates the Egyptian culture by several thousand years.It’s always important to leave little or no room for negotiation, in order to assure a positive transaction. You don’t want to met someone for a trade, only to find out the deal isn’t completed.Being specific allows the details to be worked out in advance, so no questions arise.- Where are you meeting and what time?  - What will each person be driving?- What are you bringing to trade?- What are they trading?- What’s the condition of each item?- Is any money exchanging hands?- Are everyone’s questions answered? This book is the culmination of more than 2 years of work and I look forward to getting it printed, but we need your help.Join us in bringing this book to the public.Join us in creating educationalclass.Join us in creating Bartering and Trading Boot Camps.Join us at the classes and boot camps.Photos, Artwork and Design - $2,500Professional Editing and Proofreading - $1,800Initial Printing 208 Page Book (5000 Copies) - $25,000Marketing and Advertising - $3,000Bulk Shipping and Packaging - $1,700Total Cost - $34,000Miscellaneous expenses and the cost of our first weekend training class brings the total to a little more than $40,000.This is more than a book.

This is a chance for you to help.","The book has already been completed. Of course, small changes are made with each re-reading, but the core is finished. New trades are added and new ideas are included.Professional editing was completed in January and several potential publishers have been identified to complete the printing.With a background in online marketing, Greg has created a website, online store, Amazon account and many other ways to creatively get the book out to people, including and e-book option.The only obstacle remaining is funding.",https://www.kickstarter.com/projects/34451031/hookers-homos-real-estate-and-weed?ref=discovery_category_newest,34451031/hookers-homos-real-estate-and-weed,"Over the last 5-7 years, me and my best friend have recorded hours and hours of our phone calls and conversations.

We have talked to a young computer student and they will handle uploads, website maintenance, and other online issues associated with a podcast.The total cost, with editing, will be around $15K and we will cover half this total. We believe financial support will demonstrate whether or not our podcast would be popular or interesting.If it gets funded, people are interested. If not, then it's back to the drawing board."

We talked about what I was going to do for the day. The three of us seemed quite happy. Feeling quite content I went about my morning's activities.You can imagine my shock upon arriving home, looking outside of the kitchen window to discover that Leftie was missing. I panicked; plain and simple. Rushing out the back door I began an immediate search of the surrounding area.Look, these two socks weren't just an ordinary pair of socks. They weren't your run of the mill Bonds or Target socks. They were my VERY SPECIAL bed companions. The best pair of friends any man can have. They were with me every night. They kept me warm and safe and watched over me as I slept. Without doubt they were closer than a comfort blanket.I've got to tell you...I have not had a good night's sleep since losing Leftie. These past 3 months has impacted me terribly since losing him.Only a week before, on our anniversary, I had taken their photo. How happy the three of us were back then.Each year I have glued a star underneath on their pads to remind us of our time together. Here they are.... They may not look pretty guys but they are MY SOCKS!!! Anyone who owns SPECIAL BED SOCKS will understand my heart.My first thoughts were; who would steal one bed sock. Maybe a jealous neighbour or perhaps a bird. Maybe one of my friends decided to play a joke on me and I would see my beloved Leftie returned by the end of the weekend. But alas, I remained heart broken as Leftie did not return.You can't imagine how terrible it feels when half of you goes missing.Before coming on here I did launch a campaign contacting the local wildlife society to ask their members to watch out for any brightly dressed birdlife or overly padded yellow bird's nests.Here is a poster of my MISSING SOCK Poster I put around my neighbourhood.    A candle lit vigil was held for his return. It was so beautiful. Unbeknownst to me Leftie was greatly loved by the community and his disappearance has been quite tragic.Last week as I looked into the face of Rightie, my lone bed sock, it was if he spoke to me and said. 'I am so lonely. But I think it's time to move on, Neil.Can you make me a new Leftie?'My immediate thoughts were, 'I can't knit'. But then I felt inspiration and strength welling upside me. 'I CAN do this. It shouldn't be too hard', I said to myself.I had read about the man who got help and encouragement to make a potato salad on Kickstarter. How hard would it be to enlist backers to make a new sock. So I got up the courage and here I am.Thank you so much for taking the time to read our story...So, will you now join me in my task to knit Rightie a new Leftie. Your support will give me the strength and joy to attempt this act of love for a lost and dear friend.HOW DO I PLAN TO PULL IT OFF?GOAL 1 - $50. BASIC MATERIALSI have found a self help video about knitting on Youtube. I have a friend who will loan me a pair of knitting needles. Now all I need to buy is the coloured wool.Today, I am very excited we have found a store that has the exact colours to begin the project.The 6 mohair wool colours match Rightie perfectly. I can purchase these for $44.00.GOAL 2 - $110. MATERIALS PLUS 2 LESSONSIf I reach and exceed my first goal of $50 then I will aim for $110.00 which will allow me to buy the materials plus have 2 x 30 minute lessons from a 'professional grannie' knitting tutor.GOAL 3 - $200. MATERIAL, 2 LESSONS AND JANOME COMPUTER KNITTED COTTON 'KITTY CAT' PATCHIf I reach and exceed GOAL 1 and GOAL 2 I will press on for $200 which will not only allow me to purchase the WOOL, have my 2 professional grannie knitting lessons but will also allow me to order a Janome computer sewn cotton Kitty Cat patch for the top of Leftie.Wow...how unreal would that be.GOAL 4 - $400. SOCK THANK YOU PARTY. If I reach and exceed Goal 3 I will press on for $400.00. This will allow me to achieve the above 3 goals plus organize my exciting WELCOME BACK LEFTIE sock party. There will be a Tribute Wall with all the names of the backers who helped me reach my goal. A photo remembrance wall with your socks and Rightie together and plenty of frivolity as we celebrate the return of a beloved friend.GOAL 5 - $520. AGEING PROCESS. If I reach and exceed Goals 1 to 4 then I have located a man who has a machine that will allow ageing to appear on items of clothing without destroying the material. He even makes the little rub balls appear on the toes of the socks.GOAL 6 - $1200. JANOME SEWING MACHINE. If I reach and exceed all my goals and have had our party I will then press on and purchase my own Janome Computer sewing machine. I am not wasteful with funds and this is a very good reconditioned machine. I will be able to make all my own designs and help many friends.GOAL 7 - $5000+. If I get enough backers and fellow bed sock owners to reach this goal I will design and register a memorial webpage dedicated to all those who have lost their best bed sock friends. There will be spaces for photos and memories and web flowers. It will be a lovely place to visit and you can have your memorial plot updated each year.GOAL 8 - $20,000 - $50,000. Do you realize how many people have lost bed socks and posted their grief online? Through my love and memorial sock website I plan to take orders for the making and return of missing bed socks. I have a group of lovely pensioner grannies who would love to knit socks for needy families. This will be an opportunity to give them some money to help support their cost of living. In return those lovely grannies will put a lot of love into knitting some very special friends to be returned to grieving bed sock owners and give them a purpose in life.GOAL 9 - $100,000+ We are going global man. Do you actually realize how much poverty could be reduced and purpose giving to retired grannies and pink ladies. There are millions of people (grannies) out there who would love to knit somebody a sock. You can come on board with this exciting project and bring a little happiness into this world. Help me re-start a lost and almost forgotten cottage craft industry.LET'S WARM THE HEARTS AND FEET OF MANY AROUND THE WORLD WHO HAVE MISSING OR LOST LOVED ONES!","With any project there are risks. I acknowledge this. But I am committed to the knitting. I am a violinist/pianist so I have strong wrists. No problems with R.S.I. or carpal tunnel disorder. I have committed the time to set aside for the knitting so it is completed within 45 days from the closing of the crowdfunding.I have the enthusiasm, desire and drive to see this very important project finished.Most importantly I need a sock for my left foot and I am not prepared to compromise on quality or throw away Rightie just to buy a cheap imitation or dishonour the memory of my good friend. I will work hard to see this project completed and make sure my backers are kept up to date through all the stages of the knitting work.Thank you for your support and looking forward to working with you in collaboration for this very much needed suburban addition.",https://www.kickstarter.com/projects/193483077/haikuart-project?ref=discovery_category_newest,193483077/haikuart-project," Hi everyone. My name is Neil Sweeny.I am a haiku digital artist. HOW DID THIS START?Three weeks ago I joined a Facebook group of amazing people who spurred me on to get my works onto canvass and get them online to let the world know about my HAIKUART. So here I am.HOW DO I PAINT?     People have been asking me how I go about painting my art and writing my poetry to achieve photo realism.     I have always been one of those, pull it apart and find out how it works type guys. If I was asked to build an engine and given a screwdriver and tools I probably would struggle but if the engine was already built I would ask for the proper screwdrivers and tools in order to pull it apart, examine it and then rebuild it to learn how it worked and maybe improve on it. I apply this same philosophy to my HAIKUART.    I take a photograph, my own or free stock photo and then have my computer desaturate it to break it down to a basic outline sketch. My sketch program then analyses the original to give me a digital palette of all the colours needed to reconstruct and paint the image.     With a toolkit of over 1000 brushes, pencils, knives, etc using my iPad I then carefully paint, rebuild and recreate the new image.     I wash it (filters) in layers, add lighting and depth with shadows, compare it to the original and then fine touch any rough lines. It probably takes the same time as a normal artist would take to complete an art canvass. As I am painting I will think about the Haiku poetry that I want to add to complete the imagery.On average a painting plus poetry takes about 3 weeks.WHAT WILL I DO WITH THE FUNDS RAISED?  The initial $7500 goal raised will get my paintings from computer onto canvass and will cover insurance costs and exhibition floor space at 2 shopping centres in Sydney. It will also go partly towards paying costs to have a professional website created to display my art and receive orders.  My second (exceed) goal is $15,000. This would allow me to rent space and run an exhibition of my work at a local gallery and give me the balance of funds required to finish the website.  My third (exceed) goal is $60,000. These funds will see GOALS 1 and 2 achieved and allow me to rent a small art gallery in Sydney where I could work on and exhibit my art all year round. It would also allow me to upgrade my workstation computer, printing facilities and software to produce high quality digital paintings.  My fourth (exceed) goal is $138,000. These funds will see GOALS 1, 2 and 3 achieved and allow me to take my art on tour to America and establish contacts for canvass printing locally.GIVE BACK WHEN YOU ARE GIVEN A 2ND CHANCE...    I think it is important that if you have a talent or gift and have been given a 2nd chance at life that you consider others. More explained on my Facebook page.SOME OF MY HAIKUART.

Neil.","WHAT ARE THE RISKS AND CHALLENGES?FOR ME?I thought about this for a long while. Like any project there are risks and challenges. And for me, it was actually getting enough courage to come onto Kickstarter. There are so many projects on here and will this one stand out amongst all the other worthy and great projects that are registered here? Well, I believe my work shows merit and believe you will see that too.FOR THE BACKERS?There are no risks to you as a backer as the 30 paintings I am offering are already finished. There will be no delays with shipping as you can immediately get a download.Please support my work and help me get my HAIKUART out into the community."
