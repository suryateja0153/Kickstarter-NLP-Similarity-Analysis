https://www.kickstarter.com/projects/3gp/the-bloody-bones-ii-the-healing?ref=discovery_category_newest,3gp/the-bloody-bones-ii-the-healing,"** just a quick note....the video link in our film poster is from our first film ""The Bloody Bones"" NOT a clip for this film. It was not an actaul trailer(we never released an official trailer) rather it was a test for sound and flow etc..** We just thought some video was appropriate.Hello peeps, Welcome to our campaign. My name is Jeramie Sandor. I work at 3 Guy Productions with my partner Eric Hanson and others. We're just a group of people who wanted to achieve what we have great interest in. We've made two feature films and two short films. Our 2nd feature ""Legion of the Scorned"" is being finished up in editing now. We want to make a follow up to our first feature film ""The Bloody Bones"" which we were thankful got made. However, we want the sequel ""The Bloody Bones II: The Healing"" to be everything the first film was not. What do we mean? Well if we're being honest ... our equipment, computers and software, and knowledge have all gotten better. We made technical mistakes and other errors that we don't feel happy about. We didn't try crowdfunding previously. We just did what we could do with the little we had because what we had was a lot of passion. You will help us achieve films that go beyond what we've previously done. You will help us bring a better product forward which is what we strive to do. It's important that we always try to be better at creating.  We need money to cover shooting expenses including: actors, locations, practical fx, production and crew costs, travel, food and hydration(it gets hot lol). I set the goal at $1200 because I feel like the film can get made between this amount and the other funding avenues I've pushed forward with. We made the first film for $5000, but this time around we don't have to start from scratch in regards to cameras and other equipment. Any money we make over our goal will go into improving what we already have, or it will go into getting things to improve in areas where we may not have what we need. We don't intend on just relying on this platform. We will attempt to raise money outside of this avenue(another reason we asked for $1200). That may include any number of methods including other crowdfunding options. In reality $7-$10 grand would make a pretty darn good film, but no need to be greedy. If we don't reach our goal.....we will push on. We've completed four film projects already without any help. We've just decided to reach out for help so we can make a better product as I stated. Our perks will be inclusive in regards to our film. We hope you think our perks are cool. We will strive to make everyone feel as if they didn't/don't waste money on another fruitless project. I've help fund projects as well. I know how it feels to donate to something, and then not get your perk or even know what happens. If you can't help, but are at least interested in what we're trying to do.... that's a win for us too. Check out the film's Facebook page to follow the progress. You can also see what we're up to by taking a look at our websites here and here. If you feel like letting others know ..... that's awesome too.","Obviously there are risks involved in anything that's crowdfunded. We're no different with this project. I can only guarantee that this film will get made, and made to the best of our ability. We will use all resources to achieve a great film. I feel like the only obstacle in our way is a lack of imagination and determination which is not a problem we suffer from. Sure we may not bring in any money or very little, but we will remain committed to the task of making this film.",https://www.kickstarter.com/projects/3gp/dark-threat?ref=discovery_category_newest,3gp/dark-threat,Dark Threat is a feature film that brings an interesting story about Vampires to life. In our world Vampires are referred to as Life Drinkers. They hope to bring their beloved Dark One back from his long slumber. They look for dark souls to turn in hopes those souls will benefit their efforts in awakening the ultimate vampire master. They must deal with an old nemesis of a family to achieve their goals.,"We don't have many risks, to be honest. We've set production to begin shooting in September. The majority of the cast has been cast, and most of our shooting locations have been secured. We've already had one funding campaign prior to this, and have had private investors. We adjusted our budget needs and filming needs to align with the funds we already have and hope to obtain here. This is one reason why this campaign is set so low. we feel this amount is manageable and will allow us to finalize our film."

(Warehouse and Jensen options available.)The Mighty Flea runs off a Lithium (LiFePo4) battery pack with the stamina for at least 2 hours of live playing.The Mighty Flea has a super-efficient, state-of-the-art, Class D power amp, that converts almost all the battery power into sound (instead of heat, like traditional amps do).The Mighty Flea has a carefully designed analogue preamp, with a tone control and an optical limiter, to ensure that the signal from your pickups is perfectly amplified and processed.The Mighty Flea is light and compact. The 32cm square, 20cm deep amplifier, weighs just 6kg and comes with a custom-made, padded shoulder bag so you can take it everywhere.The Mighty Flea is the perfect marriage of old and new technology, effortlessly helping you to sound great, everywhere.With your support I can pay for the tooling and setup costs to have the Mighty Flea cabinets and circuit boards manufactured by my first-class European manufacturing and assembly partners.Internationally renowned gypsy-jazz guitarist Robin Nolan auditions the Mighty FleaThe RRP of The Mighty Flea is 1140€. To celebrate the launch of the Flea, I am offering some special discounts:The Flea and a classic valve amp - side by side comparisonWe will ship The Mighty Flea in March 2017. This allows sufficient time for manufacture of circuit boards and cabinets, final assembly and test. The amplifiers will be sent using FedEx International Economy, a tracked, door-to-door service which typically takes four to six days. We will advise you when your amp has shipped, and supply a tracking number.Customs The amplifiers will ship from Belgium, which means that customers in the EU will not have to pay customs charges. Customers outside the EU may be liable for customs charges, which are their own responsibility. The shipments will  be described as ""electronic goods"" and the value will be the price you paid.VAT McBee Audio Labs (Daniel McBrearty) is not registered for VAT at present.As you can hear in the videos, our working prototype sounds great, and has already impressed the best of the best. The production version that you will receive will be further improved, with the addition of an integrated battery charger. Just plug in the external power supply, like you would with your laptop, and the battery is charged automatically, while you continue to play music.We also plan to use the Kickstarter funds for tooling costs, allowing us to outsource manufacture of the electronics and cabinets to our European partners. This results in better prices and quality.Who am I? My name is Daniel McBrearty.I've had a passion for both music and musical electronicsfor more than 30 years. I started playing jazz saxophone and clarinet when I was about 12. I got my first electronics experience in the Royal Air Force (long ago!), then, in the 1980s, in the British pro-audio industry (including a few years at Soundcraft Electronics). By the late 1990s, I was a freelance audio specialist, and designed mission-critical audio systems for Royal Opera House in London - which have been in continual use for the last 16 years. Now, I use my technical and musical know-how to create tools for today's working musicians.Why am I doing this?My first love is playing music, especially clarinet and saxophone. I love making great audio electronics. I love touring with my band, travelling, playing in little bars and sometimes the street. The Mighty Flea is a product I just need to create! Kickstarter is the perfect way for me to do that.My ValuesAudio technology doesn't have to cost a million to sound like one. My designs are extensively tested on the bench and in use before I release them. I believe in solid engineering practices, and real-world musical testing - not ""magic components"" and hand waving. Above all - I believe in continuous improvement, and in making promises that I am sure I can keep.Hit The StreetI've always loved playing music. Every good musician evolves over time, and you do it by playing with others, in front of people. When I didn't have a gig, I would sometimes play in the street. Even now - if I go on tour with my band, we might still do that. I love the reactions we get, especially in out of the way places that most artists don't go to. Great fun!But - if you want to make your music talk, you must have a great sound. I am mostly a clarinet and sax player, but I also play some guitar, and I often play with guitarists. In the street, we often had a problem. Most battery amps sound bright and tinny, and when the batteries start to go down (often way too soon) they tend to distort horribly.Rocking On BatteriesIn 2015, a local band, Roq Au Vin, asked me to make a replacement for their old Electro Harmonix ""Freedom"" battery amps. They play a lot of outdoor gigs. They had two requirements : the amp had to be small and light enough to carry on a neckstrap, andloud.(They mostly play rock covers.) Straight away I loved the idea, and I spent three days researching. I saw some great possibilities, then I called them and said ""OK, I'll do it"".That was December 2015. Now they are using the amps I designed. They are lighter and louder than their old ones, and the batteries last much longer. They love them! I even designed a battery powered bass guitar amps - it weighs about 8 kg, and sounds pretty good, right down to low E.Jumping With The FleaSo, I decided to refine the design I made for Roq Au Vin, and create a great guitar amp aimed mostly at jazz guitarists. I got my friend Peter Lewis to make the prototype boxes look great, and fitted a top class 10"" speaker. Got some musical pals to try it, and they all love it. Now - I just needed a name. Why ""The Mighty Flea""? It just came to mind - I guess, because it's tiny and ... well ... Mighty!This is how the Rear Panel of the Mighty Flealooks.1.Input Socket.2. Preamp Gain.3. Signal LED indicator. Adjust Preamp Gain (2) until this flashes when you are playing your loudest.4. Clean / Crunch switch.5. Tone Control.

In future, McBee Audio plans to develop a range of add-on modules, for instance, effects units. Right now, you can add a microphone input to your Flea, which allows you (for instance) to use it to amplify vocals as well as your guitar, thanks to the high quality microphone amplifier.

All you have to do is pay shipping to and from Belgium.","I have decades of experience of creating top-quality audio electronics. The Mighty Flea has been thoroughly researched and prototyped, and I am confident that I can deliver. I also have great experience in project engineering - essential to create a product such as this. (We have a cunning plan ...!)One issue is that I don't know (until the Kickstarter appeal runs) what our production quantities will be - I might end up building any number of these amps. But, I have plans in place for a range of possible production volumes. If the volume goes high (above about 50 units) we will most likely plan to deliver in stages, each month from March 2017. You will be kept informed!As with any manufacturing project, some components might be out of stock or on long lead times. I try to avoid single source components in the design, but there are some key areas where that is just not possible. This might delay the project - but they will still be built and delivered. In the end - I promise to keep my backers informed, and to do everything I can to get your amplifier to you on time!",https://www.kickstarter.com/projects/danmcb/mighty-flea-guitar-amp-prototype-two?ref=discovery_category_newest,danmcb/mighty-flea-guitar-amp-prototype-two,"This year I designed a battery powered guitar amplifier, which I call The Mighty Flea. All my guitar playing friendsloved it when I showed it to them.So, I ran a Kickstarter project to raise money to produce the first batch. We got to 25% funding in a few hours, and a prestigious ""Project We Love"" badge - but eventually, not enough people bought and the project did not fund.But, a lot of people were interested, and I got to them. I realised that the idea is still a very good one, it just needs a bit more work.I can make ""The Flea"" an even better amplifier,and that's what I am doing.But I need your help. Building prototype hardware costs money, but, right now, I am not able to meet those costs. (I already spent several thousand to build the existing prototype.)So - I am asking you to help me out with these costs.If you are looking to buy a Mighty Flea amp for yourself (this should be next spring when I am ready to re-launch), the money I receive from you now can be deducted from your payment then.https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mu1JSC0TFyMHere is what I discovered from talking to many guitarists and musicians:1. It's not justa ""jazz amp"". With a microphone channels added,it is a great amp for anyone that plays and sings. (Of course the mic can also work with guitar, or any other instrument).2. For some guitar players (not all!),reverbis really important. They won't buy an amp without it.3. Also, the fact that some other amps have, for instance, a three band tone control, whereas the Flea only has a simple ""Tone"" knob is a factor.4. Cost is really sensitive.5. Some small mechanical things can be improved. ""The Flea"" needs a foot so it can be angled up towards the player, and, if it was just a bit smaller, it could go into a suitcase and fly as ""cabin baggage"".So - what to do? Some people want reverb, some don't, some want a mic ... and they want it all as cheap as possible! (The realities of product design!)If I would put allfeatures that people want in, the amp would be too expensive those who only want the ""bare bones"". But if I don'tadd those features, the amp is not of interest to others.So - I decided to design not one, but threeMighty Fleas.By doing this, I can actually reduce the end cost. How?Let me explain.A lot of the amp's cost is for things that everyone needs. The box, the speaker, batteries, and much of the electronics (power amp, charger, and lots of other stuff.)So, I am re-designing the Flea so that the same basic box can be used with one of three different preamps. Voila, three models of the Mighty Flea.Here they are.1. The Mighty Flea ""Standard""The simplest model. Guitar input, tone control, the ""crunch"" switch, and a volume control.Target price : 745€ (excluding shipping)2. The Mighty Flea ""Deluxe""A single guitar channel - with a great sounding three band EQ, and a high-quality digital reverb.Target price : 799€3. The Mighty Flea ""Dual""A guitar channel and a high-quality microphone input. Guitar channel has everything the ""Deluxe"" has. Mic channel has high quality preamp on XLR connector (for dynamic mics, has switched +20V phantom power for condenser mics like AKG C535EB), tone control and reverb. A balance control adjusts mic/guitar balance. There is also an input for iPod or similar.In short - the works.Target price : 939€All Models Have These Features:Prototypes are essential to the design process. After I design the circuit to make the Flea do what I want it to, I design a printed circuit board (PCB), along with other information needed to build it. I then have to test the design thoroughly to make sure that it is correct.Unfortunately, everything costs a lot more when we make only one piece, for testing. A PCB, for instance, that would cost about 10€ when buying 10 or 20 at a time will cost about 50€ when buying only one. The same applies to metal panels, which also need to be prototyped (to make sure everything will fit together nicely).My rough work plan goes like this:I do do other work sometimes - so this schedule is a rough guide. But I do want to get on with it,and see these prototypes built and working, so I will be pushing ahead - obviously while taking care to do a thorough job.Creating a great product takes time and perseverance! I know from the reactions I have already had, that the Flea has the makings of greatness. It's a question of polishing and perfecting the idea, and that's what this is all about.Please, can you help to make it happen?",I have already done the necessary groundwork towards the second prototype (for instance I already have a battery charger circuit working on the bench). I don't really see any problems about creating the second prototype.

https://www.kickstarter.com/projects/timothysklugh/magick-and-poison?ref=discovery_category_newest,timothysklugh/magick-and-poison,"MY PLAN: I am making a new original stage production based on the edgy fantasy and underlying sinister darkness that is found in the original prose of the Grimm Fairy Tales. The original tales as compiled and retold by Jacob and Wilhelm Grimm were not light and fluffy as many of their modern day conterparts are. There was something bold, striking and often graphic in the original words. Those of us who grew up hearing these versions know how gripping they could be and how awry their morals may seem. This is the goal of my ""Magick & Poison"" stage performance. It is a new fairytale that blends many of the classics into it (be they from Grimm, Aesop, Anderson or Shakespeare), and I intend it to deliver this new tale in the same fashion that kept me tight to my father's side when he read the old Grimm tales to me as a child. I love Disney's versions as much as everyone else, but let's not allow the experience from hearing the old tales disappear. Yes, it will also be family friendly as well. I want the stage production to open in October of 2012 on a local scale and then see how far I can take it.NOTE: The stage production is set around the music work called ""Magick & Poison"" that Icomposed in2009.Prince Charme is soon to marry Briar Rose and happiness is about to fill the land assuring peace and good-will for many years to come, and that is making three foul witches who live on the other side of the forest very angry. Throughout the reign of King Thrushbeard, these three evil spellcasters(Witch Kinder, Witch Vergiften and Witch Ändern) have had to endure this onslaught of lasting serenity that has left their coven sickeningly weak. Yet, with the wedding comes new hope for the witches. What if the witches could use this opportunity to usurp the throne? What if the witches could take over the kingdom without anyone knowing they had? What would they need? The goblins, the fairies, the bride to be,… oh, and the moon. Perhaps, the victors of the story will finally belong to the villians!",,https://www.kickstarter.com/projects/timothysklugh/magick-and-poison-the-musical-phase-1?ref=discovery_category_newest,timothysklugh/magick-and-poison-the-musical-phase-1,"For more information: www.TSKlughStudio.com/mpMagick & Poison” is a new theatreshow project that is part of an initiative to bringexceptional-quality original theatre productions to the Central Ohio entertainment venue. “Magick & Poison” is an original musicalthat celebrates fairytales in the way they were meant to be told, with theglorious wonderment as well as the sinister edginess. “Magick & Poison” contains a new originalstory plot that ties in a cornucopia of legend, nursery rhymes, fairytales and medieval history. Sewn into its main plot are colorful inclusions of the tales ofGrimm Brothers, Shakespeare, Mother Goose, Aesop, Perrault, Basile, Anderson, Carrollandothers. The show is entertaining, whimsical,educational, and filled with music, twists and turns that entertains adults andchildren alike. It is a show thatreminds us how glorious creativity is and what magic can be done by imaginativethought. Also, it is a strong effort tobring back entertainment that the entire family can enjoy together.The “Magick & Poison” show is planned to be performed at places wherestimulation of public interest is needed.Currently, dates are set for the “Magick & Poison” show to beperformed next year at the Northland Performing Arts Center, so that the publicwill see what new growth is taking place in the Northland area of Columbus.I am Timothy S. Klugh, and I have spent years using my creativity to help enhanceand enlighten. For six years, I createdChristmas albums whose profits went directly to charity. For nine years, I have freely composedoriginal music for community theatres in Athens, Columbus, Dublin, Galena,Grove City, Lithopolis, Nelsonville and Westerville in Ohio. Last year, I wrote, composed and produced myfirst theatre show called “Trilogy” which was shown last year and again thisyear in Galloway, Ohio. I am ready to dosomething bigger.“Magick & Poison” is in need of funding for props, paint, materials,costumes and all the things that go into a theatre production. I have already purchased much of the audioand lighting gear myself but some others things are needed there to. This project is non-profit, so any help is hight appreciated.Thank you for your support!A great magic is contained in an enhanted forest in the land of Harmonia. Centuries ago, two witches, Tomislav and Rostislav, came from the underworld to dominate this land forcing the magic of the enchanted forest to do their will. When the kingdom of Fabula was establish, the power in the land was nuetralized, and the enchanted forest would no longer serve anyone. The witches tried to use force to reclaim the land, but King Thrushbeard and his son Prince Charming were too brave and strong to be defeated. The witches needed another strategy.When Prince Charming saves Briar Rose from her endless sleep and decides to marry her, Tomislav and Rostislav finally discover a way to undermine and destroy the kingdom of Fabula. It would be through cunningness, trickery and betrayal.The ""Magick & Poison"" musical spins an original story that weaves into its plot storylines from a cornucopia of classic fairytales, nursery rhymes and other classic prose. From awe-inspiring glory to dark sinister foulness, ""Magick & Poison"" is an adventure that celebrates the tales of folklore that has entertained generations.What was it that made the old tales of the Grimm Brothers, Mother Goose, Homer, Aesop, Hans Christian Anderson, Shakespeare and others so fascinating and intriguing that these stories would be preciously passed from generation to generation? What was it that made these tales so significant? Was it the mysteriousness of them? Their morals? Their wonderment? Or was it something even more that made these particular tales become a staple of literature for hundreds of years.The origins of some folklore come from how news traveled between individuals in days before print was readily available. A significant bit of news would spread around from place to place and, with each retelling, morph into something different. Names would change, events would change, and other particulars would change that would turn the story into something completely different. A king who loses his reign becomes Humpty Dumpty falling from a wall; A queen, her kingdom, and her unfaithful husband become a lady in a garden with silver bells and cockle shells. The black plague becomes a ring around a rose. Other tales of folklore were ways to teach lessons and morals. Little Red Riding Hood teaches not to wander into the woods alone. The Three Little Pigs teaches how to build a proper home. For one reason or another, these tales captured imaginations and were made timeless. They became just as magical to the heart as the magic within their stories. It is as if they were delivered on enchanted wings from some place far within our dreams. Thus, they have been given the name ""fairytales"".Timothy S. Klugh is a music composer and writer who was completely fascinated by fairytales. Also a fan of history, Timothy spent years studying the origins of these classic fables. Having collected some of the oldest preserved versions of the tales, Timothy decided to pay tribute to these legendary stories using his own talents.In 2009, he composed the seventeen movement music work called ""Magick & Poison"" and defined it as a proper soundtrack for Once Upon A Time. This music work appeared as the soundtrack to the Athenian Berean Community Players 2009 stage production of Terry Pratchett's ""Wyrd Sisters"". In 2010, Timothy modified and expanded this music work to become its own album.However, ""Magick & Poison"" did not seem complete yet. The music needed a story to go with it. The story needed to dig deep into the roots of the fairytales and bring out all the mystical charm and sinister darkness that could only be found in the original prose. Timothy would write a completely new story that would intertwine with those old fables. In 2011, Timothy started making a stage musical that would tell this new story using the ""Magick & Poison"" music work as its soundtrack.INDIVIDUAL CHARACTERS(In order of appearance)PIED PIPER …….

When the King decided that it was time for Prince Charming to be trained as a sword fighter, he also had Gregory trained as well. He saw great courage in Prince Charming and knew he would fight valiantly to protect the kingdom. Thrushbeard saw compassion in Gregory, and wanted Gregory to protect and look after Prince Charming throughout his life. When Thrushbeard felt Prince Charming and Gregory were old enough, he bestowed his two battle swords (that the King used in The Crusades) to both of them, that they each would always have one.Gregory would not only sacrifice for Prince Charming, but Gregory would also sacrifice for anyone he cared about.

He came upon the Scilly Islands where he became friends with King Iron Henry (who was formerly known as the Frog Prince.)

When Thrushbeard married King Iron Henry’s daughter Byrel, the king made Thrushbeard king over the eastern isles that he had long protected.King Thrushbeard explored and found other islands that were further into the Ocean. One island called Fabula (which was an enchanted land once part of a sunken continent) was the place where King Thrushbeard built his kingdom, which he called Harmonia.It was not long before King Thrushbeard was being attacked by the witches Tomislav and Rostislav who had ruled to land of Fabula for many centuries.

This project has been developing since 2010 when I was deployed insupport of operation enduring freedom and since that point I have gained awealth of knowledge, support and backing both by my community and by agencieslike wounded warrior project and prestige universities on a national level.Please read through the kickstarter page to find informationsuch as a plan of attack with the funds raised on kickstarter, a business plan andinformation on how your contribution will directly impact the lives andcommunities of our nation’s heroes after funding is complete.Now you may ask how 5,000 dollars will provide all thesethings listed on the business plan and to be truthful, it won’t be possible asthere is hundreds of thousands of dollars needed for an operation of this sizeto happen. What this 5000 dollars will provide is the needed resources tocreate the pilot program which is needed by the grant backers to prove the needand successfulness of this concept.So please read, educate and share this project with friendsand family to make this dream a reality.Thanks. How your contribution will help the farm:Every dollar donated has a use to the farm and the Veterans we will serve. These donations will be used to generate revenue to help continue to grow the program such as the sale of products like eggs and produce.Many people see a donation as a onetime contribution, with our model and business plan, YOUR contribution will be exponentially beneficial in our efforts. Some examples of how YOUR contribution will be utilized are as follows:$25 donated we will be able to fund our crop operation with the needed seed required for the veterans to be able to begin crop education. $50 donated will help the veteran begin working with a small group of animals such as chicks and piglets to begin to learn the required skills needed to care and raise these animals.$100 donated will allow a veteran the ability to start working with livestock such as calves. This donation amount will also be used to provide supplemental feed for pigs and chickens when not on pasture.$200 contribution will create the ability to provide housing such as pens and coops for our smaller animals. For this donation we will be able to also provide feed for up to 100 chickens or 6 pigs for up to two months.$500 donation will provide feed and materials for our larger animals such as calves and cows, goats and other ruminants. These materials will teach the veteran the skills of pen construction, planning and estimating material lists as well as project and farm forecasting. $1000 will allow for construction of needed irrigation systems, needed machinery for crop cultivation as well provide additional resources for the individual veteran such as crisis outreach, mental health evaluations and course materials for the length of time in the program.$2000 will allow for the purchase of materials for an onsite greenhouse which will not only extend the growing and educating times but will allow a veteran the ability to begin personal business growth on individual business ventures. This will act as not only an internship but also a launch pad for the veteran, when ready, to implement personal business plans they had developed throughout the program to become a positive member within the veteran and local business market.       Vets2FarmA place for disabled veterans to heal, farm, grow and give backIn 2011, I returned from combat deployment as a disabled veteran. Since my return, farming has been both my hobby and an answer to dealing with the trauma of the war. I earned an education in animal science and a concentration in dairy science an agricultural business. Caring for animals and growing food is a therapeutic way to address physical and emotional scars while providing food to the community we live in and families that reside in Little Falls, NY. Vets2Farm’s goal is to provide farming therapy to other veterans. We will serve any veteran and their families who have the desire to learn farming or who are farmers who wish to help us give back to the community.About Our Farm:Our15 acre all organic farm currently grows a full array of vegetables and raise chickens and turkeys. Our goal is to raise pork and beef in 2015. With your support our farm goals can be realized.Vets2FarmFarm To Table OperationBusiness PlanExecutive SummaryVets2Farmwill be in a Limited Liability Company with focus both on a nonprofit entitythat will use all aspects for strategic tax avenues as well as providingservices for recently identified veterans that are in need of reintegrationinto society and to become a valuable asset not only to themselves and familybut as an active member within the community the second stage of this operationwill be a for profit in the form of a medium to high end dining establishmentand produce sales location.Keys to SuccessVets2Farm will usepersonal experiences of both owner/ operators as well as proven track record tocreate a need and market niche that will aid in growth of local economy andreestablish a “be local, buy local” mindset. The restaurant portion will usethe prime produce from the farm aspect of the agency that will not only createa second to none experience but will also allow people in the community to feelproud to talk about and to take ownership of both establishments and to feel asif they are helping people at the same time. ProductsVets2Farm will focus onthree different product set focuses: produce production, fine dining experienceand health and welfare improvements for veterans. With these key goals takingpriority in everything we do, positive results are not an option, they are abyproduct, thus creating a positive impact for both those directly andindirectly involved with the operation. The Farm aspect will take place on a200 acre farm in the Herkimer County of Upstate New York that will have livingquarters on site for veterans that are contributing to the farm effort. Throughthe use of the Owner/Operator experience within the Social Services arena andbeing licensed as a Clinical Social Worker, both individualized and grouptherapy sessions will take place on a daily level with no less than one weekbetween group sessions. The second location will be within a twenty mile radiusof the farm which will not only produce a fine dining menu that will drawclientele but will also offer an ale carte deli style Point of Purchaselocation which will allow patrons to enjoy favorite dishes and fresh produceeven if time is limited due to a lunch break or having no time to prepare ameal between coming home from work and a get together at home.MarketVets2Farm have three distinct customers: produce customers, High end diningpatrons and quick serve patrons. Produce customers are looking for freshnessand availability of product which will be a main focus of the operation. Finedining customers are the clients that quality and exclusiveness are the primarydetermining factors of purchase decision not the standard price point approach.These clients are very loyal when they receive what they are in search of andwill allow increase of customer base through word of mouth from these clients.Clients such as these are resistant to forms of advertising and discountmethods of advertising, unlike the standard patron of many establishments inthe area. Although this client base will be smaller compared to other entitiesof the enterprise approach due to the current state of local economy, it isprojected that constant weekly repeat business will help create betterprofitability than other sections of the business. The Quick serve portion ofthe operation will be majority of revenue produced throughout the entireEnterprise. The quick serve will work in two key roles: Direct produce salesand ale a carte sales. The ale a carte section will feature key menu favoritesthat will be displayed in a deli case that allow patrons to purchase by pieceor by pound and can eat in the attached bistro section or take it to go andallow clients to have good food without the wait for when they return to theoffice or home.Management TeamVets2Farm will be leadby the husband and wife team of David and Heather Gevry. David brings a wealthof business, advertising management experience as well as a formal culinary andagricultural educational background with many other skills to the company. Withmajority of his experience being in leadership and marketing management Davidwill use past experience to help develop brand identity and brand image firstand foremost as this is a key loosing factor in many new businesses in the areaand causes many new business failure. The focus of Heather will be both on thepsychological wellbeing of the veterans as well as the mental health of allemployees of the enterprise. Heather will use personal expertise on theunderstanding of the military mindset through the experience she has gainedfrom working with David and other veterans with the transition back intocivilian mindset and lifestyle.Heatherwill also use proven techniques to aid in the recovery from both physical andemotional injury that incurred while serving in a combat zone. Financial PlanVets2Farm has been created to solve a need identified by the owners within thecounty, state and country, where members return from serving overseas are leftto not only identify personal deficiencies but also to pick life back up wherethey were prior to leaving. Key issues that will be addressed is financialindependence, morale and healthcare, employability, and cope ability to thingsthat have changed both to the veteran themselves and to their situation.1.1 ObjectivesVets2Farmhas identified several objectives for the business:1.Become a leader ofindustry of both farm production yield as well Reach the point of sustainableprofitability.2.Create a safe locationthat invites identification and healing both with the mental and physicalhealth of employees and veterans alike.3.Create an icon withinthe culinary industry that displays second to none freshness and culinaryexpertise.1.2 MissionItis the mission of Vets2Farm to provide a place for our nation’s hero’s toregain the tools and skillsets to return from service of country and to be ableto provide for self and family regardless of deficiencies that were obtainedduring service while becoming an important part of the local and nationaleconomy.1.3 Keys to SuccessVets2Farmwill use the following keys to success:1.Veteran health andwelfare above all.2.Providing anincomparable resource that helps the community and team members equally.3.Lead the culinary industryin redefining freshness of product4.Provide outlets forservice members that are forgotten when in traditional physical and mentalhealth wellness programs5.Instill the “For Vets,From Vets” mentality throughout every part of operations. 6.Develop a self-supportingcommunity that requires minimal outside aid.7.Ensuring StandardOperating Procedures are upheld to ensure profitability in all level ofoperations.Vets2Farm will be headquartered in Central New York, withoperations expanding throughout the United States primarily within the vicinityof major military installations.Vets2Farm has been created by a current member of the UnitedStates Army and a 100% combat disabled veteran who has numerous years of servicein both the U.S. Navy and U.S Army. It is this experience that will help createa reintegration program for the men and women that return from service, whichcurrently is neglected by current programs in place. These programs willaddress problems in a systematic, routine method that harbors a sense ofnormalcy and safety for many members that are used to a military lifestyle.Having many Combat Veterans on staff will help our teams not only relate to theservice member in ways that people that have not lived the experience couldrelate and to help develop a trusting relationship which will improve qualityof life. Vets2Farm have identified three main customer groups: Largecorporations within the commutable area; local and county figure heads; andlocal families. The customer segments are distinct enough to be able to targeteach one differently. The industry that Vets2Farm will attract and serve willbe a market that has very little comparable entities. Vets2Farm has identified three different target market segmentswhich they will sell to:Large Corporations This customer group will have the ability and financial standing to take advantageof not only the quick-serve option during lunch breaks and business luncheswith clients and colleagues, but will have the ability to wine and dinepotential clients with the sit down section where potential deals can befinalized or celebrated, office holiday parties will be attended and promotionsand retirements will make the guest of honor not only feel appreciated but willfeel the meal will match the distinguished career they have had.Local and County Figureheads These customers will have an invitation to frequent the establishment and localgovernment will have a designated table permanently on reserve for last minutedinners used for socialization and political events as well. This will help notonly draw these caliber clientele for business events but will also give theman exclusivity and feeling of importance when they have personal agendas suchas birthdays and anniversaries.Local Families This customer group will be the steady flow of business between the quick stopoff to get and support a good cause and a local producer to grabbing a familymeal that displays great taste and hard work in the kitchen for when dinner wasforgotten or a surprise visit from in-laws.Vets2Farm has chosen the three market segments based on the inherentneed for quality craftsmanship in culinary cuisine that is on an upscale levelwhile also being able to provide for everyday purchase capability that willexpand the menu range from majority fast food or take out option. The food service and hospitality industry in the current arena isalmost nonexistent with a small handful of pizza and sandwich shops and fastfood locations. Although there are no real comparable operations in existenceand only a handful of mid-fine dining operations in the area, there is someconcern for initial profitability due to local populations tendency to behesitant for new and change, this will beovercome by persistent marketing and public relations efforts that willundoubtedly draw business and interest.The buying patterns of the different customers are typically basedon these variables:Vets2Farm has a dual competitive edge:Attraction Economic growth potential The value of Vets2Farm milestones isin creating a set ofmeasurable activities that will be achievable goals. The achievement of themilestones will be closely monitored and the assigned person will be heldaccountable for hitting the milestones.Milestones TBA.Management SummaryVets2Farm management team is made up of thehusband and wife team of David and Heather Gevry. David first studied at WestfieldState University where he studied Business Management with concentrations inmarketing as well as Finance with minors in Sociology and Economics, a smallliberal arts school in Western Massachusetts, then later attended ConnecticutCulinary Institute, a small private culinary school, From there David studiedat SUNY Morrisville, and received a dual degree in dairy science andagricultural Business degree. David worked as a leader in the U.S Army where heexceled in his ability to teach and lead troops. After sustaining numerousinjuries in Afghanistan David decided to helping and training service membersin a different way. While being a member of his town zoning board as well asAldermen he continued to improve the local economy by developing programs thathelped city growth and employability percentages. Heatherhas always been in the business of helping and caring for others from her workas a Victim Advocate for Women and Children to her private practice work withinthe LCSW arena, to being a caring mother of five children, Heather has madeother peoples well-being above her own her priority which is why she is theperfect accent to the management team.Playingto their strengths heather will manage the inside portion of the business andmental health care of veterans, while David handles the business operations aswell as the culinary operations while playing part of the healing section in agroup capacity.6.1 Personnel PlanFinancial Plan to follow","As with any  farm, the main obstacles are weather and feed concerns for the animals and vegetables.  Our risks are mitigated through the training received in agriculture school.",https://www.kickstarter.com/projects/37799855/vets2farm-management?ref=discovery_category_newest,37799855/vets2farm-management,"We had another kickstarter and were close to our total goal but fell short so we are just looking for the major hurdle as of now.We need funds in order to incorporate and to get our legal documents in order to become a fully nonprofit agency to continue to work with veterans returning from war. this is important to us becoming sustainable as an organization is due to having grants currently being underwritten on our behalf but must be written to a non profit which we have been working on becoming.I have been providing everything financially out of my pocket from day one and without having the nonprofit, I will no longer be able to do so.We are working on the reintegration of veterans from the traumatic experience of combat and giving them the tools to become farmers and provide for themselves and their families.",The risks are minimal and we have been working through them over the past year.

https://www.kickstarter.com/projects/silentmayhempro/hell-bringers?ref=discovery_category_newest,silentmayhempro/hell-bringers,"The premise, without giving away too much, involves a team of three that spawn for a need of vengeance and plaguing horror on the future damned souls that will eventually burn in hell. They, while although evil to its truest form, are lead by a historical warrior leader of the past. The other two I refer to are both demons. Cain is the hulkish brute and the muscle. He is also the master of murder. The woman cries blood with every soul she sends to hell. Her name is Lilith. They have, as expected, theological backdrop stories. I am a firm believer of a series having to have in-depth bad guys. I expect you will love the way I do my research and then bring it to comic form. I chose this as my first creation because I feel they are all characters I can form with so much freedom. It is something I've been wanting to do for a long time.""He brings demons to a knife fight."" An ancient warrior king from the historical past of pagan civilization competes in a blood sport tournament in hell the gain audience with Satan. At this audience, Satan grants the old king one wish but in return he must serve him for a 100 years as a HellBringer.  A HellBringer is a damned soul with a conscience. Someone with enough heart and emotional being to sense right from wrong... No matter what personal ties,  religion, or law was  being forced into his brain all his life. He tells him he chooses him for this reason, with proof that the tournament victory would only verify the prophecy of the first one who could lead the HellBringers. Their first master. Who is they you might ask? The demons. The list of demons is vast and their knowledge is known via the internet for different kinds of spirits, beings, and powers. But what if this evil or mischievous foul play was used and controlled. What if they were controlled. Satan then gives both the Ring of the Damned and the Ring of the Omega to our warrior king. He gives him a garb if armor embedded with an amulet that is linked to his mind. He can control the portals of hell, as well as portals to other realms, and can bring any demon he chooses to the fold on Earth or any realm. Our warrior leader does not have a name, yet.  The two main demons of the team are Cain (master of murder) and Lilith which is the most terrifying bitch to ever be known. Cain has brute strength and Lilith has guns and cries blood with every soul she send to hell. Read a reference on wiki if you'd like. She is the stealer of souls, mostly children... So she'll have the darkest most messed up past I would think. As you can tell her white gown gets quite messy. All other demons and their powers are available as well. They are going to be used to fight off evil, where ever it may be. The souls they bring to hell and the level of evil of the soul is the key to what Satan is up to. Once he has attained enough of the evil he plans to create an abomination so destructive it will bring down even the gates of heaven. Eventually there will be scenes where our warrior king, who also can exist as an ordinary man in our world with ordinary clothes before battles, will be in a park doing the whole single man in a park routine looking all serious, and he will eventually talk to a homeless man. A homeless man with a beard, a homeless man who is skinny, long hair, middle eastern, maybe born in Nazareth in another lifetime. Our hero won't know who he is talking to and will think he is just a bum. He never heard of Jesus in his time. That's why he was in hell. Ignorance.  The conversation switches to religion on occasion when Bum Jesus shows up. And when it does, the hatred of God is very evident in our hero. Everything was taken from him... Even his life.  (Our hero might be Attila the Hun aka the scourge of god) eventually Bum Jesus will try to convince him of his wrong doings by lessons, and with each one Attila becomes more of a lighter and nicer character. More of a hero than anti hero. Bum Jesus will never be called by name and the reader will just have to assume it's him.  I'll paint it to where that will be the reader's first thought.  All bad guys are monsters, mobsters, cops, priests, biker gangs, witch circles, vampire lairs, aliens, and they will all have sweet backdrop stories. I love villains so that should be easy. I am surrounded by villainous people on a daily basis and I want it to show the everyday evils in human souls as well.  Let me know what you think. I know it's ambitious.-Mark .",Biggest risk is someone not liking it.

I barely didn't get funded for the first set early in the year, but I took the game on the road and sold out in every city I went to! I am professional comic artist and publisher, Mark May. We have combined and collected the best comic artists in the world to help with the art for Set 2! Artists include Nei Ruffino, Chad Hardin, Rich Bonk, Ben Bishop, Michael Mastermaker, Russ Casseday, Jim Hanna, Ed Smith, Chris Giarrusso,Victor Saenz, Joe Orsak, Joe Becker, Ben Naughton, Brad Voth, Rick Lozano, Sara Frazetta, Anthony Delaney, Alfred T-Virus Trujillo, Cara Nicole, Mike Hoffman, Mclain McGuire, and Mark May.How to playWhat you need:Two dice, a paper pad, and something to write with to keep track of Health Points (HP), and of course the 52 card deck. The cards themselves have SILVER FOIL on the front to enhance the art if you buy the collectors foil deck. The paper deck is recommended for game play by the collectors.Basics:The game is played by rolling the dice and using the roll amounts to determine an attack on your opponent. Each card has 6 stat categories and the combined total of the stat categories make up a character’s total Health Points (HP). Each stat category has an attack amount and the attack is subtracted from the opponent’s character’s total HP until it reaches zero in which case the opponent is defeated.The Backstory for Set 1""HellBringers""In the beginning there was darkness, all-encompassing, complete darkness. A black hole that hungered to consume everything. This darkness is called Demogargono. But there was also light, glimmering and blinding, known to man as God. Existing separate from each other until by chance, or fate, they collided stealing energy from each other creating a new existence. Life blossomed, evolved, and thrived. Like two sides of a coin the light and dark coexisted and influenced man. As time went by the light created Hell as a means to quarantine evil caused by the darkness. Lucifer’s fight with God and his ultimate exile resulted in his right to rule Hell.Lucifer enjoyed his rule for a millennia until he started to sense the rise in darkness and the existence of Demogargono. After having visions of Demogargono he experienced fear for the first time and left the Golden Bastille in Hell to go into hiding. With his absences many saw the opportunity to seize the power of Hell and three factions were formed. The Order of the Devil lead by Belial, seeks to preserve Lucifer’s rule for his eventual return, maintaining the power structures as they are. The Council of Hate consists of the armies and legions of hell, military class demons, ruled by Beelzebub. The Council of Hate seeks to bring order to the chaos of Hell no matter the cost, but they also want to destroy Lucifer’s legacy and shift the balance of power. The Horde are the embodiment of chaos and pandemonium. They are ruthless, mindless demons who want to overrun Hell and destroy everything in their path. Astaroth is the only one that can control them and keep their bedlam at bay. Baal, a powerful sorcerer, and second in command of the Horde, turns on Astaroth and casts a spell banishing him to another dimension.Lilith, the queen of Hell and estranged wife of Lucifer, senses that Astaroth has vanished and she fears the Horde will over run Hell with Baal at the helm. She finds Baal and challenges him to a battle to the death and wins. By doing so she left the Horde with no leaders, in turn granting them greater power and increasing Demogargono’s grip on the world. Lilith could travel through dimensions but she could not sense or locate Astaroth from Baal's spell. In that moment, Demogargono’s presence strengthened and Lilith is seized by the same visions that Lucifer suffered. In effort to preserve Hell and stop Demogargano from destroying everything, she forms the HellBringers. They are a rag tag group of demons, men, creatures, mercenaries, wizards, cyborgs, and the most bad ass pug ever. They are tasked with stopping Demogargano and raising a little hell along the way. (The story continues in HelllBringers #0, which can be found in the Art of Mark May Volume 1)The Backstory for Set 2""Out of the Ashes""With Demogargono defeated the remaining factions of Hell seek a ruler to pull them together as one and stop the all out chaos and wars across every one of the realms of Hell. The Deceiver of all the deceivers is all too happy to answer the calling, and he's not just gaining allies but stealing the HellBringers allies as well. Octto Von Wolfinwings has found the black poision left from the ashes of the now defeated Demogargono. He finds a way to inject the black power in his veins.Lilith's worst fears happen as she becomes her worst nightmare becoming feral and back to her demon form leaving the HellBringers without direction and a leader. A new leader of the HellBringers will rise. The explanation for how tortured and damned souls have become free from their chains and how cryptocreatures came to exist is now explained in this set. Heroes will become villains, villains will become anti- heroes, and with Lucifer still in hiding, anything can happen and everyone wants the seize power for the realms of Hell, themselves. Rules for HellBringers Set 2 "" Out of the Ashes "" :Rules for HellBringers:There are two ways to play HellBringers with a deck. Survivor Series or Gauntlet mode.First take out any card with a 666 or 333 attached to it and put it in separate pile for later.Survivor Series mode: 2 players draw 6 cards a piece. One each until 6 are laid out. They then use 2 dice to roll and determine how much an attack has taken of their opponents HP (Health Points). Overall HP is determined by the combined total of the stat categories on the back of the card. The attack is subtracted from that total number until it reaches zero in which case the opponent is defeated. A notepad is suggested to keep up with HP and attack subtractions. In Survivor Series mode you face off 6 vs. 6 and you can choose to attack anyone in the deck for your turn. Once the card for the opponent is eliminated he goes into a defeated card pile. This continues until the player has defeated all of his opponent’s cards. The player then gets to revive any fallen cards he may have endured as well as the opponent’s cards and choose any 6 out of them to proceed forward to fight Octto Von Wolfinwings. However, before you do that you must first draw a weapon card from the deck of the weapons cards. Weapons cards act as multipliers for attacks which you will need against Octto Von Wolfinwings who will vastly out number you in HP. You also now get your 7th member of your team to help you defeat Octto Von Wolfinwings. This is where you will draw a card to see what 666 Demi-God character you will recieve. Make sure to shuffle first and don't look. These cards feature different results. Dr. Oppenheimer, Demon Form Lilith, Zeus, and The Dragon Tirigith all have 666 in one stat category making their total HP brought to the group a welcome asset and required in order to defeat Octto Von Wolfinwings who can not only use his 666 categories for attack but also his 333 to steal your character to fight for him each turn.The game can be played by two people or by yourself battling yourself to see who goes to fight Octto Von Wolfinwings.Gauntlet Mode:In Run the Gauntlet mode the gameplay of HellBringers is the same except that when you and your opponent draw your first cards you instantly battle them. When the opponent’s card is defeated you will then put that card in a separate pile for later. The player then keeps the card with the battle damage of HP that was suffered from the battle. The opponent then draws another card and the battle damaged card from before fights that card. Both players get 6 cards in total and they battle this way until no cards are left for the opponent. The player then chooses 6 cards from his pile and the defeated pile to fight Octto Von Wolinwings and the rules are the same as Survivor Series for the final battle. See above.Rolling Doubles:1’s Into the Snakes Eyes : Instant kill2’s Double Deuces: Draw Joker Card, blindly.3’s The Tribus – Attack is 3 times what you roll for the next attack roll.4’s The Four Highwaymen Cometh – Choose a card from the deck to help you attack for the rest of the battle. This card cannot be attacked by opponent and will be put back in deck after battle. Do not get to keep for future battles.5’s The Five have Risen – Gain back ALL HP6’s One More to Summon Him – Roll again , If you can roll a 6 on either dice than you summon Octto Von Wolfinwings to fight for you for the rest of the battle against enemies current card.Stat Categories:Evil WithinMagicDurabilityStrengthFighting AbilityIntelligenceAll categories are added up for total HP of any character.The GameHellBringers is a card game stemming from the HellBringers first appearance in comics back in 2015 which can be found in the ""The Art of Mark May Volume 1"". Since then the universe has grown to not only include a wide range of intriguing and powerful characters. The villains are what make HellBringers unique. Set in deep culture and a plethora of mythologies from around the world, HellBringers brings characters from all walks of existence.Rules for HellBringers Set 1 ""HellBringers"" :There are two ways to play HellBringers with a deck.

The player then gets to revive any fallen cards he may have endured as well as the opponent’s cards and choose any 6 out of them to proceed forward to fight Demogargano. However, before you do that you must first draw a weapon card from the deck of the weapons cards. Weapons cards act as multipliers for attacks which you will need against Demogargano who will vastly out number you in HP. You also now get your 7th member of your team to help you defeat Demogargano. This is where you will roll one dice. If you get a 1 you get the “Bum Jesus” card, if you get a 2 you get the Norgren card, if you get a 3 or 4 you get Attila, and finally, if you get a 5 or 6 you get Astaroth. These cards feature different results. Norgren, Attila, and Astaroth all have 666 in one stat category making their total HP brought to the group a welcome asset and required in order to defeat Demogargano as he has 3 over 666 categories. Bum Jesus who you will receive if you roll a one has a 000 stat category making him able to sacrifice himself in order to defeat Demogargano without even rolling the dice.

Even then I still made the cards anyways, traveling the country selling out at each show I went to state to state.  The value on the cards rose from week to week on eBay.  That's when we knew we had a hit and we were not going to wait to start the next set. So here we are...  The moment we have all been waiting for. I brought together 20 artists... some returning and some new ones.  All superstars from the comic world. I did it for you.  A game with great easy to learn rules that you play with with dice and paper.  Easy.  Fun.  Drink and play by yourself or your friends.  I know a lot of people collect them to display as well as the art is indeed, amazing.   It was a pleasure doing this again.  Bringing together the artists.  Making new rules.  New Characters.  It fills my heart more than anything in the world. Our goal is December 2019 for shipping."

When I moved back to South Africa, I began living my dream by starting an International Fire performance community called Gooi The Poi. My vision is to connect performers to event companies and venues desiring a bright and unique show. I am moving to Boulder Colorado where they have a vibrant street performance community that is organized by the city itself. The main street, Pearl, has month to month spots that entertainers can reserve but certain performers need insurance, especially fire performers. I can get a basic insurance anywhere from $250 annual that should cover me for Boulder. A standard international fire insurance can run up to $1000. I would also like to get fire insurance for Gooi the Poi so an entire group of use can be covered when doing any events. We desire to be the best and most responsible fire dancers we can for the safety and entertainment of everyone!Dancing with fire is life changing, this amazing energy flowing around your being.. It allows us to create, this is our art. We hope to dazzle you!If you have any advice on getting through this process as quickly as possible, please share!! Thank you everyone! I am so excited and ready to light up this world in beautiful ways! LOVE to all!Roxanne","The main obstacle I see in the future is time, summer is here and now is the time to be on the streets or working gigs.  I want to do things the right way so I am hoping to get this Insurance project checked off the list so I can live my passion and dream. Also,  I am quite low on equipment so I want to use a percentage of the money made street performing to make my own durable sets of fire poi.  I also want to continue prototyping poi sets to eventually create some unique heavy duty fire equipment for entertainers.",https://www.kickstarter.com/projects/1366962532/fire-dancer-desires-to-be-street-performer-in-boul?ref=discovery_category_newest,1366962532/fire-dancer-desires-to-be-street-performer-in-boul,"For years, I have had a dream of making a living doing street performance. I had no idea what that was going to look like but now everything is coming together!!I started playing with fire poi about 4 years ago when my grandfather bought me my first set in Cape Town South Africa. I was so inspired by all the beautiful talent that I decided I wanted Poi to become one of my lifelong pursuits. After a graduated college, I moved back to South Africa and started Gooi The Poi, an international poi community. I pulled together a crew and we started performing around the city, from parties to weddings. We made all our own gear and even started making them for our friends, because it was hard finding a good quality set. I have visions one day of expanding the community and making a beautiful line of fire performance products. Until then, I want to connect performers around the world with events so passionate artists can make a living doing what they love!I have finally moved to Boulder Colorado where I can LEGALLY street perform and even make tips. There is an amazing performance community off Pearl Street and I know I can bring something unique to the array of talent. I also want more time to practice this art and become more skilled everyday!The majority of the backing funds will go towards FIRE INSURANCE! There is a lot of risk and danger involved and I want everyone to be totally safe and covered!Its going to cost about $250 for fire insurance through next April with S.I.A, Specialty Insurance agency. This will cover :Each Occurrence:	$3,000,000	(bodily injury & property damage to others)Damage to Rental Premises:	$300,000	to rented premisesPersonal & Advertising Injury:	$3,000,000	hurting someone's feelingsGeneral Aggregate:	$5,000,000	(the most the policy will pay out during the policy year)Products - Completed Op.

https://www.kickstarter.com/projects/989907466/movement-matters?ref=discovery_category_newest,989907466/movement-matters,"Movement Matters exists to investigate ""work at the intersection of dance, movement and performance art, politics, policy and issues related to the body."" Movement Matters as a project encompasses a biweekly column, a series of symposiums and live performances, and these last two we work with Storyography videographer Justin Williams to shoot documentary HD video, which are adapted into the webisodes we're releasing with Open TV. This Kickstarter is to fund just the most basic, essential fees we need to cover that videography work at a $200/per half-day rate, editing, post-production and etc. Ideally, we'd like to see this 250% funded, but realistically, we're used to eating the ramen.Movement Matters closes a feedback loop that begins with the columns and ends with the choreographed social interaction of the performances; that starts with that of the interviewer, listening to a subject recount their experience and speaking their mind, whom then takes that and represents it to the public as a new experience or intervention on their experience. Ultimately, the goal is to foster actual social movements by engaging audiences across boundaries including, for instance, poverty lines, demographics of gender and sexual difference, or the famous color lines of north-south racial divisions in Chicago. These are all subjects that have come up in the course of developing Movement Matters, and part of the current pool of ""social actions"" we're organizing around; right now we're just getting started but these are the long-term goals.Movement as an art form is a relatively new idea, but it's also the fundamental subject of modernity, par excellence. When Descartes founded modernity with his description of the res cogito and res extensa, the res extensa was indicative of an extension of the body into space. And as dance scholar Andre Lepecki points out, choreography was an ""invention of early modernity as a technology that creates a body disciplined to move according to commands of writing."" Choreography is literally a kind of inscribing with the body onto the world, but it has so far been kept outside the sphere of participatory practice, of its obvious application in social practice in the best sense of it as derived from the historic avant-garde. Until modernity, dance wasn't about movement, it was about evocations of the divine or the unseen world in some sense, until it progressed through the work of practitioners such as Isadora Duncan, into modernity, when it became centrally concerned with progress--with movement--and dance began to evoke this notion of how we ""move"" through the world and form our sense of self in relation to it. That process of becoming a subject, of becoming a person we form as expressed through our interactions with others in the world, and then taking that interaction and employing it as an artistic material no different from paint or film, is the central concern of Movement Matters. And that's also fundamentally about addressing socio-political dynamics, as the scholar Randy Martin points out when he wrote that ""theories of politics are full of ideas, but they have been less successful in articulating how the concrete labor of participation necessary to execute those ideas is gathered through the movement of bodies in social time and space. Politics goes nowhere without movement."" So, what's critical about this is how there's an effort out there in the world to limit and therefore narrowly define the diversity of the kinds of bodies that are represented in our media, by our institutions and in a whole range of other ways. In some cases, this is motivated by white supremacy, or misogyny, or classism, ableism, what have you. And that's an ongoing process, this push and pull to define the ways in which we are allowed to think about ourselves, through this process of othering and imposing hierarchies of superiority and inferiority. So, movement matters because it's the critical substrate of how we define ourselves as human beings that touch on all these divisions and which we can actually do something about if we want to, using art to do it. We hope you will support our efforts through Movement Matters to help make these changes.","We are prepared to fund this personally out of pocket. However, this would reduce the capacity to produce the series we hope to present.",https://www.kickstarter.com/projects/989907466/bridge-magazine-relaunch?ref=discovery_category_newest,989907466/bridge-magazine-relaunch,"MISSION STATEMENT: ""The original goals of Bridge in the late 1990s emerged from the bedrock notion of interdisciplnarity, of a need to recognize interdependence of art across the disciplines, and to think and combine them where appropriate; we feel this concept has further evolved over the decades. The simple belief behind Bridge is that separate fields of inquiry can and should be thought of as having shared, intersectional horizons. Today, every existing worldview, whether scientific, philosophic, aesthetic, political, or literary must acknowledge its limits or risk being defined as obsolete, unachievable, and incoherent.""Bridge began just one year prior to the aughts and published roughly 15 editions, with fiction, poetry, essays and more. It was wildly successful, publishing previously unreleased art, literature, interviews, poetry, news and essays from a diverse list of names such as Kurt Vonnegut, Aleksander Hemon, Wislawa Szymborska, Christo and Jeanne-Claude, Catherine Opie, Tristan Tzara, David Cronenberg, and on and on. It won a Pushcart prize, published legions of firsts, and helped define new avante (and arriere) garde standards of art and art-making. Now, with a small, committed core group, we are working to relaunch Bridge. We are thinking to have more than one editor per subject area, which at the moment includes Art, Literature, Music, Politics, Cult Crit, Film, Architecture, Design, Performance & Dance, Poetry. These editors will hand things off as needed. Our goal is to publish a printed broadsheet in the tradition of the vanguard pamphlets of previous eras--from Tzara's Litterature magazine to Wyndham Lewis' Blast. What matters most is an uncompromising focus on the art and on art-making that doesn't split the difference with commerce, and of the humanist devotions of this position. We're thinking to publish a few times a year--like before, Bridge will be a ""periodical,"" coming out when there's sufficiently quality material to merit publication--and will also be done as a not-for-profit. While we will fundraise to pay our writers and contributors, editors will serve in a volunteer capacity. Our current goal is to release a new issue in Fall 2017.","$500 is the absolute minimum we need to print a bare-bones single issue, without paying contributors.We know we can do better, however. Our bigger goal is a campaign to raise $7,500, to pay contributors, print a larger magazine and do so 3 times in the coming year. This crowdfunding campaign will cover the cost of design, printing and mailing of subscriber copies. Our larger goal is whatever we make beyond the Kickstarter goal, which will allow us to print more copies, more issues of the magazine in 2017-18, secure barcode materials, ISBN numbers, etc., pay a modest fee to contributors and distribute copies to subscribers. But this effort at a minimum gets the relaunch issue off the ground."

I am introducing my line of custom designed Cutting Boards & fine Writing Instruments.I will update this project with more information weekly.I have been making Custom Cutting boards & Pens for many years now & want to up grade my shop equipment to streamline the processes of making these hand crafted pieces of functional Art.A little about my cutting boards:Every board is assembled using the finest grades of figured lumber & all materials used in making process are 100% food safe. The high strength adhesive used for joining the wood is stronger than the wood itself so no worries about laminated boards coming apart. After boards are planed smooth, they are hand sanded to 400 grit & food safe Butcher block oil is applied in a several coat method then sealed in 100% pure beeswax to protect the finish. With the exception of exotic woods almost all domestic lumber I use is NC Grown & processed. All my cutting boards are made to last a lifetime & only require occasional re-oiling. All cutting boards come with care instructions for proper use.Bartop boards are 6"" x 8""Standard Boards are 10"" x 12""Custom sizes are also available.A little about my pens:The conceptualization for these fine writing instruments emerged over 10 years ago. Since then I have worked hard towards creating a product that I believe to be the finest wood-turned pen available. Currently, I am offering several options of my most popular line of pens. This post will serve as a pre-sale for these pens.Every pen is hand crafted by me in my shop. No two pens will ever be the same as every wood used has its own distinct color, figure & grain patterns. The blanks I use are obtained from select domestic sources & from Exotic wood distributors from all over the world. Only the best blanks ever make it into one of my pens.I actually hand sand & polish every piece from a Very coarse 150 grit, 180, 240, 320, 400, 600 grit then all the way up to a micro polish of 12,000 grit it is a time consuming 15 step process. The pictures do not really show off all the fine details in every piece.The elegant Hand crafted one of a kind shape and classy looks makes these items a Perfect gift! I have many types of exotic woods & can custom make your item in the wood of your choice.  I only use the finest and rarest of exotic woods and burls for the pieces offered and they make wonderful gifts for any occasion including:Christmas, Hanukkah, Anniversaries, Birthdays, Mother's & Father's Day, High School or College Graduations, Bridesmaid or Groomsmen Gifts, Secretary Day, Service Awards, Client Recognition and are an outstanding Business gift for Company Promotions.",The only risk for this project is having more orders than a single person can get done in a short amount of time. I plan to limit quantities to a number that I feel comfortable on being able to process & ship on time or early when project is 100% funded.,https://www.kickstarter.com/projects/ncwoodart/hand-crafted-burl-and-exotic-wood-pens-and-more?ref=discovery_category_newest,ncwoodart/hand-crafted-burl-and-exotic-wood-pens-and-more,"Hello, and thank you for taking a look at my page on Kickstarter.

Why do marriages work? Why do people fall in love? How crazy does love make us, really? Inspired by the works of Patrick Marber and directors like Richard Linklater and Kevin Smith, Weather Men incorporatesmodern y-generation problems with the age-old search of love and direction in an ever demanding, technologically advanced era. With a modest production budget, Weather Men hopes to tackle universal issues with only the most minimal of set pieces. ","I have been a writer for almost a decade now.  Writing for G-Vegas Magazine, Press Record Magazine and collected works through Rebel: Art Magazine.  I have a degree in English from East Carolina University.  Because of my connections to ECU and my years living in the Greenville area, I have found actors and those willing to help Weather Men become a real, living production.  Some of the risks we run are not being able to reach enough people in the area and look legitimate to the people that don't know we are a serious group of theater workers.  With some funding, we plan on advertising through our newspapers and getting the local television news station to do a story on us.

This book will be a companion in many ways to Breeze, working with many of the same themes and stylized stream of consciousness from before. There will be artwork once again to go along with it and there will be chances for those who contribute to be recognized in the book itself in the credits. This Kickstarter will also work as a way to pre-order your copy, but it only works if we reach our goal so please contribute and share as much as possible. As before there'll be a book release show which will be forthcoming when the book is confirmed upon completion.The Frozen Garden is dedicated in loving memory to my father, Chuck, who pushed me and encouraged me in all I did throughout my life.

Mark Brown made the last cover for my book and because his work and friendship continue to be important to me, I would like to continue to give him work so that he might continue his own endeavors.  Reaching this modest goal of $500 will help to pay him as well the printer's fee to get this chapbook off the ground.  The hard part of writing the poems has been long since done and now all that is needed is making the best possible product to hand out to you, the readers.  While not a lot of money, this $500 will ensure the level of quality I got with Where The Breeze will carry over into The Frozen Garden.  Not to forgot this will also help to bring even more printed pieces: posters, prints, etc. Please help by supporting our fundraiser to keep art going in our area of Pitt County and in North Carolina.

Teens saved the US from Russian aggression in the 1980’s filmRed Dawn. Superman showed kids how to fight communism by buying US savings bonds.These classic morality tales from our not to distant past stand in deep contrast to today’s political climate in which the United States is actively cooperating with Russia on global security issues.Were we wrong? Where the Russians simply misunderstood all those years? We decided to dig deep into our archives and go backto the cold war days tosee if all those warnings we had for so many years were just lies...ordid they actually tell a dramatic version of the truth andare still as true today as they were years back?Red Nightmareis a feature length film exploring the propaganda wars fought during the cold war. Many of the American films turned out to be star-studded largely due to the relationship between Hollywood and the Pentagon, taking on their most formidable opponent.. Russia. For decades, we were constantly warned about the dangerous Russians; they were either going to shower us with atomic weapons or take us over. We were bombarded with these messages in movies, songs and TV. It The propaganda wars have changed but the tensions between the United States and Russia have not disappeared. We have spent many years collecting hundreds of films and doing extensive research. Our next step is to interview the men and women who can comment on the cold war. These are actors who appeared in the films and tv shows, writers who have researched the cold war and politicians who fought it. Our nominal $500 will pay for 1 or 2 interviews. Any funds we receive after this will go for additional interviews. If we are lucky and raise a few thousand dollars, we can actually pay our editor to begin cutting the show. If we raise even more, we can pay for music, film rights and more. The key thing is even the smallest donation will make a huge step toward moving this documentary along!A recent Pew Research poll showed over 75% of Americans don't believe that Russia is an adversary to the US.* This is at a time in which Russia is at war with western allies and is modernizing its nuclear weapons. The cold war is still very much alive, but the tools of fighting it have changed. Red Nightmare not only explores the historic cold war battles but also the contemporary cold war and how it is being fought. How many of you have heard of 'Radio Sputnick' that is being played in Kansas City, Kansas? It is a story that many Americans are not aware of.* https://www.people-press.org/2019/07/30/climate-change-and-russia-are-partisan-flashpoints-in-publics-views-of-global-threats/","We have the footage.

Popular demand. We are a family of four. Our annual ""cookie list"" starts with 4 choices per person plus six standards ""for the house."" Do the math. Then add in all the partial batches for particular favorites that didn't make this year's cut, and whatever new one Scott discovered and simply has to try. (Experiments don't count as cheating, you see). Check us out on www.heritagecookies.net!My husband's passion for heritage cookies goes back to when I was nineteen and brought him home for the first time. My mother followed the Czech tradition and made 8 or 10 different cookies each Christmas. He saw that tray and declared, ""This is a Good Thing."" When we began to make our own Christmas, Scott began to explore the world of Czech baking. And then he proceeded to broaden our baking repertoire with 30 years of constant research and testing.There are hundreds - thousands! - of incredible bakers who create new cookies every year, but we are more drawn by the ones with history and stories behind them. I am a first generation immigrant to America, and one of the things you miss are the special treats of your culture and childhood. Those are the ones we wanted: the cookies that immigrants from whatever culture would swoon for when the old flavors showed up. And the emigres from America too. North America has cookie traditions of its own, and we wanted to find those as well. National cookies like Chocolate Chips, and American regional favorites like Snickerdoodles and Buckeyes too!Thirty-[mumble] years later we have a pattern. We make our 2-3 dozen cookies each Christmas. We keep a tithe of each for the family. We get the rest of them out of the house, to friends, family, coworkers, clients, and anyone who's done us a favor over the years. And then we promise, ""Yes, someday we'll write a book..."" We love sharing our cookies. But we also want to keep that promise to our friends, and to share our passion for great, timeless cookies with you and with the rest of the world. As we write this we are planning on 150 recipes or so, the vast majority of which we've already tested and written up. For the rest we are still baking, testing and re-baking. And then we'll have to bake old standards too, to get them professionally photographed. Our photographer, a lovely mother of two charming girls, has been squeezing us in between her professional magazine shoots. We would like to do right by her and make sure she gets paid. Lemon cookies only go so far (Yes Laura, we have discovered your secret!) The same goes for the graphic artist responsible for the book's layout, and for our videographer. There is much more to creating a first class cookbook than having first class recipes.This is where you come in. We have all the material we need to publish a lovely, unique cookbook of classic heritage cookies from all over Europe and the Americas. A book that will capture for your home the wonder, warmth and comfort of home-baked cookies and spice-filled air - the scents of home that our ancestors carried in memory as they moved. It will happen if we meet our goals.When this project is done we hope to issue stretch goals to fund other projects, such as a supplement of variations focused on people with food allergies. No nuts? No dairy? No flour? No problem! We want all of our friends to have cookies that are easy, and elegant, and with a bit of effort, even extravagant.We need your help! Please support our effort to publish a quality cookbook and make it available in all standard formats.Thank you,Kate and Scott Pavelle","Every project takes twice as long as originally planned, and costs twice as much. This is why this kickstarter campaign covers only the professional services we can outsource. We don't need to outsource the baking. Both Scott and I are competent home bakers, and we have a number of chef friends who are not only enthusiastic cookie recipients and reviewers, but who had also given us a word of advice when we needed it. We don't need to outsource the publishing, because both of us are published authors and I have been publishing my our books through my own imprint, Mugen Press. We don't even need to pay for all the butter, nuts and sugar we've gone through over the years. Those are sunk costs we invested out of love.Formatting a genre paranormal book, or even an illustrated anthology, is much easier than doing a good job on graphic design of both the interior and the book cover. For this reason, Chuck Beard, the designer responsible for Pittsburgh Magazine, generously offered to be part of this project. No matter how much better the phone cameras have become, nothing can replace the quality equipment and especially the experienced eye of a professional food photographer. Laura Petrilla shoots lovely images of food for local restaurants as well as food magazines, and she takes stunning portraits of the chefs while she is at it. We are lucky to have her playful creativity.Miranda Pavelle, a professional animator, is our videographer. If you see anything animated, it was she who decided to play. The cookbook will be ready in e-book format this spring. If there are any delays on the e-book delivery, I will let you know. The printed format always takes a bit longer, and we are have our secret internal deadlines to make sure you get the book in your hands well ahead of the book launch party. If you bring it, you can have it autographed by the whole team.Sending out tins of cookies is what we always do, and those of you who donated at a level where you will receive a shipment, your tin will be the same as what we like to send our relatives and friends. Again, in case of unexpected delays, you will be notified. We will send out notices of milestones being met, of bloopers that happened (Hey... did you know that liquid smoke looks just like vanilla when not properly labeled?), and you just might land a surprise cookie story in your inbox. Or a lone, interesting recipe!We will keep in touch.

https://www.kickstarter.com/projects/greyhoundproductions/furniture-world?ref=discovery_category_newest,greyhoundproductions/furniture-world,"StorySYNOPSIS:Furniture World catalogues the life of Karen, an ambitiousemployee at the titular company.As Karen progresses through thecompany's hierarchy, she comes face to face with various challenges, both personal and professional. Herquest to keep Furniture World afloat in an industry valuing online marketplaces instead of in-store experiences leads Karen to sacrificing everything in the pursuit of her American dream. On Karen's journey the companions and colleagues appearing throughout her time at Furniture World make her search for success very real.Ultimately, Furniture Worldis a commentary on the cost of success in the 21st century.A hard sell, right? Why should you care about someone you have never met working in a furniture store? Well, the person sitting next to you has probably worked the retail and sales circuit, we at Greyhound Productions have certainly experienced the retail cynicism, depression, gossiping and miserable nature of this culture, and although Furniture World explores this toxic culture and those trying to escape it, Furniture World focuses primarily on a character obssessed with this cocktail of chaos.Dripping in irony, Karen takes centre stage. Constantly fighting with Brian the assistant manager, over stealing sales and missing commission, before taking it out on Peter at home, then rising to live it all again the next day. The dramatic elements of Furniture World remain uncomfortably close to home throughout the story. The promotions only satisfy this success-hungry sales-woman for so long, Karen starts to question what the point of it all is and turns to whisky and into herself to escape, neither of which help.At it's core Furniture World is a biopic of Karen, constantly attempting to balance both her relationship and work addiction; along the way Karen makes various choices, some of which we recognise and some of which we question. The characters and situations encountered as the story progresses draw us into this dark world of comfortable cotton three-pieces and rude leather recliners. When Karen risks financial and personal destruction to follow her career, we see and feel the consequences on screen.A powerful exploration of retail culture, documenting the consequences of the extreme shift from in store experiences to online sales, this drama will make you think twice before buying that chaise longue you've had your eye on. It's a drama where the consumer and retailer are both consumed.BEHIND THE SCENES:PRODUCTION NOTESPre-Production: In 2019 Greyhound Productions began their pre-production for their 2020 project Furniture World. The project quickly took shape with the script penned earlier that year by Matthew Summer; trailers were developed to give a taste of the Furniture World universe along with a series of interviews.In October 2019, after an intensive few days, shooting finished for the trailer, extended trailer (Furniture World: Her First Day) and interviews.The 1st trailer and interviews will be released when the Kickstarter is launched in January 2020. The extended trailer will be released shortly into the fundraiser to give a further peak into the life of Karen. The feature will be shot and released in 2020.FUNDING NOTESTo bring Furniture World to life we need a minimum of £15,000 to help us finish our film. There are considerable production expenses.

With minimal pre-production this band misfits set out to tell 5 stand alone stories on a shoe-string budget with minimal prep time and maximum sleep deprevation. On the way visiting and working with creatives in Liverpool, Newcastle, Scotland, Worcester and Brighton. The documentary weaves behind the scenes footage, interviews with the actors and crew and finally the short films into 45minutes of filmic chaos. This hilarious insight into short film making in the UK is a must watch for filmmakers everywhere.Day 1: Liverpool - After quarantining together for two weeks we set off on our journey 64 Miles from Shrewsbury to Liverpool to film the first short film “I Don’t Love You Anymore” set predominantly in a bathtub. “I Don’t Love you Anymore” focuses on the end of a relationship, and the arrival of that realisation. Told through voice overs and flashback, featuring two scouse actors.Day 2: Newcastle - 174 mile trip from Liverpool to Newcastle to shoot “Class”- following a couples last motions before they attempt a burglary in Newcastle. Wrapped at 10PM then Drove 122 miles to Loch Clatteringshaw in Scotland to pitch camp ready for the morning to start shooting “A Scottish Tale”Day 3: Dumfries – “A Scottish Tale” based around a campfire a war worn veteran tells the tale of Macbeth to his juniors. After being eaten alive by mosquitos we set off to Worcester, 283 miles away.Day 4: Worcester - After arriving at an Airbnb we shot “Her Last Day”- a teachers final day at school is ruined when her colleagues don’t get her the farewell she deserved. Sleepy yet not unconscious we started towards Brighton.Day 5: Brighton - After 184 miles we filmed our first Sci-Fi, about a father who saves his daughter’s life. Then…exhausted yet victorious, we made the 218 mile trip home to Shrewsbury.120 Hours, 1200 Miles and 5 short films later, we have entered post-production.Day 1: Liverpool - I Don’t Love You AnymoreDay 2: Newcastle - ClassDay 3: Scotland - A Scottish TaleDay 4: Worcester - Her Last DayDay 5: Brighton - SophieTo bring the project to life we need a minimum of £500 to help us finish our documentary and short films.

So all kinds of issues come bubbling to the surface throughout the course of the movie...and at the centre of it all is this girl who's changing and mutating as the virus takes over her body.This is definitely a passion project for the entire cast & crew. We're a small production company from Winnipeg, Manitoba, and we're trying to make a big movie. We've already made 2 short films that take place in the same universe as Rama.Scab tells the story of how Lex met one of her companions:And Pisces introduces another character...as well as the spaceship that plays a big role in Rama:So after making these 2 short films, we're ready to take on something a little bigger. And that's where we're gonna need some help. In order to make a film like this, we need costumes, props & sets.We want to film as much of this movie as we can in camera. We want it to look and feel like a real, lived in world. And in order to do that, we've got to make a lot of this stuff for real. And costumes, props & sets cost money.And that's where you come in. We're trying to raise the money to get this project off the ground, and every little bit helps.If you don't have any money, feel free to spread the word about this project!At just 14 years of age, Meredith has already racked up more acting credits than most actors twice her age. She's strong and wise beyond her years, and is the perfect person to lead this cast of all-star actors.Corey's a boss. He's handsome, smart, and funny, and he is truly dedicated to his craft. Corey provides the perfect compliment to Meredith in this film.Walker is a machine, and that's perfect, because he plays a mechanic in Rama. He's cool, calm & collected, and he's an essential member of this cast.Paul's been making movies since the 7th grade, and has been doing it professionally for the last 10 years. After finishing 2 sci-fi shorts (Scab & Pisces), Paul is excited to sink his teeth into a sci-fi feature.Andrew is absolutely a master of light & lenses. He was the cinematographer for Scab & Pisces, and he's looking forward to expanding on the style he established in those films in Rama.Erik is a master of models & sets. He built all the spaceships & sets in Pisces, and he's the best person to be heading up the Production Design for Rama.Emily is an absolute genius. She was the Key Makeup Artist for Pisces, and she's psyched to get to work on Rama!Joe is a maestro of music. He composed the soundtrack to Pisces, and is the perfect person to work on the score for Rama!Principal photography begins in October 2018, which gives us just a few months to get the cast assembled, sets built, and locations locked. It's a tight timeline, but it also means that we can start churning out results right away. We want to keep our audience in the loop as we go through casting & set construction, as well as camera & effects tests. That means vlogs, pictures, events, etc. Anything and everything to keep people interested and engaged as they go on this journey with us.Our second round of filming is in March 2019, where we film the opening of the movie in a winter landscape. That will give us a few months between sections, giving us time to build new sets, props, etc. By then the cast & crew should be a well-oiled machine, and we can make the beginning of this film as eye-popping and dynamic as possible.And our final round of filming will be in June 2019, where we film the end of the movie in lush green fields & forests. We leave this section for the end to give us the maximum amount of time to explore this world through our sets, characters & visual style. The end of the film will be the culmination of all the work we've done up to that point, giving us the experience needed to help us end on a high note!The 3 seasons of filming will give us more time to spread the word about this film, and gather a larger audience as we move through production. That way we have a built-in audience for the finished film as we head towards marketing & distribution.","About 2/3 of this film will be shot outdoors in rugged environments.

So that means that we have to go out into less than favourable conditions to make this movie. But bad weather is just another obstacle in our path. It may slow us down, but it won't stop us.

I also happen to be a filmmaker, and I've always wanted to know more about who the Mennonites are. Where do we come from?I know that my ancestors trace their roots back to the Netherlands in the 1500s, but a lot of other Mennonites trace their roots back to Switzerland. And over the last 500 years, Mennonites have been migrating to every corner of the earth. Today, there's Mennonites living in Zimbabwe, Indonesia and Bolivia.Why do Mennonites keep moving around? And how did my family get to Canada?I want to find out. So I've decided to go on a journey. I'm gonna retrace the steps of my ancestors, and find out where I came from. And along the way, I'm going to talk to Mennonites from every walk of life. Pastors, Historians, moms, dads, kids. I want to talk to every Mennonite that I can, and hear what they think about being a Mennonite today, in the modern world. How do we fit in?By shedding some light on where we came from, and exploring where we are today, I'm hoping that I can learn a bit more about where we're going to. And not just physically, cause clearly Mennonites are everywhere. But where are we going spiritually? With all of this moving around, what is the unifying thing that makes us all Mennonite? Is it our faith? Is it our shared heritage? Is it our love of pie? What's the idea at the centre of it all? And in today's modern world, is that idea in jeopardy?","It's tough to make any movie, and even tougher to make a travel documentary that takes the audience on a journey across the globe.Dozens of things can go wrong:  From equipment malfunctions to scheduling mishaps to navigating foreign environments, making a movie of this nature is difficult.I know this, because I've made movies like this before. I've spent the last 10 years traveling around the world, encountering and overcoming dozens upon dozens of challenges that come along with international filmmaking. I know how to make a movie under these conditions. I know how to get it done."

I have been doing woodworking since I was in junior high school but serious woodworking since 1999. I love working and creating beautiful one-of-a-kind pieces of art from wood. There is nothing that feels and looks like natural wood, the grain, and the beauty of its color. Here is a small sample of pens that I have created for myself, yes I am a pen hoarder.I wanted to participate in Kickstaters' Make/100 for two reasons. First to get exposure, second to share my woodworking passion and love.In this project, I will be making 100 Pau Ferro Artisan Jr. Statesman II Postable Rollerball Pen with Rhodium/Black Titanium parts. What is a Postable pen? It is a pen that has a postable threaded end cap which makes attaching the pen cap to the pen quick and easy.Because of my love of woodworking and making pens I wanted to do this project. I have hand-selected and purchased all of the wood I will need to accomplish this project. I have also secured with my vendor the pen parts need to accomplish this project.The Make/100 project starts January 1st and runs until January 31st. Once the project has completed and funded I will start making the pens. The completion date for all pens will be March 31. Pens will be shipped as completed and in order or payment received.Funds will be used to pay off my completed shop expansion and to purchase additional woodturning chisels.As stated above, I want to get exposure and to share my love of woodcrafting. I love it when people write back to me and let me know that the pen they received is 10 times better looking than the picture. Maybe I should take photography classes? Nah, I love making beautiful works of art from wood more.",The biggest risk for this project would be that my preferred vendor ran out of pen parts.  My contingency would to use one or more other providers.,https://www.kickstarter.com/projects/dale-dansie-jaw/color-my-world-hand-turned-wood-pens?ref=discovery_category_newest,dale-dansie-jaw/color-my-world-hand-turned-wood-pens,"My name is Dale J Dansie, I sell my products on JustAnotherWoodcrafter.com. I have been doing woodworking since I was in junior high school but serious woodworking since 1999. I love working and creating beautiful one-of-a-kind pieces of art from wood. There is nothing that feels and looks like natural wood, the grain, and the beauty of its color; however, with the main “Color My World” pens they are dyed Box Elder Burl or Buckeye Burl wood and not their natural wood color.My inspiration for these pens came from the beautiful sunsets that we were able to see on our cruise that we did at the end of last year. I love the beautiful colors of the sunset, they are awe-inspiring. You can check out some of the pictures I took at JustAnotherWoodcrafterColorMyWorld.com.So why am I doing this project? Two reasons, to get exposure, and to share my woodworking passion and love. I participated in the Make/100, but unfortunately, my project did not come to fruition, but I learned a lot which is a good thing.As with any wood project that I do, I hand select each piece to ensure the most beauty, color, and quality. My pens get a whopping twenty-six different layers of coatings/polish to make sure that it will look like new from the first day you use it to 50 years from now.Funds from this project will be used to get another pen mandrel (mine’s getting worn out from all the use) and a couple of specialty tool rests (what the wood chisel lays on when you turn) and a HEPA filtration system for my shop.I hand-selected each and every piece of wood that I use with all of my projects. I look for the grain, color, and overall looks.I just want to share a few comments from some of my returning customers “Just bought two more pens for gifts. The quality of the pens are amazing, but the best part is the wood that is selected. You can't go wrong buying these pens”. “The best writing instrument I have ever used. Quality in workmanship is as beautiful as it is functional. I use mine daily as does my wife. I have received many compliments on the pen. I HIGHLY recommend them”. I love the joy I hear about when customers receive their pens.For a $5pledge, you will receive two handmade, one-of-a-kind note cards that you can use to send someone a note, or just to say hi! These note cards are 4 1/4"" wide and 5 1/4"" long. You will receive one that is horizontal and one that is vertical. They come with an envelope. These are made by my dear wife, they are random colors, designs and sayings.For a $15 pledge, you will receive a slimline pen made from either Cedar, Purple Heart, Hedge Wood, Honduras Redheart, or Pink Ivory. When pledging, you will have to specify which color you are pledging for.For the main event, if you pledge $29 you will receive a beautiful ""Color My World"" pen hand-turned by yours truly. When pledging, you will have to specify which color you are pledging for.",There really is no risk other than loss of limb or death on my part.  I have multiple vendors that I can get the wood and pen fittings from.

I have been doing this for a couple months now and this is my first big project~This enamel pin series is inspired by an anime that I love very much. Boku no Hero Academia has a dear place in my heart, and I want to share my love for it with these pin designs~These pins will be 1"", hard enamel, black nickel plated pins!If you couldn't already tell from the header image, the four characters I will be pinning are Uraraka Ochako, Asui Tsuyu, Midoriya Izuku, and Bakugou Katsuki. My four favorites~I chose various flowers to represent the personality of each character, and also because I love plantlife. I thought it'd make a cute collaboration withthese characters. :)For Ochako I chose sunflowers to represent her sunny personality, but also her fiery determination.For Tsuyu I chose lotus flowers and lily pads to represent her love for water and the calmness of her disposition.For Deku I chose daisies to represent the wholesome simplicity of his personality in regards to heroism and kindness.And for Bakugou I chose roses to represent his thorny personality, as well as his explosive resolve to become a hero. (also purely because his eyes are red lol)The overall goal of this Kickstarter is to get these pins into production as it can be very pricey. The quantity of how many pins I order will depend on how much money I receive by the end of this project. The amount I've set for now will be about 50-70 pieces of each pin. With any extra money I receive, I will up that amount.If this Kickstarter does well, I may end up doing another one with other characters from the series, but we'll see~ :)Thanks so much for looking~ <3","My personal main goal is to get these pins into my hands so as to get them all out to you, the backers. If this project does not succeed, I will most likely start restart this kickstarter with a different goal in mind.

I put at the latest June 2018, but it may very well be later, or even earlier.

https://www.kickstarter.com/projects/mauledbynature/for-men-only?ref=discovery_category_newest,mauledbynature/for-men-only,"Every year, several times a year, I'd hit the pavement in search of the perfect, albeit inexpensive gift for a man. I'm being honest here...rock with me for a minute.Socks, Ties, Handkerchiefs and Cologne seemed to be the only options. I noticed that the retail market was saturated with ideas on gift giving for women such as Gift Baskets, Jewelry, Perfume, etc. Men on the other hand, were a complete AFTERTHOUGHT! Now, I don't know about you, but the Men in my life deserve more than being conditioned to expect and get less. So, in my mind, a long journey began with the end result being making gifts geared towards MEN ONLY! Next was the idea that I needed something unique to showcase my handcrafted gifts in. Something Masculine that was unmistakably FOR MEN ONLY. I came up with the idea of Empty Cigar Boxes. You can't get more masculine than a Cigar Box, unless it's a Cigar Box with Cigars inside, or a Luxury Automobile, or even some cold hard CASH! I digress...The idea of the Cigar Box is that it's MANLY! It's compact and Travel worthy. As an added bonus, after you've used every single drop of my great products, the Cigar Box can be re-used for ideas that encompass your brilliant mind! (You see what I did there?) Men deserve compliments AND appreciation!I know men who have hair and skin. Yes, I do. Both of these would need TLC. So I set out to offer Body Care Items FOR MEN ONLY. Moisture is what most men require from their body care items. We nourish our bodies from the inside, so why not the outside also?

The oils condition the skin to leave your body feeling not only soft, but moisturized as well.BODY WASHMade with Water, Avocado Oil, Coconut Oil, Aloe Vera Gel, Argan Oil and other essential ingredients.

https://www.kickstarter.com/projects/officerfishdumplings/remix-culture?ref=discovery_category_newest,officerfishdumplings/remix-culture,"I am Hatim Belyamani, aka officerfishdumplings(officerfishdumplings.com)In late July 2012, I partnered with documentary producer and media lawyer Jordan Fletcher, who will join me in Morocco in late September 2012 to begin working on the storytelling component to the project. I'm setting out to offer an alternate path for remix culture, with the following primary goals:My 3 big passions have long been: music, photography, and cultural exchange (in the service of bringing the world closer). remix ←→ culture evolved out of my desire to bring all 3 passions together in a meaningful way.Like so many other electronic musicians, I've embraced the remix culture that’s exploded over the past several years. It’s amazing how easy it’s become to sample anything from anywhere around the world. And I've had a lot of fun doing just that with many of my remixes. But I've also recently discovered a whole new level of satisfaction when remixing music made by people with whom I've crossed paths in a deeper way than by simply (and anonymously) clicking a button to download their music. This has led me down a journey I invite you to join me on, where we set out to offer an alternate path for remix culture, one that resonates more with the spirit of our times: we wanna know more about where our food comes from, where our clothes are made, whether the producers of the items we consume are paid a fair wage. Similarly, with remix ←→ culture, I’d like to bridge the gap between remix music that we produce or consume and the people behind the original sounds that made the remix music possible. I see here an opportunity to create an experience that is at once musical, multi-sensory, fun, easy-to-use, educational, and accessible to a large number of users and producers worldwide. And through this unique experience, there's an opportunity to appeal to both children and adults, musicians and non-musicians alike, in a way that not only provides a new funding mechanism for musicians around the world, but also increases curiosity in the world about cultures both foreign and familiar.A few months ago, I left my job at Apple and embarked on my first field recording trips in remote parts of Morocco. I had limited recording gear, and very little clue as to how any of this adventure would turn out. But I ended up meeting some incredible musicians whom I recorded, photographed, and videotaped in as varied locations as:Take Brahim Fadel:He’s lived his entire life in the small town of Khenifra, where, despite his most modest means, he and his wife raised a family of 3 children and are still struggling to put all of them through school. But within a couple hours of meeting him, he insisted I join him in his own home for lunch. He also has an incredibly beautiful voice, knows his way around the lotar and kamanja, and a passion for sharing his knowledge of his culture and musical traditions.My first priority was to ensure the musicians I worked with were happy with the outcome of our encounter. That meant mixing and producing CD-quality versions of their songs and providing them with CD copies. Here's a taste, featuring Brahim on lead vocals and lotar:Even though they didn’t ask for any compensation, I thanked them for their time and talent with a cash-in-a-small-envelope symbolic gesture. But I wasn’t satisfied with that approach and I knew it wasn’t sustainable for me in the long-run. This was just the beginning my quest for a new revenue model.When I returned to SF, I created the first work entirely derived from the audio-visual materials I had captured in Morocco. Here's a 5-minute video of me demo'ing this installation:https://vimeo.com/46526464My installation was premiered at the Priceless arts festival in California this summer, and was a hit with festival passers-by throughout all 3 days. If you wanna see the range of musical fun one can have with this installation, check out this video:https://vimeo.com/49458445But, this was just a first step towards realizing the vision I outlined forremix ←→ culture. Yes it does:But it doesn’t offer access toAnd most importantly, this experience is only possible if you come to me, or I bring these devices to you.So now, with your help, I want to takeremix ←→ culture to the next level and beyond. This is my vision forremix ←→ culture.  And even though it all started with Moroccan music, it's a vision I'd like to extend to other corners of this world. Morocco just happens to be the starting point because of the deep ties I have to the country and its music. The goal for theremix ←→ culture iPad app when it becomes available, is it would provide a new framework, which not only I can use when making new field recording trips to Morocco and other countries, but also anyone who has (remix ←→ culture)-friendly content would be able to use. Imagine someone is already recording, photographing, and interviewing musicians in, say Brazil. Once theremix ←→ culture iPad app is available, they would be able to package all their content in a specified format and, therefore deliver the remix ←→ culture experience for their recorded music to users worldwide, and divert funds back to their Brazilian source musicians.On Sept 20, we’re setting out again to remote parts of Morocco to reconnect with some of the musicians from the previous trip, as well as meet new musicians, record their music, and begin to collect translations of their lyrics, their stories, and the stories behind the music. This will allow us to collect enough high-quality content to use as a prototype when we develop the remix ←→ culture iPad app.But we need your help.We’ve already sunk considerable costs to upgrade our equipment so that we can collect high-fidelity recordings even in challenging locations. There’s also travel to cover, and, ultimately, developing the iPad software that could offer the possibility of a new funding mechanism for talented musicians around the world. If we meet our fundraising goal, that will cover roughly half of the costs for this new gear, trip, and musician fees.If we're able to raise more than that, the money will go to sunk costs and funding for the iPad app. If we fall short this time, we'll launch another kickstarter campaign when we're further into the iPad phase.  Because we’re committed to making this project a reality. Recording gear upgrades (Total = $12,809.49)(Previously owned gear includes Sennheiser e914 mic, another Neumann KM184 mic, Shure SM58, Nikon D7000 camera with SB-600 external flash, an assortment of high-quality lenses, camera tripods, filters, and MacBook Pro with external backup hard drive.)Musician fees (estimated $400)Travel costs (estimated total of $3200)Kickstarter Rewards Fulfillment (depends on # of backers)iPad app development (under investigation)In addition to the personal history and ties ofd has with the country, Morocco's convenient geographical location has put it at the crossroads of many civilizations and trade routes throughout human history. As a result, the diversity of Moroccan musical traditions is mind-blowing – there’s stuff that is reminiscent of music from places as disparate as West Africa, Ukraine, China, Syria, Brazil, Mali, and Ireland. But, at the same time, Moroccan musical traditions have held on to a rhythmic sensibility that remains quite unique in many respects.",,https://www.kickstarter.com/projects/officerfishdumplings/odds-of-survival-you-will-be-rescued?ref=discovery_category_newest,officerfishdumplings/odds-of-survival-you-will-be-rescued,"---Three years ago, Scott Roy, Shawn Feeney, officerfishdumplings, and Altay Guvench formed Odds of Survival. With backgrounds in electronica, country, hip-hop, folk, modern classical, jazz, and death metal, we weren't sure what would happen. Through two years of collaborative exploration, we created something different than any of us expected.It's an 11-song album titled ""You Will Be Rescued"" that's been described as Doomgrass, Gothic Americana, and ""Willie Nelson meets Radiohead - they get into a fight."" We're really proud of the result and excited to share it with you.We recorded in marathon DIY sessions at our guitarist's house, each of us holed up in a different room (including the bathroom: see video). Starting with a classic foundation of guitars, bass, and a $100 drum set we bought the day we started recording, the project grew. Banjos and mandolins and musical saw. Organ, accordion, and melodica. Fiddle and cello and double bass. Piano and glockenspiel and mbira. Prayer bells, jingle bells, and barbells. Shaker and maraca and goat toenails, tambourine, tabla, and a Turkish tar. Stomps and handclaps. Cabinets and bowls and kitchen utensils. Garbage pails, a garlic press, and a pair of abused mini-kegs. Neighbors were angered, police were called, we persevered.The final step in the collaboration was working with our close friend and incredible producer Tyler Wood. He mixed the shit out of this album. ""You Will Be Rescued""  is a labor of love. We spent over $7,000 and countless hours to create it. We've launched this Kickstarter with a modest goal. Pre-order here by Feb 25th 12pm PST to get the album at a 20% discount. We hope you'll also consider supporting us with our higher level rewards. With your help, we can make sure this music reaches as many listeners as possible.Our self-produced music video for ""Running Wild,"" one of the songs on ""You Will Be Rescued.""","We're aiming to release our album as soon as this kickstarter campaign successfully ends.  However, there are different lead times for various digital distribution channels.

Working with Sir Patrick Stewart, William Shatner and Brent Spiner.http://rorylewisphotography.com/star-trek-cast-portraits/With the 50th anniversary of Star Trek coming up next year, Rory wants to finish what he has started by photographing a unique portrait of as many faces from the Star Trek Universe as possible. Rory has potential portrait photoshoots available with many of the cast . He needs the funding to cover the cost of travel to capture the portraits, and funding to hold the exhibits.Once complete Rory will produce a book, and exhibition both in the UK and USA, bringing these unique portraits to the general public.","The unique challenge, is to photograph as many of the cast as possible. As a professional editorial photographer, I have connections with many celebrities, and have arranged to photograph many of the star trek universe cast, the main obstacle is funding, many members of the cast live all over the world, and it is a large project to undertake without funding.http://rorylewisphotography.com/star-trek-cast-portraits/"

As the summer progresses, I'll start using ripe blackberries, blueberries, raspberries, and apricots to give you an assortment of flavors. These will be canned in pint sized jars (16 ounces).You may choose a variety of flavors, but strawberry is the only one that will be available in early June. Everything else will ship in late June, July, or August. It's just the nature of things :)Thanks for your support! Please message me if you have any questions!","There's really not much I'm worried about. I've already purchased jars and pectin, and I can easily get more from the store.There are many berry farms nearby, so I'm confident that things will go smoothly. The strawberry season is off to a great start, and running out of fruit seems practically impossible :)",https://www.kickstarter.com/projects/calebyers/willamette-valley-jam?ref=discovery_category_newest,calebyers/willamette-valley-jam,"I want to start a jam business that sources fruits locally in the Willamette Valley!

Thanks for the reminder, Sam!! And each jar is 16 ounces, or 1 pint.I will use the funds to purchase fruit and establish proper business licensing.The following berries are available, and you can mix it up and choose multiple types in the same order (2 of each, for example):","I have been in direct communication with the owners of multiple farms, and they have plenty of fresh fruit available. There should be no significant risks, as I already have purchased jars and have shipping arrangements taken care of.I've made grape jelly in the past and have recently tested batches of raspberry, boysenberry, and marionberry jams. They have all turned out well."
https://www.kickstarter.com/projects/meowychronicles2/some-dumb-generic-slasher-film?ref=discovery_category_newest,meowychronicles2/some-dumb-generic-slasher-film,"I always tried to make original, unique, and funny films. But since that's not financially viable I'll give you people what you want. What's the movie about? I don't know, some stupid idiot with a knife goes around killing badly written, cardboard cut-out characters for 90 minutes. The dialogue will be boring, the setting bland, none of the characters will be likable, and it will all around be pretty generic and standard. But sometimes you'll see boobs and the gore will look great, that's all that matters right?I have a great cinematographer, Scott Lewis. He's ready to do some really cool and stylish stuff, like a cross between Scott Pilgrim and Suspiria. But we won't let that happen, he will instead use a lot of close ups, medium shots, and a few times we'll have a tilt for suspense.We also have Cody Ruch on board for effects, and he is all about making some really cool, gnarly effects that you've never seen before. Again, we will thankfully stop him from doing that and make sure he sticks with only the most standard types of murder.Stevo Bortz is ready to take on the job of composer, he is a man who has always made very cool, very unique sounds for my previous films. I have told him to forget everything he has done and to instead give us a crappy heavy metal soundtrack. Seriously, this movie is everything the horror community loves to support. ","The biggest risk is that I'll instead use the money to make a unique slasher film like CarousHELL and you'd get that instead.  That's about a living carousel unicorn going on a murder rampage to get to a fat, bratty kid and dealing with his own existence and why he's alive at all.But that wouldn't be good.  What are the odds of that happening?",https://www.kickstarter.com/projects/meowychronicles2/a-meowy-double-feature?ref=discovery_category_newest,meowychronicles2/a-meowy-double-feature,"So if you're here you know what A Meowy Christmas is, a weird Christmas talking cat movie that I tried to make me laugh with. Currently working on A Meowy Halloween as well and curious if a Bluray Double Feature is something people would want!So that's what this campaign is for: a pre-order campaign for specifically raising funds for the Bluray to make a batch of copies. If we succeed awesome, everyone will get weird talking cat movies in HD. If not, that's okay, the movie itself is still coming to Prime Video and DVD.This campaign is *strictly* to support a Bluray release of both films on one disc.Keep in mind that A Meowy Halloween will be coming to Prime Video FIRST since that is the target audience. Because of manufacturing time it is likely that you may not get your copy of the film until well into October. This is not an early physical release.",Only risk is the bluray won't exist if this campaign fails. Otherwise A Meowy Halloween is definitely coming out in late September.

This Kickstarter campaign is my hope to turn this hobby into a side business that I can grow and introduce to my boys.I hope you enjoy looking at the pens I have available. With this project, you have the opportunity to create a pen that fits your personal taste. Once you've made your choice, you will be able to enjoy the pen for years and they are all refillable.

The idea for Bricoleur blossomed on a cold night in the studio, while drinking beer and eating some pistachios (as one does). We talked about how it would be a great idea to start a magazine that could promote the new graduates that are apart of Gallery Six. From there, for the past three months we have been working incredibly long hours to make Bricoleur a reality.Bricoleur will be focusing on world conversation, creativity and the condition of the mind. All topics we feel as a team will grab the readers attention. Bricoleur, will have all current studio members involved as well as 2 to 4 feature artists in every issue. There will be a new issue every three months. Each issue will have a rough guideline for submissions and will be printed in A4 with about 48 to 52 pages. You can expect to find anything from: writing, fine art, fashion, to even stills from filmmakers.Our number one goal is to get members as much exposure as possible. As we all know, competition in the creative industry is ridiculously hard, expensive and hard to pursue your ‘dream’ job. As new graduates, you can imagine we don't have much money. This is why we are trying to utilise tools available to us to make a global campaign and create as much awareness for Bricoleur as possible! Thank you so much for supporting us.We are alleternally grateful for any amount.With love,Bricoleur Team xAll the money made from this campaign will be going towards printing costs and distribution.With special thanks to Gallery Six- without Gallery Six none of this would exist.X4 Postcards(4x5)Feel free to pick and choose X4 images of the selected artists below.The images will be printed separately on beautiful textured paper for you.(Please note the 2 sets of images do not count as one, each image is singular)POSTERSX2 A2 PrintsPrinted on Hahnemuhle Photo Rag Paper.Pick TWO images from these selected artists.CURTLY ADAM'S CONE COLLECTIONPlease pick One of Curtly's Cones.Each cone is unique, here are just some examples.Message us if you want personalised cones (such as different colours)!",After the completion of the Kickstarter campaign the zine and rewards will be sent to print immediately (this will take a couple of weeks to happen).

We have one clear plan, though. To create meaningful artwork and help our fellow artists by providing a professional platform for them; Bricoleur, that is!Bricoleur was born on a cold evening in Gallery Six, mixing adventurously flavours of beer and pistachio nuts (as one does), talking about how we cannot bear the thought that all the work Gallery Six artists create could so easily get lost in the creative noise of London. As you must know, to get your foot in the door in the creative industry is quite hard. You probably know how the story goes: graduation, hunt for an entry level job, waves of rejections or unpaid jobs for months while trying to stay on top of your absurdly expensive London lifestyle (if you would call paying rent, topping up your Oyster card and hunting for cheap bread a life “style”). Yeah, you get the jist.So, our aim is to provide exposure to the wonderful and talented artists from Gallery Six. Each artist will create something in response to specific themes we chose for each issue. The very first of which will be focusing on World Conversation, Creativity andThe Condition of the Mind: three topics that we feel are relevant and will engage our artists and grab the attention of our readers.Bricoleur will come to you as a A4 print magazine, 52 pages on 120gsm recycled paperbecause we love this planet and our unborn grandchildren.The Content The FutureYour investment directly supports Issue One, but it is also so much more. It not shows that you also support the ideas the drive us to create Bricoleur and get Issue One underway, but your contribution will also help us with the preparation of Issue Two.In Issue Two we will feature another generation of Gallery Six members, more interviews, collaborations and so much more following the theme, Journey.A journey of course means something different to all of us. Weather it is your daily commute, or getting on dozens of flights a year, not stopping to think for a moment - because that's how you operate. It could mean a mental journey within yourself or a journey through time and history or histories...Issue One is only the first step in our journey to realise our dream of making Bricoleur grow and to eventually work on it full-time. We won’t stop on page 52 next time, but we’ll expand the zine and constantly improve its content with more spreads and deeper curiosities. Let's all go on a trip. Starting here, with your help and with Issue One.Best,Bricoleur Team x...

https://www.kickstarter.com/projects/land-boards/attiny-tinygrid85-arduino?ref=discovery_category_newest,land-boards/attiny-tinygrid85-arduino,We love Arduinos and breadboarding but we often end up with projects which are really too small to waste an entire Arduino. We also wanted some way to breadboard our designs with an ATTiny85 part. Often times we just want one or two boards and find it hard to justify a board spin for a one-off design. The other frustration we have with the Arduino is the lack of proper mounting holes. A board should have sufficient solid mounting holes.So we designed the TinyGrid85. Link to TinyGrid85 storeThe grid is laid out as 12 columns and 10 rows. Power and Ground lines are bused horizontally on the center rows. The columns are split up as shown here above and below the Power/Ground rows.The TinyGrid85 can be programmed from the ISP connector. Here are instructions for programming the card from an Arduino UNO.Here is an example of the kind of breadboarding you can do with this card. This board is an optically coupled logic probe design. I was able to quickly prototype this board design before I committed the board to layout. Your design will be your own.,The ATTiny85 part has been in short supply lately so there's always the risk that this Kickstarter could go big enough to make that an issue. Other than that we have been building and using this card for a while so we don't see any serious challenges. We have a team of local board assemblers with experience in building and testing small electronic assemblies and we should be able to scale assembly as required.,https://www.kickstarter.com/projects/land-boards/develop-a-raspberry-pi-b-sensor-connection-hat?ref=discovery_category_newest,land-boards/develop-a-raspberry-pi-b-sensor-connection-hat,"This card is available on Tindie and will ship after the Kickstarter rewards have been fulfilled. We are estimating the card will be available in late December/early January based on the number of backers we got here on Kickstarter. We are currently (in late Oct 2014) taking backorders on Tindie for the card so if you missed out on this Kickstarter you can still get the card there.Thanks to our backers, we developed a new hat (daughtercard) for the new Raspberry Pi Model B+. This hat allows external devices to be easily connected to the Pi. It can be used for breadboard prototyping or used in real-world directly wired applications.This new hat is based on a Raspberry Pi daughtercard that we had here on Kickstarter. That previous card is now available for purchase on Tindie. We think with some changes to the design we could develop and deliver a card that would meet the needs of more people who want to hook up external hardware to their Pi. One of the things which you discover early on when you try to hook up external devices is that the Raspberry Pi runs at 3.3V on the I/O pins. Unfortunately, most of the parts that you want to connect to your Pi run at 5V. The way people solve that problem is to buy a prototyping card and a voltage translation breakout card and then wire the signals up by hand. That's a lot of work and not very flexible for making changes. It's also not a very stable solution. It would be much easier if that wiring was done on the a card which connects up to the Pi. That's why we are developing this card.Our previous design used voltage translators to change the 3.3V into 5V on some of the Raspberry Pi lines and they worked really well for the task. We put in 16 lines (2 chips) worth of conversion circuitry. The parts to do that conversion are not cheap; they are about $2.30 per chip in low volume. We wondered if that made the card too expensive for some people? Also, we chose the signals which we thought should be converted to 5V and left the others at 3.3V. Did we pick wrong the wrong mix for some people?We think our previous ideas could be improved on for many applications. What if the translators were reduced to one part? That would cut the selling price significantly. What if the translator could be wired to whatever channel you want it connected to? That would be a powerful option which would provide the configurability that many people want. You could connect up to the GPIOs, UART, SPI and I2C bus in any combination you wish - up to 8 lines worth.We took these options and are developing them. We've created the design for what we think would be a great hat. Here's what the hat looks like:This hat takes all of the I/O lines from the Raspberry Pi and brings them out to GVS (Ground/Voltage/Signal) connectors. GPIO lines get their own connectors with their own power and ground. Signals that are part of a function like I2C, UART, and SPI signals get put together onto connectors but still get power and ground on those connectors. If, for instance, you want to connect up to a 5V LCD which runs SPI you would just wire it to one of the two SPI connectors.We really like GVS wiring. There's a whole world of parts that you can find on ebay and other places which use GVS wiring. That world includes much more than sensors. It includes output devices like relay cards, too. Your imagination really is the limit.At the bottom there is an 8 line voltage translator. The 3.3V side of the translator gets a header. Then female-to-female jumpers connect the header to the 3.3V connector. You could do any combination up to 8 lines to 5V level signals. At the very bottom there are 8 GVS connectors which carry the 5V GVS lines out of the voltage translator.A bit of detail about the voltage translators is in order. They are bidirectional and ESD protected. They also can run open drain mode signals so either side can drive them. They are much quicker than the typical breakout board/breadboard solution using MOSFETs. For this to be a real Pi hat requires an EEPROM to store configuration information. This adds a bit of cost but lets the operating system know what sort of hardware is attached. The user can customize the EEPROM since we added a write enable/protect jumper.Here's the new card wired up to external devices.Here's a video of the new card exercising the GPIO lines as outputs. This demonstrates the connections are working through the card and parts.We think this is a great idea but what do you think? Do you want to help us develop a card that does all of these things?","We want to take the idea above and develop it into a board. We've had success making daughtercards for the Raspberry Pi so we don't see this has a technical challenge. See our Tindie Store https://www.tindie.com/stores/land_boards/ for other cards we have done which are available now.We have written test software already for our other daughtercards so it should be easy to run that same software on this card. We went ahead and ordered a small batch of the cards. Since we launched this Kickstarter we have built up those boards and tested them. They work great. We are confident we can make this work in the time-frame we have chosen.We have a track record of meeting our promises. We had a few tries at Kickstarting that didn't reach our funding goals, but we went ahead and built up cards anyway. We offered them on Tindie and fulfilled every order we received there. So even if we fail at Kickstarting a project we still intend to take the product forward. In most cases we exceed our promises. We will deliver these card to our backers."

Create one for your kids as a surprise, or turn it into a collaborative experience by letting them have a hand in making their own ID card.  But, it's not only for children! Make a funny ID card for yourself, or give one to a friend as a gag gift.We have created dozens of unique designs, and if you help us get funded, we'll make many more.One way that children learn and play is by modeling the behavior of their parents. They see adults use ID cards, credit cards and other types of identification and they want to do this as well.  Unfortunately, children aren't old enough to get real ID cards and they know the difference between a real card and something made out of paper or cardboard. We invented Alias.Cards so that any child who wants one, can get a fun ID card that feels like the real thing. On our website anyone can upload a picture, customize one of dozens of high quality designs, and order a professionally printed ""real"" ID card.  There are already some existing services that cater to this market, but they have problems.  They only have a few generic card designs that aren't very fun and interesting. They also don't provide a real-time editor that allows you to customize and preview the card that you are going to get. We can do a lot better. We plan to have hundreds of great designs that would be exciting to own, and we'll make a great website that allows you to customize your design and see exactly what you are going to get.1) We start with high quality designs created by top notch artists. We have over 25 designs right now, and we want to add many more. We love taking suggestions from our supporters so please let us know if you have an idea for a new fun ID card.2) We have a fun interactive websitethat makes it easy for you to select a design, upload a photo and customize the details. You can see your changes in real time in your web browser, so you'll know exactly what you are getting.3) We use the highest quality materials. Our cards will be made out of 30mil PVC plastic with rounded corners and a glossy front and back. This is the same type of card that you have in your wallet. We will use professional card printing machines with high quality inks. Our plastic cards will be as safe and durable as your driver's license.4) Your card is printed and inspected by one of our designers so any errors can be caught before being shipped to you. If we notice any spelling mistakes or errors, we'll let you know. All of our cards are shipped promptly via USPS first class mail.1) Equipment &Supplies:  A professional ID Card printer is expensive.  If we secure funding, we will purchase a printer and the supplies necessary to fulfill all of our supporter's rewards.2) Website: We are also fully committed to building a great website that makes designing your Alias.Card a fun and enjoyable experience to do by yourself, or with your child or friend.  We have already done a lot of the work, but we estimate that it will take a developer an additional 4 weeks to finish.Our anticipated costs:Any extra money we raise will be put towards hiring some additional artists to make more unique ID card designs. We'll announce stretch goals when we get close.  Have an idea for a card?  Please let us know!1) Become a supporter of this project!  Supporters will be able to create their own custom ID Card once this campaign is successful. 2) Spread the word! Our website (http://www.alias.cards) is already setup to let you design a custom ID Card. You can't order it yet, but you can download the image and share it with your friends, family and coworkers. Your support and encouragement is greatly appreciated.All supporters will be given access to a special webpage where we'll post all of our ideas for new card designs. You'll be able to vote on what we make next.If you become a supporter at the $10 level or higher, you will be able to create your own custom ID card from any of the designs that we have available. All of the orders made by our supporters will be given priority over any other orders that come through our website.At the $100 level, you can tell us what card design you want us to make (within reason), and we'll make it for you.Delivery Schedule - We'll need 1-2 months to finish coding our software, building our website and testing everything.  Once we are ready, we'll send out redemption codes and instructions on how to get your reward. We are hoping to have all rewards shipped in time for Christmas.What is the final printed card like?We use the highest quality materials. Our plastic cards are identical to the ones you already have in your wallet.Can you ship internationally?Yes. We will be shipping from California, USA, so if you live on the other side of the world from us, plan on a little extra time for delivery.Can I preview what my card will look like before I pledge support to this project?Yes.  If you go to our website at http://www.alias.cards you can fully design your custom ID card and see exactly how it will look. You just won't be able to order it yet.  Become a supporter and you'll be one of the first to get your Alias.Card at the pre-release pricing.Why do I need Alias.Cards? Can't I just do this all myself?Laminated cards that you make yourself are made from paper and adhesive plastic. They don't look like the real thing, the edges tend to be rough, the cards can be bent easily, and over time the lamination can peel apart. We use solid plastic cards that have none of these problems.Is it safe for a toddler? What if they try to chew on it?Our plastic cards are as safe as the other cards in your wallet. However, to be safe, you should not let anyone chew on them.  For ages 3+ only.Can these be used as safety cards, for use in emergencies?Right now we are focusing on the ""fun"" aspect of the cards, but we do plan to add an option to include safety information on the backs of the cards. So you could put your contact info, medical details or other important information on the cards if you want to.Can people create a fake ID with your service?Our service is for novelty purposes only. We will never make a card design that looks like an official drivers license or other government ID card.You don’t have the card design I am looking for, how can I get it?Please let us know your idea. We may make it :) Or become a supporter at the $100 level and we'll definitely make it.","1) It's possible that we could get too many orders. This would be a good problem, but it would mean that we would need to scale up faster than expected. We'd probably have to purchase extra equipment and hire some temporary staff to help with the rewards. This may delay our shipments by a few weeks.2) It's possible that we may run into technical obstacles with automating the printing of each card.

You will help her scavenge for old technology in the ruined cities and discover ancient secrets about previous civilizations. There are multiple paths through this non-linear story, and many secrets to discover as you play along.Each chapter will have one or more puzzles that thematically ties into the story. You will find word puzzles like crossword puzzles, cryptograms and anagrams. There will be logic puzzles like sudoku, slitherlink and battleship. Discover math puzzles like kakuro, magic squares and crypto-math. You may also encounter coloring puzzles, mazes or connect the dots. Every puzzle is unique and there will be a wide variety of challenges to keep you entertained.The puzzles are designed to be moderately challenging: not too easy and not too hard.

Lavie Tidhar has delivered a wonderful 13,500 word sci-fi tale that you will enjoy reading.2) The Puzzles are about half way completed and being finished at a rate of 1-2 per week.3) The Website is mostly built. You can visit it now to learn more about the project. The part of the website that lets you read the story, get hints and solve the puzzles is nearly finished and is going through beta testing right now.We need to hire an artist to do some illustrations for each chapter of the story and to create unique artwork for some of the puzzles.1) We would like to have a small drawing for each chapter that illustrates what happens in that part of the story. Some of these drawings will have small puzzles hidden inside of them. We were inspired by Middle Age and Renaissance manuscripts which sometimes had ""Historiated Initials"" at the start of important chapters. These are enlarged letters that depict a scene from the text (example below). We would love to do something like this for the chapters in our story.2) We would also like to have a beautiful, hand drawn map that shows the locations that you visit throughout the story. The map will be interactive, with places appearing as you discover them, and it will function on the website as a way to navigate. If you want to jump to a different branch of the non-linear story, you can bring up the map and pick your destination.3) Some of the puzzles require specialized images to be created. With your support, we can make sure that the artwork is top-quality.4) If this fundraising campaign exceeds our goal, we will be able to enhance the product in additional ways. Maybe with extra illustrations, extra puzzles, enhanced website features or other perks. Stay tuned for more details if it looks like this is possible...1)Become a backer of this project! Supporters will get the complete experience which includes the full story and all 25+ puzzles. Get it now at a discount off the full retail price.2) Spread the word!Your support and encouragement is greatly appreciated. Please share with your friends, family and coworkers on your favorite social media.3) Solve our sample puzzle and challenge your friends to find the answer too.Every backer will get access to the complete experience which includes all 25+ puzzles, the sci-fi short story written by Lavie Tidhar and illustrations by a talented artist. This is a digital product, so all rewards will be delivered on our website. Some of the puzzles may be interactive puzzle games, but most of the puzzles will be available as a PDF, so you can download, print and solve them offline.For those competitive backers who choose the ""Head Start"" option, you will get access to everything 2 weeks before everyone else. Finish before your friends even start!Our goal is to have the first tale finished and published by July of this year. If this format of story telling is successful, we hope to publish more puzzle infused stories in a variety of genres and difficulty levels for people to enjoy.","This is a digital project, so there is very little risk in terms of delivering the rewards and scaling up to accommodate all the backers.  The story is already written and edited.  There are no roadblocks to finishing the puzzles. The website is mostly complete and ready for action.  The missing piece (and the main purpose of this kickstarter) is the artwork.  There are talented artists being considered for this project, but a risk is that they drop out for some reason.  If this happens, the search for a new artist may delay the project by a little bit, but we have built a buffer in to accommodate this if necessary."

My compositions feel the same way.I am not about to create an album of 12 bar blues and standard AABA formats.

A true musician who fights to stay where they love no matter what. I have over come the ideals that other people hold against my music. I know there will be more, but I have faced it before, and I will gladly face it again. Finding musicians may be difficult when you are new in the city, but I have faith in my fellow musical friends that we can collaborate and create something beautiful and ugly.",https://www.kickstarter.com/projects/hollyplaysbass/numbers-the-sound-of-jazz-to-come?ref=discovery_category_newest,hollyplaysbass/numbers-the-sound-of-jazz-to-come,"Ballad #1Swing #2Obligatory Five TuneQJust a few names off the list of tunes we will be performing on this new installation of Truculently Audacious.We will be joined by Rentao Diz on Piano once again. Renato recently graduated from NYU with his Masters Degree in Jazz Performance. His artistry and stylistic playing make his voice an individual amongst the flurry of piano players in New York. His sound is unique, young, and fresh, and he breathes new life into the compositions.Our next player is Mareike Weining.Currently in pursuit of her Master Degree from NYU in Jazz performance in Drums and percussion, Mareike takes the drums and turns them into more than just a rhythmic piece. She makes them sing and respond to whatever the soloist and melody player is saying. She keeps time, but also helps move the music in several directions. Her take on the instrument is new and interesting and bring the music of Truculently Audacious to life.Our horn player, Drew Williams, also a recent graduate of NYU with his Masters Degree in Jazz Composition. His bass clarinet playing is smooth and fills out the melody in a Dolphy-esque way. His view on it as another composer compliments the efforts of the original composer, Holly Cordero. His voice on Tenor is outstanding, lining each space with a new wave of notes to compliment chords, sometimes even harmonizing the melody. His ability to bring out two different characters in one tune draws the listener into what seems more like an adventure than just music playing in the background. After finishing a summer tour in the three boroughs of New York City, the team heads back into the recording studio to finish off their penultimate album, Numbers.This recording is not only an exploration of the many faces of jazz, but a journey into the musical styling of their composer and bandleader, Holly Cordero. With all new compositions fresh from the printer, these amazing jazz artists will scream out notes that need to be heard with odd harmonizations of natural fours on major chords and flat nines rubbing against minor chords. This is an adventure in rule breaking, which as their fans know, Holly Cordero is not afraid to do.Life itself is a journey in rule breaking. But life is expensive. So is recording an album. The group will be using this money to not only pay the musicians for their time, but also pay for the equipment needed to complete the recording. Production of the master and the reproduction of copies available to you costs money as well. We will be using the funds to get physical copies of the CDs as well as put them up for digital download.The money for this project goes directly to the musicians. Some of the money will go towards purchasing the correct equipment, food for the recording day, and reproduction of the CDs. Each of these things comes straight out of the pocket of the band, unless you can help. Please help make this local music come alive. We are hoping to sell the CD in local music stores such as The Stone Music Store and Other Music as part of their inventory and hope to get airplay out of it. The money also goes to pay for the musicians time. Each of these musicians has studied their craft and practiced long, hard hours to get the notes right. They deserve to be compensated for their time.Help support the local music scene by contributing to the sound of jazz to come with this amazing exploration: Numbers.","Our challenges:Gaining fans.We have a small fan base that we have gathered from our gigs on our tour. However, with creating a new record, there is a new opportunity to gain new fans. Sometimes you lose fans. We are going to overcome this challenge with excellent marketing and publication throughout the digital world and in physical press such as the Album release party and release announcements in local papers (I.e. Village Voice, Time Out NY, etc). We are consistently playing gigs out in the NY area and are currently in the works of a Midwest tour. We hope to gain more fans worldwide. Our fans seem to be from California and NY mostly.Recording TimeMost musicians in NYC have more than one gig. Recording time takes more than one day. Often times, recordings are stretched out over a period of a couple of days. This means booking these talented and gifted musicians for more than one day and making sure that they are compensated for the time they are missing out on making more money in the busy gigging scene of NY. Not only will we raise enough money to pay the musicians, but through coordination and dedication we will be able to find a time that matches for everyone and use the time that we have efficiently. Therefore, we get the most amount of work in the least amount of time. This means, for you as the donor, your album will be in your mailbox sooner, you will get a better recording, and therefore, will enjoy the music more.ResourcesAlthough money is a large resource that plays a role in the creation of an album, there is also the equipment to record, the time to rehearse before the album is made, the duplication of the CDs, the mastering time and software, the charts and music being printed out, etc. Although the budget is tight, most of us have access to a printer and a large support network to use ink and paper from. Also, two of them musicians are able to borrow some recording microphones if worse comes to worst.  The duplication process can be cut short if less CDs are ordered, and more digital copies can be made available in multiple channels for our listeners and fans.MarketingThrough touring this summer and releasing an album for the tour, we have learned successful ways to market as well as the unsuccessful. It requires a lot of time, energy, and finances in order to create buzz around the album, but the band has learned very well how to do that. This album will be more available than our last as there is a strong concentration on digital distribution rather than physical copies. The album will be available on iTunes, Amazon, Pandora, and Spotify. We will also be listing it on our website as well and will have physical albums for mail order only. We will also be hosting an album release party to create more buzz around the release of the album. After the album is successfully recorded, mastered, and produced, the marketing campaign will be started. Some marketing will be done in advance to create buzz such as the marketing campaign for the album release party, as well as preview releases for other tracks on the album. This will get people chomping at the bit to buy the album or to see the group live.  We are a string band and have bonded throughout the length of our tour. If any issues arise, like they have in the past, we will be able to find a way out. With your help, we can make this project become a success."

We are Elias Iscariot - an electro punk band from Akron/Canton, Ohio. We're one of the most insane live bands in the midwest - with our custom LED light show, one-of-a-kind props and costumes, and wicked, endless energy we bring to the stage, we're a band that MUST be seen live to get the picture. Our unbelievable antics have landed us gigs/tours with national electronic/rock heavyhitters like Mushroomhead, Powerman 5000, Polysics, Gil Mantera's Party Dream, and Zim Zum (Marilyn Manson's ""Antichrist Superstar"" guitarist.) We've been extremely active in our state and the midwest for years, releasing 4 full-length albums and playing over 200 shows.Last summer, to support our album ""Untimely Death Like Clockwork,"" we went on a two week, self-financed, independent tour. We played with a bunch of amazing bands all over the country and met tons of wonderful, supportive people who let us crash on their couches and eat their food. We couldn't have had a better time - except one thing.WE LOST A TON OF MONEY. Between a several hundred dollar car repair, gas and food for every day, a few greedy venues stiffing us on getting paid, and all of us in the band having to miss almost a month of work, we came out pretty far down in the red.This summer, we want to do it all over again. With our new found friends in places like New York and Texas, we feel the need to go out again to promote our newest full-length, ""More Than a Mouthful."" The problem is, we cannot afford to lose money again like we did last year if we can avoid it.In exchange for your support, we're offering a multitude of rewards - from signed stage props, CDs and merch, exclusive tour scrapbooks, and the ultimate - your own private Elias Iscariot gig complete with lights, costumes, props, and buckets full of crazy.We are not ignorant to how this whole thing works, especially with what we have learned in this last year of touring. We live to tour and want nothing more than to be back on the road, seeing our fans around the country, and making memories that will last us a lifetime.If you have any interest in helping a fledgling band prosper, or have an interest in bringing us to your town, please donate. We swear we will do whatever we have to do to make it worth it.

I have been active as the chief singer/songwriter for many projects over the last eight years and performed/toured with bands like Powerman 5000, Polysics, Diamond Rings, Mushroomhead, Zim Zum (of Marilyn Manson), and Gil Mantera's Party Dream. I am also the composer and music director for the YouTube partner series ""Theater Class."" I am asking my fans, friends, family, music lovers, and all around general cool people to get involved in the release of my next album, titled ""Aren't We So Lucky to Be Alive?"" The album collects four digital EPs released in 2011 and five bonus tracks for a total of 17 songs! Because I write, record, mix, and master on my own, my recordings cost me nothing to make... until it comes time to actually RELEASE them. A lot of my fans were unhappy with my last four EPs being digital only and want something to have and to hold, so I am trying to raise at least $500 to professionally press the new album. To be honest, $500 will just cover it (as in, I will barely see a profit) but I want to make my fans happy and get them the physical release they've been asking about for the last year.Donations start at $9, which gets you a high-quality download (fulfilled by Bandcamp) in almost any format you can imagine, MP3, FLAC, etc. Other prizes include, of course, the physical CD, pins, stickers, a limited edition photobook, your very own set of three personalized songs, and your very own personal performance via Skype featuring songs written about you!The bonus tracks on the album are the 2010 recordings of ""Now I'm Fine"" and ""I Knew You Before You Were Rich,"" included for new fans who were not familiar with these old favorites, the last two songs ever recorded with my former punk trio Elias Iscariot, titled ""Riot"" and ""My Sex,"" and a brand new, Elias and the Error techno rave jam called ""B Where U R.""Pledges you make will not be drawn from your bank account until after April 10th, when the fundraiser ends. All payments are handled securely by Amazon.If I do not reach my goal of $500, I do not receive any money and you pay nothing. However, that also means the album does not get pressed, the limited edition photobook does not get pressed, and my future releases will most likely be digital only.You can make sure this project reaches the goal by spreading the word! Show your friends the preview tracks on my Bandcamp page (http://eliasandtheerror.bandcamp.com/), post to Twitter and Facebook, tell anyone who will be interested! You truly have the release of my next album in your hands.Funding will run from Friday, March 9th, until Monday, April 9th. Remember, if we do not collected $500 in pledges, YOU DO NOT PAY ANYTHING and I DO NOT RELEASE ANYTHING!I appreciate so much everything you guys give back to me - I get so many amazing e-mails, messages, letters, and gifts from my fans and I have nothing but deep gratitude. I am very excited to continue to foster that connection with the campaign for my new album. I hope we can grow even closer!-Elias Gowins",

Because there’s a shortage of projects with strong roles for women, the cast is composed of five women with ages of 18, 28, 38, 58, and 75.CHOICES is an intimate, transformative, and provocative portrayal of a woman who discovers forgiveness is an inside job. The show unfolds in what appears to be a support group for women coming to terms with their abortions. But as the women share intimate stories, they discover that their connections run much deeper. The women bare their souls with memories of relationships, spirituality, and mother-daughter dynamics, as they struggle to achieve forgiveness of self. The money we raise will cover renting the venue and rehearsal space, and hiring a videographer to film the performance. After the show, the cast and I will have a conversation with the audience. Engaging people in a dialogue will promote compassion and understanding. My vision is to bring CHOICES to colleges, universities, and community theaters to keep the conversation going.

He ended up in the confines of a DP Camp (Displaced Persons Camp). It was here that he wrote his most powerful composition – ""Rhapsody 1939 -1945"". This stirring piece of music brought to life the horrors of war, the depth of suffering, and in the final denouement, the promise of hope for a world ravaged by overwhelming atrocities. Leo used the power of music to chronicle his experience and bring to life the terror and the fear that he lived through.This piece was played in the DP Camp in 1946.Then it sat on a shelf for over 50 years.In 2016, I had the good fortune to arrange this music for concert band. In arranging the composition, I could hear Leo's passion as he wrote a chilling, but ultimately uplifting story of surviving the Holocaust. He relives the past in every bar of music. At the beginning of the piece, you can hear the jackboots, the troops marching, the knock on the door in the middle of the night. The second section of this piece profiles the depths of suffering and despair, and perhaps, Leo seeing the light at the end of the tunnel. The third section of his piece is quite foretelling. Composed at the end of the war, Leo showed interesting foresight when he added a musical quote at the end of his piece. The quote was from a tune called “Hatikva”, which later (1947) became the anthem for the state of Israel.HELP BRING THE MUSIC BACK TO LIFEI am now in the process of bringing this music back to life, and I need your support. I have worked on the score for the last year, and it has been an emotional journey. This is one of the most poignant and sincere pieces of music composed about World War II. We need to hear Leo’s music because it reminds us about the horrors of war, and what can happen when hatred gets out of control - and yet it instills a sense of hope. With this work, we can see how history comes alive through the power of music. This is the human experience writ large, in one of its most eloquent forms. Holocaust survivors are dying, but it is important to keep their experience alive. You can feel the barbarity of war in this piece. The music is passionate and written from the heart.I don’t want Leo’s music, his thoughts, his experiences, his music to be forgotten. This project needs your financial support to help people remember. This project needs your financial support to bring this piece of music into the public realm for all to hear. Your support is needed to make sure this page of history stays open, so future generations can learn from it. Your contribution will ensure that these musicians can help keep Leo's voice alive. Leo's music should be heard by everyone, and Leo’s experiences continue to leave a lasting impression. Your contribution means you will be part of the World Premiere of a work that will continue to be heard in the years to come.I have put together a very special concert band for this project, and have hand picked the best musicians in the Toronto area to be part of this ensemble. They are all lead players in various orchestras, concert bands, and jazz bands. Band member's accomplishments include: winning a Juno award, conducting a symphonic orchestra, playing onstage for Adele, and even working under Seiji Ozawa. A lot of effort and practice has, and will continue to go into this music. Your contribution will help this music be heard around the world. Your donation will go towards paying the musicians, as well as paying a sound engineer, and videographer who will make a permanent record of the performance for future generations.We will be performing live in Toronto during Jewish Music Week in May of 2017; I know this will be one of the highlights of the Festival.  You may recognize the name Wladyslaw Szpillman, as he was the protagonist in a move called ""The Pianist"". In 1945, Leo Szpilman and his cousin, Wladyslaw, were  released from Aushwitz and transferred to a DP camp. While in the camp, he wrote a composition that was about 12 minutes long. It was played once, and then sat on a shelf for 50 years.After the war, Leo immigrated to Canada, and for many years, he ran the premier dance band on the Toronto scene.In 2002, to celebrate the 10th anniversary of the Holocaust Museum in Washington, the museum contacted Wladyslaw Szpilman and asked him to perform at their gala. “The Pianist” had just been released the year before.  Wladyslaw declined, as he did not think he had enough repertoire under his fingers, but he suggested that they contact his cousin Leo, who had written this symphony, and he might be able to help them. The museum representatives flew to Toronto, but Leo only had some parts, and some of the score was missing. They managed to put together a short piece, and a version a bit longer than the original was performed.Fast forward about 10 years, and Leo asked Paul Hoffert (Lighthouse) to help him re-orchestrate the original work. Paul Hoffert also included some of Leo’s grandfather’s original songs into the arrangement. Together, they worked for almost two years reconstructing the music, and they performed the new work to a standing-room only audience.Last year, I was asked to re-arrange the work for concert band. I was very excited to do this. I have spent the last year re-orchestrating this piece for concert band, and it is now ready to be performed.COMING SOON - THE PERFORMANCE!From the photos, you can see we have already been rehearsing the music. The score is finished, but there is always one more tweak!

It was there that Henry Beigleman, one of the original performers in the Rhapsody, remembered Leo’s piece, and suggested that the organizers contact Leo and try to resurrect the music. Brett Werb, the Museum’s musicologist flew to Toronto, and found the music in a suitcase in Leo’s garage. It had not seen the light of day since 1947.In 2011, Leo asked Paul Hoffert (Lighthouse) to help him re-orchestrate the original work. Paul Hoffert also incorporated some of Leo’s father’s original work into the arrangement, as well as some themes that Leo had previously written. Together, they worked for six months reconstructing the music, expanding the work to a length of 24 minutes. When it was performed at the Ashkenaz Festival in 2012, Leo was present to see this performance for a standing-room only audience.Last year, I was asked to re-arrange the work for Concert Band.

They are a way of life, that loves us back. Adam and Carlee(Co-owners of Sporgy) feel the world is ready and deserving of a more sustainable and healthier meat substitute.We love to enlighten people not only on the health benefits and sustainability of mushrooms but the FLAVORS! There are seemingly endless species of mushrooms on Mother Earth and we want to share our knowledge, inspiration and culinary abilities with the world.Mushrooms are a lean protein, which means they are naturally low in cholesterol, fat, and carbohydrates but rich in fiber, which actually helps burn cholesterol when being digested.In today's world fast food and convenience food are more than just convenient for you. Have you ever considered what goes into your snacks and where they come from?

We at Sprogy feel the best way to counter-balance that, is start a FOOD REVOLUTIONby offering convenient healthy sustainable alternatives to over-processed ecologically damaging unhealthy snacks and junk food. In contrast mushrooms are one of the most efficient and healthy foods to cultivate.","The largest obstacle will be making mushrooms a more popular choice than unhealthier alternatives.

It sustains, nourishes, and refreshes. Unfortunately, >90% of the world population breathes unhealthy air according to the World Health Organization. We have a simple goal: to ensure the air we breathe is pure, effortless, and free of irritants -- no matter where our day takes us.A revolution in designWe are building a wearable breathing device that delivers clean air with a tight and comfortable seal against your nose. Real filters, real results. An alternative to face masks in your daily fight against air pollution.How it works The mechanism is similar to how a mask work, but repackaged differently. When you breathe in, you create negative pressure inside the scaffold filter manifold in the device. Dirty air is drawn in, filtered, and clean air inhaled. When you breathe out, the air comes out of a one-way valve at the bottom. The filter is made of nonwoven fabric (made in the US) supported on a flexible scaffold. We have yet to finalize standards, but currently the fabric filtration efficiency is >95% for PM2.5.To clarify, there is no battery or fan involved.Our storyHello world! My name is Paul Shen the design engineer behind the air filtration wearable. I was originally trained as an electrical engineer at Stanford University and then began attending medical school at Indiana University. I did clinical rotations in pulmonology where I saw first hand what an affliction it is to not be able to breathe.One major contributor to airway pathology is air pollution (second only to smoking). It has reached crisis levels in much of China, India and parts of the developing world. Even western cities like London, Paris, Los Angeles and Salt Lake City suffer from serious air pollution too.With my skillsets in both engineering and medicine, I wanted to help.During my design research, I saw that the only common preventive measure outside one's home is wearing a mask. Some mask brands like 3M and Xiaomi actually do a decent job--assuming that you wear their masks and the seal on your face is good. Now those two assumptions don't often hold.So the crux of the problem boils down to designing something that's easier to wear and provides a much better seal. Throughout medical school I used my spare time to work on the design. Earlier this year I took a leave from school to work on launching the product with my friends at the consultancy Shao Pacific in NYC.  Next stepWe have a functional design prototype and are in position to start manufacturing via injection molding or a mass SLS print. We also need to hire labor to pattern and assemble the filter modules. That's where we need your support!Your inputWe will have different colors and finishes for the body and nose piece.

New fashion is always polarizing, but also bold and ground breaking. A good product with good design will eventually become mainstream.2. Personal fit. The nose piece sits below the nostrils and forms a comfortable seal in the majority of people. We were in fact surprised ourselves about how comfortable the seal is! Still, if your nose is very big or very small (e.g. kids), there may not be a perfect seal. We're actively working on multiple sizes to accommodate as many people as we can.3. Risks of delay with manufacturing. We're doing our best to ensure production and quality control are up to pace, but unexpected delay can come up.

At its core, Drinks Among Friends is focused on bringing lawyers together to spark dialogue about gender roles in corporate America and facilitating an environment where women in the legal community support and empower one another. It also provides a forum where women in the legal community can collaborate and network, while celebrating their successes and sharing their stories. All in all, it's about sharing the power and working to change the game for women in the legal industry.

We’ve been making people laugh on stage and screen for a decade now (our first Edinburgh show was in 2007). We know a few thousand of you follow us on Facebook and Twitter, and over 100,000 of you watched our videos online last year (the DUP one and a Doctor Who one did particularly well). Even better, about 2000 of you came to see our last Edinburgh show – Socks Do Shakespeare in 2016 – and even more came to see the show when it toured throughout 2017.Socks Do Shakespeare was our most successful show, and the one we’re proudest of (though we hope you also liked Socks In Space, Minging Detectives, Boo Lingerie and all the rest), and we want 2018’s to be even better.  We’re going to make a big splash in Edinburgh then tour the show around the country, possibly internationally.And we can do it, with your help.Why are we going to Edinburgh?The Edinburgh Fringe is the biggest showcase in the world. It’s where we attract some of our biggest, most enthusiastic audiences, and where we get seen by the promoters who book us for our subsequent tour dates. The chances of our show coming to a venue near you are based on the impact we make in Edinburgh. It’s also where we garner fabulous reviews, tempting more theatres to book us. And it’s where those lovely people from the TV get to see us, edging the Socks closer to the big audiences we know you’d like to be part of.What do we want the money for?Putting a show on at the Edinburgh Fringe gets that little bit more expensive every year. And, once we’ve paid for our venue hire (we’ve been invited to the prestigious Gilded Balloon for the tenth year running), our listing in the programmes, our accommodation, the tiniest bit of advertising, our posters, our flyers, and sundry other costs that you forget about until they’re upon you, even a small self-contained show like the Scottish Falsetto Socks doesn’t have any change from five thousand pounds. And we don’t see a penny of any profits till the Autumn.Firstly, what’s the show called?A good question, and one that we’ll be answering when it debuts in Leicester. But guess what – you’ll find out first! Yes, no matter how tiny the bit of help you’re able to give us, you’ll get the Top Secret Show Title revelation first. You’re welcome.Secondly, what do you get?Take a look at those rewards (on the right). We’ve put together some smashing things that you and you alone will get your hands on. We hope you’ll lap up a few of these priceless, exclusive goodies and help us make this show a great big biggie!ThirdlyThe astute Socks-followers among you might have noticed that a couple of our past shows (we’re thinking of 2015’s Minging Detectives and 2014’s And So Am I) suffered a little because – and we’re letting you into a bit of a behind-the-scenes trade secret here – in order to fund the show, Kev F (our star performer) was also running comic art classes in libraries in Edinburgh during the days. Which meant he had less time to devote to preparing and promoting the show and, on a couple of occasions, was in danger of losing his voice. Which, as you can imagine, is one thing the Scottish Falsetto Socks show can do without.We’ve never asked for your money quite like this before. We just know we can prepare and run a better show with a little more financial support at the start.So, in order to devote maximum time to writing, preparing and running the best – and funniest – Socks show you’ve ever even dreamed of, we would be helped by every penny you’re able to cough up to stick in our coffers.Loving you in anticipationThe Scottish Falsetto Sock Puppet TheatreAnd so am IAnd so is he","The biggest challenge with the show is ensuring we have adequate writing and prop making time in advance of the show, which is something that can be hard to afford. The booking fees for the venue and the programmes, which are approx £4000 of our bill, need paying already, which means we're working every available hour to get those paid off. Any contribution that enables us to spend more time on the show and less on battling those bills, helps.",https://www.kickstarter.com/projects/kevfcomicartist/findlay-macbeth?ref=discovery_category_newest,kevfcomicartist/findlay-macbeth,"Hi, I'm Kev F Sutherland (you might know my work from Beano, Marvel Comics, Doctor Who Adventures, Viz, Oink, Red Dwarf Smegazine and a hundred other comics). This book, Findlay Macbeth, is my debut graphic novel.I've adapted Shakespeare's tragedy of Macbeth and relocated it in Scotland in 1977. Findlay Macbeth is a mild mannered salesman working for Alba Industries, but when he fails to get the promotion to Managing Director, things turn a bit ugly.This 125 page graphic novel contains passages you'll recognise from Shakespeare's original play, along with story and dialogue of my own with twists and embellishments that I'm rather pleased with, though I say so myself.As well as my 125 page comic story, printed in manga paperback format, I've included the full text of the play of Macbeth, so you need look no further to check out the original.I've aimed to make the book accessible to readers of all ages, and I think it works as a good way of seeing Macbeth the play itself (albeit with some changes). Let's just say, if you're old enough to read the words and see the violence in Shakespeare's play, then you're old enough to read Findlay Macbeth.I'm very pleased and proud of this, my first full-length graphic novel (my previous work having been limited to comic books and annuals) and I really hope you're going to love it too. Your support will enable me to print and publish it, and hopefully in you I've found the reader I've been looking to share my work with.Thanks in anticipation for your help in making Findlay Macbeth see print and reach the outside world.","The biggest worry with this project is that it fails to reach a readership, so your help and support will enable me to meet the printing and promotion costs that can make that happen.And, of course, you will have become the start of that readership yourself. So many thanks for coming in on the ground floor with me,"

Arthur HarkerSome background of the tragedy from wikipedia.com:""The Space Shuttle Columbia disaster occurred on February 1, 2003, when shortly before it was scheduled to conclude its 28th mission, STS-107, the Space Shuttle Columbia disintegrated over Texas and Louisiana during re-entry into the Earth's atmosphere, resulting in the death of all seven crew members. Debris from Columbia fell to Earth in Texas along a path stretching from Trophy Club to Tyler, as well as into parts of Louisiana.The loss of Columbia was a result of damage sustained during launch when a piece of foam insulation the size of a small briefcase broke off from the Space Shuttle external tank (the 'ET' main propellant tank) under the aerodynamic forces of launch. The debris struck the leading edge of the left wing, damaging the Shuttle's thermal protection system (TPS), which shields it from the intense heat generated from atmospheric compression during re-entry. While Columbia was still in orbit, some engineers suspected damage, but NASA managers limited the investigation, on the grounds that little could be done even if problems were found.[1]NASA's original shuttle design specifications stated that the external tank was not to shed foam or other debris; as such, strikes upon the shuttle itself were safety issues that needed to be resolved before a launch was cleared. Launches were often given the go-ahead as engineers came to see the foam shedding and debris strikes as inevitable and unresolvable, with the rationale that they were either not a threat to safety, or an acceptable risk. The majority of shuttle launches recorded such foam strikes and thermal tile scarring.[2] On STS-112, two launches before, a chunk of foam broke away from the ET bipod ramp and hit the SRB-ET Attach Ring near the bottom of the left solid rocket booster (SRB) causing a dent four inches wide and three inches deep in it.[3] After that mission, the situation was analyzed and NASA decided to press ahead under the justification that ""The ET is safe to fly with no new concerns (and no added risk)""[4] of further foam strikes, justification that was revisited while Columbia was still in orbit and Chair of the Mission Management Team (MMT) Linda Ham re-assessed, stating that the “Rationale was lousy then and still is”. Ham as well as Shuttle Program Manager Ron Dittemore had both been present at the October 31, 2002 meeting where this decision to continue with launches was made.[5]During re-entry of STS-107, the damaged area allowed hot gases to penetrate and destroy the internal wing structure,[6] rapidly causing the in-flight breakup of the vehicle. An extensive ground search in parts of Texas, Louisiana, and Arkansas recovered crew remains and many vehicle fragments.Mission STS-107 was the 113th Space Shuttle launch. It was delayed 18times[7] over the two years from its planned launch date of January 11, 2001, to its actual launch date of January 16, 2003. (It was preceded by STS-113.) A launch delay due to cracks in the shuttle's propellant distribution system occurred one month before a July 19, 2002 launch date. The Columbia Accident Investigation Board (CAIB) determined that this delay had nothing to do with the catastrophic failure six months later.[7]The Columbia Accident Investigation Board's recommendations addressed both technical and organizational issues. Space Shuttle flight operations were delayed for over two years, similar to the delay following the Challenger accident. Construction of the International Space Station was put on hold, and for 29 months the station relied entirely on the Russian Federal Space Agency for resupply until Shuttle flights resumed with STS-114 and 41 months for crew rotation until STS-121. Major changes to shuttle operations, after missions resumed, included a thorough on-orbit inspection to determine how well the shuttle's thermal protection system had endured the ascent, and keeping a designated rescue mission at the ready in case irreparable damage was found. Also it had been decided that all missions would be flown only to the ISS so that the crew could use that spacecraft as a ""safe haven"" if need be. Later NASA decided it would be an acceptable risk to make one exception to that policy for one final mission to repair Hubble in its high-altitude low-inclination orbit.""",,https://www.kickstarter.com/projects/1796123309/columbia-memorial-sculpture?ref=discovery_category_newest,1796123309/columbia-memorial-sculpture,"ColumbiaAcross the sky streaked white and blue, incandescence ... turquoise too.

The synergy was real. The musical imagination allowed to run wild. Plus it was Feb...and not much else was going on.Everyone moved into the house for the entire week with practically no guarantees as to what the outcome would be. There were several directions we took that led no where, and others that came from nowhere and led to spontaneous surprises we could have never conceived.We pulled together our funds (mostly me) to rent a professional music studio for two days with a recording engineer to lay down some of the musical ideas we were coming up with by the hour. Many of those ideas are lost forever...others you will hear in the documentary and are downloadable as an EP for one of the rewards.The week ended with a dress to impress Masquerade Ball! It wasn't just any Masquerade Ball though...this was a 'whisper ball' where that guests were not allowed to communicate except with their eyes during the first hour of the event while one musician after another performed solo pieces. After that first hour was the 'mannequin moment' which is included in the film as a major highlight toward the end.Tim Hale from Hales Tales Productions shot hours and hours of video throughout each day and became an integral part of the experience itself. His crash course in editing the surplus of content was quite a milestone.THE GOAL OF THIS KICKSTARTER IS SIMPLE. We have all the material we need to submit our documentary as a feature film to festivals, and our intention is to share this vision and execution of Love and artistic camaraderie in that film festival circuit.I have created a profile for the entire project on filmfreeway.com, which is the quintessential method of reaching the largest audience. With $250 we can submit directly to over 7,000 film festivals around the world. With another $250 we can do extensive promotions by featuring our documentary on the front page, as well as having our trailer considered by top personnel in the industry.So there you have it...once we reach our $500 goal we will be taking all of our hard work and launching it into the world for consideration to be included in as many major film festivals as possible. You may think $500 isn't much, but this whole Covid climate has me reeling, and I'm out here asking for help to maintain my creative spirit and look optimistically into the future.Please know any contribution will be going directly into the proliferation of this work through the filmfreeway.com platform. It took A LOT to do all of this and now it's time to share it with the world. Thank you in advance for your time and consideration!","The major challenge we face with this project is that film festivals won't find it to have the potential to appeal to their audiences...but we are extremely confident in our work, both musically and visually, and the general story strikes an over-archingly positive tone that speaks to both the refined artist and casual observer."

I looked around for someone that must have brought her here, a parent or sibling, but there was no one. As I looked back down at her, I noticed that she was looking up at me now. A single tear had rolled down her cheek and now threatened to jump from the ridge of her chin onto her shoulder. I looked backat the slide that I had been sitting on. Someone had written something on the side. It read, “you may be able to run but the monsters will catch you soon.” Immediately I recognised the handwriting as Emma’s.

There are so many amazing Christmas recordings out there, so why would I have anything unique to offer? Because, as a good friend reminded me, I have something unique to offer. And when my first attempt at a KickStarter fell short, I thought, ""Yup, too much Christmas"". Then other friends came along and said, ""We've got your back. Let's record this."" And we did. They dragged it out of me. So my...no...our gift to you is my personal take on 5 familiar Christmas songs that I hope will lift you up, inspire you and remind you that Jesus came to bring us ""Comfort and Joy"" in the midst of pain and sorrow.Supporting this EP will cover the remaining production and distribution costs to iTunes and other online outlets. I'm glad to have Bulwark Mastering wrapping up the production, and am very thankful to have the artistic contributions of Grimm Studio, Andrew Marshall of Westward, Rob ""Shane"" Dean, Holcomb, Temple Veil and my son, Tim. Thank you for your interest and support of this project! I am looking forward to the doors of opportunity this EP will open for more music projects down the road. ",There are still some production and distribution costs ahead and this project being fully funded at $500 or more will help us meet the goal of the digital release date of December 15 and print a limited number of CD's for local distribution. Thanks!

I found myself re-reading the collection and discovered a strong theme throughout the books. Good practical thinking. I wanted to start to share this through these posters. SixImpossibleThings that are totally possible, is aboutself-reliance, and being a better person simply by doing what we should all strive to do.Lewis Carroll's stories carry an easy to understand philosophy and common sense. It is all set against the backdrop of Wonderland where all of the inhabitants are unreasonable. The posters represent six of the best themes that come out of the books.

Creating a showcase isn't cheap unfortunately. There are a lot of over head cost that we are raising funds for inorder to produce the best show that we can. The cost include the space for the showcase, chairs for seating, a raised stage for performers, D.J. to cue music and keep the crowd lively, rehearsal space, photographer, lodging for guest performers, marketing materials and decorations to set the tone. It takes many hours of time and preparation to create and manage all aspects of a Showcase thissize.

This is a family show and encourage all performers to create a piece of inspiration through dance. Last year our cost were nearly $1500 with the space rental, stage, backdrop, chairs and decor. We were able to save most of the stage but there are a few replacements needed to create a safe platform for our performers. The show will be in the gmnaisium of the Boys & Girls Club with a 24 by 16 ft. stage, 200 chairs and 3 bleacher seating (curtousy of the Boys & Girls Club), a backdrop, lighting, and boothes with local small vendors all along the perimiter.

https://www.kickstarter.com/projects/samanxiety/socially-awkward-misfit?ref=discovery_category_newest,samanxiety/socially-awkward-misfit,"Socially Awkward Misfit is a comic I draw that is loosely based on my own life. It features the character Sam, (an acronym of Socially Awkward Misfit) an introvert who suffers from social anxiety and depression.So what is an introvert? Well, someone who is quiet and doesn't feel the need to do much socializing. They are happy to spend time alone, and aren't necessarily shy. They don't like small talk, however they can often speak in length about subjects which they find more interesting.As for social anxiety, it is an intense fear of social situations. Anything from answering the phone, walking down the street, to eating in public and being in a group are all things that sufferers can find extremely uncomfortable.My comic covers my introversion and anxiety, along with depression in a darkly humorous way. I regularly publish the webcomic at www.sociallyawkwardmisfit.com. Over the past year or so, I have developed the comic quite a lot.I believe in keeping most of my content free for the followers and visitors of my blog, and will continue my webcomic on my site as usual. But I also have plans to do some longer Sam comics. I have recently finished off a longer comic, of 10 pages, which I am hoping to get printed in a book also including a compilation of the best of the last year or so of Socially Awkward Misfit.The longer comic is a black comedy story about a day in the life of Sam, and through seeing his own thoughts, we can share his anxiety and anguish.The printed book will include the exclusive new comic, combined with a selection of the best of Socially Awkward Misfit cartoons I've produced over the last year. This will be a book of approximately 50 pages, with soft covers and a size of 210 x 148 mm (A5).This is where Kickstarter comes in. I think this would be an ideal opportunity for others to get involved in the strip and to help make it happen.RewardsThere are numerous awards available on the right, from as low as £1. Here's some more details:£1 Thanks on my website£5 A PDF of the comic book.£10 Signed copy of the comic book.£15 Signed copy plus special thanks at start of the comic book.The finished book, with thanks to you credited inside also are included in all the rewards below:£20 Digital drawing of you (or someone you know) in the Socially Awkward Misfit style. This could even feature Sam as well, and can have a special message of your choice. See below...Just send a photo or give me a few details of the person to be drawn.For £25 the image will be printed on good quality photo paper and sent to you.£30 Original illustration of Socially Awkward Misfit on A4 size watercolour paper (21 x 29.7 cm) This will be similar to the one below.£45 Original illustration similar to above, but on a larger size A3 (29.7 x 42 cm)","I have recently completed the comic so all I need to do is put together the compilation. This should be fairly straightforward. Only challenge is if I get a lot of artwork to do and lots of comics to print, but I have set a deadline of April 2015, as I think that will give me enough time to complete it. I work quickly, so I'm fairly confident I get it completed and delivered early 2015.",https://www.kickstarter.com/projects/samanxiety/anxiety-the-third-socially-awkward-misfit-comic-book?ref=discovery_category_newest,samanxiety/anxiety-the-third-socially-awkward-misfit-comic-book,"Meet Sam. Sam stands for Socially Awkward Misfit, the name of my comic. It started a few years back as a few sketchy doodles relating to my own anxious awkwardness. I didn't realise that there were a lot of people around the world who related to the same things I went through.I have developed the comic throughout the years, and even though it's only slightly less sketchier, it still continues to resonate, mostly with those who are more on the introverted side.The comic has enabled me to get certain frustrations off my chest, such as lampooning people who are rude to introverts and ignorant to sufferers of mental health conditions.I also found it enabled me to create exaggerations of my own awkwardness in order to be able to laugh at myself.It is also heart warming to know others relate to it, and that they have found it helpful and amusing at times when they have been feeling low.I have already published two SAM books so far, and this is the campaign for my third book, 'Anxiety'.This features a brand new story of Sam and his struggles with social anxiety. It covers some of the issues that sufferers of this disorder have to go through on a daily basis. I hope it will help others with anxiety to realise that they are not alone, and to give those who don't have anxiety an insight into how this can affect daily life.The book also features a compilation of the last two and half years of SAM comics. These are centred on Sam's life as an introvert, with social anxiety, depression, general awkwardness and the odd bit of insomnia thrown in there.There will also be some new comics and mini-stories in the book, which will be around 50 pages, in full colour, measuring 210 x 148 mm (A5), saddle stitched with300GSM Silk cover.I think Kickstarter is the ideal site to get projects off the ground, as it allows me to publish my own books without trying to rely on a publisher who won't understand the issues, and at the same time it allows me to connect to my audience personally.Here's how you can get involved with helping the book come to life, and at the same time get your hands on it and some other good stuff...£2 - £6 : Digital ComicsFor £2, you will get a PDF version of the new book, for £4 you will also get a PDF of the second book 'Positivity & Negativity'.

https://www.kickstarter.com/projects/dragonanatomy/realistic-dragon-sculpture?ref=discovery_category_newest,dragonanatomy/realistic-dragon-sculpture,"I am an artist and love drawing dragons. In my opinion dragons are beautiful creatures. They are often depicted as heavy dangerous beasts, but I wanted to create a new kind of dragon.Everyone has their own unique preferences. I like friendly dragons similar to the ones in ""How to Train Your Dragon"" but less cartoonish and more elegant and realistic. I wanted to create a dragon that does not exist as a sculpture yet. I thought of a dragon that looks feminine - supple, fast and elegant like a cat, dangerous but also gentle. A dragon which challenges the fantasy again. A character that does not correspond to the cliché, but opens a new chapter in dragon design.In order to bring the fantasy creature to life in a realistic way, I studied the anatomy of various animals. After many years of illustrating dragons and acquiring a lot of experience, I created this anatomical correct 3D dragon. Now I'd like to share my dragon design with you and present it in the form of very different products, as an art print, an amulet, a relief, a bust and as a full body dragon figure. My dragon is different from many other heavy-scaled dragons. It is covered with small round scales, which emphasizes its excellent agility. The appearance is thin and light, so you can see its realistic musculature and extraordinary elegance. In contrast, it also has curved twisted horns, which show the power and strength of the graceful dragon. It's beautiful spiked back ridge, finned tail tip and showy neck scales make it appear proud and remarkable.I need your help to complete these artworks. With your donation I can pay the 3D printing and the material for the molds and casting. High quality material and production is very important to me!Choose your favorite picture of the dragon and get a DIN A 4 (standard letter size) print of it! If the funding target reaches 2000€, two more will be unlocked!Represents a round blue resin jewel, textured like a crystal or gemstone with a golden dragonhead (6 cm diameter). Each piece is unique.Represents a 3D relief wall decor (about 30 cm tall). The elegant golden dragon stands on a resin geode, textured like crystal or gemstone. Each piece is unique. Get this extraordinary dragon bust! It is a special eye catcher you can use for decoration, customized figure painting or tabletop games like RPGs and war games (about 10 cm tall).The amazing full body figure will be realy big - about 30 cm tall. So you can see all the beautiful details.Be creative! Aside from the elegant white, customize your dragon and let it shine in your favorite colors.I designed the dragon particularly for this purpose - so you can decide on as many different color variants as you can imagine. Websites:www.anja-kostka.deFollow me on:Instagram, Twitter, facebook, Deviantart, YouTube, Artstation","I informed myself about the resin casting process in detail and have in the past created a detailed digital 3D object for printing and casting.However, I don´t have any practical experience in mold making and casting. I aim for a very high quality cast. It is possible that I may need several attempts to make a perfect mold and find the best workflow.Because of that, I have estimated the delivery period very generously. If everything works out right away, I will ship sooner.With your support, I am confident I will master this challenge!",https://www.kickstarter.com/projects/dragonanatomy/dragon-worlds-calendar-2020?ref=discovery_category_newest,dragonanatomy/dragon-worlds-calendar-2020,"I am an artist with a passion for fantasy worlds and dragons.

To share these mystical worlds and fascinating dragons with you I aim to paint very detailed and realistic. Now, after years of training, education and experience, I present my artworks to you.For 2020 I want to do something really special. Namely the Dragon Worlds calendar!

We started with the basic creature. Here they are as they might be, when found in the wild. Each has their own unique looks, and personalities. Any dino fan could use one of these, from gaming at a table with adults to playing with your kid. They are great on their own!As this Kickstarter continues, and we meet our goals, the variations are released.The variations begin with armor.When we meet our second stretch goal, the Armored Versions are unlocked! Ready for battle, these new versions of the creatures wear armor, giving you a battle-ready prehistoric creature army to add to your collection.With stretch goal 3, an alternative pose is released! Each of the creatures has a secondary pose that was chosen just for them, and is available with the basic form AND the armored form!After that, things get more interesting, and variable, depending on the creature and the stretch goal. Some become ride able with a saddle. Others have more poses. There are also other accessory versions possible. There are a lot of stretch goals planned, so keep checking in to see what's next!But this Kickstarter isn't just about creatures. There are lots of accessory pieces that can be used with them, or on their own with other items in your collection! Set up your Base Camp as a safe haven, before setting your players loose on an adventure. You could use the prehistoric creatures to transport these accessories, or bring the accessories to carry gear to capture one. Or, combine with other pieces in your collection to create whatever works for you!

( Not Quite, Up There, and Y.E.T. are compositions of mine)My vision for this project is to do something innovative. Sure, I could record 5 standards out there, doing my own arrangements with cool intros, endings, and interludes. Then I could sprinkle a few of my own tunes into the album and call it ""Introducing Collin Shook"". It could be successful, and popular. After all, this is the recipe many great and famous jazz players have taken to launch their career. I may do this at some point. But first........I want something a bit different. I want to make a flowing, musical concept, not just play famous melodies and show off my amazing be-bop chops (I wish). I have a specific group of related songs, maybe you could call them a ""variation on a theme"", and I want to create soundscapes, new experiences, and some bitchin' grooves. What I need funding for is tuning of the piano, studio time/editing, first run of CD and vinyl copies, and legal stuff (copyrighting). I'm still researching the most effective and efficient use of dollars for this project. Rest assured, your cash will not go to buying expensive reverb layers or synthesized instrument patches.As you can see, I am not looking to just make a pop CD that I can sell at my shows and put up for sale on Amazon and CD Baby. I want to make a heart-felt statement and document my understanding of the musical universe at this point in my life. I want to say something more than having a groove and a hook lyric that will woo the masses. I hope to make something revolutionary, a deviation from the mainstream, a unique document of deep, meaningful music.Thanks for being here KickStarters!",,https://www.kickstarter.com/projects/2072125990/derivatives-collin-shook-trios-debut-all-original?ref=discovery_category_newest,2072125990/derivatives-collin-shook-trios-debut-all-original,"Meet us: Collin Shook (keyboards and piano), Dylan DeRobertis (double-bass), Matt Pirc (drum-kit).We are a group of musicians who love our job: Dylan is a classical bassist who plays in the Tucson Symphony Orchestra, and holds a Masters Degree in classical bass performance from the Indiana University. Dylan is a master of the double bass, and he rocks the E-bass just as hard. He's the backbone of our trio. Matt is a senior at the University of Arizona, finishing up his Bachelors in Jazz Performance on drum-kit. You can throw anything at him and he plays it like it's easy. Matt brings so much creative energy and improv to our trio. I am a pianist and multi-instrumentalist. My mom, a classical pianist and teacher, got me started at age 3 1/2. Since getting addicted to jazz when I was 17, I have been practicing, composing, and performing in the live music scene wherever I have lived. This is my school.As you can see, we are all really serious about music. About 2 years ago, we started playing together in Tucson. You know.....pick up gigs, background muzak at restaurants, and the occasional louder gigs at bars on 4th Avenue (Tucson's downtown music and bar strip) where we've got freedom to play our originals and rock out.We are enjoying these little gigs, but we are after the concerts and festivals. We want to share our music with people who want to listen to it. People who will understand it. http://soundcloud.com/collinshookmusicwww.collinshook.bandcamp.comWe believe that with this album, we can put ourselves closer to that.This album is all original, with influences from all directions. The original album title, #Occupy, refers to a 3-song suite we composed, consisting of a short ""Prelude to Occupation"", as well as ""#Occupy - Movement 1"" and ""Movement 2"". They will be 2nd or 3rd on the record, and they are all variations on a theme, involving a central melody and central chord progression, but expressed through break-beat drums and also a real slow, introspective ballad.For the first tune, we have ""Poca Cosa, The Little One"", a spicy samba number that was inspired by one of my favorite Mexican restaurants in all of Tucson.Bringing in the Hard-Bop Jazz influence from the 60's, we've got a 6/8 waltz titled ""Mantra"", and a hard swinging 4/4 tune called ""Not Quite"", both of which were composed in 2010. Then another #Occupy inspired tune called ""Derivatives"" (now the title of the album), which goes from a grand piano ballad to a groovy 7/4 funk.For a more modern interpretation of swing, we've got another original called ""No More Rhythm and Blues"", which we take way out into outer space. Also, a solo piano tune to close the album out called ""Mind Mehld"" in homage to Brad Mehldau, one of my favorite pianists.Song list:..........We have around $800 dollars to make this album that we have saved up from our gigs. We need another $500 or so to help fill out the budget. What doesn't go to studio time (state of the art, great mics, the best piano in town, etc...) will go into professional pressing of the album, and having enough of them to make a few for bucks for our next full length album and keep the ball rolling. Here are the numbers:$400 budget for studio time (just 1 days worth), $800 for pressing of the album, $50 for digital download cards, and $100 budget for promotion (to get radio play, copyrights, and an agent to get the album into the hands of the right people, etc..) Compared to most, this is a small budget for an album...........This is where you come in. As a patron of the arts, you can give a small amount, or large amount, and contribute to the world of music and jazz. It's not just a donation. You get something real back. Whether you are simply per-ordering the album, getting multiple copies signed, mementos (i.e, a touring poster for your walls at home), or even attending the concert, you are getting something in return for your contribution.Check our music out online, see what we are doing, and at least reserve a copy of this album for yourself. We are sure you will like it !!!!-Collin",

In our society men are looked down upon for expressing emotions of weakness, crying, sadness, despair. Women are discouraged from showing powerful feelings like anger and rage. Women need to own that rage in order to heal from it.Recent history has been hard on women in the United States. Headlines show rapists getting little or no jail time while their victims are having their rights to an abortion stripped away. Women who have nonviable fetuses are being forced to carry to term by cruel legislation written by powerful men who are attempting to have Roe vs Wade overturned. Services for reproductive health and birth control are having their funding cut. Violence against women continues at a staggering rate. Women who speak out often experience gaslighting or disbelief. We are told we are overly emotional. I know of many women who feel psychologically beaten and powerless. We have held in our rage long enough.I have been groped, molested, abused, and yes, raped. I have been told I am too much, too emotional. I have been stripped of my voice and had my power taken away. I will not be silent any longer.I have invited women who feel the rage, who need to scream to heal, to come to my studio for a complimentary portrait session. It will be totally in their control. All of the portraits will be shot in black and white, with dramatic lighting portraying each woman's individual story of rage and healing. How much they want to share is totally up to them. I intend to create a safe space of support that also gives a voice to their stories. I already have 8 women ready to photograph within the first few days of promoting the project and expect many more.This is an idea that I’m following with my gut and my heart. I want to help women heal. I want to give a voice to women who have held in that same rage. My loudest, clearest voice has always been through my art. It is my healing and I want to gift that to others.I'm raising money to cover costs associated with my time and general expenses and to provide each woman with a ready to hang portrait from her session and a photo book. My goal is to make that photo book available for purchase and use the profits to donate towards a nonprofit organization that supports women's health and safety. I'd like to be able to travel to other women outside of the San Antonio area to capture their stories as well.Here is a breakdown of where the money will be going:Thank you for your help to bring this project to life.San Antonio Express News Article: San Antonio is failing 51 percent of itself and its future","The biggest challenge is getting the project out there in front of a wide audience.

In our society men are looked down upon for expressing emotions of weakness, crying, sadness, despair. Women are discouraged from showing powerful feelings like anger and rage. Women need to own that rage in order to heal from it. To deny our anger is to deny the path to healing. To keep silent is to deny that it is a problem that needs to be addressed.Violence against women knows no boundaries. We are sisters, mothers, grandmothers, daughters. We are rich, poor, of all body types and colors.We are young and old.Violence against women is a big problem in our society. Here in San Antonio, Texas. Statistics for 2018 show that there were over 1,300 reported incidents of rape in our area. This is likely under reported as women are often afraid to speak out. Sadly, Bexar County was first in Texas with the family violence homicide rate for women over the last two years. It's dangerous to be a woman in our city.The aim of my project is to allow women to express their anger and give them an emotional release towards healing by telling their stories. I want to empower them through having their voices heard. I also hope to bring awareness to the emotional impact survivors of violence deal with on a daily basis. The trauma from abuse and rape can last years. PTSD, depression, and chronic illness all plague survivors.Women who speak out often experience gaslighting or disbelief. We are told we are overly emotional. I know of many women who feel psychologically beaten and powerless. We have held in our rage long enough.I have invited women who feel the rage, who need to scream to heal, to come to my studio for a complimentary portrait session. It will be totally in their control. All of the portraits will be shot in black and white, with dramatic lighting portraying each woman's individual story of rage and healing. How much they want to share is totally up to them. I intend to create a safe space of support that also gives a voice to their stories. My goal is to photograph between 50-100 women.I have a growing list of women who want to be involved.The photos will be presented in a gallery show in the fall of 2020 as well as printed into a book. I pledge half of the proceeds from my share of the sale of the book to a local nonprofit dealing with rape or domestic violence that the women who participate will have input in choosing. I have a publisher lined up to print the book, but I am still looking for a gallery to host the show.I anticipate that costs related to the project will include:That's where I need your help. I cannot pull off the project alone. Help me give a voice to women who have experienced violence and who long to have their story heard. Be a part of the catalyst for change that helps end violence against women in our society.","Challenges include scheduling women to come into the studio for their portraits, managing and setting timelines for finishing the project, getting the project out to a broader audience, ability to delegate tasks such as mailing rewards, making copies, emailing updates. Right now I'm doing all of the work by myself and would welcome a volunteer to help a couple of hours a week."

The story follows them as they learn how they obtained their powers, while also trying to help their city fight an overwhelming amount of crime.Set in 2019, CRIT takes on a growing amount of crime that has broken out in their home city of New Orleans. Funded by one of the worlds largest tech companies, Technetic, they take on gangs, drug dealers, and crime kingpins. In an effort to turn a profit on this investment, Technetic publicly endorses the team causing a new type of arms race as other companies try to create their own type of hero, but are these companies creating heroes or villains?CRIT is challenged with proving themselves as heroes, while learning how to use their powers. They struggle to conform to being stereotypical ""heroes"", and asked to compromise by Technetic in order to garner local funding.What would you do if you woke up with some kind of super power?CRIT: Righteous Indignation is a 34 page graphic novel, kicking off a new series of heroic adventures and challenges!This Kickstarter campaign is to fund the printing of issue #1. Issue 1 is completely written, inked, and lettered. Some final coloring and edits need to be done, but we are confident in delivering a quality product by the end of this campaign. Once the campaign ends and the funds have been collected, we're sending the files to the printer so you can have the book in your hands as soon as possible. Any funds raised above and beyond the target will go into fulfilling stretch goal rewards for our backers and be invested back into future series of the book.","The book is complete, and the only thing that needs to be done is have it sent off to the printer. The only challenge we face right now is getting the funding to pay the colorists for their work, and the printer for the books.",https://www.kickstarter.com/projects/homebrewedheroes/crit-2-vigilante-pursuit?ref=discovery_category_newest,homebrewedheroes/crit-2-vigilante-pursuit,"Thank you for checking out our Kickstarter! We have been passionately working on this series for over a year, and we are excited to get this second book in everyone's hands. As kids we all loved comics, and so it is really cool for us to create and be in our own. CRIT is based off of a tabletop game that we play each month, and then Chris turns the sessions into comics! Each character you see is based off of their real life persona, so you are not seeing scripted fights or dialog. Everything you see in the book was played out on a table, and the events were determined by the roll of the dice.If you play tabletop games, then you know that things can get crazy pretty fast, and so does our campaign. All of our characters are friends in real life, and have similar relationships to what you see in the book. So, welcome to our group, we hope you like our sarcasm, banter, bickering and action as much as we do!CRIT is a superhero comic based on a tabletop game created by Homebrewed Heroes. It is an action/adventure series that centers around a group of friends that gained powers after an accident at work. The corporate tech giant known as Technetic, learns of their powers and looks to profit off the group fighting criminal activity in New Orleans, their home city. As the team becomes more established, they learn that a rival company, Alchemex, has dirty secrets as the company seeks to discover the source of the team’s powers. The first year of the series follows the team as they challenge Alchemex, develop their powers, and grapple with choices that test whether or not they can truly call themselves...superheroes. Following the events that took place in the first issue, CRIT is sent out on their next mission: find and stop whoever has been hijacking shipments of Technetic's military prototypes. Sounds pretty straight forward right? Well, our story is based off of a D&D campaign, and if you know how those go you know that nothing is straight forward!If you haven't read #1 yet, we can add it to any tier, just message us! Also, if you want to customize your bundle please shoot us a message and we can work on it with you. We understand that Kickstarter can make it hard to add-on items, so we want to make sure that you get the covers and items that you want!If you are a fan of buddy action flicks from the 90's and superheroes, you will enjoy this book.Creator, Writer, Artist, World Builder - After more than 20 years of creating characters, and writing stories, Christopher Michael is the creator of CRIT, and the universe they live in. When he decided to create CRIT, he used a resource that he knew well: Dungeons and Dragons. What is a cool and different way to write a story? Organically through the actions of players. But the problem was that there were no source books with material he wanted to use, so he took the rules and created his own game to master. Chris records the game sessions, and turns the story into the comic you read.You can find Chris on the Instagram @homebrewedcomicsDetails, Shading, Additional Colors - Cristiano has been a lover and fan of comics since he was a child, but it was in 2013 that he became part of the as a comic book colorist. Working over the years on small projects for independent publishers, he aims to fulfill his dream of one day working with big publishers in the comic book industry. He currently lives in São Paulo, Brazil. He joined the Homebrewed team after Chris reached out about help on this issue. Cristiano brings the book to life with his amazing details, and talented use of colors. The entire team was blown away with the work he did, and cannot wait to see what he brings next. He can be found on Instagram @crisscoloristCreator and Writer of Bolder, Wed Developer, Editor - Terreyl writes the dialog and actions of Bolder, and provides ideas and feedback on the world of CRIT to help drive the narrative. He is influenced by many different media types, and brings a love of Sci-Fi, Anime, and heroes to the team. He understands that heroes need to flaws. and pushes for balance in the team. He also runs the Homebrewed website www.hbhcomics.com and is an editor of the comic.Creator and Writer of Caliber, Editor, World Builder - Brad is just as sarcastic in real life as his character Caliber is in the book. He writes the actions and dialog of Caliber, and helps to direct the story. As a seasoned DM and the person who introduced Christopher to Dungeons and Dragons, he has been telling stories and creating characters his entire life. He has helped build the world of CRIT with Chris, and directed a lot of the ideas Chris had. He also balances the classes to keep characters from being too powerful. He has read every game manual, and understands that in Dungeons and Dragons it is important to keep the power balanced so that the game stays fun. Brad is also an editor of the comics.Creator and Writer of Spectre - Austin is the game guy. You may see him cosplaying at PAX, or streaming on Twitch. He brings a wealth of Dungeons and Dragons knowledge as he is a DM in his own games as well.Creator and Writer of Reach - Obie has been into comics since he was a kid, and loves the opportunity to create characters in a medium that he loves. He can usually be found in Twitter wars with Rob Liefeld (with his infamous toilet picture).","With the situation with COVID-19 there are greater risks than would normally be present. This is most likely to have an impact on the postage times. We have built in a bit of extra time into the plan to take account of this. The book is almost finished at the time of posting, so we will not have any delays in production."

Each die has a face for +3 , +2, +1, 0 bonus, -1, & -2.This is the second time I have tried to get this going in Kickstarter. The first was a longshot. The plan was to have plastic dice custom molded. It was expensive andhad a very large minimum order for the work to make sense. This time I have sorted another much easier way to get this done. Laser engraved wooden dice!! Please feel free to look at my old Kickstarter, I have a video there. BUT remember, that was plastic dice, this one is wood.I have located a reliable source for the wooden blanks. The pictures here are actual prototypes of the dice engraved with a CO2 laser. I also have the artwork completed (I have been busy over the last 3 years).Once this gets kicked off (surely we can come up with $500??) I will get the laser engraver in place and set up to do bulk engravings. There are still 36 separate engravings for each set (6 dice x 6 different images) so it will be something of a pain to run the dice. I sincerely hope to beat the deadline but I am giving myself plenty of time. There are details to work out for the laser settings and best colors. Please remember this will be laser cut wood, the dice will not all match perfectly!The part I am least happy about is limiting the number of pledge options. But with wooden dice there just aren't that many ways to do this. Keeping it very simple also makes success much more likely.Here are pictures of the prototype dice. The artwork will be the same. We should have the engraving show up a bit more consistently, but on wood they can't match perfectly.","Here is the biggest risk:  Wood is complicated.  The laser actually vaporizes some of the wood and burns what is left.  This process depends on the density of the wood.  You can see some of the differences in the prototype images.  I will try to pick the most consistent dice, but please do not expect your dice to match perfectly.There are risks in any project.  The risks in this one are pretty small.

The cool, dry, intellectual humor that goes into the tale of a little boy and his imaginary friend has been a favorite of mine since it was published in newspapers in my teenage years.Bless this Mess is a project I started a few years ago which I initially wanted to do based on my son Micah, who reminds me a lot of Calvin, and the angel and devil he hangs out with who give him advice and take him on misadventures like the little rascal he is. However it quickly evolved into a strip about my whole family, leaving the angel and devil sidekicks behind.It was published in magazines and newspapers in Scandinavia for a couple years, but I couldn't really make a go of it in the states, and got too busy working on other projects that actually paid the bills to keep it going.

By removing the conventional line based grid on a typical calendar, we allow you all the space to highlight key dates and events.The primary visual markers are the abbreviated months, weekends are highlighted with large hairline crosses. A limited number of key dates, including (UK) bank holidays, have been introduced across the calendar.The nature of the wall planner enables you to quickly see the whole year in a snap shot, the weekends act as reference points to work between or to, depending on which are more important for you.The gradient wash which covers the calendar is reflective of the seasons during the year, slowly warming up and then decreasing in line with the ambient temperatures.––The wall planner has an overall flat size of 480x680mm (just a touch smaller than B2), we've made it this size to make it moreeconomicalto produce and post and also so that it doesn't dominate too much of yourwall space.We are planning on having this printed on Olin Smooth High White 150gsm paper.

We'll let you know if there are any changes!","Our aim is to ensure master artwork for the final calendar/poster, including final print specification, will be concluded and ready to go for when our project listing comes to an end. If we achieve our funding target, and assuming we don't need to make too many changes to the design and specification following backer feedback, our main challenge will be get them all packaged up and posted out as soon as possible upon receipt of delivery, so to ensure they get in the hands of backers ideally before the festive period, and at worst just after the turn of the new year!!",https://www.kickstarter.com/projects/581502567/make-100-limited-edition-pieces-of-a-100-year-old?ref=discovery_category_newest,581502567/make-100-limited-edition-pieces-of-a-100-year-old,"What do we hope to achieve?We're taking a 100 year old $1 bill and slicing it up into 100 pieces, and in turn seek 100 backers in 100 different locations across the world to bring them all back together again as one, online.Everything has a story to tell:The $1 bill is an icon of history, and this 100 year old artefact probably has one hell of a story to tell. Somehow along the way it's ended up in the UK, but rather than being stuffed in a draw somewhere to be forgotten again, we're adding a very new chapter to this particular banknotes tale.What will youreceive and what do wewant you to do? At the very least all backers willreceivetheir limited edition piece. Beyond this, we want to host further information about the pieces upon the website. So we will invite backers to share with us details on its new location, and hopefully even a photo of it in their hands. If backers also choose to share commentary or feedback on the idea, then that would be a bonus.The available pieces: Below we have shown enlarged visuals of all the pieces available to backers. There are only 100 in total, they're all one of a kind and totally unique – so they're all truly limited edition. Take a look, find one you like, and scroll through probably the longest reward listing in Kickstarter history to find therelevant number, and pledge.Why are we doing it? For us, Make 100 couldn't have taken us any further away from the routine of running of a design studio than it has. For once, we've got the opportunity to share an idea with a massive and diverse group of people, and to let it run wild, to find its own way. We're excited to see how people will engage and react to it, and to learn about what motivates each backer to pledge their support. Above and beyond all this though, we just want to have fun with it.Which piece will you choose? There are any number of reasons why backers will pledge their support and choose one piece over another – which is one of the things we're fascinated by. For some it could be purely a financial thing, where they can only afford so much. For others; it might be the design of the piece, or the fact that the absolute highest and lowest numbers are seen as the most desirable amongst collectors, or the number has a particular significance - like a birth year.Why are we using a $1 bill and not a £1 note? Have you ever seen a 1917 British banknote? It doesn't come close to the 1917 US dollar in terms of design. Basically, every part of the $1 bill is beautifully illustrated – so for us this makes each piece far more interesting to look at. Plus, the US Dollar is the global currency, so more people will relate to it.Why are pledge values set in increments of scale? It you haven't guessed already, we've really pushed the boat out on the 100 theme. We looked at introducing a common value across all the pieces, but were really drawn to just seeing how people will engage with the system we've set. We hope to find backers for all the 100 pieces — but if not, our aim is to find just enough to help us hit our target and cover costs, so we can at least offer the remaining pieces through the website.What's the plan after this project ends? 99.9% of our studio time is committed to fulfilling client projects – after all we all have bills to pay, and 99.9% of our personal time is committed to being with the kids – after all, we only get that time once. But no matter what, and as we have done before, we will honour the project if it successfully funds. If we have the fortune to exceed our target, then this will be used to buy studio time – which will allow us to get off the ground other ideas we would dearly love to push through Kickstarter.Thank youfor taking the time to get this far down the page. We hope that you find it interesting, and so much so that you see the bigger idea. If you have any question, then please do feel free to get in touch. David + Ruth","We run a small design studio by day, so are well equipped to overcome almost any challenge. Our only concern is with slicing the note into pieces, and how precise we can be when doing it - after all we've only got one chance - so that's why were getting help from an experienced illustrator who's a dab hand with a scalpel."

With just a little bit of work, it could transport us and our friends (you) anywhere on the eastern seaboard.Steel boats are strong and durable, but every so often they need to be drydocked and their hulls completely cleaned, scraped, repaired and repainted.We're way overdue for hauling her, and if we wait through another winter, she probably won't ever be seaworthy again. She could be a fine houseboat for years to come, but we have a limited and closing window to restore her to her former glory. (She ferried New Yorkers to Staten Island from 1953 to 1962).Everyone who sees the boat for the first time asks: when can we go out on it? We are constantly begged by our friends to make it operational, so that we can:For example, earlier this month we hosted a 40th birthday party (while docked) and later this month we're a hosting a traveling troubadour for concert (July 25th -- you come!) But we envision more: Burlesque cruises, floating immersive theatre, projection mapping canals, etc.With your help, we'll all be spending more time on the water by September 2014.Boat ThingsThe Taurus is the labor of love of a World War II Navy mechanic who wanted to raise his family on a boat. In 1969, he purchased a decommissioned crew boat for $1. Working with his own hands over the next 8 years, he turned an empty steel shell into the most amazing home you've ever seen:Elderly and no longer able to perform the maintenance work himself, he put it up for sale, looking for someone he could trust to devote the attention and devotion of a one-of-a-kind boat like the Taurus deserves.The boat is a floating museum of charm. Justin likes to refer to it as 'the Millennium Falcon of houseboats', but that doesn't do justice to its class.This is for you and for us.Fair winds and following seas!P.S. Thank you to Danielle Furfaro and KenYapelli for the video help!P.P.S. If you're interested in supporting other awesome art spaces in Brooklyn, please check out House of Yes!","We've estimated the repair costs as much as possible, but there is an element of uncertainty when working with a vessel this old. While we have done our due diligence, having had a diver inspect the underside of the hull and consulted a with a specialist in boat restoration, the estimated range of repair costs remains broad. It is possible that repairs may be as low as $10,000. On the high end, it is unlikely but possible that the total repair costs could approach $25,000 (at a maximum, for a total hull replacement). If this happens, we will borrow the remaining funds (credit cards, family etc). We won't know what the exact repair cost until the boat is already in dry-docked, where we have no choice but to repair it (it is, after all, our home). For the reason, there is little risk to our Kickstarter backers of a funded project but incomplete subsequent repairs: unless we finish the repairs, we will be homeless.If the cost of the repairs are less than the total funds raised through Kickstarter, we will outfit the boat with the tools to better facilitate our reward events and future gatherings: classy rain cover for the top deck, lighting, etc.",https://www.kickstarter.com/projects/justinlange/in-case-a-uke?ref=discovery_category_newest,justinlange/in-case-a-uke,"In 2017, we received a Black Rock City Honorarium grant to build emergency ukulele stands.

Because of the harsh dust and sun, the ukuleles need to be quality instruments to hold their tune while out on their adventures. The project goal of $500 will allow us to purchase instruments.Our stretch goal is to also be able to cover the costs of logistical support. It costs $1,000 just to ship the art out to the playa and back.

Every little bit helps!#incaseauke","The biggest risk of our project is that people won't interact respectfully with the piece: the Ukuleles are meant to be played for as long as desired, but then returned. We'll be experimenting with other messaging this year to try and make it clear that the ""gift"" is the experience of playing the ukes, but that no one can physically claim the instrument as permanently theirs.

https://www.kickstarter.com/projects/kendel-ventonda/the-forgotten-chronicles-role-play-game?ref=discovery_category_newest,kendel-ventonda/the-forgotten-chronicles-role-play-game,"The Forgotten Chronicles began as a Roleplaying game in the style of AD&D, Pathfinder and multiple other Pen and Paper games. Based on this I wrote a book, which you can already purchase on Amazonand DriveThruRPGin the german version. We're still working on the translation.This Roleplaying game is special because of its simple and modular system, which is easy to learn for new players and it can be extended endlessly. You can even write your own expansions for it.In addition we completely parted from the classical elements, and added completely new ones. The Races come completly from nature and are inspired from classical literature. From feudal Middle-Ages to Steampunk. Everyone can find his / her setting.At first planned as instructions, we now want to start a little series in which our old testing team continues their adventures. We want to document it and involve you, the viewer directly into it.Every episode lasts about 20 - 30 minutes and a season then lasts a whole evening which usually goes on for around 4 - 6 hours. Uninteresting passages we of course cut out and instead we cut in single comments of the player, who describe what they thing in special situations. The viewer, other then the players has always the option to read secret notes and if he / she wants experience the different secrets each and every character has.Meet our six players and their weird quirks!

Our 300g / m² pokersized cards come to 55 per deck! The cards are divided into three types: Place, Encounter, and Quest. So you can only draw one card to find an interesting location, an exciting encounter, or a new task, or you can draw a whole row to find an idea for an entire quest line.It is up to the game master, how he wants to use them. Whether he pulls them for himself to win an idea or lets them pull players so they can meet their fate.To draw a quest line, the game master begins with a map and the location. On it he finds an illustration, a description and an instruction for the next move. This can be, for example, a card for the encounter. There too, he will find an illustration, description and again an instruction. The line ends as soon as a quest is drawn.An example: If the game master draws a lake as a location, he will then draw an encounter. This could be a kid. Well, a child alone at the lake? Possible, but unlikely. The game master is therefore requested to make an encounter to determine a companion for this child. In this example, the young woman who looks as abandoned and lost as the child. Only then is the game master asked to draw a quest. In this the players are asked by the young woman and the child to escort her. In this case, the game master can even move again to determine where to escort them.These combinations make the variations of the Questlines almost infinite! Of course, the game master is free to make their own interpretations and objections. The cards should inspire him and not command him. And best of all: The cards are suitable for almost all fantasy systems!In order to make the game as easy as possible we have separated the cards in color so that you always see which type of card you need right now. Therefore, our cards are of course also in full color and beautifully illustrated! In addition, they fit in with almost any system because they do not tie tightly to a genre.","Of course, there are risks that you have to overcome in case of doubt. However, we have years of experience and know what to expect.So we have three print shops that can deliver to us within days, and in case of emergency, we can also adjust the layout if the format changes slightly.Since we have already completed texts and illustrations and created them ourselves, we have no problems with the work and licensing at this point."

I have made various stationery items and bookmarks as well as limited edition prints.I would like to draw something special to you and create a very unique piece of art for your home.I love drawing Wildlife.. so I could also draw an animal of your choice.I would like to provide you with a piece of art that makes you smile everyday.My ink drawings are very special and I take great care to make something unique and beautiful.They are drawn on triple primed canvas 40cm x 60cm with a ball point pen and delivered to your door unframed and in perfect condition.I uniquely handcraft each piece to make each drawing unique and very striking.THANK YOU FOR CHECKING OUT MYKICKSTARTER CAMPAIGN!Reward 1 & 2 & 3 & 4Step 1: Choose a reward either a (Bookmark, Post it note, Limited edition print)Step 2: Choose an animal in the wildlife collectionStep 3: Sit back and await your reward for helping me on my art journeyReward 5 & 6Step 1: Think of something you love or a person that is close to you or your favourite pet or anything that you think will look great on your wall.Step 2: Email me the picture and I will start your drawing and send you progress pictures as I draw and progress.Step 3: Sit back and await your drawing in the mail.I will keep everyone up to date on the progress of their artwork!",So I had a think about it and there aren't any major risks that come with completing my project. I have set aside sufficient time for each of my rewards. If by chance it goes really well at might take me an extra month or so to catch up on the personalised drawings. But I will keep everyone up to date if this occurs.,https://www.kickstarter.com/projects/97183656/capture-your-pet-or-family-in-time-with-a-unique-artwork?ref=discovery_category_newest,97183656/capture-your-pet-or-family-in-time-with-a-unique-artwork,"Thank you for having a look at my Kickstarter campaign.So just to give you an idea of what I would like to do with this campaign I thought i'd add some pictures of my artwork and explain what you will get to help me raise funds for expanding my family portrait and pet portrait art portfolio and hopefully soon get my personal studio/gallery started.I am a wildlife artist and in my career so far I have done over 200 original wildlife artworks and sold 1000's of limited edition prints for people around the world. I am very great full that people enjoy my artwork and style. With this campaign, I would really love to increase my family and pet portrait portfolio.My Rewards will work as follows:Standard sizes for ease of framing when you receive your artworkAll my rewards also include the following:Here are some of my portraits I have done recently..These portrait pictures attached are framed but due to the nature of the campaign, I will be sending your artwork unframed in a postal tube. I have sent 100's of artworks this way with a perfect delivery record. I use standard size artwork dimensions so it will be easy and cost effective to frame when you receive your artwork.So how it will workI will get a reference photo from all my backers of their portrait they would like.I will do a few mock-up sketches and once I've started I will send you progress photosOnce you are fully happy with your artwork I will arrange for it to be sent safely to your door.I will also do a mixed medium reward where I can add colour to your portrait. I do this by painting a colour layer in acrylic and do my drawing style over the acrylic wash.Sometimes certain pets look really good with a slash of colour like in the example above. But that I will leave up to you!Here are some portraits I've done for clientsHere are some of my progress videos of some portraits that I have done.Please excuse the editing or lack there of, its not my strong point. I Just wanted to show you my technique that I use to create the depth in my artwork. This was a family portrait I did for a client in Switzerland.Just added another video of a portrait I did for a client.When I do these drawings it is really satisfying to see the end result and when the customer is happy with the outcome. They are a great form of meditation for me and is so relaxing when I do them.Thanks for watching and I hope it gave you some insight to my technique.In closingThank you for having a look at my campaign and I hope I can capture your pet or family member in time in a unique piece of art for your home.If you have any questions please contact me and I will try my very best to contact you back as soon as I can and answer any questions you may have.Have a nice day.Johnathan",I have a large stock of canvas and I am ready to create your artwork. I might run out of pens tho..That is me being very optimistic that is.. Just kidding. I am ready for this and have full capability to deliver on this project.I will keep everyone updated on the progress of there portraits. If I run into any problems I will keep all my backers informed. Thank you for supporting my campaign.

The first episode will tell the story of Zacchaeus and will be published on YouTube for everyone to enjoy freely.Our plans do not end there, though. With your help the Little Clay Bible will expand to many more stories and help teach a new generation about God's amazing love for them. These stories will be fresh, fun, and exciting! Fun is the key! Kids learn when they are having fun.It goes without saying that when we teach our kids it must be correct teaching. But that fun part is often forgotten. There are theology books to learn about God, but no kids are reading those. Most adults aren't even reading those. It's wrong to bore a kid with the Gospel. The Little Clay Bible will be Fun! It will be something kids WANT to watch and enjoy. Don't be surprised when you're giggling too, grown-ups.I want to be clear that this Kickstarter project is for the Zacchaeus episode and not the whole Bible. But my big, audacious goal is exactly that - to create a collection of these short animations that span the entire Bible. If this project is a success and gets overfunded it will go a long way toward doing the next stories in line like John the Baptist, The Sermon on the Mount, Noah and the flood, Who is the Greatest Disciple, The Tower of Babel, Jesus Calming the Storm, Feeding Thousands, Walking On Water, Healing a Parylized Man, Telling Parabels of The Good Samaritan, The Lost Coin, etc!Many of the assets created for this project will be re-usable for future stories (once we have a Peter model we won't need to recreate it). Your investment now will get the Zaccheaus story off the ground and pay dividends for years as re-usable characters make other Bible stories possible.Investing in KidsWe all have small people we love: our kids, grand kids, nieces and nephews. My wife and I have three young boys. I pray that one day they are strong, faithful, good men. Raising them to be God-followers is a big part of our lives. I want entertainment that helps them grow. But not all children have positive Christian influences. Some children are raised in homes that are hostile to Christ. In other homes God simply isn't a big deal. These kids need to know that God loves them, too!This is really big stuff. What we do now can change the trajectory of children's lives. Let's do this, not just for our kids, but for all kids!The Little Clay Bible will teach foundational Christian values. Let me be clear where I stand:I would be honored to work side by side with you. Please consider supporting this project in every way you can:Thank you!","The main challenges with this project are technical. Major animation studios have established product pipelines (a set of steps for doing things) that have been tested and refined. They have expensive software and teams of people to guide the project along each step. I have put a lot of thought into the software tools and pipeline I will use. I used this process to create the preview clip. But until it's been more thoroughly tested there are things that could go wrong and adjustments that must be made. The results from the KickStarter intro movie are encouraging. Decisions for the project pipeline include:  -software cost  -ability to find and hire artists  -rendering capacity (how long will it take to generate 1 minute of video?)  -rendering cost  -visual qualityAm I suited to meet these challenges?You bet!  My formal education is in Mathematics, Computer Science and Physics. Strange as it may sound, these have prepared me very well for the Little Clay Bible. I understand the software and process from top to bottom. But I'm not just a pencil pusher. I have developed an artistic side as well. My technical knowledge is balanced with creativity. I have made a decade-long hobby of 3D art, paying attention to the latest tools available and also the underlying creative elements that make a good movie good.",https://www.kickstarter.com/projects/19993937/zacchaeus-the-little-clay-bible?ref=discovery_category_newest,19993937/zacchaeus-the-little-clay-bible,"We want to share Jesus with anyone who will listen. For me, now, that means kids' Bible stories on YouTube.Our first Kickstarter campaign to put Zacchaeus on the screen flopped: https://www.kickstarter.com/projects/19993937/little-clay-bible-zacchaeusI'm pretty sure God told me to do this, so there is no giving up. Hard work has made up for lack of money and we are still on track to share Zacchaeus with the world! (A big thank you to the volunteers who have helped so far!) We are so close.We need a small budget to finish rendering frames for the video. Each frame can take hours to render and we have over 3000 frames! That would take over a year on my computer, but with your support we can have it done this fall.","We are on the tail end of this project, so we have worked past most of the kinks already.

About the instruments I'm planning to make: It will be 15cm in diameter or about 6 inches, I have finished two designs for the front so far, a tree design, with the trunk signifiying the milky way, and an art deco inspired design. I can make astrolabes for any latitude to the nearest 5 degrees (could be more accurate, but it is too much work to make one for every 1 degree latitude difference). The rete (front) features 39 different stars, one from nearly every constellation in the northern sky. In the future, if there are enough requests I could make an astrolabe for the southern skies as well. The same counts for a metal version. I know a company which can make it but the costs are far higher than the costs to make it out of wood, so maybe if there is enough demand.The finished wooden astrolabe will be sold for around $70-80. No matter which design you order or for what latitude.I first learned about astrolabes while studying physics and astronomy at Santa Barbara City College in California, and I became fascinated with them. I wanted to learn more about them, how they worked, how they were designed. At some point someone even came to me asking me to tutor them in the use of the astrolabe. I also bought two real astrolabes but I wasn't really satisfied with them and wished I could make my own, because good quality copies of these beautiful instruments are rare and expensive. Now a few months ago I started trying to figure out how to make my own, how to calculate all the shapes and lines that are part of the design of the astrolabe. After finishing my digital vector drawings, it was a challenge to find a company willing to manufacture it for a decent price, but eventually I found one. Ideally I wanted to get it produced out of metal, as is traditional, but as a backup plan I thought wood could be a visually and financially appealing alternative, so I managed to find a great company specializing in laser cutting.Now all that is left is to order it. Since I am in a bit of a financial tight spot at the moment I barely have enough money to order one prototype, let alone some supplies I need to finish the astrolabes after receiving the freshly laser cut parts. This is why I turned to Kickstarter. With a small starting budget I can order my first astrolabes, promote them, and hopefully attract enough attention so I can order more to sell.Thank you in advance for your contribution to my project, and I hope to be able to send you your own astrolabe soon!Sincerely,Thom","All that is needed is to order from the manufacturer, besides that the only challenges yet to be faced, are the painting and finishing of the wood.

It will accept kids,teens, and adults alike! It will teach making and circuitry, but with a focuson 3D printing. A great feature is that it will send people, myself included,to schools and libraries to do workshops and presentations on making,circuitry, and 3D printing. As with most things, 12,000 dollars USD is theminimum goal to get the equipment, but more is ALWAYS welcome, and evenencouraged!

This campaign is to buy the materials and tools to build the StreamLine drone: the only Drone, as far as we know, that can stream whatever content you choose. The StreamLine will be programmable using multiple apps on the google play store, many of which have a ""Follow"" function, which is a function where the StreamLine follows the Android device. This is essential, so that if you are walking, you donot lose the signal. To add content, you simply put the content on a USB drive, and plug it in! Its as simple as that! To connect, you simply connect to your StreamLine's WiFi network, and go to any webpage, and the StreamLine's network will automatically redirect you to a site where you can view and manipulate your content. If you want to program it with a course, the apps have an interface like Google Maps, where you simply set waypoints, and the StreamLine follows! You can also control it with a special RC transmitter/controller, or also programmed with a PC. It can also be outfitted with FPV and camera systems. The RC controller, PC software and camera and FPV systems are not included with the StreamLine. We sure hope you help us out with this, and who knows, maybe you will soon be the proud owner of a brand new StreamLine! We sure hope so!","One of the biggest challenges, ridiculously, is making the drone light enough to take off! Another challenge will be making it presentable, but I am confident that we will be able to engineer a solution."

Most of the influences in this album are from my youth, growing up watching the horror movies of Hammer Films with Christopher Lee and Peter Cushing, watching the Creature Feature films on Saturday Night, and the infamous grindhouse films of a by-gone era. I have put myself, my heart and soul into these songs, and I'm certain everyone is going to really dig them! For recording, I am using my good friend, Charles Madison, to help me. I am also rounding up some local talent to help me with putting the music together as I envision it. I cannot do it all myself, and I am fortunate to know these great, talented people at this time in my life to work on something so cool and game-changing! I believe everyone will be surprised and proud of the results!And this is just the beginning. I have future projects planned. I have been keeping notes of all my ideas. I have been more creative and productive than ever before in my life, and the support of my friends and community will ensure these dreams will be a reality.

https://www.kickstarter.com/projects/1498813033/miriam-hobbs-debut-album?ref=discovery_category_newest,1498813033/miriam-hobbs-debut-album,"Hi! This is Brenna, Miriam's mom and manager. Why am I writing instead of Miriam? Kickstarter does not allow minors to run their own campaign and Miriam is now just 17. It makes sense if you think about it. Someone has to be responsible for making sure the minor handles the money properly to be sure it is used for the purpose it was intended and ultimately completes the project. Who better to do that than Mom. But I am not just any mom, I am also her manager. I have a business degree and decades of experience in film, radio and television production. My current company, Social Communication Pro, started in 2015 to manage my clients' social media, produce content and provide performance coaching to musicians, actors and business professionals around the world. So I am uniquely qualified to help Miriam not only complete this project, but also promote it once it is done.Everywhere we go these days people are asking us, ""Where can I buy her CD?"" As Miriam and I began goal planning for 2016, she decided it is time. We would like to have an answer to the question. Choosing the direction a young artist wants to go is a big step in their career. Miriam has taken her time, considered many different options and is now ready to tackle her first recording effort. It will be a R & B album with jazz, pop and rock influences. She will have 3-6 original songs and also include 6-8 great covers (similar to the ones you hear when she performs live). However, producing an album takes money. And that's why we are here. Using Kickstarter to fund the album just makes sense. Miriam sings for her spending money, but her full time job is still school. She is currently a Junior in high school. This summer she will be taking a trip with her classmates to Europe, then come home to begin the college application process and her Senior year of high school. She prefers to stay busy. She knows she can either get a part time job or take the next step in her music career. For her the choice is simple. Music! The goal is to raise the money this spring, produce the album this summer (as soon as she returns from her European trip in June) and release late October 2016. We will be working with some great professionals to complete the project. Dave Wilkins has over 30 years in the music industry. He has written, produced, and played with many great artists over the years like Wendy Matthews, Shannon Noll, Matt Cornell, and Academy Award winning actor, Russell Crowe. Dave is also the artistic director of the Sydney Blues & Roots Festival. Tommy Byrdhas worked with some of the best Texas musicians around, like Jerry Jeff Walker, the late greats, Walter Hiatt and Champ Hood of Uncle Walt's Band, Mitch Watkins, Roscoe Beck, Eric Johnson, Marcia Ball, Kinky Friedman, the amazing Johnny Gimble, and so many more. Jake Ward whose current single ""Take My Hand"" is No 2 on the Texas Country Charts will be joining Miriam for a stunning duet! Jake and Miriam starred in ""The Little Mermaid"" and ""Smokey Joe's Cafe"" together previously and both of them are looking forward to recording together. We recently did a quick sample recording of one of the songs we plan to have on the new album. We put together a budget and are ready to get started. Your contributions will go to cover:We have created rewards for the different levels of donation and hope you enjoy what we are offering. If you haven't already, please check out her website, Miriam Hobbs.com.For more samples of her singing, check her out on YouTube. Miriam is a 17 year old singer from Canyon Lake, TX. She has been in numerous musicals, and has been performing concerts since 2013. ","Every project has risks.  This is Miriam's first recording project.  We have tried to anticipate all obstacles to finishing this project by surrounding her with great professionals, creating a realistic budget and time frame for completion.  However, life is very fluid and things happen that we cannot predict.  It is our intention to complete the project during 2016 and have all promised rewards to you as outlined.  We cannot guarantee there will not be delays or complications that prevent us from completing the project or delivering rewards.  Please feel free to reach out to us BEFORE you contribute so we can address any questions or concerns.

And it is finally finished! She is just doing some final mixing and mastering. She has worked with the best musicians in Austin (Tommy Byrd, Dave Scher, Chip Dolan, and others) and we cannot wait to share this music with you! As she is a DIY artist at this point, the cost of printing CDs comes out of her pocket. So we are asking you to pre-order the album as a way to defer those costs and also so we have a better idea how many we should get made in this first run! So tell your friends and make your pledge today.Miriam graduated high school on June 3rd and will begin touring July 2017! The goal we set for this campaign is the minimum amount needed to get the CD's out the door. But anything we raise over that will go towards the touring budget as well as additional advertising of shows, promotion of the CD, new merchandise, etc. Thank you all who have helped get her to this point! Thank you for pre-ordering the album to help get it released faster! As always, your support is greatly appreciated. Thank you and God Bless.To get a feel for what the album will sound like, please check out her first single available at CDBaby.com:","As most of the project is complete, there is very little risk that we will not be able to deliver on our rewards offered. We set our goal at the minimum we need to get the job finished on time but due to printing delays (that our out of our hands) or something unforeseen there is always a risk the project will be DELAYED.  However, we expect to ship in August 2017 (or earlier, if possible).   If we raise more funds, we can add ""better"" packaging on the CD, we can send the music to more radio stations, we can add more stops on the tour, etc."

Her husband is in a different room, so she shouts him a question but he does not seem to have heard her, where after she screams the question again, but with no success either. So, she starts walking in the flat trying to find out why he would not reply to her question. Unfortunately, this attempt ends in failure as well, as she discovers he is not there.She turns around and there is a man in her house looking at her. He holds a set of keys and says: “You left them in the front door. You’ve gotta be more careful. We could have been robbed.”“What do you mean we? This is my house!” “Yes, but it is also my house. See?” and shows her an envelop with his name and the same address.After a while, he offers her to play a game of chess, during which he suggests they should find her a new home. This totally confuses her and she intuitively refuses it claiming “This is my home”. Realising that he would need a new strategy, he offers her to look into the mirror and tell him what she sees. She obeys and glances at herself but she does not see her beauty and her youth. In front of her stand an old woman, who she understands must be her. “What happened to me?”, she asks.“Your name is Barbara Franklin. You are 82 years old. Dad died 12 years ago.”From him, she learns that she has a “mid-stage Alzheimer’s disease. Your memory will only get worse, I am so sorry, Mom!”He talks about a “special facility” that he has found for her and wants to bring her there to help. To the question “What if he [her husband] comes home?”, he embraces her and putting his hand on her chest replies: “He is already home!”","It is going to be our first project. Therefore, most things we will face for the first time. Nevertheless, we are looking forward to it a lot.",https://www.kickstarter.com/projects/517894976/the-empty?ref=discovery_category_newest,517894976/the-empty,"“Life is too short, time is too precious, and the stakes are too high to dwell on what might have been."" Hilary ClintonFirst of all, thank you for reading this page. We appreciate your interest in this project.Secondly, before you think that is just a fundraiser for something personal, no it is not.How do we know that we did everything right? And if we realise that we made mistakes, does it make sense to regret? Can we change anything?It is a visual story of a man walking through the purgatory in after life. He is faced with different important moments of his life but now he gets a chance to look at them from a different prospective. He spent his entire life chasing after his desires and goals but now he came to a point where doubts overcome him. Was it all really his deepest desires? Could there be something else? Another side of life?Surely many of you can relate to these issues and have often asked yourself how to balance work and home life, and really -- there isn't a clear answer. Some people will say, ""Sacrifice everything, because the people at the top got there by doing just that,"" while others will say, ""Yeah, but those golden statuettes and accolades won't keep you warm at night.""As all of us come from the entertainment industry, the thought behind The Empty is a very personal topic that we all face daily. This master skill of getting family and career under one roof is what everyone is looking for. This is why we all are so fascinated by this story and want to share it with you.With a small team of film lovers and fans, we want to explore life after life. We are creating a film that will show what happens after we cross the line to death and find ourselves in purgatory. The questions we want to find answers for are what is actually important in life.Director Michael Boccalinihas over 10 years of experience working within the film industry. He has worked on, most notably, the award winning short filmOne Night Only(2014), the TV talk showLadies Talkon ABN TV and the fantastic mocumentary Love Possibly (2018).Producer/Actor Dima Sol is predominantly a stage actor known for portraying characters such as Hamlet, Treplev in The Seagull and Myshkin in The Idiot in London. But this time and for the first time, he is exploring his new role as the producer. Eventually, his toughest role so far.Production Designer With her extraordinary imagination and the vision of the project, Vera Horton became an indispensable part of The Empty family and created the mystical atmosphere of the film. However, Vera is also famous as an actress in The Robbery and Fall of an Empire: The Story of Katherine of Alexandria (2014).Actress If you need someone to draw a picture, to play piano or to demonstrate an amazing dance, then the beautiful, versatile and trilingual actress Gin Mar is the right person for you. Fancy to watch a film with her? Then turn on Killing Eve or My beautiful Life and enjoy!And more and more!We are glad to say that we have already completed the production stage of the film and we are confidently moving over to the post-production. It was three long and difficult outdoor shooting nights accompanied by coldness and rain. Nevertheless, it was amazing to see how every team member urged to achieve the best possible results and to make The Empty awesome.Your contribution will go very far in helping us augment what we already have, in order to pushThe Empty. £600 is the amount we are asking for, and this will go towards our post-production budget, i.e. sound design, colour grading, mastering, etc. Lastly, upon completion, it will help us pushThe Empty onto the global stage, through internationally recognised film festivals such as Sundance , BFI London Film Festival and Raindance.We’re basically inviting you to be a fully fledged member of theThe Empty family, to help us put together this puzzle that we’re all so passionate about, to have your own personal stake in our dream. In return, you get, chief of all, our eternal gratitude, plus some pretty awesome rewards. Of course, we endeavour to lead by example, and we’ve invested nothing short of blood, sweat and tears intoThe Empty, and we will stop at nothing to make one hell of an impressive film. Contributors should understand that about 30% of the money raised goes to fees related to this campaign: 10% goes to Kickstarter/Amazon processing fees, 10% goes to perk fulfillment (those amazing rewards you deserve) and a possible 10% dropout rate contingency. In the end, about 70% of what is raised goes to the production. We genuinely appreciate your time and support, because we wouldn’t be able continue on this adventure without you. And lastly, spreading the word helps us immensely, and if you could just do us the small favour of posting or tweeting or blogging about us, it could help bring us closer to our goal than you might think.Let’s go make a great film! Together!","It is a very visual project, which was filmed at night. Due to the lack of light at night time, we faced a few challenges. It was our task to get the most out of our equipment (camera, lights) and to be very smart of how we want to show it.Also, as the project had to be shot at night in winter/spring, we had to struggle with the weather conditions.We have all the footage now and now we face the next most important step of the production - the post-production. We hope to finish the project in the next couple of months so that we can send it to as many film festivals as possible as we want to raise awareness for the important things in life and we are dreaming of reaching a wider audience. In our materialistic world people not always understand what actually matters."

It doesn't need to be dirty or secretive.https://wasitgoodforyou.co.uk/( The website is being worked on at the moment )It contains a multitude of evocative literature, exhilaratingillustrations and powerful photography supplied by all kinds of people who wish to use their talents to fill in the shadows that surround the 'sex chat' and all that comes between and behind.Some of the submissions/ things you may see...The website Wasitgoodforyou was created 2 years ago and has now got to the stage where its time to put all the wonderful content in a tangible hard copy/ a coffee book table you can pick up and put down whenever you are inspired.This magazine will not only supply content from Wasitgoodforyou website, but it will also display special interviews from integral people that I've met along the way ( that you all need to hear from) The artist, Alba Hodsdoll for example will be featuring her line drawings and the photographer Lukas Viar will be taking us on a tour of queer night in London. There will also be a new feature on sex education from Bristol basedsex blog, 'Shag'. The read will spark your curiosity as well as feeding it, but also be a portable discussion Manuel on identity of all forms and feelings in all spectrums.For every copy sold also Iwill be partially donating to the amazing 'Wearethepantsproject' all in the name of fertility and equality, run by Tasha Bishop. She provided her powerful and emotive account of her journey with MRKH syndrome which will be within the pages. This story was at the beginning of the life of the online wasitgoodforyou and it changed the platform of expression within the website. It was a story and reality that is very dear to me. I hope to keep this safe and open place with the magazine, whilst constantly promoting and supporting artistic expressionism.WHY DO I NEED KICKSTARTER?- I am a student who has a very low/ too little income- I need someone to convert my ideas into a book format- I have the man on the job, however need the money to pay him.- I would then need the money to publish copies and circulate them around so that everyone can have a piece of the gold dust within them !","I have all the contents for the magazine and hoping to be able to have it in format by the end of august. However the distribution for me is going to be hard as I am a virgin to the publishing world.I am hoping to publicise it on my Instagram and website (selling it here) - but also wanting to sell it in independent stores around the UK ( This is where I will struggle) I am hoping, with sheer enthusiasm- to be able to go into these bookstores and sell my magazine !

You will open it and be invited into a carefully crafted analogue of all kinds of artistic 'Sexpression'.However we need your help!

I would love if you could give anything to this project you can!WHEN THE BOOK ARRIVES ON YOUR DOORSTEP YOU WILL BE SHOCKED TO SEE A RED VELVET BOX, EMBOSSED WITH THE ALL TO WELL KNOWN WORDS 'WASITGOODFORYOU.' YOUR HANDS TRACE THE LINING AND EXHILIRATION PUMPS THROUGH YOUR BODY. WITH AN EXHALE, YOU OPEN THE BOX TO FIND ALL BUT HEAVEN LYING WITHIN.What is WASITGOODFORYOU?Coming from my first ever sexual experience where I was asked this question and I had no answers. I had no language for it and thus no way of sharing with others. However sharing is crucial!https://www.reddit.com/r/AskWomen/comments/1hsra1/do_you_hate_the_was_it_good_for_you_too_question/ A little backstory, as this is a book about stories at the end of the day:‘Wasitgoodforyou?’ Was the first thing I was asked after I first made the loving. He, breathless and me, bewildered. I said ‘yes’ which was the most unsatisfying and dishonest answer I have ever given. There were so many more things to say. For a few more years I stumbled and stuttered when asked what I thought about the deed. I had no language or comparisons with others.University then happened and I met people who had the ‘language.’ They taught it too me and taught me that all language was different. Because all sex was different and sex meant a hell of a lot of things. Then I learnt that sex is not always sex.My head began to hurt with all this new information, but it was invigorating.So, this was the birth of Wasitgoodforyou. I was surrounded by artists who all seemed to share a similar openness to the ‘Sexchat.’We agreed that it was the ability to explore this chaotic subject through their respective art forms that made it easier. As hard as this topic can get, they can use art as a mouthpiece such as illustration, poetry to tell their stories, whilst still being extremely intimate.I began publishing art, poetry and stories on a website and soon I had a mail box full of experiences. From an admittance to masturbating watching Nigella Lawson videos to eye opening illustrations of the experience of touching someone for the first time. I was gobsmacked and felt an urgency to share.Wasitgoodforyou has always been locationless and non specific to any genders, races and cultures. We hope to reach everyone and be absorbed by many in a respectful way. The ideology was that both men and woman find this topic as crazy as the next and we need to hear a plethora of stories from different cultures and ways of being in order to begin to understand. If we can ever!Wasitgoodforyou has been going for 5 years now, with over 100 artists contributing to its magic and honesty. It’s time for more though.Ill give you a little taste of a poem within its corners by Verity Brown:Somethings are meant to be red Tomatoes, chilli, that stuff on Ron Weasley’s head The paper, a poem, regrettably maybe this one too? The colour of Mars, or an apocalyptic moonBut some things just shouldn’t be the shade of Sunburn, or rashes, or a murderer’s spade Although a symbol of love, courage and fiery passion It’s also what your face goes in an embarrassing situation.18 years and a certain something still to try A something so common but I was too shy 18 years old and I’d never been kissed Didn’t really fancy it when I was pissed.I lay on the bed next to someone I knew Sober and awkward like a serious shrew Like throwing darts in the dark I missed the target a bit And what happened next was a little bit shit.Not caught in the rain, it was no movie scene Maybe one from Tarantino, my fate was quite mean No goddess of Venus, no romantic date Was I cursed by the excitement of leaving it too late?The intimate silence had soon been replaced by Retching and gagging and the look on your face If you were to sample a really, really bad soup. Fuck, shit, bollocks Three words on loop.His white T-shirt stained by the colour and grace Of what your nose has to offer after being punched in the face. Don’t get me wrong, no violence was involved, Just the nasal consequence of a fierce fresher’s cold.Drenched in the shade of a classy rouge beverage I sat suffering the shame of my nostril’s own haemorrhage If there’s one thing a kissing partner doesn’t need, It’s the coincidence of a badly timed nose bleed.VISION?To celebrate the artists we have worked with over the last few years by giving them space on paper.There will be poetry from great new poets, art, photography from exceptional new comers! There will also be interviews with actors who work in productions that have sex as the main topic and a woman who spends her life moulding vaginas, cliterally speaking!We have even got a double spread page on the wonderful and renowned artist Alba Hodsoll who puts: Sexuality at the forefront of Alba Hodsoll’s graphic works in paint and ink. Crisp lines and restrained colour palettes combine with the negative space of the canvas to produce a distinctive vision of feminine physicality.I want you to own the book with all this artwork and feel like you have contributed to the taboo of breaking down the Victorian ideal of sex.Wasitgoodforyou is as clean as it can get. By ‘Clean’ we mean that it is not trying to be kinky or sexy. If a story or poem makes you feel that way then let it be! However we don’t think sex is always like that, it can be tough, harsh and stale. Wasitgoodforyou, thus is about having a blank canvas to allow people to have it on their coffee tables and not be embarrassed to own it. We want no one to hide it away.Once you have the book you will be welcomed with open arms into the community, with a launch night happening in March and a consistent engagement from its social media platforms (Facebook and Instagram). Within the book you will also be asked to provide some expression!I want to change people’s minds that the sex talk can be had with many without judgement and with a language that is respectful and creative!We have always believed in having a super personal relationship with our artists, especially when talking about these topics are often very personal.

She began collecting pins her senior year of high school while at a FCCLA convention in 2012. Since then she has slowly expanded her collection and found the online community of pin collectors and creators. Seeing the amazing art by even more amazing artists brought to life in the vibrant colors of enamel inspired her to create her own pins with her doodles.Up until now I have only been a backer and a patron from the sidelines. I have finally gathered the courage to try and bring one of my doodles to life for others to enjoy. I'm afraid of ordering a bulk supply of products only to find out that it's not a big hit. Kickstarter allows me to set up a pre-order system.If I reach my minimum goal to manufacture the products, everyone who pitched in has bought themselves a pin and a special hand written thank you from me. If I fail to reach my minimum goal, my project fails and all money is returned back to those who funded me.  Right now I'm looking at a goal of $500.This includes the price for:  There is currently no explicit ETA for the completion date of the pins. I'm currently still talking with the supplier about the basics and waiting to receive a sample piece that can be altered if needed. I would like the products to be available sometime in May but I will give a better update once I have an answer.The pin features the following design:These pins, if funded, will be made in the USA!At this time there is no sample piece to show exactly how the product will look. Once I have been provided this I will share it on Instagram and include it here.Because this is my first project, there may be delays in the production time.

The beautiful latticework in his head showed the led lights fantastically and he has been beside my bed ever since. I really wanted to share this lamp with the world, as it is both functional but also a cute collectable and companion (we adults in the modern world can't resist cute things, I'm the same). Pop vinyl figures are very popular to collect but unfortunately mass produced. These munny's would also always be made in small batches of 30 or so to preserve their value.As the latticework is hand cut it will be different on each light and each will contain a tiny hidden shape cut in the lattice (such as a star, small animal, etc).The colour for this project is a metallic bronze, silver, gold or copper acrylic and the LEDs are red, white, or multi coloured. The lamp will be fully functional, as LED lights can be left on all night safely, and they can be placed anywhere in the room as each comes with a battery box (which takes 2x AA batteries, no mains power required).I plan on introducing other colours to the range after this project but will keep each run short so the lights retain their appeal to collectors.Once the project is over munny will be available to buy on my website but this Kickstarter project is essential to gauge the market and produce the first batch. If funding is successful I will be sending out a brief survey to gauge preference for future colour schemes and for you to select your choice of LED (red, white or multi) and colour (bronze, silver, gold or copper) foryour munny reward.",I will keep everyone fully updated with the progress of the project. After the funds has been transferred to me I will purchase the munny blanks and start work. While waiting for the blanks I can start work on the keyrings/mini models sculpted in polymer clay and these may well be shipped out first.Before the munny's are sealed any painting errors can be cleaned off and corrected. But there are not a large number of challenges with this project. I am working on a couple more munny blanks to smooth out production but after that I will need your generous support in order to continue.I have sourced several suppliers for the blanks and LED's and ordered one of each to test shipping times and quality. These tests have all proved successful.

Hopefully you won't be suffering as badly from digital addiction as the film's protagonist Sam; a technology reliant millennial. When Sam is mugged and her phone stolen, she will go to extreme lengths to get it back!This short film crime/thriller with a twist will be 8-10 minutes long. The aim is to express how anxiety can be caused by FOMO (fear of missing out) and to explore why we feel compelled to hold our phone all day like a third limb. We want to raise awareness about one of the fastest growing first world issues, effecting mental health and work /life/screen balance. Some users check their phones 100 to 200 times a day! The idea is to promote discussion about how we can't bear to be away from our screens.This personally affects me so I am keen to explore this through film.The film will be shot in London and Greater London. The majority of the cast and crew are fresh faces in the film industry and the films lead is Johanna Thea, a rising star from Ireland: https://www.imdb.com/name/nm4811231/ The metaphor of drug withdrawal will be used to express the protagonist's distress when she is without her phone and how she becomes desperate for a 'hit' of technology.The end game: after post-production the film will initially be entered into festivals and then shared on social media for the world to experience, lots of hash tags will be added including the key one #insanesmartphoneaddiction and of course #disquietshortfilm and many more.We aim to get the film completed by the summer but have set the rewards for December to factor in for any setbacks and reshoots.There are some great rewards, including becoming an Easter Egg in the film (your name or face on screen, see rewards section), tickets to the screening and more.Really excited to get filming! Shoot dates are set for two weekends in April and we have all the cast and crew raring to go!We will update soon with a video of Jeffrey (Director & Writer) & Joanna Thea (lead) telling you more about the project! We also will post behind the scenes photos, screenshot and update you when the film is at each stage, production, post and festival submission.All the best, Jeffrey",Most of the cast and crew are all students or new to the film industry so we are still learning. We may have to do a re-shoot if we don't get the footage we need. We are committed as a team to getting the shots needed and carrying the project through to post-production and beyond! We aim to shoot in three days but have factored in a fourth day for safety.

I also have plans for another 15 designs, which will be available in an online shop that a successful Kickstarter campaign will help me set up.The cards measure 150mm x 150mm (6"" x 6""), are blank inside and each one comes with a white envelope.These 15 designs will be printed as soon as Kickstarter transfers the funds. If everything goes to plan you should receive your rewards in November!So, if you're looking for something a bit different for a birthday, wedding, new baby, anniversary or Valentine's day then hopefully you can find something here. Then of course there's Christmas - I've bundled 6 cards together as a reward for anyone who wants all of the 'festive' designs!Recipients of these abusive, playful and potentially offensive cards will invariably thank you for brightening up their day!","I do not foresee any problems with this project.I'm happy with the printer I have chosen, so I expect things to run smoothly!",https://www.kickstarter.com/projects/207721656/cufflinks-for-steampunk-fans-and-watch-lovers?ref=discovery_category_newest,207721656/cufflinks-for-steampunk-fans-and-watch-lovers,"IntroHiSome of you may already be familiar with my work. For those of you that aren't, my name's Joe and I hand make a range of Steampunk inspired jewellery and accessories, under the name Jamlincrow, using parts salvaged from vintage mechanical watches.This is my third Kickstarter campaign, the first project being back in 2014.For this campaign I'm concentrating solely on cufflinks.CufflinksI have made some changes and improvements to my cufflinks. You will now find some very sleek and robust Silver and Gold plated options, smart stainless steel cufflinks and, for the first time, I am introducing some watch mechanism cufflinks with 925 Sterling Silver backings. All made by me, in sunny Bournemouth, UK!GoalsIf I raise the funds it will not only allow me to launch my exclusive solid Sterling Silver line of cufflinks, but hopefully allow me to buy some new equipment so that I can work on some completely new creations.I am especially interested in incorporating some woodwork into my future designs, so any tools/machinery which could facilitate that would be very welcome additions.I have a background in woodwork and after a break from it I am now starting to get an urge to revisit it!My ProcessI have accumulated a large number of watches and watch parts over the years. These are the nuts and bolts (gears and wheels!) of my work process.To turn these mechanical timepieces into intriguing and unusual pieces of jewellery, I start by dismantling the broken/defective/discarded watches and getting down to the mechanisms inside.The next step is to locate defects and remove those components and clean the inner workings, so that the final piece will look smart.I then need to replace the parts I have removed with parts harvested from other mechanisms, and put everything back together again, once I am happy.In the case of cufflinks, I have to carefully match up the parts so that each set of mechanics is part of a matching pair, Ithen file down and individually fit each one into its backing.I have been making Steampunk cufflinks for a number of years and I now work closely with the people who fabricate my backings for me. We have made various changes as time has gone by and I am really happy with where we're at now.RewardsThe watch movements no longer function, they are just incredibly interesting to look at and very pleasing to the eye.Thanks for looking!","My aim is to get all the cuff links out to you during November. Some countries take a little longer than others to process international packages, for example Australia can take several weeks and South American countries can be particularly slow.I have a large selection of watches to work with and can get hold of more if needed. I have been making jewellery and accessories with watch parts for several years now, so everything should go smoothly!"

Loud, colorful, dirty and honest... After discovering some of the most interesting cities like New York, Boston, Las Vegas, Osaka, Shanghai, Beijing, Mumbai, Colcatta, Moscow, London, Singapore and different countries of the Arabian Emirates and northern Africa during the last years, Berlin became the center of my life. During the last years, I met so many different people and cultures but in Berlin, there is this sepcial mood... You can feel the unique character of each quarter, when you walk the streets, smell the air and listen to the sounds. But there is one thing, that´s most fascinating here...Along the Karl-Marx-Alley during sunset or between the modern skyscrapers and the historical buildings from the roaring 1920´s, you sometimes feel like being part in one of the famous ""Films Noir"". Long shadows, high contrasts, fascinating characters in combination with high quality wide angle lenses and unusual points of view keep this mood and express this feeling to the Viewer.The final images are chosen together with film students and their lecturers, specialized on the Film Noir genreI shoot since my early years, since 2011 focussed on urban and streetphotography with a documentary character, not just showing a person but building a realtionship to the environment and creating a feeling for the complete moment. I work with old, manual lenses on digital full frame for keeping a feeling for the photographic basics, especially composition and settings for time and aperture, a thing that´s getting lost in the digital age. The camera became my all time companion here, because you never know what happens just around the corner.I see, that this style of photography is the right way by international honors and awards, f.e. from the polish SHSS magazin, the Photographic Society of America and receiving the Performance Award by the UNESCO during the Humanity Photographic Awards and publications in different magazines like the german Stern. 2016 my work was included in the German National Library.The exception of this project is its high value quality, due to its materials, the processing and for sure the shown images. The client will receive a book, that´s conveying the feeling for the luxury and the exclusiveness of Berlin, but also gives a view behind the scenes of this tourist city and shows its special character.The basic version in the size 28x28cm, produced by a professional partner, owns a cushioned, white leather hardcover. The pages are made of 300g thick fine art paper, coated with a water-resistant layer against dirt and damages.Another version of the book will be produced with a black leather cover and tarnished black inscription. This version is limited on 25 samples worldwide, each with a handwritten dedication for the buyer and an additional signed fine art print in 30x20cm.Berlin ist eine faszinierende Stadt, mit eigenem Charakter die ihr ein unverwechselbares Flair verleiht. Laut, bunt, schmutzig und ehrlich... Nachdem ich in den letzten Jahren einige der interessantesten Städte der Welt fotografisch erkunden durfte, darunter New York, Boston, Las Vegas, Osaka, Shanghai, Peking, Mumbai, Kalkutta, Moskau, London, Singapur, diverse Länder der arabischen Halbinsel und Nordafrikas ist Berlin nun mein Lebensmittelpunkt geworden. Ich habe in den letzten Jahren viele Kulturen kennengelernt, doch das Verhältnis der Berliner zu ihrer Stadt ist einzigartig. Besonders eine Charakteristik macht diese Stadt zu etwas ganz besonderem...Entlang der Karl-Marx-Allee während des Sonnenuntergangs oder zwischen den modernen Hochhäusern und den historischen Gebäuden der wilden 1920er, fühlt man sich in die Zeit der berühmten ""FilmsNoir"" zurückversetzt. Lange Schatten, hohe Kontraste, faszinierende Charaktere, kombiniert mit hochwertigen Weitwinkelobjektiven und ungewöhnlichen Perspektiven fangen diese Stimmung ein und vermitteln sie dem Betrachter.Ich arbeite bei meinen Projekten mit alten, manuellen Objektiven an digitalem Vollformat, da man durch diese Arbeitsweise wieder ein anderes Gefühl für die Fotografie, speziell die Bildgestaltung, Belichtungszeit und Blende bekommt, was im digitalen Zeitalter oft verloren geht. Die Kamera ist in den letzten Jahren mein ständiger Begleiter geworden, da das Leben gerade in einer Stadt wie Berlin auch keine Pause macht und man hier nie weiß, was dich hinter der nächsten Ecke erwartet.Dass ich mich mit dieser Arbeitsweise auf dem richtigen Weg befinde, zeigen verschiedenste internationale Auszeichnungen, u.a. des polnischen SHSS-Magazins, der Photographic Society of America und der Verleihung des Performance Award durch die UNESCO im Rahmen der Humanity Photographic Awards und verschiedener Veröffentlichungen, u.a. im Stern. 2016 erfolgte die Aufnahme in die deutsche Nationalbibliothek.Die Besonderheit dieses Produktes liegt in seiner Hochwertigkeit, seiner Qualität im Hinblick auf die Materialien, die Verarbeitung und auch die dargestellten Bilder. Der Kunde wird ein Buch in der Hand halten, welches ihm einerseits den Eindruck der Exklusivität dieser Stadt vermittelt, jedoch auch anhand der Motive einen Blick hinter die Fassade der Touristenstadt und des Luxus gewährt.Die Grundversion des Buches im Maß 28x28cm wird in einem professionellen Partnerunternehmen gebunden und besitzt ein gepolstertes Hardcover mit weißem Lederbezug. Die Seiten bestehen aus qualitativ hochwertigem, 300g starkem Fine-Art Papier welches mit einer speziellen, wasserabweisenden Folierung überzogen wird, um die Fotografien vor Verschmutzung und Beschädigungen zu schützen.Eine weitere Version des Buches wird mit einem Cover aus schwarzem Leder und mit mattschwarzer Beschriftung produziert. Dieses Exemplar wird als limitierte Edition auf max. 25 Exemplare begrenzt und für jeden Käufer mit einer Widmung versehen. Als Zugabe beim Kauf dieser Edition wird ein signierter Fine Art Print in der Größe 30x20cm beigefügt.","There are no risks according to the production of this book.

My husband had bought me a set of shimmering mica watercolors and I wanted to make something abstract and beautiful to experiment with them.My painting turned into a splash of bright, cloudy colors, and sparkle: my first of many nebula paintings. It came as no surprise, space photography inspires the magical effects of Infinite Spiral, my long running webcomic. With Inktense and the Finetec mica watercolors I was able to make the same magic happen on artboards.100 of Billions is a result of the seed planted by that first painting. Inspired by Carl Sagan and Bob Ross, it is a commitment to spend a few hours of every week exploring the beauty of our universe with paint. By June I plan to have 100 finished space scenes.There will be many experiments along the way as well as I learn to paint different patterns of light. I certainly don't have the wall space to keep all of these paintings for myself.  By backing the project, you can take one off my hands - or set of prints of one of my favorites. This will further my ultimate goal: to have learned through 100 paintings a variety of ways to paint space, stars, nebulas, and more. I plan to share those techniques with others, so that 100 of Billions can become 1000s of Billions ... or to quote Carl Sagan, ""Billions and Billions.""Space is beautiful, magnificent, complex, and lovely. I can't wait to share with you more of these special places in paint. Back the project, you won't be disappointed. And when it's finished and the last painting is dry, I'll be back so we can paint together and spread wonder for the world to enjoy.Feel free to message with any questions you might have. Follow me on Instagr.am (@kristy.cunningham) to see more of my work. Thanks for spending part of your day here.","I don't anticipate many risks or challenges with this project. I have easy access to all supplies for this project. As a user experience designer, I am used to working with deadlines. June provides me a long tail window to prepare all paintings and enjoy the process. My hope would be to deliver these rewards sooner.I've helped develop and deliver content for two Square City Comics anthologies and I successfully self published the first volume of Infinite Spiral back in 2014.Barring any surprise health issues or emergencies, I anticipate being able to fulfill all rewards with minimal hiccups.",https://www.kickstarter.com/projects/441119572/tobys-table-illustrated-recipes-from-grandmas-kitc?ref=discovery_category_newest,441119572/tobys-table-illustrated-recipes-from-grandmas-kitc,"Toby's Table (now 100% funded) is a perfect bound book of over 20 of our family's favorite recipes, collected by Grandma Toby throughout her life. Each scrumptious, comforting recipe is hand illustrated in black and white withthe directions carefully reconstructed for your success in the kitchen. The book also includes a 12 page comic story about Toby and her table.Dinner rolls, casseroles, cookies ... My Grandma Toby collected recipes. They were traditional family recipes and recipes to feed her husband and six kids on a tight budget. Dinner centered around a picnic table that could hold the whole family.The table remained a centerpiece as grandkids entered the picture, though the picnic table itself was retired to the back porch over time. Food and the table became a centerpiece for gatherings, holidays, the introduction of new babies, and teenage confessions. You could always sit down with Gram, have a bite to eat, play some Yahtzee, and spill your guts about whatever was going on in your life - no judgment.When I left for college those recipes became a tie to that table, my Gram, and all those good memories. I'd write Gram and she'd send recipe cards back, hand written in her self-described ""chicken scratch."" I'd make the recipes when I was lonely or homesick to have a taste of Toby's table no matter where on the planet I was at the time.Nearly two years ago our family lost my Gram, but her legacy lives on in many ways. One of those is the recipe box which has passed to me. However, to me, the recipes are a family gift and Gram always shared and traded recipes with family, friends, and acquaintances. So during Inktober 2017 I began drawing family favorite recipes to turn them into a cookbook so that I didn't squander the gift of the recipe box.This project is the result - a perfect bound book of over 20 of our family's favorite recipes.You can expect comforting recipes like:The book also includes my short comic, Querencia. The comic celebrates her life and the significance of her table and was initially published as part of Square City Comic's 4th Anthology, Sensus Obscura.I encourage you to take a look, preorder the book through one of the backer rewards, and whip up a taste of Grandma's house.And remember, there's always room at the table.By meeting the $600 goal I'll be able to create a small print run of Toby's Table. At this main goal, project is scoped as an 5.5x8.5 inch, perfect bound book totaling at minimum 44 pages in black and white.Of the $600 raised, $375 will go to printing costs. $175 will go to shipping costs. In addition, $50 will go toward Kickstarter and payment fees.But wait, there's more! If we meet a few modest stretch goals, I can afford to upgrade this project!STRETCH GOAL #1: $1000(LOCKED)By meeting this stretch goal of $1,000, print backers will receive an upgraded book. Toby's Table will become a handy spiral bound volume with coated pages that hold up to the kitchen. I'll also create a color cover for the book.STRETCH GOAL #2: $1400(LOCKED)By meeting this stretch goal of $1,400, not only will Toby's Table will become a handy spiral bound volume with coated pages that hold up to the kitchen with a color cover. I'll also add 20 more recipes to the book! Digital copy backers will also receive the additional recipes.","I've self published two books before, the first volume of Infinite Spiral, my webcomic, and a minibook titled Everyday Imaginings. I've also contributed to multiple anthologies. I know how to prepare files and pages for print and get projects done on time.In addition, half of the initial recipes are already illustrated. I enjoy doing them in the evenings to unwind, so finishing the set is no problem.That being said there are a couple risks to the project. Items could get lost in shipping or there could be a delay in the printing process.Another risk is I'm expecting my first child in April. The June expected delivery timeline on the book should give plenty of time for me to begin fulfilling rewards, but babies run on their own time tables and needs. I have a solid support network through family and the local comics community, though, and don't expect this to be an issue."

https://www.kickstarter.com/projects/143152889/smart-servo-controller?ref=discovery_category_newest,143152889/smart-servo-controller,"The SSC [Smart Servo Controller] is the perfect addition to your robotics tool kit. Hobbyists and and Professionals alike can benefit from its ease of use and powerful features.The SSC is designed to be a building block used to implement complex control logic and motion algorithms without having to write any code. It can be used to expand the functionality of your existing robotic projects or be the platform for a new project.The goal of the SSC is to allow you to spend less time coding and more time creating. The SSC can integrate into existing projects. It will work in conjunction with PIC, Arduino and other microcontrollers or be used independently.The SSC was created with the DIY community in mind and will be made open source once the project gets funding.The SSC works by evaluating rules that the user creates. Up to 256 rules can be created. The rules are run independently and the results are summed together on the output channels. There are 4 different types of rules: Output State, Linear Map,Sequence and PID. Each rule can have any number of conditions attached to it. These conditions determine if the rule is allowed to be run or not. Using rules provides an intuitive way to program complex control algorithms. SSC has 8 configurable inputs and 14 configurable outputs. The input types are: Analog, Servo, Pulse and Digital. The outputs types are: Digital, PWM, Servo, High speed PWM and Low speed PWM. The system can be set to use 5 volt or 3.3 volt logic.They key to the SSC is flexibility. With a powerful and re-configurable design the SSC can be used in many applications. Configuring is done through an intuitive user interface.I came up with this project after building a little robot that I wanted to make dance. I made the robot out of some old servos, pieces of wood and plastic that I had laying around. I connected all the servos up to a microcontroller and programmed it so the different servos could be moved with commands from a computer. I was soon stumped. How can I make my robot move and dance around while keeping my sanity? I didn't want to write code for every single movement I wanted the robot to do. Sadly the robot sat on the shelf waiting and waiting.Having used 3D animation and video FX software I was familiar with graph editors and timelines. Then it dawned on me. If I can make a computer animation of a robot move around using a graph editor, Why couldn't I make a real robot move using similar techniques?The idea for the Smart Servo Controller was born. After many many hours of designing and programming I am ready to share my idea with the world. Hopefully this will allow others to dust off their robots old and breath new life into them.The device has 8 inputs and 14 outputs that can be configured for different type input and output types. The operating voltage can be change from3.3v to 5v for compatibility with other electronics.The board runs from a 5 volt power supply. A selector switch sets the input and output operating voltage. There are disconnects that allow the input channel and output channel to operate from a different voltage supplied by the user. This way you can supply the servos with your own voltage source and not rely on the board power supply.All the input and output channels are ESD hardened with dedicated ESD protection circuitry. The 5V input is reverse polarity protected for added protection. This makes the SSC well suited for beginners in electronics so they can explore without the risk of damaging the circuit board.Up to 255 rules can be programmed. Each rule can have any number of conditions. The conditions types are as follows:  Running multiple rules that output to the same output channel sums the results together. The outputs can also be summed with a virtual zero point. If no rules are active for a particular output channel a default output state can be set or the output can be left at the last value.The firmware in the SSC is designed to receive software upgrades. These upgrades will add new features and improvements.Configuring the SSC is done through the Smart Servo Controller programmer. This graphical tool lets you setup the inputs and outputs, create rules and test the output of animations.This first demo shows how easy it is to use the software to make servo motors move.In this next video describes a little bit about the walking robot that was made to show case the SSC. The robot has 6 degrees of freedom in each leg.This next demo shows how to turn on and off relays based on a temperature sensor. Plus a blinking LED for fun. (Added June 18)Turning LEDs on and off. (Added June 23)Using the PID function to have a robot keep its distance from my hand. (Added June 23)Stay tuned for more demos and tutorials :)Be sure to checkout our facebook page to stay up to date with the latest developments.https://www.facebook.com/smartservocontroller","In this project I have tried to eliminate technical risks by designing, programming, testing and using the SSC in several projects before launching it on kickstarter. I have been working closely with the PCB manufacturing and assembly service. Together we are committed to delivering a quality product. If supply chain delays or manufacturing mishaps occur we will keep you informed every step of the way.",https://www.kickstarter.com/projects/143152889/diy-digital-vacuum-guage?ref=discovery_category_newest,143152889/diy-digital-vacuum-guage,"I've been riding motorcycles for over 10 years. Like many other motorcycle enthusiasts I do my own maintenance, from chaining oil to adjusting valves. After seeing other people make DIY digital vacuum gauges I wanted to make one for my own use. I've created this kickstarter to help make building a vacuum gauge more accessible to those who want to build one. Here are the two bikes that I currently own and work on:The project is completely opensource. The eagle design, board layouts and source code is all available on sourceforge.The gauge is powered by a 9 volt battery. The LCD screen incorporates a back light. The functionality of the digital vacuum gauge is configured through the onscreen menu. The menu is accessed by pressing the MODE/CAL button.The four pressure sensors can be calibrated to run in absolute pressure mode or relative to atmospheric pressure mode. The vacuum read out can be displayed in kPa, PSI, inHg or mmHg. The display can be set to show numerical values or draw bar graphs. The amount of digital filtering can also be configured.The pressure sensors should be used with 3mm or 1/8"" vacuum tubing. Below is a video walking through the menu. A short press moves through the menu options and a long press will select that option.The kits are designed for people of all electronic skill levels. The PCB board reward is just the PCB I designed. It is up to the backer to source, assemble and program the digital vacuum gauge. All the resources needed are available on the sourceforgeproject page.For the backers who don't have he ability to program the microcontroller used in the project the second reward is ideal. The backer gets a PCB board and pre-programmed microcontroller. It is still up to them to source the other parts and assemble the project.If backers don't want to source parts, can't solder surface mount components or don't want to solder any components those reward levels are available as well.This project is aimed at a very small group of people and I plan on fulfilling the rewards myself. I have contracted Smart Prototyping (Part of NOA Labs Limited) to build the PCB Boards. I have done a sample run of 25 boards that I have on hand. If I get more orders I will order another batch of PCB boards through Smart-Prototyping.comComponents I will source from either Digikey or Mouser depending on what is most cost effective at the time of ordering. For those of you who want components pre-soldered to the circuit boards I will do that myself. I have soldering and re-flow tools to do the job.The prices are based on component costs, my assembly time, taxes and import duties. You are welcome to use this project for whatever application you want. If you feel like you can build one for less you are welcome to the source files, BOM, and pcb designs. They are on the sourceforge project page.",This project is low risk because I have built and used the vacuum gauge. The biggest risk would be getting to many orders and the time involved to fulfill them all. I don't foresee this being an issue because the project is targeted to a very small niche group of people.

We wanted disturbing stories in which a powerfully drawn setting plays an important role and includes a “presence” that is critical to the plot.

These dice are also intended to have a certain aesthetic appearance to incite the most fervent collectors.The concept we propose is a new way to play with magic in role-playing games.This concept takes the form of dice.And for our first range, we propose 4 dice dedicated to elemental magic: fire, water, earth, air.Being based on a 6-sided dice system, the principle is simple:1 side corresponds to the failure of a spell.2 sides, with the same spell, correspond to “classic” spells. This spell is not so powerful but the player is more likely to fall on.2 sides correspond to an effect spell related to the element of the die. These are two spells from different power levels and do more damage than the “classic” spell.1 side corresponds to the most powerful spell: this is your critical spell.We created for each element a sub-class that will give each die a specific function: the destruction is a subclass of fire; it’s a single-target spell with burn damage over time or even instant death. the kinesic influence is a subclass of earth; it’s a single-target spell which can hinder movement and even neutralize opponents. the control of position is a subclass of air; it’s a single-target spell able to repel enemies or to eject them out of a combat zone. the area of devastation is a subclass of water; it’s a spell with a greater or lesser effect area. If misused, it can hurt the allies and even the spellcaster. Thus, each die will have distinct effects giving its user a role or a special power.(pour notre audience francophone, retrouvez ces informations en français sur notre site www.arxpell.com/fr!)Example of use:Example of use:Example of use:Example of use:Thanks to their simple illustrations, clear and understandable to all, you can use our dice in various game styles. Our dice weren’t designed for a particular game.They are for all players who want to reinvent their playing. They can be compatible with numerous game rules and conversely, game rules can be adapted to the dice. With an inventive game master’s, everything is possible. Using your imagination, you can integrate them to your scenarios in existing games or, for the most inventive of you, create your own game from scratch!For example: a magician casting a spell; an object to which you want to give a magical effect; the consequences of triggering a trap...Other examples on our website:http://www.arxpell.com/en/integrate-our-dice-into-your-rpg-games/Want to use our dice with Dungeons&Dragons? See how to adapt the rules for critical hitsand critical failures.Funding our project would help us mainly to launch our business: developing our online store and buy our first stock!If all goes well, then we could develop an entire range of dice on the same principle. We already have very precise ideas for new sets!A small part of the budget will help us to bear the costs already incurred, such as: the company formation, the hosting of the website, graphics, communication, translation... The price of our dice might seem high but we must take into account: the work of graphic designer for each die, the customization of each side by the engraver, the size of the die (19mm), the customs fees...The dice are well-made and they have great details. The dice have square corners to give them a classy look. They are 19 mm (about 0,75 inch), which allows a good reading of the drawings.They are black in order to highlight the color of each element. Each face is etched. Our prototypes were engraved by Custom Dice, Inc. (USA) which co-participates in several Kickstarter projects.Each side of each die has a unique design made by a graphic designer who talentedly transposed Julien’s ideas and drafts.Your contributions allow you to have one or more dice.We deliver worldwide. We offer package tracking by adding an extra charge to your package.","We do not manufacture the dice. Positive note: we already have the manufacturer and the prototypes :)We work with Custom Dice, Inc. (https://www.facebook.com/customdice/)Some traits are quite thin; the die might have some color breaches in small places.Delivery time may be longer(!) than expected. We order the dice in the United States and we repackage them in France.",https://www.kickstarter.com/projects/729111700/arxpell-hit-location-dice?ref=discovery_category_newest,729111700/arxpell-hit-location-dice,"For this new project, we are offering you two types of hit location dice: dice to hit humanoids and dice to hit monsters.Add a more realistic dimension to an event during your games: whether an action is beneficial or dangerous, it will surely affect a part of your body or one of an opponent; what’s more fun than leaving it to the chance using of our hit location dice!Affected by a critical strike? You still have a chance to get out of it by rolling the humanoid hit location die and praying that a non-lethal part of your body would be chosen. The dice can be used for many types of role-playing and board games: heroic fantasy, zombie, post-apocalyptic...The novelty in this range is the dragon die.And this die can also allow you to hit other creatures that don’t have the “humanoid” physical archetype. Use this dice to destroy all your monstrous enemies, they won’t be spared anymore by your attacks!For lack of imagination, launch the hit location die and new opportunities are open to you!System based on a die of 12 faces; the principle is simple:Why only one wing to the Dragon dice?The dragon is seen in profile; for better visibility, we chose to draw a single wing so as not to overload this drawing regarded the surface. It would have been impossible to place the impact on the second wing.To compensate for this, we have positioned two impacts on a single wing: one impact at the top and the other at the base.We therefore give the players or the GMs the freedom to interpret these two impacts.--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------Our former Kickstarter campaign: Elemental Magice DiceWe took into account the fact that our former campaign had too high prices.That’s why we are offering you a good value for money in this campaign.We hope to succeed in this campaign as to be able to finance our Elemental Magic Dice which require a more substantial budget for their manufacturing and thus to revive a new KS campaign.","Not much as a risk.

For the last two years, we have been running the MST3K -S.O.L consuite. We are excited to be returning for a third year. While enjoying last year's con the theme ""A Touch of Evil"" was announced. All of the things we could do with a second consuite were running through my mind. Then it hit me, an Asylum.The challenges we are facing are making sure we can provide two spectacular, unique experiences. A few members of our creative team for S.O.London consuite are finding other time constraints. So, we are looking to the CoreCon community for assistance.In the Asylum, we will be offering a look into the history of medical treatment for the ""insane"". Experience wearing a straight jacket. Committ your friends and family or maybe they will admit you. And hopefully a lot more.As a thank you for being a supporter of this new consuite, we are offering you mock patient files to be enjoyed by con goers, our caffeinated brownies with or without bacon, and lastly our handmade straight jackets.Thank you for your time.

So, we are turning to the CoreCon community.Bethlem is a consuite with an early 1900's Asylum theme. We hope to provide information on early medical treatments, institutes that were formed to care for the ""mentally insane "" and the doctors that were trying to help.

https://www.kickstarter.com/projects/mysticriverrose/precious-angel-pillow-project?ref=discovery_category_newest,mysticriverrose/precious-angel-pillow-project,"Hi everyone! My name is Cassie. My project is something i've been working on and off for almost 4 years now, But it has been slower then i would like.In May of 2010, I lost my son, shortly after birth, due to congenital heart defects. For a year I tried to handle my grief on my own. Then i was welcomed into a community FILLED with thousands of moms who were just like me! who'd either miscarried, had a stillborn, or lost a newborn.In the next year, I learned that many of them had their own facebook pages, where they would make items, like jewelry that said ""in loving memory"" Or candles, or crocheted hats and booties to send out. I started thinking, I want to do something like that. I want to make something for some mom to reach out and touch, hold. But i don't want to copy anyone else, i want to do something no one else is doing. My mother in law had bought me an embroidery machine the year before, and I threw myself into sewing as a way to cope. One day i was approached by a memory bag program, and asked if i might be able to make tiny pillows, to be included in their bags that they take to the hospitals. When i asked about the bags, she said she works with her local hospitals, and provides bags, with all these information packets, and little keepsake things, so that the nurses can hand them out when a mom loses a baby. I felt honored that she would ask me to be included, but wasn't sure if i could pull it off. But I told her i would try.I made 20 pillows for her, with various little animals and cute baby things on the front. and when i posted pictures on my facebook, they went viral, and EVERYONE started messaging me, wanting one, begging for one.So I started my own page, and started taking orders. In 72 hours, I had a demand of over 200 pillows! I was in shock. but i worked daily to send out as many pillows as i could. I got to about 120 and then my embroidery machine started to give out. I had to take it to the shop, and eventually, I had to apologize after some people waited 10 months! And refunded everyone I wasn't able to help.I already have over 5000 embroidery designs in my computer. I also have a program to make/edit/fix designs, convert them to any file type any machine might use!My goal, is to raise this money, to help with the down payment on a newer, better, industrial embroidery machine. I am taking some of my own money, as well as the money I'm trying to raise here, to put a large enough down payment on a multi needle BabyLock Endurance 2, so that I can bring it home, and continue what i started.My pillows were about 4"" x 4"" but with this new machine, i could make them bigger, and faster. Before, most designs took me anywhere from an hour to 2 hours, JUST to do the embroidery. With this NEW machine, i could do an entire pillow from start to finish in 20-30 minutes!I could make MORE pillows, and i could make them even better. Each pillow i make is stuffed with polly fill, and then a sprinkle of baby powder is added.Also, with the old machine, i only had a 4"" x 4"" work area, it made the deisgns small, and limited the names and dates lengths.With the new machine, not only could i create BIGGER pillows, but i could put multiple names on each pillow!My GOAL is 100 pillows a month. I want to be able to send them world wide, so ANYONE who wants one.Part of the money raised, will go towards launching a new website, where people can see everything, where they can order right from the website using paypal, can customize, add, remove change anything they like. But it wont be limited to just the pillows, I'll be doing patches, and baby blankets, and stuffed animals, and memory bags, to hold all those items and SO much more.I've been dreaming and planning this up for 4 years now, but unable to do anything because I no longer have a working embroidery machine. Why so much you ask? Simple, the machines they sell in stores, like Walmart, Joanns, Michaels and places like that are for minimal use, they are considered ""hobby"" machines. I had a machine like that, a cheap $400 one. I put over $700 into it in one year just to keep it working. All the parts inside, are plastic, and dont last. Its not meant for everyday use, 8+ hours a day like i was using it! I effectively worked these poor little sewing machines to death to assist people in having just a little something to hold onto since they will not have their babies to hold. It was my hope that these pillows would bring a fleeting bit of solace to those who had experienced loss, and that each love-filled stitch would be one stitch closer to mending the broken hearts that they felt.With the new BabyLock Endurance 2, its an industrial machine, all metal parts, meant for running a small business, meant and built to last. Comes with a 2 yearmaintenanceplan, if anything needed fixing, it would be fixed! I also comes with its own stand, and 3 hoops, including a HAT hoop! I could also buy other much larger hoops later on, for bigger projects like memory blankets, if i wanted.This is my dream, to be able to get this machine, and do something wonderful. Will you please help me with that?I'veincludedrewards for various levels of donations. using my new machine to send you something as a way of saying THANK YOU for helping me reach my goal and helping me realize a dream.So please, consider donating to my cause. Thank you.","Risks and challenges with this project, well there is always the possibility that the machine can malfunction and break down. The good news is, the machine comes with a 2 year maintenance plan, if anything goes wrong, they fix it at no charge to me. That would however cause a delay in my project. I am always open and honest with my customers, I inform them in a timely manor of any and all problems, delays and or issues, and I ask what THEY would prefer, If they would like to wait, and receive their item(s) a little bit later then schedule (and perhaps offer free shipping, or upgraded shipping to compensate, OR ask if they would rather have a full refund.  I have refunded people in the past, because of past issues with not being able to get the pillows out in time due to machine problems. I WANT my customer to be able to come back, and comfortably refer friends and family, and KNOW that you'll get your item, or your money back. I Know that paypal has strict guidelines for issuing refunds, and I don't want anyone to worry that they wouldn't be refunded after a certain time. I will only be taking a limited number of orders per month, so if you order at the beginning of the month and suddenly change your mind at the end, you'll get your refund. Other possible challenges, I am a stay at home mom, with 2 children, who are both in school, so i will have a set schedule, m-f 8am-4pm. I will only be able to concentrate on my work while the kids are at school, once they are out of school, it can get kind of hectic in my house. Summer time, I will keep the same schedule, but I may not be able to keep the same pace as school months.",https://www.kickstarter.com/projects/mysticriverrose/mystic-river-rose-all-natural-soy-candles-and-jewe?ref=discovery_category_newest,mysticriverrose/mystic-river-rose-all-natural-soy-candles-and-jewe,"Hello! My name is Cassie! for the last 11 years I've been a stay at home mom, and wife. My husband is currently active duty in the airforce.This past February I had the pleasure and opportunity of purchasing 2 existing businesses. One was Jewelry making, and the other, candle making. I decided to combine the two, and really dig into it! We launched our website and shop March 1st, and the welcome we got was huge!! The jewelry making came easy with plenty of already finished stock, but the candle making came with very little supplies, a few recipes and what I'd learned along the way. Over the last couple months, I've been researching, testing, making, and perfecting my candle recipes and knowledge.Most of my scents are unique and you wont find them anywhere else!So what we're looking for funding for, is to go to a LOCAL printer, come up with a patent logo unique to us for our tins, and the scent labels as well. We are also looking to upgrade our camera to be able to take more professional pictures for the website. Currently using a cellphone to take pictures. Anything remaining will be used to purchase wax, scents, and or more containers for candle making.So far the Scents I have are:Autumn Apple HarvestCoffee & CupcakesMy candles are in 4oz tins, with 100% All natural SOY. the Wicks are a braided cotton, NO wire cores.The wax melts are a soy/paraffin blend.I have also come up with another candle type that has been popular! I call this line the Crown Jewel line. They are 8 oz candle tins, and each one has a alcohol inked necklace hidden inside! As you burn the candle, a foil packet sneaks out, you can carefully extract this and find a unique one of a kind necklace on an 18"" chain, Nickel and lead free!Here is a example of the necklace you might find in your candle!I have also been trying to experiment with the idea of glass jars for the jewelry candles!But again, presentation is a large part of this!With your help, I would love to take this to the next left, nail down those labels, the logo, and then my next step is to take these candles and try to get them in the local gift shops! maybe even a couple hospital gift shops?My kids love to help me, we try to do a few vendor events every couple months, but sadly, most of the budget was spent purchasing the business, creating and launching the website, supplies, etc. I have so many fantastic scents still in the works, fandom candles, monthly scents, birthstone candles and so much more, so please, consider pledging to help us get to that next step! Thank you so much!","Problems we could run into are very small and easily fixed or overcome, for example, candle doesn't burn evenly, the scent isn't strong enough, or the scent is too strong, all this can be adjusted by changing my formula's, upgrading the wick size or downsizing. Currently how i am handling that, I have a set group of people who are my testers, I ship them my candles, they burn them, and then fill out a feedback form and give me feedback on each candle, and i've been able to adjust accordingly thus far. I have not had many issues to date, and i dont foresee any that would be major set backs or giant hurdles to overcome.  I am always totally open and transparent about the process, ingredients and methods in my candle making, i have no issues explaining things to anyone who might ask :)"

We wanted to take this opportunity to thank everyone who offered support - be it with pledge dollars, advice, comments, or helping to spread the word.FREE TILE-PUZZLE: If any of you are depressed that you won't have the opportunity for hours and hours of fun (and by fun, we of course mean ""frustration and a not-so-slow spiral into madness""), fear not! Jay, who wears many hats at Cultúrlán, including tech guru,has created a free tile-puzzle featuring the artwork from this project and has uploaded it to our Facebook page,here.FUTURE PROJECTS: We will definitely be Kickstarting other projects in the future.

If you are just seeing this project now and you'd very much like to get your hands on one of our Cthulhu-themed T-shirts (totally understandable), please send us an email at ""info@culturlan.com"" and write ""Cthulhu Hug"" in the subject line. Available in Men’s from SM to 2XL and Women’s from SM to XL.Like many things associated with H.P. Lovecraft's works, this project was conceived in the midst of madness. The details aren't important, but the short of it is that at the end of the conversation we decided we wanted to launch a project in honor of H.P. Lovecraft's influence on our culture, but that we probably needed to start with something a little less, well, insane(to give you an idea of the craziness, it involved a Cthulhu-themed hot-air balloon, complete with waving tentacles).The challenge before us was figuring out an appropriate project that also fell within our skill set. Enter the jigsaw puzzle. Long experience has taught us that few things have the potential to madden quite like a particularly challenging jigsaw puzzle. At least,few things we can easily replicate.And the concept of piecing together a vast and complex puzzle does seem an appropriate homage, given the nature of the mythos. Plus, given James' incredible artistic ability, we felt this was something we could actually pull off. Enter Kickstarter.We can only surpass our funding goal with your help. That help can be the obvious financial support, or it could come in the form of helping us get the word out. Or it could be both. Whatever you decide, we appreciate it (unless you think it's helpful to be burning us in effigy. We don't appreciate that;).Pledge $5.ELECTRONIC PUZZLE. Experience the madness virtually!

We know a million dollars is a stretch, but summoning Cthulhu is no easy task. In the event we raise $1 million, we will invite all of our backers to a special location (probably Las Vegas. We should blend right in.) and attempt to summon Cthulhu through judicious use of alcohol (for those 21 and over. It'd be a real shame if the police interrupted the ritual due to underage drinking), a mixture of happy and disturbing thoughts, and maybe even some dancing (if you've seen us dance before, you'll realize that ""alien and disturbing"" only begins to describe it). Help us bring Cthulhu to a home near you! [Estimated Delivery: The End of All Things... or Summer 2014, whichever comes first]Our descent into madness began a long time ago, when we were first introduced to the writings of H.P. Lovecraft and the Cthulhu Mythos. Our journey has spanned years, and our break with reality was arguably completed when we founded Cultúrlán Enterprises in late 2012, with the goal of re-contextualizing history and mythology in order to make it more accessible to everyone. We currently have two product lines: The Native Celt and Mythographer-X. You can discover more about us, our product lines, and our ongoing projects via our website at www.culturlan.com or by visiting our Facebook page at www.facebook.com/Culturlan. A brief description of the Mythographer-X brand can be found immediately below:Mythology is the formulation of a complete worldview through the process of creating stories. Those who engage in this process are called ""Mythographers"". Since H.P. Lovecraft published his Cthulhu Mythos and J.R.R. Tolkein published ‘The Hobbit’ and ‘The Lord of the Rings,' mythography has become a staple of the entertainment industry. From comic books to games to movies, this process of creation has become deeply embedded in many modern cultures.The Cultúrlán Enterprises products under the Mythographer-X brand bring deeply informed perspectives to these arenas within the entertainment industry. Whether digital or physical, each product draws upon history, culture, and the other components of mythology to celebrate and, at times, redefine them as we explore the varied and often unnameable realms of the human imagination.","DELAYED DELIVERY. As with all projects of this nature, there is the risk of delay due to factors beyond our control (manufacturing issue, delivery delay due to weather, etc.). In the event of delay, we will send out twice-weekly updates regarding the status of the project and what we are doing to fix the issue, up until the problem is resolved.",https://www.kickstarter.com/projects/2067672215/the-shirts-that-may-yet-live-tees-inspired-by-myth?ref=discovery_category_newest,2067672215/the-shirts-that-may-yet-live-tees-inspired-by-myth,"We want to make Celtic history and mythology more accessible to everyone, and we believe we can best do that by transforming aspects of it into artwork and placing that artwork onto commonly used mediums (such as T-shirts, playing cards, temporary tattoos, glassware, and greeting cards). For more information, please visit our Facebook page or our website at: www.culturlan.comor send us an email at ""info@culturlan.com"".We know how difficult holiday shopping can be, and we want to help (we'refriendlylike that). Plus, we really want to expand our wardrobe.As a result, we are raising funds to print two shirts:(1) the Sword of Victory design from our Celtic Myth card decks, &(2) our logo featuring an Owlclutchingthe Salmon of Knowledge.The design on this shirt comes from our Kickstarter-fundedCeltic Myth playing card deckand is a traditional Ace of Spades bisected by the Sword of Nuadha, sometimes conflated with the Chaidheamh Soluis (Sword of Light). In at least one source it is also referred to as a 'candle' or fire-brand. This sword was brought from the otherwordly city of Finnias where the poet-sage Uiscias presided. Similar to Lugh's spear, it was unstoppable in battle and is possibly connected somehow with Caledfwlch, the legionary Welsh sword that would eventually become Excalibur, the gift of the Lady of the Lake. Since the name Uiscias seems to be related to 'uisce' (water) there could be a dim parallel with that more familiar sword.Available shirt colors: Black, with a white design (as featured above).Available styles & sizes: Men's, Small - 2XL. Women's, Small - XL.Our mission is to recontextualize history and mythology and thereby make it more accessible to everyone.It felt fitting therefore to include in our logo the Salmon of Knowledge of Irish tradition — this was a salmon which dwelt in the Boyne river, in a pool at its source over which sacred hazel-trees grew. The hazelnuts of these trees were magically imbued with mantic knowledge, so the salmon who fed on them distilled their knowledge in their flesh. Brewing in a cauldron or roasting this flesh would produce a magical potion that could grant otherworldly knowledge, so within the body of our salmon is hidden three hazelnuts.We also wanted to touch on more popularly held symbols of wisdom and otherworldly knowledge given our focus on history and mythology, so Verreaux's Eagle-Owl seemed a natural choice. The owl has long been associated with wisdom in Western tradition, going back to the cult of Athena. Additionally, birds play a variety of roles within Celtic mythology and predatory birds such as the eagle and hawk are associated with long life and transcendent realities.Available shirt colors: Black, Dark Gray/Charcoal, Navy Blue. Please email or post a comment if you'd like to see a different shirt-color option.Available styles & sizes:Men's, Small - 2XL. Women's, Small - XL.We are also offering 3 playful shirts as add-ons from our Mythographer-X line: (1) Cthulhu Hug, (2) Zom-bees, & (3) Don't Be a Snack - which features artwork on the front of the shirt as well as on the back.Available shirt color: Black.Available styles & sizes:Men's, Small - 2XL.

Please add $2 per shirt for all XXL sizes.Each shirt will be 100% pre-shrunk cotton. We will be using Gildan shirts for the Men's cut and Anvil for the Women's.Printing shirts is one of those things where quantity impacts cost. As a result, if we reach a high enough volume for our costs to change, we will effectively pass those savings on to you by adding these Stretch Rewards:$1,200. FREE HOLIDAY CARDS. Every backer will receive one complimentary blank holiday card for each shirt included in their pledge rewards. These cards will showcase our artwork on the front and an explanation of the symbolism used in the artwork on the reverse. The center will be left blank for you to fill in as you wish.$2,400.

If things get a little crazy and we raise more than 5K, we're going to need your help with ideas for stretch rewards. So if the pledges are flowing in, please post your ideas in the comments section!There are four of us at Cultúrlán and we believe we can help make Celtic history and mythology more accessible by transforming aspects of it into artwork and placing that artwork onto commonly used mediums such as T-shirts, playing cards, temporary tattoos, and greeting cards (among other things). We have plans within plans (which, ok, may presently be more accurately described as ""hopes"") of someday publishing games to help with this effort too.Our interest in history and mythology does not begin and end with the Celts however, and we've created a number of more playful pieces to celebrate mythology in general. While we primarily rely on our Creative Director, James Acken, for our artwork (with his background and experience as a Professor of Medieval Studies), sometimes we ask close friends if they'd be interested in designing something as well; the Zom-bees shirt displayed above is one such, with artwork by Alan Caudel.","Our designs are ready for the printer, we only need the funds to complete the print run. We will be using a Florida-based silkscreener for our shirts, but delays may still occur due to circumstances beyond our control.We will do everything in our power to ship all pledge rewards on time (i.e. by early December). Should we be unable to do that, we will immediately notify you, our backers, of the delay and what we are doing to rectify it. You can expect updates from us at least once per week until we ship your rewards - and we will be fielding questions and comments on an ongoing basis here, on Kickstarter, or via email at <info@culturlan.com>."

It's a type of Japanese stage play. Each fox represents one of four elements - Fire, Water, Earth, and Wind! They love to dance and perform, but most of all, they love to cuddle!This campaign is to specifically help fund the Earth & Wind foxes. We're starting off with three unlocked plushes though! The Fire & Water foxes have already been living at PlanetPlush and want to help get their friends funded, so you'll be able to select them as rewards as well! If we hit our stretch goals, more Kabuki Foxes and goodies will be available. You can choose any of the unlocked plush as your reward!If the campaign is successful, I'll be sending out a reward survey at the end and you can let me know which plush you want!Each plush is made out of a high quality, short pile minky fabric. They have appliqued and embroidered details, plus cute custom print spandex bows. They're about 12 inches tall from foot to the top of their head. Each one has its own unique symbol embroidered on its forehead that represents the element they depict. They have unique tails too!Here are some images from our factory that show off their details!(Click to enlarge)Everyone who pledges towards a physical reward will receive one FREE mini Earth Fox hard enamel pin! The mini Earth Fox pin is the same design as its larger counterpart, but only half the size! Mini pins are Kickstarter exclusives and will not be sold in my shop.Kickstarter will help the Kabuki Foxes reach a broader audience! The manufacturing costs of quality plush toys is very expensive, and it's often a struggle for small businesses to self fund on their own. By using Kickstarter I can gauge the interest for my products and bring attention to a potential new IP (intellectual property)!In case the plushes themselves weren't enough, we're offering more exciting Kabuki Fox products! Check them out below!Baby Foxes!That's right! The Kabuki Foxes also come in palm sized baby versions!

https://www.kickstarter.com/projects/778217334/custom-coin-rings?ref=discovery_category_newest,778217334/custom-coin-rings,"I have just recently begun to make custom coin rings and (after significant urging from others) decided to pass the word about my new found hobby.My path to making custom coin rings began in 2016 - my mother had recently passed away (September) and one evening in November I was searching the internet for a German coin with her birth year. I thought that it might be nice to have a coin for her and also another coin with my father's birth year (as keepsakes). While doing my search, I came across a video showing how a ring can be formed out of a coin. I became very fascinated with the coin ring forging process and before long I had watched several hours of ""instructional-how-to"" videos. The more I watched - the more I became intrigued with the process and decided to give it a try.To say this is a hobby would be an understatement. My wife calls it my obsession. I have spent many an hour working with different coins and using various techniques to develop my skills and abilities. I am far from being a skilled craftsman, but many people who have seen the rings I craft - say that they are impressed with the way my rings look.If you look up the history regarding when and where the process of making rings from coins began, you might find some mention of it starting with ancient mariners. Or you might find a post describing how World War II service men would pass the hours by taking a quarter or a half dollar and tap the rim of the coin with a spoon until it would mushroom out and curve over on itself. After getting it to a stopping point, they would then cut (carve or gouge) out the center until they had a ring.Today's process of turning a coin into a beautiful coin ring is much improved and unlike the early coin rings - today's rings preserve both the inner and outer beauty of the coins that are used.Rings made from dimes and pennies will always be made to very small sizes (many crafters will not go over a size 4). Since the original coins are so small, it is difficult to get a ring that will fit most people's pinky finger. For these reasons, Rewards 2 and 3 are being offered as a size 2 - just perfect for a necklace or bracelet bangle.To find your ring size for the other rewards, you could print and use this handy set ofdirectionsor go to your local jewelry store have have them measureyour finger or a ring that you know fits.Information and examples of the Quarters used for Reward 5 can be found hereStatehood, Territories. Information and examples of the Quarters used for Reward 6 can be found here ""America the Beautiful"" National Parks and Sites.The rewards associated with this campaign will be crafted to a high standard of quality and craftsmanship. Your support will be used to fund continued development of of my skills and techniques. You will also be aiding me in covering my startup costs as well as future costs associated with development of a internet shop/website where I will feature and sell my coin rings.For those of you who are unaware - the wearing of most (if not all) non-precious metal coin rings can and most probably will result in some level of discolor on your ring finger (the dreaded green or black ring finger band). To combat this effect - I coat all of my rings in a protective coating. This coating is not permanent and will wear away over time. You can add a layer of clear nail polish to the inside of your ring and this will help to minimize the discoloring effect.For your viewing pleasure I have included a few of my other completed rings.Thank you for taking the time to look at my campaign information. Even if you decide not to contribute, I ask that you share this page with your co-workers, friends and family. I hope to get my website/internet store up and running soon.You can email me directly at the following address: dragonsfirecreations.ok@gmail.com with question","There are relatively few risks associated with this campaign.  The biggest risk is that this campaign would be too overly successful (one could only wish).  Rewards will be processed as they come in and will be shipped by the end of September.  Since the rewards are crafted from mostly current coins, the risk of not having sufficient stock is not a major factor.  However when creating coin rings some can be damaged to an extent of not being able to repair or recover from making it scrap.",https://www.kickstarter.com/projects/778217334/custom-crafted-coin-rings?ref=discovery_category_newest,778217334/custom-crafted-coin-rings,"This is a relaunch of my first project on Kickstarter.

I still plan to have all Rewards sent out by the end of September. Hopefully my original backers will follow me and continue to back this project. My path to making custom coin rings began in 2016 - my mother had recently passed away (September) and one evening in November I was searching the internet for a German coin with her birth year.  I thought that it might be nice to have a coin for her and also another coin with my father's birth year (as keepsakes).  While doing my search, I came across a video showing how a ring can be formed out of a coin.  I became very fascinated with the coin ring forging process and before long I had watched several hours of ""instructional-how-to"" videos.  The more I watched - the more I became intrigued with the process and decided to give it a try.To say this is a hobby would be an understatement.  My wife calls it my obsession.  I have spent many an hour working with different coins and using various techniques to develop my skills and abilities.  I am far from being a skilled craftsman, but many people who have seen the rings I craft - say that they are impressed with the way my rings look.If you look up the history regarding when and where the process of making rings from coins began, you might find some mention of it starting with ancient mariners.  Or you might find a post describing how World War II service men would pass the hours by taking a quarter or a half dollar and tap the rim of the coin with a spoon until it would mushroom out and curve over on itself.  After getting it to a stopping point, they would then cut (carve or gouge) out the center until they had a ring.Today's process of turning a coin into a beautiful coin ring is much improved and unlike the early coin rings - today's rings preserve both the inner and outer beauty of the coins that are used.Rings made from dimes and pennies will always be made to very small sizes (many crafters will not go over a size 4). I have been able to take a Penny up to a size 6 and a Dime up to a size 4. Since the original coins are so small, it is difficult to get a ring that will fit most people's pinky finger.  For these reasons, Rewards 2 and 3 are being offered at a size 2 - just perfect for a necklace or bracelet bangle. I will, however, honor requests for larger sizes up to the Reward maximum size.To find your ring size for the other rewards, you could print and use this handy set of directions or go to your local jewelry store have have them measure your finger or a ring that you know fits.Information and examples of the Quarters used for Reward 5 can be found here Statehood, Territories.  Information and examples of the Quarters used for Reward 6 can be found here ""America the Beautiful"" National Parks and Sites.The rewards associated with this campaign will be crafted to a high standard of quality and craftsmanship.  Your support/pledge will be used to fund continued development of of my skills and techniques as well as purchase new equipment and inventory.  You will also be aiding me in covering my startup costs as well as future costs associated with development of a internet shop/website where I will feature and sell my coin rings.For those of you who are unaware - the wearing of most (if not all) non-precious metal coin rings can and most probably will result in some level of discoloration on your ring finger (the dreaded green or black ring finger band).  To combat this effect - I coat all of my rings in a protective coating.  This coating is not permanent and will wear away over time.  You can add a layer of clear nail polish to the inside of your ring and this will help to minimize the discoloring effect.For your viewing pleasure I have included a few of my other completed rings.Thank you for taking the time to look at my campaign information.  Even if you decide not to contribute, I ask that you share this page with your co-workers, friends and family.  I hope to get my website/internet store up and running soon.You can email me directly at the following address:  dragonsfirecreations.ok@gmail.com  with questions.","There are relatively few risks associated with this campaign. The biggest risk is that this campaign would be too overly successful (one could only wish).Rewards will be processed as they come in and all will be shipped by the end of September.  Since the rewards are crafted from mostly current coins, the risk of not having sufficient stock is not a major factor.  However when creating coin rings there is a risk that some can be damaged to an extent of not being able to repair or recover from - making it scrap."

Aside of my life on paper and canvas I began to create visual memories pleasant and entertaining. At one point people began asking me for commissioned pieces. They also wanted to see more, or be able to see my works in person. I promised that I would hold a gallery show, and or different events that were art based upon reaching my goals. I also promised to create pieces for those who requested if they would provide the supplies etc. My current goal is the first of many steps to succeed in preserving, protecting, and exhibiting my art. The project picture is an example of one of my detailed tiny 2 x 2 inch canvas paintings. if you go over on the right of the page you can read my full backstory in my BIO. I have not created a video yet, but I may upload one so feel free to check back from time to time.Having a very supportive following, and a drive to succeed I am hoping this kick starter helps to get me going further on my path. I want to give my fans and clients what they want and in turn create my artistic visions freely and share them publicly with no limitations.I am currently in the stages of beginning to protect my intellectual property and artistic creations with my own investments. In order for me to have an exhibit of any kind I would first like to finalize my start up as an art business legally and then proceed with the funds needed to rent different venues as well as meet the supply and demand for my art by my fan base.Running a small business can become expensive and in the beginning it will take a while before being able to receive a loan. I prefer to work for what I dream of rather than borrow money and have to pay back that money with high interest which will take away from the purpose of making money organically with hand crafted goods.","Risks: Delays in schedule of new installations / pieces for exhibit or sale due to my health changing at any given time as I am temporarily totally disabled and possibly permanently, therefore I have physical limitations. I would overcome those risks by preparing as many art works in various forms as I possibly can prior to holding any tour or event so that existing pieces are ready. I would also hold a virtual gallery exhibit where people can interact with me remotely and it will be a live exhibit but in a space that can accommodate my needs. ""The show must go on""Challenges: Road blocks with the needs of my business versus the availability of a venue and or funds. Art supplies, software, coordination, and more all require a budget that exceeds my kick starter goal and has already come out of my own pocket. If I do not reach my kick starter goal I will still continue towards this project it will just be extremely difficult and delayed.",https://www.kickstarter.com/projects/jackiesarttour/needs-for-supply-and-demand-for-jackies-mividajdma?ref=discovery_category_newest,jackiesarttour/needs-for-supply-and-demand-for-jackies-mividajdma,"I need the help of those who want me to create!!!! Art is how I make a living after losing my job. When I incurred injuries that required surgery, I was unable to do anything at same consistency for quite some time. I have been deemed disabled. I now work through my pain and suffering at my own pace to create paintings, drawings, digital visuals and more. I formed my LLC with self investment and am in process of building the tools I need to do more. Although I set my first Kickstarter goal for $4500 to cover supplies and company needs and it was not met, I still outside of the Internet was able to invest my own funds to pay for a lot of what I needed to make my art tour begin, however it is still not even close to what I need to complete the full goal. I sold art, I took side jobs and I over exerted myself through blood sweat and tears. Some people donated in person which was greatly appreciated!!!! I have done TWO Art shows even though my initial Kickstarter was not met. I did the first one out of pocket and invested in my supplies and registration and more. My company needs. My marketing material and then some. I re invested my earnings from sale into a second art show and into some more company fees and supplies. I was commissioned to do some art and am getting the ball rolling. Any help from those who donated on the first one (who were never charged because goal was not met) would be greatly appreciated!!I was also featured in a video by ""minute made ny"" that now has 3300+ views and counting the video can be found on Facebook.",Risks and challenges: Risks-delays when I'm feeling sick or having to give up if I can't self invest or raise funds Challenges: being able to crowdfund publicly after being out of the publics eye for so long during my medical rehabilitation. It is so difficult to reach everyone in a time crunch and express my creative goal!!!

Hosts Tyler Washington and Chris Kissinger begin each episode by cracking open a new craft beer to rate and review. The podcast aims to highlight the lack of diversity in craft brewers and bring more diversity to the craft beer community. The show also looks to feature guests who have lived an “alternative” Black life, to illustrate there is no set of rules or lifestyle that defines one's Blackness.The Alternative Blacks Podcast is looking to raise funds to cover the costs of travel, lodging, and tickets for the Fresh Fest Beer Fest. This festival, based out of Pittsburgh, is the nations first Black beer festival and aims to introduce craft beer to a market that has been traditionally overlooked, highlight local minority-owned businesses, artists, and entrepreneurs, and of course celebrate beer made by a few of the only 50 or so breweries in the USA operated by black business owners.The festival offers opportunities to talk to some of the leaders of diversity in craft beer to allow the Alternative Blacks not only be better equipped to discuss the issue of lack of diversity in craft beer on the show but also prepare the Alternative Blacks to lead a workshop for the local businesses in the Reading and Lancaster area.","While the Alternative Blacks Podcast does not have a huge following yet, they are known and recognized by some of the biggest pioneers in the Black craft beer movement and the education and resources provided at the Fresh Fest Beer Festival will help launch the show into an educational resource for the Reading and Lancaster region.",https://www.kickstarter.com/projects/alternativeblacks/support-the-alternative-blacks-podcast?ref=discovery_category_newest,alternativeblacks/support-the-alternative-blacks-podcast,"With everything happening in today’s society, the need for honest conversations about race in America are increasingly valuable. The Alternative Blacks Podcast strives to provide those open and impactful discussions to our listeners while breaking down the barriers used to define one’s Blackness. Specifically, we aim to diversify the craft beer industry by highlighting Black brewers and rating a new beer with each episode.To expand the reach of our message, we are asking for funds to heighten the quality and possibilities of the podcast. We will use the funds to invest in recording equipment, allowing us to interview local and regional brewers, as well as diversity and inclusiveness champions. With the ability to incorporate additional voices, we will record more provoking and informative discussions on the podcast. Equally, as our audience grows, it is time to improve the quality of sound. Our listeners can look forward to clean and crisp audio after reaching our goal!In order for us to provide the most enjoyable and educational content, it is crucial to run this campaign successfully. That is where you come into play. While we hope you are able to donate to the campaign [even a dollar is greatly appreciated], sharing our campaign with your friends and family goes a long way!","Currently, the Alternative Blacks podcast generates $60/month from our loyal Patreon subscribers. However, after monthly expenses for the show, it leaves very little for upgrading equipment.

This project itself has introduced our students to a real world problem in teaching students how to be entrepreneurs. Our old room needed an upgrade a while ago, as you can see in the picture below: Our new plan is to incorporate new computers and technology that won't take 5 minutes to log in, more color in the room, and the right tools. We will also take out a wall and put in a glass wall so that people walking the hallways can see all the great projects that our students are working on and they can work with many different classes.Some past projects that our students have worked on include a 3-D printed telegraphs, baseball bats made from a billet, and doghouses. We have also done work with electronics, Arduino, and C.A.D. software - Imagine what could happen in the new space!

Students like to express themselves through the way that they dress. With your help and contribution, we plan to succeed in our mission - to create a T-shirt that will allow students to do just that.Our T-shirts will be a great way for students to express individuality while still having a sense of unity with the entire school. Students will love to represent their school in a fun, cool, and creative way. They will be able to show school pride by wearing T-shirts designed by students for students.Our GoalsWe are greatly hoping for our business to be successful because we would like to give students a new sense of pride for their school. We have three main goals for our company. Our first goal is to make creative products that will be relatable to the Sutherland community as well as the general population. We can judge our success with this goal based off of how many products that are bought as well as feedback from the people who bought them. The second goal that we have is for our customers to be satisfied with our products as well as the customer service of our business. This again will be mainly judged on feedback. The final goal of our business is to have multiple learning experiences that will help us to understand the struggle of owning a business in the real world. This goal is harder to measure compared to the other two because it is more long term.Here is a link to our website which contains our full business plan.","Our entrepreneurship class has big goals and big ideas. We want to be able to produce these T-shirts so that we can help the students at our school to show originality while showing unity.Assuming that we reach our Kickstarter goal, our main risk would be not selling the entirety of our inventory. We are going to advertise and spread the word around our school as much as possible in order to avoid this, but, as with any risk, there is a chance that something could go wrong. Another risk that is a little bit of a subset of the first is that people would not like and/or appreciate our business, but there is not really anything we can do to control this."

We designed tattoo stickers to make a perfect match for these Folk flower styled designs.When we were young, we thought these kinds of paintings are old fashioned and boring. But nowadays we’ve come to realize that it is quite valuable and is inspiring us. They have their own satire, humor and their own unique beauty with concise expression. So we started to discuss about bringing “ORIENTAL PAINTING” to the present. And we selected some flowers to draw in oriental painting style. They’re peony and camellia. People believe that these flowers bring us riches and happiness for our family in Asia. A graphic designer, Jiyeon gave me a good idea about adding “TATTOO” to give some vintage mood to our designs, while developing these products. Finally we decided to use TATTOO STICKER instead of a stamp. You many know that most of oriental paintings have a seal or signature. So we thought that our designs have to be a set with tattoo sticker to make them perfect or be special. After finishing our designs, we apply them on POSTCARD, POSTER and POCKET MIRRORS as a kind of protoype. We would very much like your help in creating a new styles of posters and postcards and pocket mirrors that take their inspiration from Korean flower folk drawing, the oriental painting. Our big theme is honestly from unfamiliarity and likability of it. If you love travelling other countries, you could understand what we’re saying.

Pens made from wood are becoming very popular, both for crafters and collectors. I myself got caught up in their making a year ago, and have desired from the onset to be able to offer a set like the ones I have here. By backing this campaign you will be allowing me to upgrade my craft through new equipment or upgrades to existing equipment as well as the ability to continue working with these beautiful materials in order to offer them on my Etsy store and in my craft show booth. As a backer you will receive one of the rewards listed to the right and detailed below made from your choice of a wood that is mentioned in the Holy Bible. So choose your tier and get ready hold a piece of biblical history!Olive wood treesfrom the ancient city of Bethlehem, Israel (also known as Roman trees) have been bearing fruit since the time of the Romans.  Every year the farmers of the Holy Land pick the olives in the middle of October.  During the same season, they prune some of the branches.  This pruned wood is then stored, dried, and eventually sold to craftsman for use.The olive tree is one of the first plants mentioned in the Hebrew Bible and in the Old Testament, and one of the most significant. It was an olive branch that a dove brought back to Noah to demonstrate that the flood was over (Genesis 8:11). The olive is also listed in Deuteronomy 8:8 as one of the seven species that are noteworthy products of the Promised Land.  The Allegory of the Olive Tree (Romans 11:17,24) refers to the scattering and gathering of Israel.This is a beautiful wood, with a wide range of colors, from a creamy white to a beautiful pink.  It is the only tree in the Holy Land that can outlive the Olive tree.   The fruit of the carob tree is edible and slightly sweet.  It grows in the form of a pod filled with beans.  These beans were once used in weighing precious metals and gemstones due to their uniform weight, and is the origin of the word carat in those measures.  A more recent use of the carob bean is as a substitute for chocolate, snacks, and livestock feed.Carob, or locust, fruit is mentioned in the New Testament in Luke 15:16 as the ""husks"" stolen from pigs and ate by the prodigal son when he had hit his lowest point before returning to his father.  Also the ""locusts"" eaten by John the Baptist mentioned in Matthew 3:4, some believe, were in fact the beans of this tree, where the name for them as ""St. John's Bread"" is derived.Also called ""The Cedars of God"" this wood comes from one of the last vestiges of the extensive forests of the Cedars of Lebanon, that thrived across Mount Lebanon in ancient times. Their timber was exploited by the Phoenicians, the Assyrians, Babylonians and Persians. The wood was prized by Egyptians for shipbuilding; the Ottoman Empire also used the cedars in railway construction.King David used this wood to build his palace.  In 2 Samuel 5:11 tells how King Hiram of Tyre sent messengers, cedars, carpenters and masons to David to help him build his house.  And again King Solomon, David's son, used these cedars to build his great temple in Jerusalem. 1 Kings 5:8-10 details of the promise of Hiram to Solomon to supply these great trees for this purpose.The Cedar of Lebanon (cedrus libani) is now protected and is proudly displayed on the Lebanese flag and coat of arms.The genus Acacia includes more than one hundred species of trees and shrubs which are found mainly in the arid and semiarid regions of Africa. Here the acacia trees are often the only plants on an otherwise bleak terrain. Several species of acacia grow in the Sinai but one of the most common is Acacia raddiana, and it seems likely that this could be the acacia referred to in the Scriptures.Acacia wood is mentioned only in connection with the tabernacle (Exodus chapters 37 and 38). The following items were made of acacia wood: the ark and its poles, the table of showbread and its poles, the brazen altar and its poles, and the incense altar and its poles, all the poles for the hanging of the curtains as well as the supports [boards]. In short, all the structural features of the tabernacle were constructed of acacia wood. Acacia from Israel is extremely rare, and as such is extremely costly.  In order to make these pens affordable I will have to source this wood from a supplier that harvests it from other areas of the Middle East and nearby African countries.  It is the same species with the same look and feel, but sadly does not come from the Holy Land itself.  Once stretch goal 3 is reached, however, I will source enough of this wonderful wood harvested directly from Sinai, where the Ark of the Covenant was built, to do a limited edition series of pens with special hardware worthy of its beauty and rarity.All rewards will come with a certificate of authenticity for the species of wood chosen. All lumber for these rewards are harvested fromdead fallor pruning activities. No trees were harmed ordestroyed in the harvest of these woods.shown in Lebanese Cedar$90 or moreShown in Acacia$120 or moreWith this project I am hoping to fund equipment needed to take my craft to a new level, show off the beauty and majesty of one of God's many great gifts, and fund the purchase of materials to devote a space in my craft show booth for the sale of the rewards offered here.Initial Goal $1000My first goal for this run is to raise enough funding for the purchase of enough materials that I can take the same rewards listed here and create a devoted space in my craft show booth for them.  This wood is beautiful and begs to be displayed and set apart. This requires special signage and stands to be bought or made that will be worthy of such a display.Stretch Goal 1 $2,500In addition to my initial goal once this level is reached I will be upgrading my current lathe to allow for longer turnings as well as new chisels, gouges, and a hollowing system to help expand my abilities. Unlocks Ink options! Cross style refills will have the option to upgrade from the black standard to blue or red; while Parker style refills can do the same in standard ink or upgrade to black or blue gel. Sorry rollerball and fountain pens only come in black.Stretch Goal 2 $5,000Once this goal is reached I will be able to upgrade the entire lathe itself allowing for larger and longer turnings. This will open the ability for me to make platters and large bowls, expanding my repertoire considerably. For you this unlocks leather pouches for pens without boxes! All pens to this point not going out with boxes will be shipped in a plastic tube to protect them. However, once this goal is reached they will be shipped with a premium quality leather pouch!Stretch Goal #3 $7,500In addition to the first 2 stretch goals this will be a complete overhaul on my table saw, with cast iron wings a router table extension and a new fence system. This will also unlock the special limited edition pen rewards using Acacia wood harvested from Sinai with a set of hardware that will make them look spectacular!Stretch goal #4 $10,000My ultimate goal! This level of funding will allow me to buy a laser engraver with all of the extras needed to engrave round objects. I will have to forego some of the previously mentioned upgrades to my shop for this, but this will be a game changer for my craft. This level of funding will also unlock the engraving of all rewards. This can be a name, note to a gift recipient, small images, or even a bible passage mentioning the wood you choose. The only limit is size and your imagination! This will be a free service to all backers who receive a physical reward once I meet or pass this goal!**Please be aware that should I reach this goal all reward delivery dates will automatically be pushed back one or two months as I order, install, and learn to use the engraver.Hello, my name is Nathan and 2 years ago I started a small woodworking shop called BGG Woodworks --I had taken 3 years of woodworking shop classes in high school, but due to the cost of tools and materials, I was rather daunted into not continuing the craft.  So for almost 20 years I barely dared to dream of ever getting back into woodworking.  Then 2 years ago my wife, knowing a bit of my background, convinced me to take it up again.  About 6 months into this new, but revisited, hobby I found the joy of wood-turning, and more specifically pen-turning! I have been hooked ever since.  Being a pen turner allows me to use unique materials that most people don't think of. In the past year I have made pens from wood, acrylic, corn cobs, copper wire and silver solder, pine cones, deer antler, Corian counter top material, and even shavings from a previously turned pen (sounds ugly but it turned out great!).  In terms of material types, I can turn most anything.  The only limit is the imagination. The conception and birth of ""One Good Turn""As I said above, when I started my woodworking shop I gave it the name of BGG Woodworks a name with a ton of meaning for me, but not very descriptive of the craft I finally settled on.  For some time it has bothered me that the name sounded more like a furniture store rather than a wood turning shop.  I actually conceived of the name One Good Turn last summer shortly after I started selling at craft shows, but I laid it aside as I was already established for several events under the current name. Once the holiday season was over, however, I had taken some time off from the craft shows to prepare for the arrival of my new daughter.  Now that I am getting back into my craft and preparing for another summer of shows, as well as the decision to run this project here, I decided it was time for the change.  So now BGG Woodworksgets ""turned"" into One Good Turn!","This is a craft I have been doing for some time, and I have tested the hardware for each of the rewards myself, so I foresee very little risk in this program.  However, that said I do order the hardware for the pens from a third party supplier who guarantees the gold finish for a lifetime under normal use, but with any mass produced item some anomalies do occur.  Should the pen fail in anyway under normal use, please return it and I will remake it for free.There are some pretty significant challenges to face if this program is extremely successful.  The wood can be sourced from several places, but it is limited.  If my suppliers should run out of stock, I will make every attempt to find alternative sources, but it is likely I could be forced to wait for that stock to be replenished before I can get more.  Also, in the event of extreme success, the delivery dates can be considerably pushed back.",https://www.kickstarter.com/projects/onegoodturn/biblical-wood-pens-by-one-good-turn?ref=discovery_category_newest,onegoodturn/biblical-wood-pens-by-one-good-turn,"It is my desire to bring a bit of biblical history into the modern day.  Pens made from wood are becoming very popular, both for crafters and collectors.  I myself got caught up in their making a year ago, and have desired from the onset to be able to offer a set like the ones I have here.  By backing this campaign you will be allowing me to upgrade my craft through new equipment or upgrades to existing equipment as well as the ability to continue working with these beautiful materials in order to offer them on my Etsy store and in my craft show booth.  As a backer you will receive one of the rewards listed to the right and detailed below made from your choice of a wood that is mentioned in the Holy Bible.  So choose your tier and get ready hold a piece of biblical history!Olive wood trees from the ancient city of Bethlehem, Israel (also known as Roman trees) have been bearing fruit since the time of the Romans. Every year the farmers of the Holy Land pick the olives in the middle of October. During the same season, they prune some of the branches. This pruned wood is then stored, dried, and eventually sold to craftsman for use.The olive tree is one of the first plants mentioned in the Hebrew Bible and in the Old Testament, and one of the most significant. It was an olive branch that a dove brought back to Noah to demonstrate that the flood was over (Genesis 8:11). The olive is also listed in Deuteronomy 8:8 as one of the seven species that are noteworthy products of the Promised Land. The Allegory of the Olive Tree (Romans 11:17,24) refers to the scattering and gathering of Israel.This is a beautiful wood, with a wide range of colors, from a creamy white to a beautiful pink. It is the only tree in the Holy Land that can outlive the Olive tree. The fruit of the carob tree is edible and slightly sweet. It grows in the form of a pod filled with beans. These beans were once used in weighing precious metals and gemstones due to their uniform weight, and is the origin of the word carat in those measures. A more recent use of the carob bean is as a substitute for chocolate, snacks, and livestock feed.Carob, or locust, fruit is mentioned in the New Testament in Luke 15:16 as the ""husks"" stolen from pigs and ate by the prodigal son when he had hit his lowest point before returning to his father. Also the ""locusts"" eaten by John the Baptist mentioned in Matthew 3:4, some believe, were in fact the beans of this tree, where the name for them as ""St. John's Bread"" is derived.Also called ""The Cedars of God"" this wood comes from one of the last vestiges of the extensive forests of the Cedars of Lebanon, that thrived across Mount Lebanon in ancient times. Their timber was exploited by the Phoenicians, the Assyrians, Babylonians and Persians. The wood was prized by Egyptians for shipbuilding; the Ottoman Empire also used the cedars in railway construction.King David used this wood to build his palace. In 2 Samuel 5:11 tells how King Hiram of Tyre sent messengers, cedars, carpenters and masons to David to help him build his house. And again King Solomon, David's son, used these cedars to build his great temple in Jerusalem. 1 Kings 5:8-10 details of the promise of Hiram to Solomon to supply these great trees for this purpose.The Cedar of Lebanon (cedrus libani) is now protected and is proudly displayed on the Lebanese flag and coat of arms.The genus Acacia includes more than one hundred species of trees and shrubs which are found mainly in the arid and semiarid regions of Africa. Here the acacia trees are often the only plants on an otherwise bleak terrain. Several species of acacia grow in the Sinai but one of the most common is Acacia raddiana, and it seems likely that this could be the acacia referred to in the Scriptures.Acacia wood is mentioned only in connection with the tabernacle (Exodus chapters 37 and 38). The following items were made of acacia wood: the ark and its poles, the table of showbread and its poles, the brazen altar and its poles, and the incense altar and its poles, all the poles for the hanging of the curtains as well as the supports [boards]. In short, all the structural features of the tabernacle were constructed of acacia wood.Acacia from Israel is extremely rare, and as such is extremely costly. In order to make these pens affordable I will have to source this wood from a supplier that harvests it from other areas of the Middle East and nearby African countries. It is the same species with the same look and feel, but sadly does not come from the Holy Land itself. Once stretch goal 3 is reached, however, I will source enough of this wonderful wood harvested directly from Sinai, where the Ark of the Covenant was built, to make a limited edition series of pens with special hardware worthy of its beauty and rarity.All rewards will come with a certificate of authenticity for the species of wood chosen.  All lumber for these rewards are harvested from dead fall or pruning activities.  No trees were harmed or destroyed in the harvest of these woods.All reward hardware was chosen specifically to showcase the beauty of the woods offered.

You will have the option to choose another color hardware with your backer survey. All options will be listed at that time.Rewards include the items mentioned only.  Props, stands, books, etc. are not included.With this project I am hoping to fund equipment needed to take my craft to a new level, show off the beauty and majesty of one of God's many great gifts, and fund the purchase of materials to devote a space in my craft show booth for the sale of the rewards offered here.Initial Goal $750My first goal for this run is to raise enough funding for the purchase of enough materials that I can take the same rewards listed here and create a devoted space in my craft show booth for them.   This wood is beautiful and begs to be displayed and set apart.  This requires special signage and stands to be bought or made that will be worthy of such a display.Stretch Goal 1 $1,500In addition to my initial goal once this level is reached I will buy a small low power laser engraver capable of a single line of text per pen. Unlocks Ink options and a single line of laser etched text!  Cross style refills will have the option to upgrade from the black standard to blue or red; while Parker style refills can do the same in standard ink or upgrade to black or blue gel.  Sorry rollerball and fountain pens only come in black.

All pens to this point not going out with boxes will be shipped in a plastic tube to protect them.  However, once this goal is reached they will be shipped with a premium quality leather pouch!Stretch Goal 3$6,000In addition to the first 2 stretch goals this will be a complete overhaul on my table saw, with cast iron wings a router table extension and a new fence system.  This will also unlock the special limited edition pen rewards using Acacia wood harvested from Sinai with a set of hardware that will make them look spectacular!Stretch goal 4 $10,000My ultimate goal! This level of funding will allow me to buy a laser engraver with all of the extras needed to engrave round objects.  I will have to forego some of the previously mentioned upgrades to my shop for this, but this will be a game changer for my craft.  This level of funding will also unlock the engraving of all rewards.  This can be a name, note to a gift recipient, small images, or even a bible passage mentioning the wood you choose.  The only limit is size and your imagination!  This will be a free service to all backers who receive a physical reward once I meet or pass this goal!**Please be aware that should I reach this goal all reward delivery dates will automatically be pushed back one or two months as I order, install, and learn to use the engraver.July 31, 2015Kickstarter Launch!  After this date this program will run for 30 days.  Lets get to that goal line!Aug. 31, 2015Kickstarter program ends.  At this point, if, Lord willing, I meet my goal(s), backer survey cards will be sent out.  The faster you get them filled and sent back the faster you will get your reward.  I will be making the rewards on a first come first serve basis.  So who ever fills their survey out first and gets their reward first.Sept. 14, 2015 (Tentative)Money should be released into my account by this time. Once I get these funds I will start placing orders for materials and hardware to make the rewards.**Be aware that if stretch goal 4 is reached everything after this point will be pushed back at least one month as I order, install, and learn to use the laser engraver.  Any rewards not requiring laser engraving will still be made in order of receipt of their information for the sake of fairness and to allow me the time to learn to use the new equipment.Sept. 21, 2015 (Tentative)Time to turn, turn, turn!  Once all reward material and hardware is collected I will start to turn.  I will ship the rewards out as I make them on a weekly basis. This gives me time to turn several at one time, package, and ship.  Doing several like this allows me to minimize equipment setup and changes making things faster all around.  I still have to work my full time job and fulfill other family and business obligations while making these rewards so I ask for patience during the process. You should receive your reward in plenty of time for Christmas!I will post weekly updates of my progress here on kickstarter for the benefit of all backers! Hello, my name is Nathan and 2 years ago I started a small woodworking shop called BGG Woodworks -- I had taken 3 years of woodworking shop classes in high school, but due to the cost of tools and materials, I was rather daunted into not continuing the craft. So for almost 20 years I barely dared to dream of ever getting back into woodworking. Then 2 years ago my wife, knowing a bit of my background, convinced me to take it up again. About 6 months into this new, but revisited, hobby I found the joy of wood-turning, and more specifically pen-turning! I have been hooked ever since.Being a pen turner allows me to use unique materials that most people don't think of.  In the past year I have made pens from wood, acrylic, corn cobs, copper wire and silver solder, pine cones, deer antler, Corian counter top material, and even shavings from a previously turned pen (sounds ugly but it turned out great!). In terms of material types, I can turn most anything. The only limit is the imagination.The conception and birth of ""One Good Turn""As I said above, when I started my woodworking shop I gave it the name of BGG Woodworks a name with a ton of meaning for me, but not very descriptive of the craft I finally settled on. For some time it has bothered me that the name sounded more like a furniture store rather than a wood turning shop. I actually conceived of the name One Good Turn last summer shortly after I started selling at craft shows, but I laid it aside as I was already established for several events under the current name. Once the holiday season was over, however, I had taken some time off from the craft shows to prepare for the arrival of my new daughter. Now that I am getting back into my craft and preparing for another summer of shows, as well as the decision to run this project here, I decided it was time for the change. So now BGG Woodworks gets ""turned"" into One Good Turn!","This is a craft I have been doing for some time, and I have tested the hardware for each of the rewards myself, so I foresee very little risk in this program. However, that said I do order the hardware for the pens from a third party supplier who guarantees the gold finish for a lifetime under normal use, but with any mass produced item some anomalies do occur. Should the pen fail in anyway under normal use, please return it and I will remake it for free.There are some pretty significant challenges to face if this program is extremely successful. The wood can be sourced from several places, but it is limited. If my suppliers should run out of stock, I will make every attempt to find alternative sources, but there is a chance I could be forced to wait for that stock to be replenished before I can get more. Also, in the event of extreme success, the delivery dates can be considerably pushed back."

On Behalf of The People wasoriginally commissioned by The National Coal Mining Museum for England (NCMME). Following a successful premiere and small scale tour in 2017, we are seeking support to tour this exciting new play in the Spring/Summer, 2018. The PlayOn Behalf of The People by Ray Castleton, is a two-act play originally commissioned by NCMME as part of their 2017 programme of events to mark the 70th anniversary of the 1947 nationalisation of the British coal mining industry. Since the demise and dismantling of the coal industry in the 1980’s many stories, plays and films have been written and produced about the industry and the communities which depended on it and how they have fared since; important stories which need to be told about a period which deserves ongoing debate. But this play differs from those stories in that, whilst it also connects the audience to a period of seismic social change and struggle, it is set in the immediate aftermath of the Second World War and takes the audience on the journey of hope and determination of a mining family through to the Coronation celebrations of 1953. It is a story of political and social change which we believe is not told often enough. On Behalf of The People distils the time and the social changes into a heartfelt and endearing story of a family coming to terms with the loss of one son whilst embracing the return of another. It shows the family coping with all their private emotions about work, politics, health, love and relationships. The play takes powerful turns of joy, heartache, aspiration and struggle layered with deep emotions of love, loss and loyalty to one’s family and colleagues. The story is delivered by four characters and is laced with dry wit, humour and a sense of realism.On Behalf of The People - developmentThe play was an original commission by the National Coal Mining Museum, Wakefield and premiered in July 2017 as part of the museum’s exhibition ‘By The People for The People’, marking the 70 years since coal nationalisation.

https://www.kickstarter.com/projects/totalradnes/goofy-foot-an-alternative-nes-controller?ref=discovery_category_newest,totalradnes/goofy-foot-an-alternative-nes-controller,"In 2015 I traveled up to the Portland Retro Gaming Expo to watch one of my best friends, Ryan Ritchie, and his little brother Quaid compete in the Classic Tetris World Championship. I had been dreaming of making this pilgrimage for years and now I was there having the time of my life. As I watched Quaid get pummeled by Jonas Neubauer, the now 6-time Champion, I drifted from our world. Lost in the lust of the falling pieces, I envisioned myself amongst these Tetris masters. Pulled back in by a “Boom Tetris!”, I did not return to this reality empty handed. I was enlightened by the vision of a mirrored NES controller.Having played the drums for 2/3rds of my life, maybe I could utilize that hand speed and pull off the Thor Aackerlund hyper tap. But the D-Pad was on the left and I was quicker on my RIGHT. When I got back to Los Angeles I headed straight to the garage and made it happen. Luckily the classic rectangular design still had more to offer, allowing me to change the circuity and play it upside down The word got around about my creation and soon I had a bunch of requests to make more.  Seeing my mod as only a way I could overcome being a lousy Tetris player, the true path was cleared.I began to realize this mirrored design had taken on a life of its own and I needed to really give this project some attention.  Selling the modified NES controllers on a boutique web page wouldn’t be doing the Goofy Foot justice.  It needed to be made proper, with the cord coming out of the top and the buttons and D-Pad in their proper Goofy Foot positions.Designed to set the standards of Goofy Foot game play, quality and feel are our main focus. We want it to feel like a classic design, using quality plastics andrubber pads. A standard cord length of over 7.5' with an NES 7 pin plug, the Goofy Foot Controller is compatible with the Nintendo Entertainment System,the AVS from retroUSB,Hyperkin's Retron line,and other NES clones.Let's be real,we're not making the Goofy Foot to become rich. It's a labor of love, with a driving passion to introducean alternativewayto playing our favorites. With this said, we designed the circuit board with the community in mind. No black resin blobs hiding secret circuitry, we are encouraging the curious to unscrew the back plate and checkit out.With the buttonjumper pads, it's easy to mod the B/A buttons.Maybean A/B configuration feels better to you, giving you an advantagefor crushing your favorite game. Pimp your Goofy Foot by adding LEDs, just wirethem up to theextra PWR and GNDpads.It's simple, we need your help. Getting a large order of circuit boards, components, and plastic injected parts, to bring the cost down to something reasonable, takes a large chunk of coin to even get started up.   We’ve already broke the bank hiring a graphics designer and a product engineer to get the Goofy Foot 90% of the way to production. There's no stopping us, butwe could really get things cooking with a little help.With a bunch of great referrals fromother Kickstarter Creators, we have set uprelationships with themanufacturers weneed to bring this to life.With the bids in, we will need to raise $16,000 to kick off this production.With an investment of $4,000 fromasupportive Step-Father and the support of this NES loving community, weWILL be playing Goofy Foot! Swedish Columbia Presents...Goofy Foot, The Compilation, a mix of our favorite songs plus a few new and exclusive chip tunesfrom some of the killer artists atSwedish Columbia.

This DIY Mod Kit gets you everything you'll need to convert your NES controller over to Goofy Foot. Kit includes the ""Goofy Foot Proto"" circuit board, resistors, and replacement face decal(tools and NES controller not included).These Mod kits will ship out before the Goofy Foot Controller, so you will be one of the first to play Goofy Foot.

A term in video games for leading with the RIGHT thumb, as opposed to the more common way (left thumb on the D-Pad). Tony Hawk, a Right-Handed living legend, skated his way to the top standing goofy footed.  It's a misconception that the term Goofy Foot refers to being left handed.

With this said, we designed the circuit board with the community in mind. No black resin blobs hiding secret circuitry, we are encouraging the curious to unscrew the back plate and checkit out. Pimp your Goofy Foot by adding LEDs, just wirethem up to theextra PWR and GNDpads provided.Considering the preservation of the original controllers, we have designed the Goofy Foot Mod so that it is just as easy to return the controller back to it's original condition. The Action Switch is set back far enough, to fit within the walls of the controller's plastics, so that it fits without grinding. For the dedicated Goofy Foot player, a small window can be cut from the lower casing, allowing easy access for swapping the 'A' and 'B' buttons. Details will be provided in the instructions.

Thing is, we’re not doing this for the money. We’re doing it to help stop the spread of Covid-19 and save lives.We all keep hearing that the best way to stop the spread of Covid-19 is to, well... spread out. However, not everyone is socially or physically distancing as much as they should still. A lot of the time people simply forget to do it. But by having distancing messages written on as many chests or backs as possible, we can get this message across quickly. And by making the designs free to download, we can get the messages out there NOW.We’ve seen Iron On Transfer Paper for around $2.50AUD a sheet (in packs of 5, at a large mart beginning with K in Australia), and it's available in most stationary and craft stores around the world too. You can also buy it very cheaply in bulk online, but this will delay getting the messages out, so we would only recommend goingthis route if you live in remote areas, or for when you're printing your future t-shirt designs.And, as you can get a T-shirt for very little money these days (or, in fact, nothing if you use one you already own), this can be affordable for most people.There are already 20 designs ready for you to download. Most have various colour options, and where it makes sense to do so, we've made variants with your choice of 1.5m, 2m or 6 foot in the message. Oh, and there are also another 20+ designs we're currently working on, that'll be available to download very soon. If the designs are totally free for everyone to download, why are we asking for Kickstarter donations? Very good question.The money will enable us to create, launch, host and maintain a dedicated website, register the necessary URLs, pay our collaborating designers for their time (they don’t have much paid work at the moment), pay future collaborators for their time and effort, pay for photography of the designs, register a company (enabling us to pay our collaborators and suppliers), register a name for the ongoing project, possibly pay for translators and for PR to spread the word further.  It will also allow us to purchase a good quality printer so that we can print transfers ourselves, and offer them as an option for people who don’t have ink jet printers.Also, by pledging we can get your email address (which we will not sell or forward on), enabling us to send you the first batch of designs to download and/or share. Then you can start putting them onto your t-shirts, sweatshirts, hoodies, whatever...We would also soon like to offer ready-printed t-shirts (for those without an iron or who'd simply rather have a finished t-shirt sent). And, as physical distancing is going to be around for a very long time (some experts even predicting a couple of years!!), this is definitely going to be an on-going project, with new designs and offers regularly being added to the collection. We're also going to add smaller, cuter designs for children to wear and potentially designs for face masks and caps.Basically, the more money we raise, the more we can do.Thank you everyone. Stay safe.","The major challenge here is that we need to get these designs and messages out on the streets as soon as possible.  That's why they're completely free for anyone to download.  Also, we need to keep adding new designs.  Not just to keep the collection fresh and exciting, but also to appeal to more and more people (young and old).  Everyone has their own style and taste, and we need to cater for as many as those as possible.  And that is why we need more collaborating designers.

So to that end I've decided to try and start an event, half a year from Dragon*Con, that is primarily focused on ""Social Deception"" games with Werewolf being foremost amongst them (but I'm gonna play me some Harry Potter version too!).I have decided to call it ""Decepta Con"". Instead of selling tickets at some arbitrary price I've decided to launch a Kickstarter campaign to fund a space for us to play. All money contributed to this campaign will be used to pay for a space to play. The more we raise the bigger the space.Because the event is in the dead of winter I would like to host it in a hotel that has conference rooms. To make it as easy as possible for people who live considerable ways away to fly in and have easy access to the hotel I am currently looking at hotels with shuttles to-from the Atlanta airport.The first hotel bid/quote I received was the Atlanta Airport Marriott. Rooms are $129/night and 520 square feet of meeting space (enough to hold 36 people when set up like a theater, but probably big enough for one ~20 player Werewolf circle) is $655 for Saturday and Sunday.If people want to attend but that rent is too high we can consider moving the location to somewhere like Indian Springs State Park (30-45 minutes south of the Atlanta airport).So pledge your money and let's get this party started!Thanks,BJ Swope",Risks and Challenges:  Not raising enough $$$ per attendee to be able to afford enough square footage so that we could play good games.

The Company provides an opportunity for dancers in the Greater Kansas City area to showcase their talents and gain experience on stage and in rehearsal that is as close as possible to a professional level. Company members range from age three to eighteen years of age, as well as several volunteer teachers and parents. The company is managed by Senior Artistic Director “Miss” Tauna Hill Keltner, who is the daughter of Mrs. Hill, and holds a Bachelor of Arts Degree in Dance Education from the University of Missouri-Kansas City.The Company alternates between performances of “The Nutcracker Ballet” and “The Wizard of Oz” and the productions are open to any dancer in the greater Kansas City area. KCDTC has produced these two shows on a regular basis since 1987. The most recent Nutcracker was performed on December 4, 2014 and the Wizard of Oz was last performed on April 7, 2013. The next production of The Nutcracker is scheduled for November 2015.The KCDTD also regularly awards two scholarships to company members. The Nelda M. Hill Memorial Scholarship and the Kelsey Ryan memorial Scholarship. Mrs. Hill's scholarship is awarded to a Company member who demonstrates loyalty to the discipline of dance and ranks dance high among their priorities. The Kelsey Ryan Memorial Scholarship is presented to the company member who is maybe not the best dancer, but hold dance in their heart, the way Kelsey did.Kelsey was killed in a tragic car accident while attempting to make the 40 mile trek to Miss Tauna's Dance Studio (www.hill-topstudio.com) one January night.The purpose of this project is to fund the KCDTC operating expenses, production costs, and scholarship funds for production scheduled May 17, 2015 at Shawnee Mission West High School, 8800 W 85th Street, Overland Park, KS 66212.

I'm an obsessive collector. I'll start collections of anything! I can walk into a second hand shop, flea market or boot sale, pick up something old and instantly fall in love. I'm never happy with just one though. I need more, I need to find and collect all their friends, until I have enough of them to fill a box.

After all, who doesn't love a good story?As World War 2 broke and the U.S declared war on Germany and its allies, the materials American Tobacco used for the original green packaging, including its copper foiling were needed for the war effort.American Tobacco used highly prized chromium to produce the green ink, and much needed copper to produce the gold-coloured trim. A limited supply of both materials were available as chromium was used to paint tanks and artillery whilst the copper was needed for bullets. This was seen as a perfect opportunity to re-design the packaging to appeal to a female audience. American Tobacco declared that ""Lucky Strike Green had gone to war"" and started to phase in a new white packet design with red dot which has become synonymous of the mid century modern era through television shows such as 'Mad Men'. I have scanned in my beloved Lucky Strike Green Cigarette Packet and brought it back from the trenches in all it's pre war glory as a stunning A2 screen print.These A2 prints will use true to the original colours, including a stunning Lascaux metallic gold ink on a high quality, GF Smith Pale Grey Colorplan 275gsm paper. Each piece will also be hand signed.

I have tried to make the rewards as straightforward as possible, if you love my collection but don't have too much spare cash then buy a postcard. If you love the collection and want one on your wall but don't have room for a big A2 poster then choose the A3 digital print. The more you give to my campaign, the more valuable your reward is.

I also started studying Visual Design so I could make better notes.I want to empower everyone in the world with the basic knowledge of Mechanical Engineering topics, and I want to do this with the help of clear, appealing Visual Design.

Thank you for finding my project!If you're new to Kickstarter and heard about Lost Age Studio from Facebook or from friends/family, I would like to tell you that in order to receive your candle(s) and/or card reward(s), $1000 must be raised by October 1st or we'll all get nothing! Please read onward to educate yourself on my project goals! My rewards and stretch goals are generous!After my $600 investment for 70 lbs of soy wax, various fragrances, 132 containers, cotton/paper wicks, wood wicks, various labels, pitchers, measuring table and thermometers, I am unable to purchase anything new or to continue developing new products. I'm essentially stuck because of funding.With the small goal of $1000, I can strictly purchase high quality soy wax, 100% concentrated fragrances and crisp new containers now that I have all of the capital I need from the initial investment. With your help, the studio will come to full life!Lost Age Studio was created with an out-of-pocket investment of $600 in early August of 2015. Honestly, I should have used Kickstarter from the very start while making a few products for creative development. My goal is to bring fragrances inspired from the past to the future, such as my buried treasure fragrance you can read about down below.My mission is to produce reasonably priced soy wax candles with unique fragrances and a creative edge inside of packaging you can be proud to hold in your hand and place in your living space. The mission is to ALSO continuously improve the product while choosing a variety of containers, colors and fragrance oil blends.You should buy a soy wax candle if you're looking for a candle that is eco-friendly and doesn't discolor your walls. Paraffin or gel wax candles can handle slightly more fragrance load, but they also produce a lot of soot and burn unevenly because the wax does not burn completely. There are more cons than pros when burning a paraffin wax candle.Have you ever bought a paraffin wax candle in a large container and when the candle is nearing half-full, you start to noticeably see the black soot collect on the sides? Yourself and others are breathing that as it burns. Soy wax candles produce such little amounts of soot, that you won't notice it and is much better to breathe in your home or apartment.Putting my old degree to good use, I've created an attractive top and wraparound label on an 8 ounce tin container. I've tried three different wick brands to find the best one that will create a steady flame that doesn't flicker out of control and create a proper melt pool.All fragrances and wax supplies I use are phtalate-free and American made.Here are my 15 LOCKED IN fragrances!Cinnamon Spiced Apple - Red apples mixed with cinnamon and other spices that will imitate the smell of a fresh baked apple pie.Cinnamon Spiced Vanilla - A fragrance that contains the essences of vanilla beans and spices. Inspired by the common trade of spices and vanilla beans throughout history.Buried Treasure - A bi-layered soy wax candle that contains the essences of the 17th Century Caribbean. It is designed to burn through a layer of spice fragrances that ""digs"" itself through to the heart of the tropics. This will create a spiced orange and rum fragrance mixture as it burns. It is essentially three fragrances in one and very fun to burn.Merry Mistletoe - A familiar Holiday fragrance we can all enjoy.Lavender - An aromatherapy candle that is tried, true and tested for many years to have calming properties.Cucumber Melon - A clean, refreshing and pleasant scent with the right amount of cucumber and melon fragrance. A top seller for many soy wax candle companies, so I made a unique blend of my own.Cabin Morning - The smell of freshly brewed black coffee and pine tree fragrance to fill up your home to bring you to an energized start of your day or just to bring your imagination to a quiet place in the woods.Blue Spruce - A strong holiday scent that smells like a fresh cut Christmas tree. Contains the blends of cedar wood and pine with refreshing citrus notes.Unscented (for the Allergy conscious) - An unscented pure soy wax candle with crackling wood wicks. It will only release the smell and warm vapors of the burning wood wick. For some people out there, this is enough to enjoy. This is a request from a co-worker that I honored.Peppermint and Eucalyptus - A relaxing aromatherapy fragrance that can rejuvenate you after a ridiculous day. We all have those days where we could use a little pick-me-up.Pumpkin Spice, Cider and Chestnut - I have chosen to blend these fragrances to create a special and unique fall season scent that will warm up your home ambiance. You have the fall decorations, but do you have the scent to go with it?Lake Woods - The smell of evergreen, spruce, pine and lake water are the fragrance blends for this candle. Imagine yourself looking at the horizon of a lakefront with tall trees all around you with the wind at your back.Northern Woods Tranquility - That first breath of fresh air when you escape from the suburbs and exit your vehicle at a campground. Contains fresh lavender and pine fragrance blends. A unique coupling you'll have to try for yourself. Also makes a great Holiday scent.Fireside Hearth - A familiar fragrance if you've ever gotten cozy next to an indoor or outdoor fireplace. Makes a great Holiday scent. Contains amber, woods, patchouli, clove and saffron notes.Red Saffron Ginger - A fresh and crisp scent. Use this candle fragrance to lighten up the mood in your desired living space. This candle fragrance introduces ginger, cedar wood, geranium and patchouli.I have much more ideas after funding is completed! Thank you!$1000 (original goal to start production) -I will make and ship the soy wax candles and try to continue business the best that I can.$1250 - MORE DIVERSITY OF CONTAINERS! -8 ounce (8 fluid ounces) mason jars will become available with a jute rope tied around the top with sleek packaging.$1750- ADD-ON! -I will create and ship one extra premium soy wax candle tin (4.8 fl oz) to every Kickstarter EXCEPT for the pledges that were for $5 or $1.$2000- EVERYBODY WINS GOAL! -The pledges that were for $5 through $500 will get an extra 8 ounce (4.8 fl oz) premium soy wax candle with crackling wooden wicksand everybody will be recognized in the Special Thanks (All will be known as my prime Kickstarters) page on the future website for all of your pledges.$2250- GENERAL IMPROVEMENTS! -Packaging improvements, pillar and votive molds, tea-light creations, labeling improvements, a high-quality printer that prints on new labels, more fragrances, a greater website plan and more! This goal will also put me onto Amazon's marketplace using Volusion.Anything more than the $2250 stretch goal listed above will be spent wisely. Every dollar will be accounted for on a paper spreadsheet so I can see the trends, track sales/orders/shipments and try to keep as far away from failure as possible. I thank you all for your pledges into making my dream come true. Making candles and other products I can think of for each and every one of you will be a great feeling of accomplishment!Thank you again! It really means A LOT!","How will I mass produce these candles?There's nothing to worry about with my ability to complete all of these candles inside of the due date window I am giving you. I have some supplies to cover product research and development, but not enough funding to purchase additional capital and bulk supplies. I know I am capable to make all of the candles you see in the pledge rewards with the right capital and supplies.How will I remain competitive?I have done more research than I can keep track of in time. I work at an assembly line for my day job and when I get home, I research candles and suppliers. I have found the best possible soy wax and fragrance oil suppliers I require to maintain a high quality product.What is my risk?I can promise the Kickstarters who pledge their money towards my project the candles they are going to get as rewards... But, what happens after that? I have a few years experience in sales and marketing and I will try to do what I can to keep Lost Age Studio alive.What are my challenges?Developing a loyal customer base. I have sold many candles to co-workers, friends and family and they have all given me positive reviews on the products they receive. I have to attend tradeshows and make more personal sales to create more sales and referrals.I'll use Etsy, Amazon and a website I can create in the future.",https://www.kickstarter.com/projects/845152650/black-pearl-candle-company-soy-wax-wood-wicks-and?ref=discovery_category_newest,845152650/black-pearl-candle-company-soy-wax-wood-wicks-and,,"Overfunding is something I am prepared for. Every candle requires 7 ounces of wax, 1 fl oz of fragrance oil and one wooden wick. Using basic math, I can calculate how much of everything I need before and after funding or overfunding to complete your orders.Boxes for shipping have all been figured out as well as the final packaging design. There's a lot of work by hand to be done for each candle, but I've arranged how much packaging supplies I would need to order for X amount of candles.Don't worry about my abilities of assembly and production because I've been working in assembly for the last 3 years and I know the procedure! Thanks for reading and please find a reward that suits you the best!"

So for now I will share what I can!Having two small children, I discovered many things in life that I didn't realize before.

I learned that soap, candles, shampoo, deodorant, and pretty much anything that you would use to clean and/or pamper yourself, was actually doing you more harm than good!Needless to say... I was shocked. So I turned to organic and natural products for my children and myself, and that lead to me creating things at home. This then lead to my first bath business thoughts in 2015, which lead to me starting my first legal business called 'Simply Wonderful Candles' in 2016. After a lot of trial and error (but also success), I decided to take what I learned from my little candle business and re-brand for a fresh start in 2017. I was struggling with the idea of selling just candles because I wanted to do a whole bath line, and I also was still learning so much about branding and marketing in general, so long story short the re-branding didn't work out.I decided to close down SWC (after not doing anything with it for awhile) in 2018. Meanwhile, I was learning all that I could about branding, marketing, and creating soaps and other bath products- as well as a candle that I could 100% stand by as being all natural and amazing.In 2018 I started to develop the bath business products and brand, and in 2019 the vision was complete. The only thing that I needed to do was get the funds to get started, but as it turned out, we became homeless for a little over 5 months and not to get too personal, but it was horrible and my business was then the last thing on my mind.Fast forward to today, we have a really good home and are very happy, and I am now in a spot where I can go hard at my business dreams (which I also want as a way to be able to have more time with my kids).

Later on I will get a permit to sell cosmetics so that I can sell things like hair mask, whipped body butter, and lip balm.I will have pack and gift set options, and a very strong brand getting started! I have learned that your brand and marketing is key when starting a business, this is even more so than buying all of the products and making a bunch of inventory- because if you have no one to buy that inventory, then you've just lost all of that money and time. So by portioning out the funding money appropriately towards equipment, product material, legalization, and marketing, I am confident that I will be able to build a strong client base and grow my business even more from there!","The budget will be tight but I have done extensive research on where to get everything to make sure that I get the best values at the best prices. The timing is tricky because I have to legalize the business before I can sell and I still need to close down my DBA for my old business, but I have everything ready to go as far as paperwork and who will be my registered agent, so that all should take about 15 to 20 days.Once I have everything and the business is legalized, I will be testing the products and ingredients to make sure that everything meets the vision and will be something that I can 100% stand behind *I am not able to test my custom scents or signature soap ideas yet, but that will be among the first things that I do*.",https://www.kickstarter.com/projects/adella/goofy-goat-soaps-llc?ref=discovery_category_newest,adella/goofy-goat-soaps-llc,"All Natural, Eco-Friendly, and Fun- Goat Milk Soaps + Whipped Soaps + Coconut Wax Candles + Self Care Gift Sets!

Altobelli, I am the creator of a new web comic series called Zheph Skyre, and I am starting this Kickstarter account in order to improve it. I graduated from the University of Massachusetts at Dartmouth with a Bachelor’s Degree in Digital Media. While attending college, I began to take Illustration as a second major, but I was assured that I would only require the Digital Media degree and a good portfolio to get hired as an illustrator. I decided to start this web comic series because this story has been evolving in my head, and I must let it out. Admittedly, this is my second attempt at creating this series, but I am much happier with the results.If I reach my goal, I willpurchasethe latest HP tablet with Photoshop capabilities. Iattempted to raise money for an expensive drawing tablet and a whole Adobe software package, but I believe this is a better goal to set in mind.This web comic follows the life and adventures of an inventor named Zheph in an alternate world. His inventions are “steam punk” based, but the people where he currently resides do not accept such progression. They stubbornly stick to a harsh life of labor with few technological advancements. Most people view him as some sort of magic wielding demon worshiper because of it. This story will have both science fiction and fantasy elements to it, so the possibilities are endless.I was born with autism, and I have had various pets that I have adored. Having such social issues, I believe I have unique, personal views that will assist me as I write and draw this story.At some point I will print this story into graphic novels, but for now I wish to show it online. I could possibly work towards making this an online animation series in the future. I may require some financial help for these aspiring goals, but right now I am concentrating on the web comic.Donations will be greatly accepted, and if I receive more than the goal, I will hire another artist or two to assist me with making the web comic pages.You can check out the current status of Zheph Skyre at www.zhephskyre.com. You can also check out the rest of my artwork at www.jdaltobelli.com, but just a forewarning, that website is strictly flash based.These images are and will be available in numerous forms of prints. Some of them I created with a drawing tablet while others required traditional means when my tablet failed me.The dog in my video is Jack Frost. He is a yellow lab mix, and he is a kind, snugly buddy of mine. He is among a few great pets I have had that have inspired certain aspects I plan to use for this web comic.The two friends of mine that I am considering to hire to assist me are Elizabeth Swallow and Heather Finnegan. They are both friends of mine that I have worked with at the Worcester Art Museum. Elizabeth no longer works at the museum, but we stay in touch. These are two very talented artists whom I believe deserve to be recognized.I would consider hiring Elizabeth to help color the pages, and Heather to help clean up the black outlines on the web comic. Both of these tasks I do myself and they are quite time consuming, so I would divide these minor tasks among them.Among people who have taught me very useful skills is the illustrator Andy Fish. I have taken taken classes he has instructed at the Worcester Art Museum, and he is a very talented teacher.There are numerous parodies I am using as gifts for this crowd sourcing fund. These are based on other people's work, but considering these are merely parodies I am given the right to use them.These Deathnote Parodies are just a joke. I do not intend any real harm to any of the listed people (except Bin Laden is already dead and the Twilight characters are not real). It is just dark humor.","I have been working on the concepts for this story for many years.

This horror prose anthology collects and presents stories in the style of such great shows as Tales from the Crypt, Night Gallery, and The Twilight Zone. If you like your horror with a touch of dark comedy, this book is for you. Seventeen tales of terror are wrapped up in a journey through the strange collection of Vincent Gheist.Vincent Gheist is the odd antiquarian who runs the show. He's equal parts rock star, psychopath, and weird uncle. The story is told as he guides a curious visitor through his museum where every trinket has a tale.Well, it's kind of both. The Odditorium started asa graphic novel, but I had far more stories to tell than I could afford to have professionally illustrated. As such, I turned to this prose anthology as kind of a prequel to the upcoming graphic novel. Within the book, you will find several images of Gheist and The Odditorium as they will appear in the comic.Here's the fun stuff. If the project breaks $2000, I will add an additional story AND pack in an oversized postcard of The Odditorium illustrated by Matt ""Six"" Bahr and colored by Steve Canon. If it hits $2500, I will add yet another story, one I deemed a little too horrific for thefirst cut! If we get past that, who knows, but it's an exciting prospect.I'm a writer of horror, humor, and children's lit. I've lettered and edited indie comics. I've even published a few of my own. I was raised on 80's and 90's horror, comics, and a steady diet of shows like Tales from the Crypt, Night Gallery, Outer Limits, and Twilight Zone. I love my horror with a twist or a smirk.I'm not one to tell you how to parent, but I'd say this book is probably a hard R in a few places. People react to horror in realistic ways... usually with a swear word.I know, and neither should you.Thank you to everyone checking out, sharing, and supporting the project. Indie horror is my passion and it has been a long labor of love to get these stories from my head to the printed page.","Barring a catastrophe at the printers, there are no immediate challenges to the book.

Ain't nothin' like the real thing, right? Seventeen tales of terror are wrapped up in an over 200 page journeythrough the strange collection of Vincent Gheist.The Odditorium follows Howard Baker, a disillusioned horror writer yearning for something special to inspire him in his sleepy little town. A strange encounter in his boring local museum sends him on a journey that lands him on the doorstep of odd antiquarian, Vincent Gheist. Once within the walls of his strange mansion, each room holds its own collection of strange stories. The book is a a series of tales within a tale, as any good anthology is. A trip to the ""Slightly Haunted Objects room"" opens the chapter Back to Paranormal. Dinner in the dining hall begins the stomach churning chapter You Are Who You Eat. Every twist and turn has new stories to unravel and Gheist takes the sometimes snarky, frequently freaked out narrator through them all, bringing the reader along for the ride.Vincent Gheist is the odd antiquarian who runs the show. He's equal parts rock star, psychopath, and weird uncle. The story is told as he guides a curious visitor through his museum where every trinket has a tale.Great question. Yes, We did just fall just short of half our goal last month. After some number crunching and some soul searching, I think that's enough to give the people who supported me what they want. I believe in this book and this series. As such, I really feel I owe it to my supporters to put that book in their hands. I'm doing that by making my base goal JUST what I need to fulfill my promises to my awesome first run backers. I've also lowered shipping costs, added more early bird slots, and lowered early bird prices to hopefully encourage some new folks to come along and entice back those who weren't quite quick enough on the draw last time.So, let's talk about the good stuff...-Discounted early physical and digital copies of the book!-Original sketch cards from Odditorium artist Jon Running! Not just any sketch cards. They are classic horror scenes with a Gheist twist!-Cursed copies! Yep. Cursed. Complete with hexproof packaging, certificate of authenticity, and warning from Odditorium staff. Only the bravest or most foolish will order these. Buyer beware!-Original art from the book! That's right. Own a piece of original art straight from the pages from the Odditorium!-All eyes on you! I'll personally take a look at your work and help you get that story you've been working on ready for print!-You're Horrific! What scares the beejezuz out of you?

I have been doing pottery for 4 years now and I absolutely love it! Pottery is my lifeline. Having suffered from mental health issues for many years I find that pottery helps me to feel centred (I do love a good pun!) and connected to nature in a way that I never knew I needed. I can get lost in pottery, it’s truly wonderful.During the day I work for a local branch of a national charity for elderly people, where I provide a free information and advice service for the residents of Medway. I love this job and find it very rewarding.For a while now I have wanted to be able to give the elderly residents of Medway the opportunity to practice the skill of pottery, as I feel that it would help reduce social isolation and would particularly benefit those elderly residents with Dementia. I have made some ‘Dementia Balls’ (please see the photo below) which have a small ball of clay inside them that you can feel and hear rolling around inside as you follow the continuous pattern on the outside. Pottery is a very tactile and soothing experience, exactly the kind of activity that is good for stimulating the mind. Renting a kiln is very expensive and would dramatically increase the costs involved in a project such as this. Having a kiln will enable me to run sessions at a much more affordable cost for those that have limited funds.Working alongside local charities and community centres, I would like to run a low cost pottery course for the elderly residents of Medway.After isolation from COVID-19 ends there will be a lot of people who have lost loved ones, especially the elderly. Many of our elderly will have lost friends and partners and may have had their social circle severely reduced. I'd like to give them the opportunity to be able to express themselves through a soothing medium in a social environment where they feel safe. Given my experience within my day job, I will be in the perfect position to offer advice and signpost people to relevant organisations and make appointments for them to discuss any issues privately and confidentiality. I hold an up to date DBS certificate.My plan is to run courses in 6 week blocks, for 2 hours a week for 6-10 people at a time. I'd start off with one course as a pilot and gradually increase the number of courses depending on popularity and demand. All materials will be supplied as will the cost of firing and glazing. If this course is successful, it is something that I would like to provide on an ongoing basis. I would like to take my equipment to local Care Homes, Day Centres, Residential Homes, Community Centres etc, and give them the opportunity to experience the same pleasure that I get from making things with clay. This is also why I have chosen a portable wheel, so that I can use this in my sessions as well as teaching various hand building techniques.I would also like to offer future courses for vulnerable people, children with Learning/Behaviour Difficulties and those who suffer from Mental Health Issues.I have experience as a trainer and have delivered many courses on various subjects, and I believe that this experience, and my knowledge and familiarity of the clientele will enable me to make a success of this project. It is something that I am really passionate about.Here is a breakdown of the costs of my project:By helping me to fund this project you will be helping me to breathe life into my dream, and enable me to pass on those benefits to the elderly population of Medway.These courses will be ran in my own time and I will not be making any profit. The purpose of this project is to provide a different activity for people to enjoy, after spending so much time in isolation, whilst doing what I love.I will provide updates to everyone who contributes to this project. If possible I'd like to be able to display the finished pieces in a local art gallery.Thank you for taking the time to read my story. I have included some photos of my work, most are currently unfired due to a lack of a kiln, but it gives you an idea.Take care and stay safe.Karen",Potential risks are that the isolation of COVID-19 goes on longer than planned.

I can get lost in pottery, it’s truly wonderful.During the day I work for a local branch of a national charity for elderly people, where I provide a free information and advice service for the residents of Medway. I love this job and find it very rewarding.For a while now I have wanted to be able to give the elderly residents of Medway the opportunity to practice the skill of pottery, as I feel that it would help reduce social isolation and would particularly benefit those elderly residents with Dementia. I have made some ‘Dementia Balls’ (please see the photo below) which have a small ball of clay inside them that you can feel and hear rolling around inside as you follow the continuous pattern on the outside. Pottery is a very tactile and soothing experience, exactly the kind of activity that is good for stimulating the mind. Renting a kiln is very expensive and would dramatically increase the costs involved in a project such as this. Having a kiln will enable me to run sessions at a much more affordable cost for those that have limited funds.Working alongside local charities and community centres, I would like to run a low cost pottery course for the elderly residents of Medway.After isolation from COVID-19 ends there will be a lot of people who have lost loved ones, especially the elderly. Many of our elderly will have lost friends and partners and may have had their social circle severely reduced. I'd like to give them the opportunity to be able to express themselves through a soothing medium in a social environment where they feel safe. Given my experience within my day job, I will be in the perfect position to offer advice and signpost people to relevant organisations and make appointments for them to discuss any issues privately and confidentiality. I hold an up to date DBS certificate.My plan is to run courses in 6 week blocks, for 2 hours a week for 6-10 people at a time. I'd start off with one course as a pilot and gradually increase the number of courses depending on popularity and demand.If this course is successful, it is something that I would like to provide on an ongoing basis. I would like to take my equipment to local Care Homes, Day Centres, Residential Homes, Community Centres etc, and give them the opportunity to experience the same pleasure that I get from making things with clay.I would also like to offer future courses for vulnerable people, children with learning/behaviour difficulties and those who suffer from mental health and addiction issues.I have experience as a trainer and have delivered many courses on various subjects, and I believe that this experience, and my knowledge and familiarity of the clientele will enable me to make a success of this project. It is something that I am really passionate about.Here is a breakdown of the costs of my project:Kiln - £650 - I will be getting either a top or front loading electric kiln that I can plug in with no hassle.Clay and basic pottery tools for the pilot course - £72Kickstarter fees etc - £78By helping me to fund this project you will be helping me to breathe life into my dream, and enable me to pass on those benefits to the elderly population of Medway. These courses will be ran in my own time and I will not be making any profit. The purpose of this project is to provide a different activity for people to enjoy, after spending so much time in isolation, whilst doing what I love.I will provide updates to everyone who contributes to this project. If possible I'd like to be able to display the finished pieces in a local art gallery.Thank you for taking the time to read my story. I have included some photos of my work, most are currently unfired due to a lack of a kiln, but it gives you an idea.Take care and stay safe.Karen",Potential risks are that the isolation of COVID-19 goes on longer than planned. In which case I will run the course at a later date.

We have several team members that have participated in the RoboRave competition for 4-5 years already. All of that experience has been utilizing the Lego Mindstorms software. That software is really easy and intuitive to use.... but as their coach, I want to CHALLENGE them more this year!Arduino is an open-source platform for robotics that will allow our older students to write lines of code using Python or C++ programming. That will be more difficult than the graphical block programming style that Mindstorms uses. Our new philosophy is that once WinnAcademy students reach High-School, they should graduate from Mindstorms to the Arduino platform. We are very excited to try this new approach, and the kids are wanting to do MORE and learn MORE.The funds from this project will allow WinnAcademy to purchase five (5) new Arduino robot kits - that contain all the necessary electronics, motors, sensors, gears, bolts, and nuts.Thanks for considering this project, and helping young minds to be creative and learn more about math & science!","No risks whatsoever.

They are very interested in robots, and these mysterious machines lead to the fun and excitement that goes along with scientific discovery.These inquisitive kiddos meet every week from February to May in order to design, build, and program their robot to compete inseveral roboticchallenges. Without any remote control, the robot must use light sensors to follow a black line on a white track, navigate multiple Tee intersections, and stop at a ""tower"" to deliver ping pong balls. Of course, the robot very rarely does what it's supposed to do! Each team is typically comprised of three students, and they must balance robot speed with accuracy, while trying to achieve consistent results using the Lego Mindstorms robotic system.All funds raised will be used for buying new robotic hardware and software so that we can teach additionalyoungsters about math and science by tapping into the fun and creativity of programming robots. Besides the hardware costs, there are entry fees forRoborave,snacks and meals during their weekly practice sessions, and a custom designed T-shirt to wear at the event.

Sometimes, they are unable to commit to the 50-60 hours required to learn robotics during the Feb-May 2015 time frame. We have had this issue in the past, and worked hard to find other children willing to step in and learn even faster to meet the RoboRave challenge deadline.Robotic sensors and parts can be unreliable. We have learned over the last 4 years which components give us problems. Each team will have a backup set of those parts to keep their robot up and running through the RoboRave challenge.

When we thought about it more, a zine just felt right for us. We wanted something you could hold in your hands as the primary product, where the website was really an online anchor for the printed zine, where you could go back for more each week. Inspired by Kiki's Delivery Service among other things, our witchy readers have magic based on their own inner strengths and innate curiosity about the world.Now, we are hoping to print a lovely physical artifact that you can hold in your hands while you relax in the grass, sit on a rock by the beach, orsip warming beverages on a rainy day. Featuring illustrations and text by Lucy Kagan, the zine will also come with a pull-out poster, as well as stickers and postcards at higher reward tiers. We can't wait to ship it out to you, and we hope you'll enjoy it!As mentioned above the zine will also be supported by a blog, which will update every Thursday and Sunday by Lucy Kagan and Melissa Fenik. This will be a place for us to share witchy things with our readers on an ongoing basis!With this range of reward tiers, from the book to extras like stickers and postcards, we have also included a very limited selection of special rewards - we are excited to be making some hand-printed and hand-embroidered patches! Check back soon to see more as we work on creating these just for the amazing people who help us launch this project!The printed patches will be small one-color lino-cut prints on fabric with raw edges, which can be pieced onto a bag or jacket, or framed or whatever else you can think of.Melissa and Lucy both enjoy designing, illustrating, and hand-printing block prints. The print designs will be revealed in the coming months, but will definitely be magical!The top two reward tiers feature a hand-embroidered patch in a yet-to-be-released design, as well as a sketch commission from Lucy. These are extremely limited, so be sure to snag one of these if you can!","This will be the first zine that we will have printed and bound by an outside source. We want Hazel to be a beautiful book, so it is important that the paper and print quality are perfectly suited to our media. Shipping a large volume of orders is also new for us, since we usually sell in-person. We are ready for the challenge, and have a small army of friends to help us, but for now, we are not taking international orders in order to simplify the process for us.We will be using Kickstarter to take preorders so that we can best estimate what kind of volume we will be ordering, and find a cost that works for us. We are hoping to order enough extra copies to continue to fulfill orders and have books available for purchase at conventions in the coming year. Lucy has made minicomics, prints, and stickers in the past, and is excited to try something new. Both Lucy and Melissa have experience with screenprinting and block printing, and will be using these skills to make some extra special limited edition rewards.",https://www.kickstarter.com/projects/lucykagan/hazel-witches-lifestyle-mini-magazine-issue-3?ref=discovery_category_newest,lucykagan/hazel-witches-lifestyle-mini-magazine-issue-3,"Hazel is a young witch just starting on her journey of self-discovery, inspired by characters like Kiki in Kiki's Delivery Service, as well as young women I know who have moved far away to find where they belong. Hazel represents our readers, all young women pursuing their dreams, trying to discover how to make them a reality, and cast their own magic on the world.About 5.25"" x 8.25"" (close to your standard digest or manga size), 48 pages long, and printed on quality paper that brings the artwork to life, Hazel is a beautifully made art magazine on a small scale.Each artist and writer has created a thoughtful contribution, always illustrated, that brings our reader a little inspiration on how to live daily life a little more magically. Whether it's instructions on a ritual for confidence, a relatable story, or a few words about kitchen witchery, each piece contributes something special to your day.Sydney AndersonRagon DickardCorlette DouglasAnn DwyerLucy KaganAllison KupattMiakoda Van KuykendallNina MoralesNina PetrossianSorona RamdarsinghSarah Van RoseSudi RouhiTori SharpEileen StallHazel Issue I was made entirely by myself, Lucy Kagan, as a project to make a certain kind of book or magazine that I couldn't find anywhere else. It had to look a certain way, and have a certain feel, and contain content that was lifestyle-y but as if it was written for a fairytale witch and her friends.Issue II was my first time asking people to collaborate, and I am so proud of how the book grew and became something surprising and lovely. It contains a crochet pattern, a summer recipe, and a spell for withstanding a trip to the doctor's office. I love the feel of this book, and it makes such a nice companion to the first.I can't wait to round out the trio to this magical number, and I'm so proud of all the work everyone did inside. Whether you're collecting all three, or just now getting your hands on this beautiful third copy, I know your going to be a wonderful new part of the Hazel coven, and we're happy to welcome you. For outstanding young women everywhere who are taking first steps on their paths or are lighting the way far down the road already, I'm happy to make your acquaintance through these pages.Here's a snippet of the wonderful pieces you'll find inside!We have everything available from just a digital copy of the magazine to all three of the first issues of Hazel including a print exclusive to this campaign, all the way up to original artwork by one of the Hazel creators! These beautiful enamel pins are also a great addition to your accessory cabinet, and come with the book at the $35 mark, and we're adding this set of three prints by Lucy Kagan if you get all 3 books and the enamel pins. EDIT: Enamel pin tiers sold out, but you could help us reach our stretch goal to bring new pin designs!!!At the limited tier of Grimoire Collector, you'll even get a custom sketch in the back of your book, done similarly to these contributor portraits.EDIT: This tier is currently gone, but we recently added Grimoire Collector #2 after reaching our second stretch goal! You can now get three wooden pins pictured further below in the designs of the Teacup, Cat, and Witch Hat included, and we will also have the Magic Possum for sale later on.Our most esteemed and limited backer tier only has three spots, one for each artist who will be doing a small 5""x5"" commission: Ragon Dickard, Lucy Kagan, and Tori Sharp.EDIT: Lucy & Tori's commission slots are full, but Ragon is ready to roll!Each artist will discuss with the backer what they would like their commission to be, as the artist deems reasonable. A great example would be a portrait of your friend, your witchsona, your favorite pet as a wizard, or your favorite book character! Here's the kind of work each artist can create for you~EDIT: Aside from all the great backer prizes, we have cleared all the milestone goals! WOW, thank you!!! Find them in our updates!We were completely blown away by how fast we were able to get funded, and we're so happy to be able to release stretch goal items already! Before we could even post our first stretch goal, we made it to well over double of the initial goal. This allows us to use the same premium interior paper stock as in the previous issues, but this time on a lovely antique ivory color, as well as give everyone who ordered a physical copy their choice of one of our beautiful approximately 3"" stickers.The next step is turning these into wooden pins, and we've now released a new version of the Grimoire Collector tier that gives you just that! In addition, all of the $25 tier backers will now receive one wooden pin. Reasons why we love wooden pins: beautiful material, lightweight, preserves the beauty of watercolor paintings. Check out the sidebar for all the fun ways to join the coven and get a piece of Hazel magic for your own. We'll have lots of fun updates along the way, including interviews with the artists and lots more, so chip in, get your book, and dive into the world of Hazel with us!","Printing is the main challenge for us here. I have always wanted to make Hazel a quality publication that feels good to hold in your hands, and that means having it perfect bound and on a nice weighty paper. This drives up our cost per book, but we hope it makes for an item you will want to keep for years to come. This year, we want to try a brand new paper quality and a new printer with a great reputation for creating quality books. Helping us reach our goal will allow us to bring this issue of Hazel into the material world, the most magical spell of all!"

https://www.kickstarter.com/projects/puptreats/the-plight-of-humanatee?ref=discovery_category_newest,puptreats/the-plight-of-humanatee,"Hi everyone! My name is Tracy, and I'm trying to help get my *very* small art business, Atomik Cupcake Designs, into the public eye by offering some merchandise to sell. WHAT IS IT?My first project with this is called ""Plight of the Humanatee,"" and features Hugh the Humanatee, half human, half manatee, engaging in humorous illustrations involving the plight of humanity. Clever? Eh? Eh? Here are some example themes:""Humanatee help us all to be the best that we can."" (prototype illustration is included here!)""Literature is one of the most interesting and significant expressions of humanity. - P.T. Barnum"" (Cultured reader themed illustration)The quotes will be mostly inspiring, some of them by famous thinkers of the past, but some will also be funny (for example: I've lost my faith in humanity). The Plight of the Humanatee illustrations will be marketed in the form of none other than... humanatee-shirts! I'm sorry, there's a lot of puns here.WHAT IS THE GOAL?There are two goals behind this project; the first is, of course, to raise enough money to create and sell these shirts so that I can afford to continue creating more inventory for Atomik Cupcake Designs (more t-shirts, digital programs, price of making prints, etc.).But, the second reason is far more important. The goal behind featuring this particular series as my first wearable merchandise is to spread inspiring messages using an easily recognizable (at least I hope so!) character. We're all human after all, aren't we? Except for Hugh...he's only part human.WHAT DOES MY DONATION GO TO?I only need $650 to get this series going! This is an experimental endeavor for me, so the fund amount is low to account for the possibility that, for WHATEVER reason, the humanatee isn't as awesome to other people as I think he is. I have all the drawing supplies and necessary tools for vector illustration, so the funding will go towards buying the t-shirts and also to the price of having the designs screen-printed, since I don't know how to do this myself.Plus, if you're one of the first 20 to donate over $30, you'll also receive a t-shirt from the Plight of the Humanatee series! Spread the love!Thanks so much for reading and restoring some of my faith in humanatee. =D","Making the humanatee-shirts will be simple enough with the proper funding, but how will the word get out about them? How will he get onto the backs/tummies of hundreds of his adoring fans?Aside from the wonderful advertising from those who earn a free t-shirt from their pledge, these shirts will be available for sale on Atomik Cupcake's ArtPal page, and may also become available through eBay depending on their demand. They will be advertised on Atomik Cupcake's Facebook page and website, as well as the slightly-kind of affiliated SplatterCraze wordpress blog, which is my personal blog. If I can get this project off the ground, then I'd love to start making more merchandise featuring other characters that I've designed!",https://www.kickstarter.com/projects/puptreats/farm-friends-hard-enamel-pin-collection?ref=discovery_category_newest,puptreats/farm-friends-hard-enamel-pin-collection,"Hey there! My name is Tracy, and I'm the presence behind a little start-up called Atomik Cupcake Designs! Since 2015, I've been on a quest to turn my kawaii-inspired art and illustrations into tangible pieces of art in the form of stickers, pins, buttons, keychains, and magnets. My goal is simply to create, and to make designs that make people happy. There’s a lot of sadness in the world, and while a cute pin or sarcastic t-shirt might not make the biggest difference, it can still put a smile on someone’s face and brighten up the world for one person. And if I can dothat, I'm on the right track!For this project, I wanted to go big and design a series of hard enamel pins. I've recently created a couple individual enamel pins for my Atomik Cupcake Designs Etsy store, and I absolutely love the look and feel of them, so I figured...why not get a little ambitious with it? That's why I've decided to take to Kickstarter to invest in a little help to bring my idea to life. Guys, meet the Farm Friends, an eclectic group of adorable farm animals!(and if you want to see examples of our other products, check out our website here!)Each pin is roughly 1.25"" in size, with a brushed black nickel metal and silver butterfly clasp backing.If you buy the entire set of 4, the pins come on a special 4""x6"" backing altogether in a clear plastic box. It'll look great on display or as a gift!Follow us on social media and the web and learn more about Atomik Cupcake Designs!Our Website | Facebook | Instagram | Pinterest","The biggest risk that I face is that this is my first real attempt at a Kickstarter campaign! Several years ago, I made a very uneducated attempt at a Kickstarter for some t-shirts that I wanted to make, but because I went into it with absolutely NO research or idea what was happening, whereas I now I have a reasonably well-thought-out plan, I don't think it counts. ;)Atomik Cupcake Designs has a small, but growing online presence. My main concern is being able to have enough people to back this project! I'll need to sell roughly 55-60 individual enamel pins in order to meet my funding goal, so I'm counting on you guys! <3I've designed and sold enamel pins before, so I'm relatively used to the process and how long it takes for them to be manufactured. If successfully funded, PINS SHOULD BE SHIPPED TO BACKERS BY NO LATER THAN THE LAST WEEK OF NOVEMBER; however, if any unforeseen circumstances should arise, backers will be informed immediately!"

But I was always envious of those who could do it.My partner is an artist, and he began really focusing on creating in his spare time about three years ago. I would sit beside him writing, silently wishing I could do what he did. Then one day, after a few months he convinced me to give alcohol inks on yupo paper a try. He taught me a few things so I wouldn't feel completely lost.I fell in love, but was still intimidated by working with a canvas... like a ""real artist."" I've slowly been giving it a try but have struggled to really like anything I had done, until I completed One Red Bird #1 and then not shortly after, One Red Bird #2.This adventurous, little bird and her big dreams to travel the world is the story I want to tell with my next 98 canvases.Why am I so passionate about this project?1. Because this adventurous little red bird reminds me, and everyone who meets her, that it's never too late to try something new.2. Because art inspires.3. Because I think we could all use a reminder to live our dreams no matter how big they are and no matter what stage of life we are in. It's never too late or too early!By funding this project you will help this One Red Bird explore her dreams and continue her adventure, and in doing so you will inspire many others to do the same!Help me paint 100 One Red Birds!",The only challenge will be completing one hundred canvases.I've been very thorough with my budget and don't foresee any risks there.,https://www.kickstarter.com/projects/oneredbird/one-red-bird?ref=discovery_category_newest,oneredbird/one-red-bird,"In January of this year I began exploring acrylic on canvas. As a medium, it was one I hadn't tried much before. With my very first painting a theme emerged: One Red Bird kept flying through my landscapes.This One Red Bird kept showing up in my art because she had an adventure to go on and a story to share with the world. She was small and sweet and no one believed she could do it. They tried to make her fearful of this big, beautiful world. But she didn't listen and she just kept flying.As I continued to write her story, Covid-19 began to take over the world sending us all into lock down. The world was afraid, but One Red Bird wasn't. She knew that one day the world would open back up again, and when it did her adventure would remind people to not be afraid.In my own life, the fear I was fighting was sharing my art with the world. I had begun exploring visual art seriously just before I turned 40 and have never illustrated a children's book before. The thought of sharing my artwork in such a public way was terrifying. But here it is and now I'm no longer afraid.I'm so proud of this little book. It is proof that no matter what age or stage of life you are in, you too can always dream a new dream. Help me make this dream even more real with a beautiful hardcover!Thank you for reading my story and sharing in One Red Bird's journey!",The only risk I see is having to deliver late due to Covid-19 shut downs.

Their programming language is based on that of Arduino, making it familiar to the vast body of Arduinoistas.The PhoBot makes building a connected robot really simple. The PhoBot is a Shield into which you can plug your Spark Core or Photon. You can then connect it up to batteries and motors, to use the Photon or Core as the 'brain' of a robot.The PhoBot prototype has the following features:The PhoBot is an Open Source Hardware design and when the design is final, the schematic, and EAGLE design files will be made available on Github along with a simple to use code library that will also be open source.You can specify 'variables' and 'functions' in your Photon/Core code that then make it really easy to make nice web interfaces like the one below to control your robot using a code library developed specifically for the PhoBot. This includes getting a real-time reading of the battery voltage and distance to any obstacles.At the moment, just one PhoBot prototype exists (cooked in my modified toaster oven) and it has only been tested on the Spark Core (Photon arriving any day) the idea of this Kickstarter is to iron out any little problems with the prototype and thenfund an initial production run by SeeedStudio.com who have something better than a kitchen appliance to make PCBs.","I've tested the first prototype with a Spark Core and it seems pretty good, so I don't see too many risks. However, I'm waiting for a Photon to arrive so that it can be tested with that. There is probably only one more prototype iteration before the design is good enough for production.From a business perspective, the product will be managed by my partner Linda who runs MonkMakes.com which sells a number of products that we make and source to support my books.",https://www.kickstarter.com/projects/simonmonk2/monkmakes-protoboard?ref=discovery_category_newest,simonmonk2/monkmakes-protoboard,"As an electronics hobbyist, I like to prototype my projects on solderless breadboard and then transfer them to something more permanent when everything is working right. I have never been completely satisfied with other protoboard designs and decided to address what I saw as their short-comings.MonkMakes Protoboard is designed to make the creation of one-off projects and prototypes as simple to make as possible by:1. Using the same layout as 400 point 'half' solderless breadboard (inspired by Adafruit's Permaproto boards)2. Adding component footprints on the side of the board for connectors and a relay that don't fit straight onto breadboard. These are unpopulated so just add the parts you need for a particular project.3 Adding component footprints on the board for a linear voltage regulator to add a power supply (if you need it)4. Add longer breadboard rows at the bottom of the board for modules that use 2x4 or 2x5 pins such as the ESP01 or NRF24 modules.5. Solder jumpers to allow supply rails to be connected to power supply (if you want)As well as being a good place to solder up the final design, I have also found it useful to stick a solderless breadboard onto one protoboard with a full set of components to be used for the solderless breadboard phase of the project. That way I can prototype without the need for any soldering, using jumper wires to connect to the screw terminals, audio jack etc.Because this is a product that can be used in various configurations, there are a few variations on what is included in the product as reflected in the Rewards.Some people will just want to buy the bare boards. Others will want boards with a set of components and a solderless breadboard to make a complete prototyping kit.Here is what I did when I was making an energy monitor for my solar panels using a Spark Core.First off, I turned one of the MonkMakes Protoboards into a solderless prototyping board by soldering on all the connectors and sticking a self-adhesive solderless breadboard onto the protoboard. This board can then be used each time I have a new design to prototype.The next step is to build the design.The audio jack is used to connect the CT sensor that measure the current and two screw terminals are connected to an AC transformer.Once it was all working, I just transferred the solderless breadboard design to a second protoboard to make the design more permanent.This is super-easy to do because everything is in the same place and could just be transferred from the solderless build to the soldered protoboard.This board is ideal for use with any project that you could start with a 400 point solderless breadboard. So that means pretty much any project. Its great for projects that use an Arduino Pro Mini or even for making an off-board Arduino.The aim of this Kickstarter is to fund an initial run of PCB manufacture and component sets to launch this product onto the market for Monk makes Ltd.","A first prototype of the board has been made and a few prototypes (projects I have been waiting to make) have been created. So, I see this project as low risk.Being able to supply a kit of (extra components) requires the sourcing of components at a good price to keep this prototyping system low-cost."
https://www.kickstarter.com/projects/drywitgoods/send-jen-to-the-national-stationery-show-please?ref=discovery_category_newest,drywitgoods/send-jen-to-the-national-stationery-show-please,"HI, I'm Jen and I make and wholesale my own stationery. I design, print, cut, and fold from my home office and I want to increase my sales for 2019 and beyond. One great way to do that is to meet buyers from shops across the world, face to face, at the 2019 National Stationery Show in New York City.The catch: it's wicked expensive to get there and exhibit. Some people spend up to $20,000 (yes, that's the correct number of zeros) but I'm hoping to spend only $8,000. This covers the booth fee, the setup of the booth, travel, hotel, food, and marketing materials before, during, and after the show. Whew! That's a lot, right!?But I know it will be worth it because I am so confident in my products. I only sell the cards I love and that make me and others laugh.I design cards that look pretty, then deliver a killer smart-ass, cheeky, witty punch! Take a look at my catalog and see if you like anything.As of writing this, I am in 7 states and 9 shops. My goal is to be in 80 shops! Yikes, right? This is why exhibiting at the show could be a big effing deal for me.If you choose to help me get to NYC in February, I promise to make you proud and bust out some sales.Take a peek at my catalog and see it my stuff moves you to pledge.",My challenge is time. I can turn around 100-200 cards a week so I should have enough time planned to fulfill cards for this project. But you never know... every American adult may decide to fund me and then I'll be slammed trying to fulfill cards - so I added a big ol' buffer. It that would be a challenge I'd be so happy to take on!,https://www.kickstarter.com/projects/drywitgoods/dry-wit-goods-snail-mail-subscription-kit?ref=discovery_category_newest,drywitgoods/dry-wit-goods-snail-mail-subscription-kit,"Hi! I'm Jen, with Dry Wit Goods, and I make stationery - specifically greeting cards, calendars, prints, decals, and other novelties. They are sassy, pretty, and smart-assy, and make people happy. I take familiar life moments and turn them into punchlines that are relatable, yet surprising. I sell retail and wholesale from my home office and do it all myself! I'm a one-woman, card-making, machine.In addition to my cards, calendars, and prints, I am adding a monthly subscription box for snail mail lovers.Snail Mail faces challenges in texting, Facebook, and email, being used to catch people up on life happenings. But there's nothing like going to the mailbox, pulling out a pretty envelope, and tearing it open to find a gem of a letter from someone you adore! A letter, written well, is something that someone will hang onto and read a year later. It's also a form of communication you don't need electronics for -- and we all need a break from those at times.This monthly subscription box will include prompts and list fun holidays (like National Donut Day) to get your brain pliable enough to start with that first word and then flow from there. The box is also creative and includes embellishments (like glitter and glue, ribbons and embroidery thread, paint and wood cutouts, and so on) which can be added to prettify the letters and envelopes for a special delivery. There will also be quality pens and pencils you can't find just anywhere, that are cool or fancy-schmancy. All will be curated by moi based on themes and styles each month.Each monthly box will include:*The Kickstarter Exclusive* Box will include even more items and for a lower price than the regular box price!The boxes are especially for the people who don't make time to write, don't know where to start, and maybe feel a little intimidated by crafts. They are simple kits with inspiration built in.No two months will be alike so there is always surprisingly fun to open. And with branded packaging, you'll know your special treasure has arrived.I will also donate $2 to a literacy non-profit for each snail mail subscription box, and the boxes themselves are made of recycled material.The pledge amount I set will be used to cover the initial costs and things like: branded shipping boxes (these will be so cool!!), storage boxes for me to keep it all organized (yikes!), and some tools I will use to make a lot of the goodies that will go in the boxes. If I beat my goal and receive tons of pledges, I'll also allot funds for fulfillment help! I'll probably recruit my family, but it's only fair that they get some spending cash, right?I also want to advertise my subscription kits and these pledges will go towards a very small marketing budget. I plan on running ads on FB, Instagram, and Pinterest. Any click helps lead toward a conversion.**Overall, I want this subscription box to help people learn how to sit down, pick up a pen or pencil, and let the words ease onto the paper, telling stories about their lives in ways they didn't think they could.**p.s. I am so sorry, but this campaign and the subscription box are only open to US residents at this time due to shipping costs. Shipping is included in the boxes, and at this time, I don't have a way to charge extra each month for international shipping. It's on my list of ""wanna haves"", so please stay tuned.p.p.s. You can check out my online store, DryWitGoodsp.p.p.s You can follow me on Instagram and Pinterest, too!","The biggest challenge will always be finding new and interesting items to stock the boxes. My research shows that people end subscriptions more because of repetition than price.I also want to make sure that the boxes have the value people expect, no matter what each item costs. I'd rather include 2 quality items than 10 crappy ones. Fulfillment will only become and issue if this takes off and scales bigger and faster than my small home office will allow. But that's a problem I'd welcome. That would mean I was putting out a product people like."

Is it worth reading?Believers are making a profound impact through innovative means. Such examples like Wycliff Bible Translators, The Jesus Film, WYAM, and Mercy Ships have brought hope to countless peopleusing creative tools and new strategies.However.Those who can’t read need God’s Word.We have the technology to deliver it.In the same way the printing press, radio, and film have spread the Gospel throughout the world, we are using modern technology to share the Greatest News ever using… the world’s smallest Mp3 player. It comes preloaded with the New Testament in the country's native tongue.This allows the entire New Testament to be given to someone, in their own language, without them needing to know how to read. He or she can discreetly listen to it.Anywhere. Anytime.Whether this person is a guard on post in a closed country, a tuk-tuk taxi driver who works 14 hours a day, or an isolated worker harvesting coffee beans. They are listening to the most powerful story in existence.This tiny MP3 player has a built in headphone and a flexible ear piece that conforms to the ear. There’s not need for obtrusive, external headphones that get tangled up. The device is entirely self-contained save for the USB charging cable (included).Small, concealable, and easy to use. It is specifically designed for the purpose of working in environments where our brothers and sisters have not heard the Gospel.Every Ohura will have the audio version of the NewTestament pre-loaded. The language will be spokenin one of the world’s top 10 most popular languages. Each device will have one language assigned to it.Who will be spreading these devices? Our brothers and sisters. You!In the same way the Gideon Bibles are in every hotel night stand, we are giving this powerful tool to missionaries, travelers, or really anyone in a multicultural setting.A bonus to the Ohura Project: You’re not giving a controversial tract. Some tracts are awesome, while others have dangerously bad theology—you are literally giving the Word of God to someone. You can't go wrong with that.Will you join us on this exciting breakthrough?  Will you invest, not in a creative little gadget, but invest in real people’s lives… and bless those lives, using the brilliance of modern technology? Join us. Be used by God to give the gift of salvation, heaven, and eternal life to those who are isolated.","Our top 4 biggest challenges: 1. Enterprise capacity: I love Jesus, but I have a full-time job and a family to take care of. We need help. We already have a nonprofit 501(c)3 (Knok Studio) backing the Ohura project, so we have accountability, but manpower—that’s what we need.2. Battery life—a challenge that even Apple is struggling with: Right now we’re at 3 hours, which is the entire Book of Matthew (the longest of the Gospels), or Mark and John played back to back. While this is certainly enough for one sitting—as you probably well know if you’ve ever sat through a 3 hour lecture in college--we’d like to extend the battery life so there is less need for charging and more time for listening to God’s Word. 3. More of an unknown than a challenge: Finding a manufacturer who will finalize the design. (all images are prototypes. Final design may have variations as we improve upon the design) Our goal is the make a high-quality, dependable device but also make it affordable enough for travelers to purchase in bulk and take overseas where the Gospel has not reached. 4. Sin. We're always getting tempted this side of heaven. Please pray for this wild endeavor, that our hearts remain clear, our faith steady, and Christ close to our side.",https://www.kickstarter.com/projects/chevassus/ohura-the-minimalist-mp3-audio-player-with-micro-s?ref=discovery_category_newest,chevassus/ohura-the-minimalist-mp3-audio-player-with-micro-s,"What is it? The Ohura mini-player is a fully, self-contained Mp3 audio player. It is designed to be not reliant on a cell phone or headphones.The ultimate goal: Our nonprofit's dream is to distribute these mini-Mp3 players in developing countries. The players will be pre-loaded with narrated educational information--in the local's language. But first we need to complete this final push to finalize the design.We'd love to send you the Ohura mini-player for supporting this dream.It looks like bluetooth headphone, doesn't it?We want Ohura to blend in. We have designed Ohura to look like a common bluetooth device. We don't want it to draw attention, like a radio would. Ohura will be used as an educational tool in closed countries that do not grant education to women (e.g. Somalia).1. Charge the Ohura in a USB port (included cable)2. Load MP3s onto the micro-SD card (included card) and insert the card into the player 3. Turn it on and pop it into your ear (left or right ear) 4. Happy minimalist listening.We are already 90% to our goal, but we need a final push for a final design tweak. The change involves adding an ear hook piece that will ensure the Ohura player does not move for those with active lifestyles.We'd love to send Ohura players to our loyal fans and supporters once we're up and running!","We have a fully functional prototype, however there will be challenges dealing with overseas manufacturing.  Thankfully we have a wonderful relationship so far with a current manufacturer however we are fully prepared for unforeseen production snags."

A dog has three major agendas: EAT FOOD, PLAY OUTSIDE, and HANG WITH MASTER. This trip will give him all of those things for SIX SOLID MONTHS!We will begin the long trek in mid-April, 2015. Help Disco Dog have the best time of his life, safely and comfortably!...And the photos will be everyone's reward!This is not just a hiking journey, this will be a photo documentary of the whole experience. In 2007, Moss discovered the ""thru-hike"" on the Appalachian Trail. The trail runs for nearly 2200 miles from Georgia to Maine. It takes an average of six months to complete the journey. Stella Dog was his partner back in 2007… Stella has become too old to hike, and now there is a new pup, ready to take on the challenge. His name is DISCO DOG!! He's an Australian Cattle Dog. He was rescued by Moss from a woman on craigslist who could not take care of him any longer. Moss loves Disco and the duo will prove to be perfect hiking companions.Note: Since dogs are prohibited in the Smokey Mountain National Park, the team may end up skipping those 80 miles. There are shuttle services that will keep a dog while the hiker does the Smokeys, and then takes the dog to the north end, but it might just be best to skip 'em.Moss has already hiked the 1000 miles from Georgia to West Virginia in sections over the years, but the dream of actually accomplishing a thru-hike in one season would make this hiker's life complete… and Disco… well, he's gonna have one great time… all the time.We already have our basic supplies. Moss is an experienced hiker, so the things like Tent, Backpacks, Water Filter, etc., are in our possession already.Food For Six Months- Disco does not know how to buy groceries or support Moss, so Moss will need to buy the team groceries to stay alive. Besides trail food, Disco will get cheeseburgers in towns.Periodic Lodging - After each section, we will stay in a ""trail town."" Disco will get to sleep in a comfy hotel room with air conditioning. He will need rest. And many times, hotels charge extra for pets, or you have to choose a more expensive hotel that will even accept a dog.Shuttles/Transportation - When we come upon some country road, we may need to get to town. If hitchhiking doesn't work, we may have to call a paid shuttle. When we reach the Smokey Mountains, Disco can't enter the park - no dogs allowed… so some solution for transportation will have to happen there (possibly, Disco may be kept in ""daycare,"" while Moss braves the black bears in the park).Mail Drops - Sometimes Disco and Moss will send themselves packages with supplies. The post office prices are expensive these days.Supplements - Disco and Moss will be on a regimen of joint supplements and vitamins. Disco will also need monthly flea and tick medicine.Gear Replacement / Repair - The trail is tough on gear. Backpacks rip, straps break, cameras malfunction from moisture, shoes wear out fast (most thru-hikers go through at least 4 pairs of trail-runners in a season). Disco may end up needing his own set of trail shoes when we reach the rocky parts of Pennsylvania.The Trip Home From Maine - Since it's logistically complicated to ride a bus or a plane with a dog, we'll rent a car from Maine for our trip back home to Asheville in the fall.We've set a modest goal of $4,000. Every dollar over that goal will be used to enhance the experience, as well. We are asking for funds to make this trip as safe and comfortable as possible.

I spent my younger days exploring the woods around Travelers Rest, following train tracks after school, and swimming in the Saluda River during the hot summer months. There was no shortage of good times to be had. As I've grown older, I've watched my hometown also grow and change. While the woods and mighty Saluda remain constants, Greenville no longer has the abandoned tracks I used to follow as a kid. The unused railroad tracks have been repurposed as the Greenville Health System Swamp Rabbit Trail, and a thriving local scene has sprung up around this path. Now, there's a whole new generation enjoying the Upstate's natural beauty by way of the trail. I am so proud to see the many positive changes coming to my hometown and want to take part in this change. I believe that starting a plant-based food cart on the Swamp Rabbit Trail would be a great addition. I want to share one of a kind, organic, plant-based foods with my Swamp Rabbit kin!Rabbit Food5 Day Kickstarter              For the bowls, we'll be offering Sambazon brand açai as the base with a selection of organic ingredients for the mix-ins and toppings. If you’ve never had an açai bowl, you are missing out! The consistency of a bowl, versus that of a smoothie, is akin to ice cream. It’s so good!Additionally, we’ll be serving fresh pressed juices, kombucha tea, cold brew coffee, water, organic energy bars, and a rotating selection of plant-based snacks.Local and sustainable is what we’re all about!

https://www.kickstarter.com/projects/229002013/my-storytellers-keycharms?ref=discovery_category_newest,229002013/my-storytellers-keycharms,"At My-Storytellers we create hand stamped, limited edition Keycharms. We have a simple and unique product, we know what it takes to grow, and we are ready to share our story with the world.Keycharms are what they sound like…charms that can be added to a keychain to personalize and tell your story. Along with the keys from your house, car, and office you can let it be known that 'TODAY IS THE DAY,' be motivated to 'LIVE LIFE TO THE FULLEST,' and hold a simple reminder to always 'REACH FOR THE STARS.'Right now we hand stamp the words and phrases onto pewter or copper and add them to a regular key ring. We work from our studio just outside of Boston, where we hand craft each one with love.You are going to help us develop and produce a very special My-Storytellers Infinity Loop that will make it easy to add, collect, and display your Keycharms.The Infinity Loop symbolizes that the story never ends, but one of the most exciting features is that the Infinity Loop can also grow into a beautiful bracelet or necklace to showcase individual or groups of the Keycharms you've chosen.Your support is instrumental to help usrefinethe Infinity Loop, which is already in development. We are currently working on finalizing the design, and you will help us create the prototype and molds we need for production. We also hope to purchase more raw material and better tools for our studio, put together inspiring packaging and marketing, create our website and online catalogue, and grow the teamandproductionto meet the interest and demand we've had so far.My-Storytellers is a family company in every sense of the word. My Mom started stamping these charms a few months ago to give to family and friends, and as a way to help raise money for the Conquer Cancer Coalition. We've been working together running a non-profit for the past 11 years after losing my Dad to cancer, and created both the 'Conquer Cancer' specialty license plate in Massachusetts, and the Cancer Garden of Hope on Boston City Hall Plaza - as a way to raise money and awareness for the cancer community. When I put the original Keycharms on display along with my artwork in my gallery in Rockport, MA the response was tremendous. If you are reading this because you were in my gallery this summer, we couldn't thank you enough for your support and encouragement. So far our Keycharms have traveled from Rockport to Boston, New York City, Los Angeles, Honolulu, Tokyo, and London - and we are just getting started!Currently we are a team of three co-founders. Susan Zuker is the President of My-Storytellers and is the heart of the company. Susan's non-profit work and volunteerism ensure that no matter how big we grow, our corporate responsibility always starts at home. Michael Pelletz is our treasurer and manages our development and growth. Michael's decades of experience in running companies of all sizes and developing products to market have guided us with a plan for success. My name is Jonathan Zuker, the Vice President of My-Storytellers, Executive Director of the Conquer Cancer Coalition, Rockport Artist, and Proud Father. I handle our creative material, our website and social media as well as manage product research and development. I'm crafting this Kickstarter campaign, and I love telling our story. I believe in our team, and the ability for good people to make a great idea come to life. That's where you come in.Now it's time to tell your story. We have great incentives including our Infinity Loop, limited edition Keycharms and gift sets, a copy of the 'Today is the Day' song Charlie wrote, as well as special incentives to help us grow. And the bigger we grow, the more we can give back to the community by partnering with wonderful foundations, teams, and causes across the globe.And thanks to our friend Charlie Scopoletti, a two-time cancer survivor, who wrote and performed the song 'Today is the Day' in our video. Charlie performs every year at our free Day of Hope and Healing event at the Cancer Garden of Hope on Boston City Hall Plaza and we are proud to have him on our My-Storytellers team.That's our story, and we're sticking to it.","The one thing we've learned by working together in the cancer community is that many of life's challenges lie over the horizon. We are prepared to adjust our sails, to meet any challenges and to enjoy our journey. We've always said that as long as it's not cancer, we'll deal with it. That's our promise, whether its a snag in production and delivery of our Infinity Loop, a mistake in the fulfillment of an order, or anything else. We promise to work hard together to make things right, and be transparent about our process. We are not building this company to run a sprint, rather we are training it to endure a marathon. And we're from Boston, so we know a thing or two about marathons.",https://www.kickstarter.com/projects/229002013/my-storytellers-keycharms-your-life-is-your-story?ref=discovery_category_newest,229002013/my-storytellers-keycharms-your-life-is-your-story,"the WHOOur story begins 12 years ago, when my Dad was diagnosed with late stage cancer. When he broke the news to us, he said that no matter what happens to him, know that he led a blessed life. My Mom said, 'Michael, your 53, you're not gonna die.' He repeated it again. 'I just need you to know that no matter what happens to me, know that I've led a blessed life.' Four months later, we knew how much he meant it as we all gave him one last kiss goodbye. So my Mom (Susan), my Brother (Matt), and Myself (Jonathan) started on our journey to create the non-profit Conquer Cancer Coalition to help other families in the fight against cancer. We're proud to say we've raised and given away over $725,000, established the Massachusetts 'Conquer Cancer' license plate, and designed, built and maintain the 'Cancer Garden of Hope' on Boston City Hall Plaza. We've always worked great as a team, and through it all we have heard some of the most amazing stories, and met some of the most inspirational people. We started My-Storytellers because sometimes it only takes a few words to remind us of who and what is important in our life.the WHATAfter we got the 'Conquer Cancer' license plates on the road, My Mom and I were talking about how there is a story behind each plate, and how something as simple as a license plate can be a catalyst for something positive, whether it's thinking of someone we love, remembering a story, or raising money to help others. Sometimes the simplest things in life can be the most profound. What if there was something that we could keep with us to bookmark some of those moments and people in our lives. We have a meaningful license plate, we thought, why not take it a step further and create a meaningful keychain, and charms, so we can always be reminded of those stories. After all, my keychain was on a metal carabiner and my Mom's was on a series of nail breaking split rings. Neither really suited the purpose well, and they were void of meaning (and style). We could do better. After a year of research, development, testing, and relentless crafting, we are very proud of our result and excited to introduce our lineup of Keyloops and Keycharms to our friends, our family, and to you.What is a Keyloop, you ask? That is a great question! We use a combination of braided leather with a secure stainless steel clasp to blend form and function in a way that - let's just say a keychain never looked this good. We handcraft each Keyloop, and designed it to be the prefect place to collect and display your Keycharms.What is a Keycharm, you ask? Wow, it's like your reading my mind! We take pewter (lead free of course), and squeeze together some positive energy with meaningful sentiments and traditional techniques in a custom, state of the art studio. What results are small, handcrafted works of art that help bring out the Storyteller in all of us. Just like Our True Story of the Lucky Penny.the WHENOur Kickstarter Campaign is running now through Lucky Penny Day (May 23rd) which would also be my Dad's 66th Birthday. Your rewards will be delivered in early June, but your support will stick with us forever. Since we already make our product and it's easy for us to ship anywhere in the world, fulfillment on all orders are prompt. We are also planning our My-Storytellers kickoff party on Lucky Penny Day with food, music, and always lots of stories - at our new flagship location in downtown Rockport, Massachusetts. Whether you have supported us at shows, non-profit events, or just happen to be enjoying the beautiful day in Rockport, we would love to see you there on May 23rd, Lucky Penny Day!the WHEREThere are a select group of boutiques and retailers that currently carry our Keycharms and Book Sets in the New England area. And beginning on Lucky Penny Day 2016 (May 23rd), we will have our beautiful flagship retail location up and running on 6 Tuna Wharf, in the seaside artists community of Rockport, Massachusetts! There you can find our full catalogue of charms, a variety of limited edition colors and designs, and of course a place to sit down and share some stories. We'll also feature original artwork by Jonathan the Painter (that's me), and a lot of information about our non-profit Conquer Cancer Coalition. Most weekends I'll be there, painting at the easel, so come in and say 'Howdy!' You can also find us at the Natick Mall on Sundays in May, as we are featured in their Mall Street Market throughout the month. But no matter where we are, for us, the story is always personal.the WhyWe know how busy everything can get with life, and how overwhelming and consuming technology can be at times. One thing we learned along the cancer journey, thanks to my Dad, was to stop and enjoy some of the everyday moments that make life so special. Our Keycharms will never need batteries or a wifi connection or a micro SD card. Our Keyloops will never measure your heart rate, how many steps you take, or how much sleep you get. But they will make you feel good and make you think of someone, or something special. Plus, you can count on it to turn on, out of the box, every time. And since we are a family and company founded on helping the cancer community, with a twelve year track record, you can feel good knowing that our profits will continue to help make a difference for other families traveling the cancer journey. the HowMaking Keycharms and Keyloops is something we've become fluent in. Let's just say it's some combination of an art and a science and a family recipe. We've spent a while fine tuning our process, design, and production capabilities. And now we are turning to you! We need your help to grow to the next step. We are only asking for $1,000 because right now getting out to a wide and diverse audience to get feedback and exposure is really valuable to us. And Kickstarter is a wonderful (and free) way of accomplishing something more intimate than some traditional methods. Actually, that $1,000 will go a long way for us in putting the finishing touches on our Flagship My-Storytellers location, and also in enhancing our digital footprint. If we are able to raise more than that, we will invest in expanding our production capacity by scaling up the systems we have in place. We love our setup, it's based on tried and true methods, and it's easy to imagine it growing quickly with the right community support and funding.the ThanksFor taking the time to learn our story, for reading about my Dad and conquercancer.org, and for all the support from far and wide - We couldn't thank you enough. Your life is your story...Make it a good one!The Cover of each gift book is a reproduction of 'Safe Harbor,' originally painted for the Massachusetts General Hospital Cancer Center by Jonathan the Painter. The reproduction wraps around all three sides of the box and inside cover.","We have been producing our Keycharms and Keyloops for retail sales for several months now, and have fine tuned our process and techniques. While we handcraft the finished product, the materials come to us from a variety of sources and it can be hard to predict disruptions in the supply chain of other companies. What we have done is created a redundancy in our material vendors so that we can always have enough material for production, as well as back stock inventory to meet any surges in demand without interruption. We know there will be surprises and unforeseen circumstances. They're stepping stones or stumbling blocks, and it's all a matter of perspective. For the last twelve years we've been running the Conquer Cancer Coalition - And it has been one big challenge...but hearing the stories we've heard, the love we've had, and the survivors we've met...there is no challenge we won't overcome if we have our health."

It's a great problem to have!The commercial kitchen I've booked is already approved by the local Health Authority and is ready and waiting to see a little jamming action.I strive to use local produce, however weather can play a big part in prices year to year. So if Mother Nature throws us a curve ball and the prices jump too high, I would purchase produce at a lower rate for the interim.Accountants are awesome! They will make sure we stay on track and turn a profit while keeping up on all that fun paperwork."
https://www.kickstarter.com/projects/11971605/disaster-area?ref=discovery_category_newest,11971605/disaster-area,"""Disaster Area"" is a podcast about disasters throughout history: the causes, the events, the people affected, and the legacy of the tragedy. Each episode will look at one disaster in-depth. Every fifth episode will be a ""Movie Break,"" a lighter look at some aspect of the disaster movie genre, whether it be a specific movie, a series, an actor or actress, or a specific trope.What I hope to do with this Kickstarter is be able to put out more episodes a month. I'm hoping to ask for shorter hours at my day job so I can focus on my creative work, including this podcast. It takes me about two weeks at this point to do the research and put out a new episode simply because of my work hours getting in my way.","The risks come mostly in having the motivation to complete more episodes when given more time to do so. I have depression and anxiety, so I always have to fight against my mental health disorders to get things done. However, it would help to have more people to answer to in terms of getting things done. If I know people are expecting more output from me, it encourages me a lot.I am also a writer who is trying to finish a couple of manuscripts and working on outlining several others, so I sometimes find my muse waving at something else on my to-do list and urging me to work on that instead. I find I can keep myself focused on other things if I can consider them a paying job, and turning the podcast into that would mean being mentally prepared to work harder on it.",https://www.kickstarter.com/projects/11971605/disaster-area-a-podcast?ref=discovery_category_newest,11971605/disaster-area-a-podcast,"Hello, listeners! I'm setting up this Kickstarter with the intention of improving the podcast and trying to make it easier to get out episodes of the podcast a bit quicker. The purpose of this Kickstarter is to replace my current laptop (specifically with a Lenovo Yoga Book, which has a stylus feature which will allow me to save written notes to it and therefore make it easier to organize and outline episodes) and get a better recording set-up to clean up the sound on the episodes. I'm currently using a five-dollar clip-on microphone and my iPhone to record episodes, and while it's working out I'd love to improve everything to sound more professional.I'd also like to put any remaining money towards things such as the Soundcloud subscription for the podcast, finally setting up a website for the podcast, and buying resources such as books I need for future episodes. I'd really like to make this podcast the best it possibly can be.","The biggest challenge I have with making the podcast is a combination of money and time. I work a full-time day job and also write with the intent of hopefully being traditionally published (right now, I'm self-publishing), and money is always tight. Due to an issue with my previous employer, I needed to quit my job at the beginning of October and only got a new job a few weeks ago. Therefore, money has been tighter than usual. I've been intending to replace my laptop to something lighter and more portable to make it easier for me to take notes for the podcast on the go. My current laptop is a cheap bulky replacement I picked up on the fly and it's not realistic for me to bring it with me every night to my factory job. This presents a challenge in that I end up handwriting notes, which I then have to transfer to my computer, all of which adds more time to the research and preparation process. I also would prefer to record under better conditions. As of right now, I do so in my living room with a cheap microphone using an app on my iPhone. The challenge here is that I live on a main street, and there's plenty of street noise to try and work around. As it is, I try to record in the middle of the night on my days off to try to cut down on the noise. Your donation will go directly into improving the podcast. Since it's just me doing all the work, I'll be able to immediately put the money toward putting out a better production."

https://www.kickstarter.com/projects/curran/vizhub-20-a-data-visualization-platform?ref=discovery_category_newest,curran/vizhub-20-a-data-visualization-platform,"Everyone with an Internet connection should be able to lean how to code. For free.Data visualization is one of humanity's most powerful tools for making sense of data, and therefore making sense of the world. That makes data visualization one of the most impactful kinds of coding one could do. For this reason, everyone with an Internet connection should be able to lean how to analyze, design, and code data visualizations. For free. At least, that's what I believe, and that's why I'm working on VizHub. VizHub provides the missing platform to achieve these goals.I'm building the next generation of VizHub - ""VizHub 2.0"". This video gives a sense of what VizHub 1.0 (the currently deployed version) is capable of. VizHub 2.0 will build on that.VizHub is a Web-based application for data visualization and creative coding that can be used by students, teachers, and professionals. I've already developed ""Version 1.0"" (Minimum Viable Product) and used it to teach my 2018 online Data Visualization graduate course offered through Worcester Polytechnic Institute (which FreeCodeCamp just released as a 13-hour video). I've also used VizHub during data visualization workshops I've delivered in-person for both corporate training events and events open to the public such as Data Visualization Foundations at Stamen Design. Regardless of the merits of VizHub 2.0 itself, if you have benefitted from my work and the free online educational content I've created, please consider backing this Kickstarter as a way to say ""thank you"". Thank you!So, what are the merits of VizHub 2.0? What makes it better than other things out there? Well, let's start with the question ""Who would use VizHub?"".The vision is that VizHub can be a tool that people at all levels of their programming and data visualization journey can use. From novice students just learning to code, to college students learning new frameworks and libraries, to teachers and delivering live-coding tutorials, to professors visualizing their research data, to freelancers working with clients to evolve visualization works, to small teams developing data visualizations (comprised of managers, admins, designers, engineers, and clients), to enterprises who need a unified platform for executing large scale data visualization initiatives.Existing software that has made huge strides in the space of online code editing includes: Observable, Bl.ocks.org, Blockbuilder, CodeSandbox, Glitch, CodePen, JSBin, Plunker, JSFiddle, and to some extent GitHub. While many of these overlap with VizHub in the feature set provided, none of them provide the ""perfect blend"" I'd like to have for data visualization education and practice. I have actually used used Blockbuilder (at WPI in 2017) and JSBin (at MIT in 2012) as the platform for courses I've taught in the past, and they left much to be desired. Let's examine exactly what was left to be desired, by looking at what our various personas would do with VizHub.In an education context (e.g. university course, workshop, or one-on-one mentorship):Within teams (or if you're a freelancer, you'd need to wear all of these hats):For a tool to be useful for all these personas, it must have all features listed. If it doesn't have each and every one of these features, then it excludes one or more personas. This is why it's important to develop VizHub. On the surface, VizHub is ""yet another Web-based IDE"", but the deeper motivation behind it is to support this specific set of personas, and target the field of data visualization in particular.Let's talk about the features VizHub 2.0 will have, and why each is important.The Code Editor feature is required for Students, Teachers, and Engineers. The code editor must be able to give instant feedback when changes are made (unlike GitHub's Pull Request and GitHub Pages redeploy workflow). In order to be compatible with existing real-world projects and be exportable to downstream workflows, ES6 modules should be supported.VizHub will have a unique ""Visual Editor"" that lets users make changes without writing any code. For example colors (using a perceptual color picker), numbers, booleans and strings can be made editable. This feature will be useful for exposing ""tweakable"" things. This feature will allow personas who do not have coding skills, but have an interest in making minor changes, to help evolve works. For example, this would be particularly useful for The Designer, The Manager, and The Client.The features Presentation, Forking, Discussions, and Real-time Collaboration sort of ""hang together"", and are particularly useful for education contexts.Export refers to the ability to download a file (usually a .zip file) that contains the source files behind the visualization. The exported file should be runnable externally in a local development, without any dependency on the platform.Embed refers to the ability to include the visualization as an embedded object within any existing Web page. For example, placing a visualization inside a blog post or news article. A distinction can be made between Embedding with Linkback, where the embedded frame includes (is ""polluted"" with) a link back to the original VizHub page, and White-label Embedding, where the embedded frame contains purely the visualization itself, without any additional link back to VizHub.Metric of Popularity means some way to tell how popular a given work has been. For example, this could be view count, number of ""hearts"" or ""stars"", or number of forks. In VizHub, this will take the form of ""upvotes"", which will also have their negative counterpart ""downvotes"", which will be paired with some UX flow to encourage constructive criticism.Collections refers to the ability to assemble linearly ordered sets of works. For example, one lecture of a course showing the evolution of a visualization could be one collection. A collection could groupd works according to themes. In principle, a single visualization could belong to multiple collections. In a sense they are similar to YouTube playlists.Private Works refers to the ability to make it so only permitted collaborators can view a given visualization. This is distinct from ""unlisted"", in which anyone with the link can access.Manage Teams refers to the ability to create and delete teams, add users to teams, remove users from teams, and edit permissions of team members.So, that's an overview of the features that VizHub 2.0 is slated to have, and why.The VizHub home page lists new visualizations created by users. I've noticed a steady stream of about 10 or so new visualizations being created in the platform every day. These are mostly forks of my work with minimal or no changes, but some are completely original content. As it stands, VizHub has the bare minimum feature set to make it useful for students and teachers. Most of the users appear to be newcomers to coding who are using the platform to learn the basics and experiment.The count of unique users has been continually increasing since VizHub was launched in August 2018. This is reassuring, as it validates that there is a place in the world for a tool like VizHub, and there are people who would use it.In VizHub, visualizations can only be created by forking existing visualizations. This leads to a tree of content that can serve as a map of the content space. This foundation also seeks to leverage the ""Fork & Modify"" style of collaborative development that has made Open Source such a success. In fact, all public content in VizHub is MIT Licensed, making the platform friendly to those looking to export works out of the platform for downstream workflows and integration into commercial products.Additionally, VizHub supports industry-standard development practices such as ES6 modules, and does not introduce any VizHub-specific language or primitives. This makes VizHub content easily exportable and directly interoperable with existing codebases. Also, VizHub currently supports React with JSX. I hope to make Svelte 3 work inside VizHub as well, as its reactive programming model is quite compelling.Observable is probably the closest thing to VizHub on the market today. I have huge respect for the amazing work that’s gone into it, and the community that has sprung up around it. There are however a few “show stopper” issues that turn me off from using it, particularly in an education context.The primary issue for me in a teaching context is that Observable is not JavaScript. Students IMO have enough to learn already when exposed to JavaScript, CSS and HTML for the first time, and I’d rather not add another layer of techniques and syntax to learn (even though they are all ingenious productivity-enhancing things). When it comes to exporting code and integrating work from Observable into existing codebases, there is significant added complexity. It’s probably as simple as it can be, given the contstraints at hand, but I’d prefer to leave students with something “vanilla” that they can easily use outside the platform.The secondary issue for me in a teaching context is that the license on public work found in Observable is not a permissive Open Source license. This means that exporting or copy-pasting code out of Observable is essentially using unlicensed code, unless the author explicitly declares an Open Source license in the notebook, which I haven’t seen done very often. Forking & modifying unlicensed code is something I’d like to steer clear of recommending to students. For class projects it may be just fine, but in a professional setting it can be problematic. This is why VizHub will take the same approach as CodePen: all public content is MIT Licensed.That said, I really mean no disrespect for Observable. It’s an amazing platform that has some very futuristic features, especially the reactive runtime and interactive notebook model. The Suggestions feature is great for asynchronous collaboration. For more on what makes Observable great, check out this post Why Observable?.I started a re-design and re-write of VizHub with an eye towards adding collaboration, social, and IDE-like features. If one is expected to spend hours of time in VizHub's development environment staring at code, it should be customizable to a certain extent, as this is what developers have come to expect. I prototyped what it might look like to be able to customize the color theme and coding font used (drawing from the most popular). I'm also a huge fan of ligatures such as the fat arrow glyph, which would add another level of readability and elegance to ES6 development.Real-time collaboration is another core feature that VizHub 2.0 will have. Think Google Docs for code. I can't count how many times I've been remotely mentoring someone, teaching a live event, or working with clients where the delay introduced by having to make a new Git commit and re-deploy stood in the way of doing things. For example, when I'm mentoring someone and live-coding in their project, I want to hand over control to them when they have an idea or know how to move forward. As another example, when client asks something like ""Can you make that blue slightly brighter?"", I want to be able to make the change and have them see it instantly, rather than saying something like ""Sure, I can do that after the call and let you know when the change is deployed"". I've built out already a rough implementation of real-time collaboration for VizHub 2.0, and feel the path forward for developing this feature fully VizHub is clear.With real-time collaboration comes the opportunity for ""presence"" features. For example, showing where the cursors for the other users are, and showing what text they have selected. In collaboration with the ShareDB Open Source community, I've helped put together this prototype of real-time collaboration with presence cursors and selections. This brings presence features one step closer to implementation within VizHub. Other presence features slated for development are listing which collaborators currently have the visualization open, and showing what file they are looking at.The ability to edit code on smartphones can open up the possibility of programming to a vast population of people, particularly in India where mobile computing dominates. This is something I'd like to make possible with VizHub. For example, I'd like to be able to run a visualization workshop in which the audience brings their smartphones, not their laptops. I want to be able to have participants fork & modify a visualization live, then share their work with the group on Slack or Twitter, using only their smartphones. This capability would open up the door to teach coding skills to those who would otherwise never be able to write a line of code in their lives (for example, in remote villages in India where no one has a single laptop or desktop computer, but everyone has Internet-connected smartphones).Imagine then that a student shares their work in progress and I open it on the projector for everyone in the workshop to see. I could then point out a minor improvement to be made, and the student could make the change instantly on their smartphone, and as they type, the changes would be broadcast to my computer in real time, and be shown on the projector to everyone in the room. This is the sort of thing I want to make possible.User interface design has always been something I've struggled with. In recent years I've come to realize that I'm more of an engineer, a software craftsman if you will. I'm just not that good at user interface design. I found that I much prefer working on a team, where there is a dedicated designer to generate pixel-perfect visual designs that I can then go and implement. Having had great experiences working with Stamen Design on many projects over the past two years (in particular their amazing designer and project director), I hired Stamen Design to work on UI and product design for VizHub 2.0.The work was highly collaborative (lots of whiteboarding and talking through flows), and was done when we were all physically present at the Stamen office in San Francisco during a single week. I'm personally totally thrilled with the resulting designs. This gives me a huge amount of ""ammunition"" to draw from while doing the engineering work. Even though not all features have been fully designed, these designs are definitely enough to build out the core of a fresh new implementation, and the visual design language here can be extrapolated to more features in the future.Unlike the VizHub 1.0 codebase, the VizHub 2.0 codebase will not be Open Source. In making the original codebase Open Source, the hope was that users would actively participate in development of the platform by doing things like opening new issues, commenting on existing issues, and even opening Pull Requests to make improvements. None of that happened. Garnering only 32 stars to date, VizHub as an Open Source project has been a complete flop. Having the codebase Open Source introduces many problems with developing it into a commercial product as well, which is the next phase for VizHub.Although the VizHub codebase itself will not be Open Source, the public content of VizHub will be (clearly marked as MIT Licensed). In this way, similarly to GitHub, VizHub will foster the growth and flourising of Open Source content, for data visualization, creative coding, and whatever other areas of development VizHub users pursue. The roadmap for development is to implement the new designs from Stamen during July and August 2019. Beta testing will begin in July. I will use VizHub 2.0 Beta to teach the online graduate course, and the students will essentially be beta testers. The hope is to launch VizHub 2.0 publicly, with Pro features working, in Q1 2020. Beyond that the Teams and Enterprise features will be developed.I've become a huge fan of Scrum, a framework for ""Doing twice the work in half the time"". A huge part of Scrum is getting feedback from actual users as the software is being developed, and delivering incremental improvements at consistent intervals (largely based on that feedback). VizHub Beta testers will be given access to the new re-designed VizHub as it's being implemented, and will also receive a newsletter each sprint detailing fresh incremental improvements. The forum will serve as a place where beta testers can provide feedback (especially pain points), to inform what should be worked on next and to bring up usability wrinkles that need to ironed out.My time tracking software tells me I've already invested over 500 hours into developing VizHub. I feel like it will take about another 500 hours to develop it into the complete vision I have for it. This is why I'm turning to Kickstarter - to raise funds so that I can focus full-time on VizHub, and not have to dilute my time over the next year or so with paid projects and put VizHub on the back burner yet again (as I've had to do many times to stay afloat).Ideally I could raise enough funds to hire additional people to work with me on developing VizHub. If I did have cash to burn on VizHub, the first thing I'd do is hire Stamen Design again to help build out visual designs for more advanced features. I'd also hire additional developers to help with the engineering work, which I'm currently doing all alone. I'd hire a marketing specialist to help grow the user base of VizHub. Eventually I'd hire a product manager as well, to take my place as the one driving and prioritizing the set of features to be developed. At that point I could step back from VizHub development, and just use it for what I love to do, namly data visualization projects and teaching.","The biggest threat to the success of this project is running out of money and having to turn to paid work to pay my bills, putting VizHub yet again on the back burner.",https://www.kickstarter.com/projects/curran/vizhub-launch?ref=discovery_category_newest,curran/vizhub-launch,"My name is Curran Kelleher. I’ve been in the field of data visualization for over 14 years. After graduating from University of Massachusetts Lowell in 2014 with my Ph. D. in Computer Science, I spent one year at Alpine Data Labs, a Big Data Analytics startup in San Francisco (since acquired by Tibco). In 2016 I founded my own consulting company Datavis Tech INC and have been doing remote data visualization and software engineering work since then. I have also been teaching Worcester Polytechnic Institute’s annual online graduate course in data visualization for the past three years. I currently live in India with my wife and daughter.Everyone with an Internet connection should be able to learn how to write code and visualize data. I am building a platform called VizHub to make this a reality. Using VizHub, people can study data visualizations, read the code that creates them, and edit the code to create their own novel works. I’ve been working on VizHub since June 2018. I have used VizHub in my WPI online data visualization course for the past two years. It’s the platform I use to produce lecture videos, and also the platform that students use to do their assignments and projects.The current state of VizHub works well enough to use in the classroom, but not quite well enough to support the large scale education and data visualization production initiatives I envision. VizHub needs to be developed further to make it compelling and useful to professionals already in the field of data visualization. It also needs to be made accessible to those around the world with limited resources in developing countries, such as mobile-only Internet access and limited English language skills.Professionals in the field need more than a Web-based code editor. They need something that takes full advantage of the Web as a platform for both publishing and collaboration. It should be trivial to embed visualizations from VizHub into any news article or blog post, or to share them on social media. People should be able to collaborate in real-time on private or team-level projects. Deployment to clients and getting feedback should be trivial. These are pain points of currently available tools on the market, widely used by visualization practitioners, that will be addressed by VizHub. These features must be developed to make VizHub a commercial success.Those around the world with limited resources should also be able to make use of VizHub. The primary use of the platform for these audiences is education. VizHub can be a gateway for people underdeveloped regions to educate themselves about software development and data visualization. Anyone with an Internet connection, a smartphone, and free time can use VizHub to study coding practices, navigate educational video content, and even develop code and visualizations themselves.Optimizing VizHub for use on mobile devices will make it one of very few tools that actually enables people to develop software on (not for) mobile devices. A visual editor, which will allow users to make edits of numbers and colors by simply dragging their finger across the screen, will make the platform even more accessible. These features of VizHub need to be developed in order for it to make a large impact on educating and uplifting those with limited resources worldwide.The main purpose of VizHub is to enable large scale education and data visualization production initiatives. Use of the platform in teaching WPI’s online data visualization course has shown promising results that such initiatives are feasible. For example, many of my assignments are of the “Fork & Modify” variety. This means the assignment is to make a copy of a chart or map I’ve created in the lecture videos, and modify it to show different data. The overall effect is an astounding explosion of data visualizations. From one seed, many trees grow. And this is with only 24 students. This is just the tip of the iceberg.I will execute a large scale education initiative starting in January 2020. This initiative will consist of a series of video lectures and assignments freely available to all, released on YouTube and VizHub. This series of videos will provide high quality educational content covering basics of computer programming to advanced interactive data visualization design and engineering. This will benefit society by enabling a vast public to educate themselves and learn marketable new skills. This initiative will also bring potential customers into contact with the VizHub platform.Educating people is the first step towards encouraging them to produce new data visualizations. Part of the large scale education initiative will involve assignments. Students will be asked to “fork & modify” visualizations to work with new and different datasets pertaining to a variety of topics. Topic areas of interest include climate change, space exploration, human suffering, demographics, ancient history, computer science, news and current affairs. By providing direction and data for students in the form of “assignments”, a vast number of data visualizations will be produced in an extremely short period of time. These visualizations will have the potential to reveal things about our world we did not know, and help solve the largest challenges facing humankind today.The main goal of this Kickstarter is to make VizHub self sustaining. Currently, most of the income for my business comes from sporadic consulting, training, and engineering work. I would like to see VizHub customer subscriptions generating 90% of that revenue in the distant future. In quantifiable and realistic terms, I’d like to grow the revenue of VizHub customer subscriptions to $2,000 per month by November 2020. This would make the VizHub platform self sustaining and ultimately enable its long term growth and expansion.Since the first version of VizHub was launched in August 2018, the platform has seen over 1,400 unique user logins. In September 2019 there were approximately 2,300 active users on the site (both logged in and not logged in, excluding the 2.0 beta site). Over 7,000 visualizations have been created in the platform so far. Assuming continued growth at the current rate, there should be approximately 5,000 unique user logins by November 2020.To grow revenue of VizHub customer subscriptions to $2,000 per month, we need to convert roughly 6% of the 5,000 unique user logins to paying customers at monthly subscription cost of $7/mo for the lowest tier plan (5000 * 0.06 * 7 = $2,100). These estimates do not even consider the higher growth rate that would likely be induced by the education campaign. Although this is a simplistic revenue model with very rough estimations, I argue that these goals are realistic and achievable.In order to achieve my goals in further development and commercialization of VizHub, I need to find a way to be able to invest more of my own time into it, and ultimately hire additional talent to work with me to move the project forward. Even after managing to invest over 700 hours into developing VizHub, there are so many more things to be done. I’m beginning to feel that I cannot do it alone.As an example of how I would manage resources, consider how I hired Stamen Design to develop user interface designs for VizHub 2.0. In Spring of 2019, we reached a barter deal in which I exchanged 20 of my working hours for 20 working hours of the Stamen team, including their top-notch user interface designer. I went to San Francisco and worked with the Stamen team for one week on this. The resulting designs were astounding. With these new designs in hand, I implemented them faithfully when developing “VizHub 2.0 Beta”, which was used in this year’s WPI course and will be developed further into the commercialized VizHub product.Currently, I feel frustrated that I need to work on other things, such as proprietary client projects, to pay the bills. I want to make VizHub and related developments my top priority activity. Funding would enable that to happen. Thus far I’ve been reluctant to take on venture capital, as this initiative is not something I want to “dilute” or eventually “exit”. This is something I want to develop and work on for the rest of my life.What follows are screenshots of what's working so far in VizHub 2.0 Beta.What follows are images of not-yet-implemented designs created by Stamen Design.These can be implemented soon if this Kickstarter is funded.What follows are images of various software used to support the VizHub project.What follows are images of miscellaneous research and future directions.","If the project is not funded, it will need to go on the ""back burner"", and the vision for VizHub's commercial launch as well as the development of the ""Datavis 2020"" free online course will be in limbo for an indeterminate amount of time.Some of the features planned for development may turn out to be more challenging than expected and may not be achievable. Regardless, if the project is funded it will provide a huge boost."

https://www.kickstarter.com/projects/maykaidee/may-kaidees-thai-vegan-cooking-tour?ref=discovery_category_newest,maykaidee/may-kaidees-thai-vegan-cooking-tour,"Hi there!I'm very excited to let everyone know that I'm planning a huge cooking tour starting in the USA.Over the past 20 years, tens of thousands of travelers to Thailand have enjoyed my unique vegetarian and vegan cuisine, and also the culturally inspired, high-spirited cooking classes that have become synonymous with May Kaidee (my stage name). But of course, not everyone can travel to Thailand for this experience, so I've developed a plan to bring it to as many as possible who might enjoy eating healthy Thai food and learning how to prepare it themselves.I also want to reconnect with my past students and customers, so during my tour I’ll definitely visit as many of you as I can.My plan involves buying a small food truck (a customized VW Bus), and traveling around the USA for 6 months offering vegan meals to individuals, groups, and organizations. Along the way I'll visit food and music festivals as well, which offers a great opportunity to cook for many people in a single location. While on tour, I'll teach cooking classes to all those interested, hoping to educate people on the health benefits of the Thai ingredients used in my recipes, as well as benefits of eating plant-based food in general, not just for our body but also for the environment. Additionally, I want to stop at community centers and shelters along the way to donate both meals and cooking instruction, because I believe that everyone deserves the opportunity to experience healthy food that tastes great.After the USA tour, my stretch goals are to continue in Canada, Central and South America, Europe, Asia and Australia.Eight years ago, when I first visited the USA, I noticed immediately how popular fast food was. Everywhere I went, I saw many people eating unhealthy food. Even though I’ve returned several times since then and I still see the same thing, I know from experience that many people with poor eating habits actually do want to make changes in their diet but just don’t know how or where to start. I feel I can help such people by introducing them to a delicious, healthy alternative in Thai vegan food.Even if you already eat vegan food, my signature Thai recipes are sure to give you a special culinary experience.Let’s arrange for me to visit you on my tour, so that you can enjoy the same cuisine thousands of others have enjoyed at my restaurants in Thailand — whether I cook it for you myself or we do it together in a class.I'm offering attractive reward options, including downloadable recipes from my cookbook, a printed version of my cookbook, my special blend of chili paste, hot sauce, and dipping sauce, as well as cooking classes.Note: For the rewards that include my visiting your home or organization, I just ask that you be flexible in terms of the exact date we agree on for me to visit. It's possible that I'll need to stay in certain areas longer than planned if I have many rewards to fulfill in such areas. The interactive map shows the tour dates as I have planned them (click the icons), but it's possible the schedule will need to be adjusted slightly. Also, if you would like me to visit for a dinner or cooking class on a date not marked on the map, please don’t hesitate to contact me, because it's possible I'll be able to visit you on your preferred date. I will certainly work with everyone to make sure we have great cooking experiences together.I've already found a VW Bus in great condition for sale within my budget. It had a new engine installed only two years ago and had a number of other aging parts replaced.I've found a fantastic restoration company that specializes in VW Buses and received a reasonable price quote for giving it a custom paint job and equipping the interior for my needs.Since 2003, I’ve conducted brief cooking tours in the USA, Great Britain, Japan, Russia, and the Dominican Republic. I often receive invitations to lecture at retreats, health seminars, and food events worldwide, and I’ve appeared on television in Thailand, Germany, France, and China.Most of the funds will be used to complete the custom food truck and cover the costs of traveling on tour. The following is a detailed breakdown of all expected costs and expenses.A few mentions about May Kaidee...The New York Times,CNN, Toronto Star, Swell Magazine, VegNews, Lonely Planet, National Geographic TravelerSee the latest updates on Facebook, Twitter, and Instagram.Despite being relatively successful, and also happy, things were not always so good for me. When I was a young girl, poverty in my village in northeastern Thailand often meant eating whatever ""meat"" was available — from snakes and scorpions to rats and dogs. So I was sick a lot of the time, but thankfully, life got better as I learned to grow vegetables (and I was even able to sell some).Then something really great happened: my aunt called from the capital, Bangkok, and asked my parents if I could come work in her vegetarian restaurant. I couldn’t speak any English then and was afraid of foreigners, so for the first year there I mainly stayed in the kitchen, washing dishes. But after a while, once my aunt turned me into a server, I developed the confidence to learn basic English and also to cook her recipes.A few years later, when I was twenty, I started May Kaidee’s Thai Vegetarian and Vegan Restaurant from my process of experimenting with my aunt’s menu and also eliminating the animal ingredients from certain famous Thai non-vegetarian recipes, creating my own flavors, sauces, and pastes in their place.Several of those early creations have remained on the May Kaidee menu up to today. Mine is a small but successful business (by Thailand’s standards), with locations in Bangkok and Chiang Mai, that employs many people who I called in from my village the same way my aunt called me in all those years ago. Now I turn my heart and mind to what I can offer elsewhere, not just in the context of providing enjoyable Thai vegetarian/vegan dishes and cooking classes, but also in terms of actively promoting plant-based food for a healthier body and environment. If I’m given the opportunity to do that, I’ll certainly make the most of it.","Since I've already led cooking tours in various countries, I'm confident that my team and I will be able to handle any challenges that might occur along the way. Fortunately, I have a great support network in the USA, so I'll never be far from help, if needed. Also, I've chosen a VW Bus for the specific reason that it is an easy vehicle to maintain compared with other types of vans/trucks. The VW Bus is very reliable.If my truck happens to get damaged at any point, I will have insurance to guarantee that I can get back on the road in a reasonable amount of time. At worst, some of the dates would have to be pushed forward, but I would still be able to complete the tour.",https://www.kickstarter.com/projects/maykaidee/may-kaidees-nyc-summer-of-thai-cooking?ref=discovery_category_newest,maykaidee/may-kaidees-nyc-summer-of-thai-cooking,"Inspired by the passionate interest of New Yorkers in my first cooking-tour campaign, I've launched a new campaign aimed at bringing my signature recipes to larger numbers of people here in New York City, with a focus on promoting the health benefits of Thai vegan cooking.I will spend all of August visiting events, giving cooking demonstrations and volunteering, in addition to fulfilling rewards for backers of the campaign.My plan consists of three main goals for August. First, I'm going to support local gardening. For the past year, I've been visiting a particular West Village garden which I’ve grown to love. I will begin volunteering at the garden next month, returning to my roots of growing food organically and locally.My second goal is that I will come to your home or office to give cooking classes.

Some may call it the future liquid because of it's amazing properties. It was invented in 1963 by NASA's very own Steve Papell as a liquid rocket fuel that could be drawn toward a pump inlet in a weightless environment by applying a magnetic field.   Ferrofluids are extraordinary and beneficial because of their small magnetic nanoparticles. Nano has been around since the early Romans. They used gold and silver nanoparticles in stained glass to make really interesting color combinations. In this day in age nanotech will enable us to reshape the physical matter in the world with almost the same ease as virtual reality. Because of nanotechnology matter is becoming a virtual medium, just like in a virtual world.   With properties never before envisioned, engineers and scientists are exploring exciting new discoveries on the nanoscale every day. Nanotechnology is likely to have a significant impact on society, because nanoparticles provide the foundation for advancing nanotechnologies in a vast way. Researchers are working on nanomedicines that can be controlled with a magnetic field to target and treat specific locations in the body.   Nanotechnology is applied today in the fields of energy, medicine, electronics, telecommunications, transportation, consumer products, energy, and space exploration, along with human enhancements and much more. The nano possibilities are endless. The future is nano! Welcome to the future of jewelry!","A lot of time and effort goes into each individual handmade piece.  Working with ferrofluid can be very difficult because it likes to stain almost anything it comes in contact with.  Thanks to the geniuses at CZFerro.com we were able to eliminate that problem.  So there are not very many risks and challenges in completing this unique project, but hard work dedication and passion!"

QUICKLY TELL ME WHAT THIS PROJECT IS. TL;DR ME!I'm making a 12-minute animated comedy called Convenience Store Diet, a comedic look at life in your 20's filled with the satirical, twisted, adult humor you'd expect from a dude who worked on over 100 episodes of Robot Chicken. So if you like laughing, cartoons, and crazy humor, then this is for you.AWESOME! WAIT, WHO ARE YOU?I’m Andrew Racho. How are you? Would you like a blueberry scone? I just baked them!Over the past decade I’ve worked as a writer, actor, director, and artist in animation on some of your favorite shows. You’ve probably seen something I’ve done on Robot Chicken, TripTank, Moral Orel, Outlands, Your Dungeon My Dragon, An Okay Place to Eat, A Brain Divided, Frankenhole, Titan Maximum, Like Share Die, Animals... the list goes on.I also regularly make independent animations, and today I'm bringing you a new animated show called Convenience Store Diet!WHAT IS THIS CONVENIENCE STORE DIET THING?It was a comic. Now it's a comic AND an animated show!Convenience Store Diet is my weekly comic. It’s a mix of pop culture jokes, relationship humor, and musings on life in your late 20’s.This should give you a sense of my humor.Over the years I developed a cool way to bring the humor of Convenience Store Diet to life with animation. As time went on, I wanted to dig deeper with the characters and stories. I want to explore that time in your life when you’re still growing up even though you’re growing old. That time in life when you feel like everything is supposed to be in place, but isn't.So, I decided to turn my weekly outlet for poop jokes into an animated show!COOL! WHAT IS THIS ANIMATED EPISODE ABOUT?Three friends in their late 20’s come to discover they’ve yet to get with the times and buy smartphones. One by one they rapidly assimilate into the smartphone culture and world of technological douchebaggery, brah! So are they avoiding a plague of lunacy, or are they too out of touch and afraid to grow up?While the show is an exploration of feelings about that time in my life, it’s not all that serious. At one point guy selfies his own car crash then vomits his intestines out. Animation!WHAT'S IT GOING TO LOOK LIKE?It's going to look like the comic and the shorts, only better! So far I have most of the characters built and rigged for animation. And, the extraordinarily talented Sarah Hampton made these awesome backgrounds!* 04/02/15 And here's a still from the animation, which I recently started on for one scene:And yes, that is a selfie stick in his eye.DUDE, WHY NOT JUST MAKE THIS FOR TV?I have great friends over at the networks and highly respect what they do. But rather than make a program tailored to fit their network needs, I'd rather make a program telling the stories I want to tell directly for you, the fans and supporters who have enjoyed my work over the years. This show’s for you! And Gary, even though Gary ate my box of Triscuts 15 years ago.WHERE CAN WE WATCH IT?Once it's made, you can watch it online via a private link.WHY SHOULD I BACK THIS PROJECT?Because you're awesome, obviously!If you like what I do, or you want to support independent animation and comics, back the project. Kickstarter is a cool way to bring a community of artists and fans together You're getting a funny show, some cool rewards, and getting to be a part of a process that opens the animation community to you!I'M IN! WHAT DO I GET FOR BACKING THE SHOW?WHAT HAPPENS IF WE GIVE YOU A BILLION DOLLARS?Well, I'm sure Dr. Evil will try and take it from me. So if I get a billion dollars, I'll need my own sharks with frickin' laser beams.If you guys love the project and are generous enough to donate more than the goal, I'd love to use the additional funding to make this show better and bring you more content and animated shorts!WHAT IF YOU MEET YOUR GOAL? IS MY MONEY GOING TOWARD PENGUIN HATS?I love penguin hats! But alas, the responsible human in me is more compelled to finish this project than swim in a sea of tiny fedoras.But here's the estimated breakdown:10% Kickstarter Fees10% Kickstarter Rewards10% Sound Mixing20% Music40% Animation and Compositing10% Additional Art$15k isn't much and this whole endeavor will still cost me a bit out of my own pocket. But if we go over, I'd like to put that extra money into making the project better. Or, toward the stretch goals!STRETCH GOALS?Say everyone loves this project and donates Yachts full of gold doubloons and diamond necklaces and I go past my initial funding goal. Rather take extra the money and bury it on the moon, I'd rather use it to give you more!Thus: stretch goals!$15k - Initial goal complete: Episode Done!!$20k - A better show, plus upgraded prints for the receivers of print comics!$25k - A better show, plus a new animated short! Dance Class Etiquette$35k - A new animated short! Bears Are Assholes$50k - A new animated short! The Wine and Cheese Party$60k - A new animated short! The Doctor's Visit$70k - A new animated short! My Roommate Is A Cat$85k - A new animated short! Floating Into Space$100k - A new animated short! TBA if we make it here. Or, we can scratch the previous shorts and instead do another episode.","I've been making my own independent animations for years, as well as leading teams on large animated shows. Given my experience, I am extremely confident in my ability to complete the project and have the network of capable colleagues who can help me see this through. Also, because animating my own characters over the years allowed me to develop the animation process, technical R&D is not a hurdle. This show is ready to go into production.Animation is a slow process. Thankfully I’ve done a lot of the pre-production work early and this should be a simple and straightforward production. It probably will be done in a few months. If I raise enough money, I can afford to bring more people on and speed up the process.The goal is to get this made for you by the end of the year and production will start as soon as the funds become available.",https://www.kickstarter.com/projects/1648801663/i-think-my-healthcare-might-suck-cartoon-screening?ref=discovery_category_newest,1648801663/i-think-my-healthcare-might-suck-cartoon-screening,"TL;DR: Fund a funny cartoon and come to the screening party! All-in-1 week, so only one week to support!You ever find your healthcare provider to be a pain in the dingle? You ever wonder if you picked the right doctor when his office clearly has blood stains on the walls? Yes? Well then, non-robot, have I got the cartoon for you!Hey everybody! I'm Andrew Racho! I've worked on a lot of cartoons: TripTank, Robot Chicken, Moral Orel, BoJack Horseman, Animals, Greatest Party Story Ever, blah blah blah.Currently I have series of comics and cartoons called ""Convenience Store Diet."" If you haven't seen any of my previous work, check out my last short!I'm doing a 1-week Kickstarter to fund an animated short and also a kickass screening party! A Screening Party Sounds Cool! What's The Short About?My new Convenience Store Diet animated short follows my character, Andrew, on his  adventures as he chooses the best surgeon for his hernia operation. Things go awry when he realizes that his top choice is not in his coverage group and he's stuck with option B.Can't Wait To See It! What Makes This Party So Cool?It's a low-key chance to hang out and watch cartoons with people who are into the same stuff as you. We'll screen the short and a few other surprise animated projects. And there maaaaay be a bouncy castle.When's The Party?Once the Kickstarter is funded, I can properly fund and organize the event. I'm aiming for a late April or early May screening. June at the latest.Where Does My Money Go?Costs will go into paying for the production as well as the event costs of a film screening. And also, the rewards, kickstarter's cut, and taxes.When Should I Back The Project?As part of Kickstarter's All-in-1 Week, the campaign will only be for 1 week. So back now and come join the party!I Can't Make It To LA, But I Still Want To See The Cartoon!Back the short anyway and stay tuned for the digital release. Also, one of the rewards offers you your own remote screening party! STRETCH GOALS:$4000 - Additional short to be made for the party!MORE MONEY - How much is the bouncy castle rental?","Animation takes a while to produce, but I'm very close to finishing the short. I'm hoping to get everything done before the deadline so that we can have a party before June. Late April will be the most ideal.Also, if you miss the party, I'll be able to send you the short and can mail most of the tangible rewards. But you'll miss out on the festivities that can only be experienced in person.DISCLAIMER:- Party will take place in Los Angeles, CA on a TBD date sometime between April and June. I'll send out the invites several weeks in advance.- I can't guarantee/offer accommodations, parking, etc. Lyft if you can.- If you can't make the date, I can't guarantee any of the in-person rewards like being called ""your majesty."" I'll still post the short for you to enjoy. But yeah, no refunding or makeup dates.- 21 and up because I curse a lot and don't want to say the q word in front of kids.- Tangible rewards for higher-tier backers will be handed out at the party. If you can't make it, I'll message you and mail you what I can."

With the right amount of funding we can get better Actors, locations, props and equipment, all vital to making Blackout a success.Actors are what bring a film to life, they take a character from an idea on paper and make them a reality. They are one of the mostimportantparts of making a film and your money will help us find the best possible. We will be using sites such as casting call pro, however we also want to go through casting agencies who will be able to help us find actors that best match our characters. Your money will help us pay our actors what they fully deserve.Although we have access to some equipment such as the Black magic Cinema camera. Your money will allow us to add to this, by getting extras such as, specialist lenses and a speedbooster so that we can use the black magic to its full potential, and get the best image quality possible.To make this film we require two locations. Fortunately we have already secured our first location which is an electricity pylon in a field. You have already seen this location in our promotional video, so we have already carried out shoots there.Our second location is one of the main reasons we need your help. The majority of Blackout is set in a research facility. In order to replicate this, we need a top quality modern office location, something that we believe is going to cost us most of our budget. We are currently working on securingthis location, but with your help, and more money to put towards the search, we can get one that is perfect, to bring our story to life.Your money will go towards sourcing the props and costumes that we need to make this film. Some of these we are able to make ourselves but we want to get the best quality costumes and props possible to make the film as authentic and real as we can.Once this film has been made, we don't want to stop there.

And YES, I WILL model every single house of those who donate enough.Without further ado, let me show you a couple more pics of my work so far, this is a pre-alpha build, this is not even 1% of what I'm going to create for the actual game in both quantity and quality.I really hope you like what you see so far and expect to see more. ","The only risk is the time i will invest in the development of the game assuming people actually fund it, if many people pledge to see their house in-game it might take me some time to make all of the 3D models, The time will depend on how big their houses are and/or how complex in design they are.The challenge will be to finish this game before this year ends but don't you fret, i will release Alpha versions or ""early builds"" of the game for you to test (only for backers) so you will get to see the game through it's stages long before the release of the final version."
