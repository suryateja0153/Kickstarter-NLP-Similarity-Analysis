I am at a point where I want to be able to showcase my recipes, and let people taste my foods. I have worked for others for too long, and I see my own potential, and want others to see what I can do when given the chance to spread my culinary wings.This kickstarter is to help me get my food truck idea off the ground. The money I am trying to raise will help me pay for start up costs associated with getting a new business off the ground; such as incorporation fees, websites, truck acquisition, licensing, and permits. Any and all donations will help me get that much closer to my goal, and hopefully realize my dream of having my own food truck. Once I get established with my food truck I hope to grow into other culinary ventures. But in order to do these things, I need help, help from generous and kind people like you.Thank you for taking time to look this over, and thank you for helping in any way you are able.","As with all food ventures there is risk involved. I have worked in the food industry long enough to know how to recover from most incidents. One issue would be burned batches of soups, I know enough to make sure I have enough product on hand to be able to remake and adapt the menu in case of emergencies, sadly it means more time and money, but it is better to start fresh then serve a sub par product. Unhappy customers are another challenge, luckily I learned how to be civil and pacify even the angriest of customers from working graveyard shifts as a chef in a casino. I also am aware of issues in purchasing, checking over, and adding equipment to a food truck, and that it may delay the time frame I have set forth, but I will make sure to keep clear and open line of communication with all backers, so that we are all on the same page. I want nothing more than to be successful with this venture, and I am sure if you are investing in me and my idea you want the same thing, but I know safety needs to be priority one. For myself I want to make sure the vehicle I am driving is safe, and passes all safety checks so I do not endanger myself or others while on the road, or at a fest.",https://www.kickstarter.com/projects/622632746/the-soup-guy?ref=discovery_category_newest,622632746/the-soup-guy,"My project is to allow me to continue to grow as my customer base continues to grow as well. Through your funding I will be able to add a few more key pieces of equipment to my trailer, along with ensuring a safe reliable vehicle to begin to take the trailer to more events, such as farmers markets, festivals, and other local events.I have been a professional chef for close to 20 years, and I feel it is time to start getting my name out there and put my own recipes first. I started my first small catering business in 2013 where I tried to offer too many choices, but what ultimately seemed to stick were the soups I was making. After taking a year off due to health issues, I came back and started up The Soup Guy, since its launch I have seen my customer base increase week to week through just word of mouth. I was featured in a local area newspaper, that has a circulation of about 90,000 readers.Through this I am growing faster than I know what to do, but I am still confident in my product and know my own limits and when to stop taking orders.","Some of the risks involved in this project are if I am unable to keep up with new business, and lose customers. As a newly formed small business, new customers are what will help me continue to grow. My current repeat business retention is 75%, so the other 25% has been new business, and as word of mouth continues to spread my business continues to grow. As I said though if I am not able to keep up with the customer growth I will not be as successful as I know I can be."

I want to include a way for importers to sell cars and parts. For example, A community based store where people can find specialized parts for their car simply by listing a make, model and desired parts. Then sellers can search and find buyers with ease. Stream lining the process of tirelessly finding overseas parts.","I am a confident developer with many programming languages, I have the required knowledge to build and deploy the site. My concerns are being able to pay to run the servers and marketing required to have the site catch followers. Once the site is live, I will begin to travel along with my now finished project car. I will visit car meets and introduce the product to folks at the meets. This form of marketing is cheap and doesn't always work.

This installation is an closer look of the interaction, and more importantly the lack there of, of individuals packed together in these masses. It will give the viewer a birds eye view of the hundreds to thousands of figures in motion. And just like in a busy city's walkway they all seem to not be interested in the others around them. All just hurrying on their way or making small social groups where they try to break away from the herd.Every figure will be a hand made ceramic individual. Even though many of them will look similar, each one will be unique with its own character. If the funding gets high enough I will also make large three to five foot sculptures of the figures to place around the sidewalks of downtown to actually mingle in the crowds. Hoping for the chance to make between 5-10 of them, each of them very unique and performing a simple action of the common pedestrian in a caricature fashion. There will be areas where the figures have decided to recognize and interact with each other. In these areas the figures glaze or texture will be handled differently to represent the idea of communities being born when people take time to slow down. These areas will also give the whole visual form of the installation a powerful contrasting element. The figures will range in size from an inch to a cpl feet.

It all started when I saw my father boil sap from the trees on the farm when I was just a little boy. Over the last year I have decided that I would go through the trees on the property and see if there were enough maple trees to make this business a reality, and after just an hour and a short walk I found that my father never even scratched the surface of the potential the farm had for the venture I am now trying to partake. I have counted and marked over 500 trees on the property and found that other local farms are also on board to help me and allow me to tap their trees for a cost of around .10 cents a gallon of sap. With that I am putting this project in your hands to help me get the equipment necessary to tap, boil, bottle, and sell this natural and self sustaining product, maple syrup.",If the only situation I feel can arise which would be weather cooperation your orders will be filled by other venders that I have a relationship with in my area that will sell to me bulk syrup.

I remembered stories that my aunt, uncle, and father used to tell about my grandfather making maple syrup. I made about 3 gallons of syrup last year tapping trees along the road by the farm house, and this summer took a class about how to make syrup commercially and decided to look at the property and see what amount of trees we had. After a week of ribboning trees and counting the amount of taps I would need I came up with the numbers. The farm is 82 acres set in the town of bethel in New York. Of those 82 acres about 50 are wooded and we have approximately 623 sugar maple trees scattered around various corn fields that our family have recently began reusing as corn mazes and pumpkin patches for the fall. Of the 623 trees about 477 are able to be tapped for maple sap for syrup making and the other 146 trees are within 5-10 years of maturing to the right size of 10"" in diameter. I am setting 250 taps this year on a main line that will produce between 8 gallons of sap per tap in a bad season to 25 gallons per tap in an optimal season giving me between 2,000 to 6,250 gallons of sap for the season. Sap is boiled down at an average of 40 gallons of sap to (1) gallon of syrup. I will have enough with the minimum to make the amount for your orders. Thank you.",There is minimal risk but the only risk would be a short season due to the weather getting to warm and staying warm enough for the trees to bud early.

The force required to pull the viewer is generated by the compression of the straps around the skull. Lengthening the top strap will cause increased pressure on the ears. The weight of the viewer assembly tends to cause slippage and lifts the strap at the back of the skull.The semi-rigid frame of the Hands Free Headgear adapter forms a small truss system that supports the viewer in front of the face. There is no pressure on the forehead or cheeks. The system is well clear of the ears and there are no elastic straps compressing the skull.Rather like Orville Redenbacher, who spent decades trying to improve popcorn, Neal Nelson has spent the past 18 months revising and improving a head mounted display adapter system for Virtual Reality viewers.Several dozen units of various designs have been sold trough the web, ebay and Amazon. Some examples are shown here:The Hands Free Headgear adapter for the Samsung Gear VR viewer incorporates the best features from all of the previous designs and is the most advanced head mounted display adapter system for the Samsung viewer available from any source.The Head Mounted Display Adapter Kit consists of three components including two magnetic mounting brackets that attach to the sides of the Gear VR viewer, and a head mounted support frame that accepts and supports the viewer assembly.The kit will not include the Gear VR viewer or a Samsung Galaxy phone. Gear VR viewers are now available at many different retail outlets such as BestBuy, Costco and NewEgg.Step 1. - Remove the head straps and peel off the face cushion from the Gear VR viewer.Step 2. - Remove the non-stick backing paper from the double-sided adhesive foam for one of the magnetic mounting brackets.Step 3. - Insert the locator tab and press the adhesive foam in place on the viewer body.Step 4. - Repeat Steps 2 and 3 for the 2nd magnetic mounting bracket.Step 5. - Insert the viewer assembly into the Head Mounted Adapter frame.Step 6. - Press and turn the size adjuster knob counter-clockwise to loosen the hat size band.Step 7. - While wearing the adapter, press and turn the size adjuster knob clockwise until the fit is snug but still comfortable.Step 8. - If necessary adjust the top strap to further insure a comfortable fit.Step 9. - Slide the viewer assembly vertically or horizontally within the frame until the viewer assembly is positioned for the best viewing experience.No. The original elastic head straps and the face cushion are attached with Velcro and micro Velcro type fasteners. Removing and/or replacing them can be accomplished without tools or modifications. The Hands Free Headgear magnetic mounting plates attach with double sided adhesive foam tape. Again, there are no modifications to the Gear VR viewer.Yes. Although the double sided foam adhesive tape was carefully chosen to provide a strong bond, it is possible to slowly peel off the magnetic mounting brackets that are attached with the double sided foam adhesive tape. Then the original Samsung elastic head bands and face cushion can then be re-attached.Some people have reported discomfort similar to car-sickness after an extended viewing session with a Virtual Reality headset.  Early research in this area has generally been tested with VR gaming applications where frequent or sudden head movements take place.Watching a Virtual Reality entertainment program, such as watching a feature length movie or a sporting event, will generally not include continuous or dramatic head movement.It is expected that extended viewing of Virtual Reality entertainment programs will be an experience comparable to watching a 3-D movie in an IMAX theater  .This Hands Free Headgear head mounted display adapter uses the same type of ""rare earth"" magnets that were used in the original Google Cardboard viewer.  These strong magnets could affect the operation of, or even damage, certain sensitive electronic devices.The same type of care should be taken with this adapter that was taken with the original Google Cardboard viewer. Avoid close contact between the rare earth magnets and sensitive electronic devices. More information about this topic can be read here:https://www.kjmagnetics.com/blog.asp?p=pacemaker-safetyCopyrighted material or trademarks that are mentioned on this page are the property of their owners.Hands Free Headgear is a trademark of Neal Nelson.  Neal Nelson also has a utility patent pending for the head mounted display adapter technology shown on this page. A utility patent covering the Hands Free Headgear design was applied for in October of 2015.",The risks and challenges should be minimal. Hands Free Headgear has been shipping their original head mounted display adapter for Google Cardboard viewers since January of 2015. This new design for the Gear VR viewer has different physical dimensions but the basic components are similar. Suppliers have been qualified and relationships are in place so there should be a smooth launch process.
https://www.kickstarter.com/projects/ydentglobal/the-black-house-youngest-president?ref=discovery_category_newest,ydentglobal/the-black-house-youngest-president,"Synopsis:What if slavery never happened, what if when the Europeans came to North America millions of natives lives were spared. So much chaos, so much blood, so much death all over the idea of freedom. The idea that no 1 man nor group should have complete control over humanity. What if power never became the motif, what if our nation up held it's original purpose and offered freedom and prosperity for all men, women and children. That was the idea that forever rerouted  the course of America and set the pace for true freedom. That was the idea that made the people vote for me. The 2nd Black President and at 27 the youngest person to ever hold this seat of power. Unlike many of my predecessors I planned to fix this nation no matter the obstacles. I made the tough calls and did what I had to assure that future generations would never have to experience the mayhem that was called The United States of America for 500 years. I found the brightest, most innovative minds the world had to offer. They called us The Black Sheep Cabinet. So we said FUCK IT WELCOME TO THE BLACK HOUSEI don't want to bore you all with a long description so I will keep this to the point! I've had views on politics since a young age, with my mom being an Army Vet the matters of my country resonate deeply within my spirit. At the age of 14 I started my first company YD Entertainment which has opened tremendous opportunity for me. I was able to craft the skills of not only being a recording artist but the skills needed to cover ever job within the entertainment industry. Some people ask me how do I do it all and sometimes I don't even know, determination I guess. I understood early that solely rapping wouldn't give me longevity and as I grew older my passion for science and technology began to re emerge as well as my childhood acting dreams. In 2010 I started The Virginia Hemp Company, won two green business awards (2012 -2013) and now I am actively working with many people around this country to bring about solutions to the world issues.In 2012 I started a mock Presidential Campaign with the idea that Youth Leadership could bring about some amazing things for our country. The youth of my generation are developing a mentality like never seen before in history. We want to see the world prosper for all people and not just the few. We want to create new systems that put the people and the planet before profits and eventually create what I believe can be heaven on earth.I've been gaining much support for my Presidential Campaign lately and only being 25 I cannot legally hold the seat of President which is bogus. The age of candidacy is a clear cut example of Age discrimination. There are 10 year olds in college and 35+ year olds living on the streets. The government can't give me a reason why 35 is the chosen age. Experience does have a lot to say about leadership, but so does innovation. I believe it's time for the country to Relax, Rebrand, and Rebuild. I think America should adopt Cannabis and Hemp as their #1 renewable and sustainable resource. I think that energy should be universal and health and nutrition should be the focus before ""health care"". Power and control became the motif for our politicians, but now it's time for a new human evolution. The evolution of the mind will allow humanity to accomplish feats we could only dream of. My background is in entertainment business, visual arts (graphic design, photography, videography), media communications, marketing, and audio engineering. All these skills require knowledge of how the mind works through psychology and I strongly believe media is what influences our nation.I want to create a film about hope, a movie that demonstrates America can overcome ALL barriers that separate us as humans. I want to use the skills I've worked amazingly hard for to create something timeless that will inspire generation after generation. I want to give the world a view inside of the America I see. The America where every one is truly free where us as citizen focus on human development and gear ourselves to begin pioneering other worlds. All of our issues have simple solutions once we remove many of the driving factors that even make people get into politics. The Black House won't be just a picture about a young black man in office but a movie about how all races can come together and help make a better future for tomorrow. The final purpose of this film is to create a movie that will bring attention to the DMV (Dc, MD, VA) as a hub of entertainment. There is so much talent in this area but with no active channels for careers in entertainment much of the talent is being wasted working regular jobs. This film will spark a renaissance in the DMV","I want to get this filmed and ready before the 2016 elections so we're aiming to start shooting ASAP! Casting - Depending on how much money we raise will depend on casting. Casting will include the main actors, supporting actors, and extrasFilm Crew - We will need a full film crew from grips to a glam team.Permits - Because I want to film much of this in DC I will have to deal with permits.Room, Board, and other Travel Expenses There is much that goes into a film. We have much of the film equipment we need to accomplish the movie but limited budget for the roles and logistics to make this a top notch motion picture. I need way more than $10k so lets make this one of the biggest statements about crowd funding and create an Iconic and Timeless movie together !",https://www.kickstarter.com/projects/ydentglobal/vallywood-dmv-promo-tour?ref=discovery_category_newest,ydentglobal/vallywood-dmv-promo-tour,"VALLYWOOD Virginia Da New Hollywood is a comprehensive project created by (me) Slain Illuzion to assist in Virginia's rise as the next hub of entertainment. I am a Full Sail University grad in Media Communications and majority of the jobs I qualify for in the entertainment industry are in New York, Florida, California, and beyond. So now my goal is to bring Hollywood to Virginia. The 33 track album tells a story of love, betrayal, struggle,redemption, and living life to the fullest.The record takes you on a journey and through it you experience the many different aspects of what makes Virginia Da New Hollywood Featuring his newest label artist Daygo Coohlyn from San Diego California the duo come together to create many timeless records and hit songs that will resonate with your soul and give you eargasms over and over. VALLYWOOD is more than music, it's a lifestyle that merges fashion, history, spirituality, fellowship, passion, romance, knowledge,fighting injustice, wealth,and fantasy. It's an experience like no others, some live here while others just visit, but when you come here you create memories that will walk with you for a lifetime. The album released Jan 2nd 2016 and through the help of interns with daily digital marketing across a number of channels we have been able to keep consistency with our streams and sales.But for Stream numbers to be enough to make $100,000+ dollars we need to be in the millions of streams and thousands of mp3 sales. Now we are entering the phase of marketing where we need to hit the road and take the numbers through the roof for the summer time. Daygo and Slain were planning a cross country VA 2 CA tour which is one of the hit singles on the album, but because of time and budget restrictions we've decided to tour the whole state of Virginia from Mid June to Dec spreading love and light along the way one city at a time. Virginia is a very large state and has a range of people from all walks of life and we wish to be able to reach as many people who are willing to listen, watch, and come to the shows. With over 10 Million people in the state and the popularity we have already generated here in state hitting the road is going to be an amazing experience for us but we are still in need of a little money to make it happen comfortably.The money raised via Kickstarter will be used for on road living expenses, and marketing materials we can use as we travel the state. VALLYWOOD Fashion is a mix between 1600s-1800s era fashion and modern day fashion. Being in Virginia we have access to tons of colonial clothing but it is a bit costly. Working with designers in Jamestown we are able to acquire articles of clothing at a discount and are working with fashion interns in the area to design new look. The fashion is a very important part of our marketing.We will be documenting the whole experience in it's raw form from the fun on the road to the wild parties we encounter along the way. As we raise funding we are also actively pursuing sponsorship with companies that align with our vision in the realms of creativity and fashion. . The ultimate goal from this smoovement is to usher in the Era of Virginia Corporate Entertainment that allows for the creativity of artist to lead vs a cookie cutter formula to assure return on revenue. Music got boring and we want to bring the life and soul back to the industry that we have sacrificed so much for and to accomplish that we need your help!! ","We prefer to look at things from a positive outlook. We will be taking my 2015 Honda Civic which is amazing on mileage and has full coverage, we lead a pretty healthy lifestyle so the budget wont be hit to hard by fast food stops as we prefer to charge up with smoothies and healthier food options. A number of situations can happen on the road but as long as we travel in light we dont foresee many if any challenges that will prevent the success of this manifesting"

In keeping with our traditional family recipe's, our dough is handmade, our sauce is slow simmered to thoroughly blend our seasoning: a mix of herbs & spices (both from the original secret family recipes developed in 1958). Our pepperoni is precision sliced so they crisp to perfection. Our subs (signature Italian; ham, bacon and cheese; and steak) are all cooked open faced so the cheese and bun crisp. Our bread sticks are basted with garlic butter, topped with a sprinkle of Romano cheese and baked to a golden brown. We also offer wonderful cannoli and tiramisu. In 2016, we felt compelled to carry on the family tradition and do what we loved. We did a lot with a little. With hard work, sweat and creative solutions, we resurrected Gardina's Pizza in Bellbrook, Ohio on July 7, 2016. We are a single shop, family owned business. The community has been unbelievably supportive and responsive. We have 2 employees and hope to create more jobs. We strive to carry on the traditions passed down by Dad and Mom, not only in our product, but in our business practices and conduct (discounts to military, police, firefighters/EMT's, teachers & nurses has been a tradition since 1958.) We've got the experience, know how and a solid business plan with realistic goals for measured, manageable growth. We need funding for operating capital, a new energy efficient oven, hiring additional employees and marketing.This will allow us to expand hours to include lunch service and offer increased catering capacity, while creating more jobs & giving backto the community.

The story behind the suit, is of a very emotional and humbling time in my life. Oftentimes, my despair verging on the suicidal. All I had to my name was a duffel bag with some clothes that I had bought at The Salvation Army years before. The designer of the suit, Jade Howe, was a friend of mine and had bestowed it upon me. I was deeply grateful for that suit! I had many 'friends' in the entertainment industry and I had events that I, I mean CHURCH, had to show up to. And I would show up everywhere in it; From boarding a private jet to go to red carpet events to after-show dressing room shenanigans followed by late night trailer park runs.

I am inviting you to give a little of your spare change in support of my forthcoming poetic pictorial books entitled Spare Change. The purpose of this book is to show the humanity behind homelessness and to raise money to help make a difference. I have a cinematic approach to photography and believe that life happens in moments. To me, a photograph is simply capturing a beautiful glimpse of time so that it can last forever. And if something lasts forever that means so does its impact. My goal is to use my talent to change the lives of others. Currently, I plan to bring attention to homelessness through the publication of my debut book, a collection of photographs and poems entitled Spare Change; a Poetic Pictorial. I have interviewed quite a few of Chicago's most incredible homeless people who are happy to share their story, and I have officially partnered with a writer/editor whose work has been published by Random House, HarperCollins, Penguin Books, Viking, and more. With the additional support of your spare change, I will have the financial backing to acquire the best equipment needed in order to produce the most amazing and timeless images possible. Once we have published the book, a substantial amount of earnings from sales will be allocated for contributions to help people truly understand what led others into homeless situations. A portion of profits will also be used to help get and keep people off of the streets. ","Currently, the main challenge that I am facing with this project is in regard to equipment.

https://www.kickstarter.com/projects/viraltap/tiny-planets?ref=discovery_category_newest,viraltap/tiny-planets,"Im am trying this again, if I can get 40000 people to donate at-least donate $1 I can fund my project. I have had this project up before and I have cut the cost substantially. This will be a MMO, but since I have to cut funding it might be at-least 3 months after launch of the game to do so.This is basically a Real time simulation game, with every element you can probably find in a game of this type. Farming, pets, some first person elements Civilization type elements, My big plan is the graphics I plan to revolutionize mobile gaming graphics. I have a new technique in which I will not reveal until after the game launch and if I can receive a copyright and patent on.My plan is to launch by March 2015. The funding will currently pay for Equipment upgrades as well as certain software. I am still working on One 3d-model that is going to be the in a word the showcase of the game a preview model. I continue to work on it as well as tweak it, the model is one of the most important elements to the mobile app. The screen shot is below.I have continually worked on the model for a few weeks now. It would be finished faster with funding and as well allow me to open up time for me to continually work on this project in almost a non-stop project. I was hoping to hire a little help with the previous version of the project which I deleted as I received no funding I have cut the funding from 85,000 to 40,000 in order to make my project more appealing.My goal is to revolutionize Mobile gaming in such a way that I phase out pay to play. My belief is pay to play just ruins every game you can find, yes people need to make money, but If the game is reliable, supported, as well as viable there should be no reason to pay for diamonds or etc.Ads may be in the game to support funding of the servers but, they will not cover the game screen at any time of play, they will most likely be on loading splash screens.My goal is to keep the app between 100-250Mbs.","There is risks with every project as i am doing this by myself time is the big risk as I am still learning always learning about programming on the Mobile platforms.  Another risk is acceptability of the project after it launches, including os updates in which certain pieces of code may no longer work if the Mobile os is updated. I will continually ad support for as many mobile platforms as possible so everybody can enjoy playing. Popularity is a main risk, no gamers = no fun for the MMO.This is where substantial advertising on my part will come in. Every setback will be posted in an update on here I will continually update daily as the project continues as soon as I can get funding the project will make a serious start, as right now I am playing with ideas, most will not be posted on here as it will not be fun if all features are revealed.I work full time in the medical field and have 10+ years experience in art. I've dabbled with 3d graphics for last 8 years and now I am comfortable enough to do this project. The challenges are resources in order to complete my project. I am learning C# right now and hope to dominate it soon. I hope to complete this project by the end of the year. The challenges Ill face are just challenges, they will be overcome whether they will be difficult or not I will find a way I always do. I will continually update of the challenges and successes. The only risk I can see right now is it wont become popular, with the multifaceted depth of the game. Other problems could include the debugging process and beta testing process. Beta testing may be limited to a few number of people, as there may be a fee to purchase the entire game with no in app purchases for a low price, will be needed to maintain multiplayer servers. The one big challenge that I face is finding a suitable gaming engine for both platforms that will work well with both mobile platforms. The programming challenges with that alone will need to be overcome to get the game the way it is supposed to be. The biggest challenge I know I will face will be incorporating detailed 3d models with out eating RAM and processing power, I will however keep the textures to a minimum in-order to bring you a game style that you may have never seen before on a mobile platform, techniques used in ""DEAD SPACE"" and ""Skyrim"" as this will be a casual game to test out this new technique I have come up with. More actionesque games may come in the future incorporating new technique to build a console quality game without the use of 2d sprites. There is one challenge that every game faces is acceptance and the vote of confidence by fans in it. I am hoping by pioneering this new style of mobile game that it will be accepted by those who play it. I want to say that the game will be infinite but it wouldn't be a game if it was.

I work Full time for an Ambulance company. In 2006 I went to ITT Tech for Digital Entertainment and Game Design. I am Currently an Emt and do 3d Modeling for fun but I want to Get More serious about it and create a Game that Everyone will Love. I have made many tiny games back when I was in high school on an old 800mhz machine and would love to do it to entertain people. I always believed a smile and some entertainment can heal.    I am Also Starting a game company to further my education in the medical field to make a company even if it just has a marginal profit to be able to afford medical school. I have had several large kick starter campaigns and I never receive funding for my projects. So I came here to try something a little smaller.    The Games I make I want be grand enough to help Entertain the world. I want to revolutionize Gaming on the Mobile Platform and give something noone has ever seen before in mobile gaming, hopefully ever game I make will make me better at it as it should and to even make a game to really get to that person so they just say wow.What We Need & What You Get    Explain how much funding you need and where it's going. Be transparent and specific-people need to trust you to want to fund you. The Funding I need for this small project is $8000.  About $3,000-$4,000 will go to new hardware and software upgrades new motherboard, Processor and GPU, and Memory Upgrades as I cannot develop with the current system I have now. $1,000 will go to licensing and Taxes. The rest will go to Development software and One or two new devices to do software testing as well as Rendering Software.    My specialty is Emergency medicine but I do well with 3d modeling as well as concept drafting.    If I don't reach my funding Ill use what I can to get started and then Ill start a new campaign to try to get the rest.The Impact    I am planning to revolutionize mobile gaming and bring back the principles I grew up with why gaming when I was a Kid alot of us grew up on those gaming principles and Id like to bring them back.Other Ways You Can Help    Help me fund my campaign so I can give you a Worthy Game.

The Commune is a rebel terrorist organization that strives for people to be more independent of technology and they will do anything even murder to accomplish their mission.The President of the WWGS Council has been overseer for 20 years and prides himself as being a Leader of the People and free of corruption.Current System Benchmark A current ChallengePassMark(TM) PerformanceTest 7.0 Evaluation Version (http://www.passmark.com)Results generated on:  Monday, June 30, 2014Benchmark ResultsTest Name: This ComputerCPU - Integer Math: 134.1CPU - Floating Point Math: 302.8CPU - Find Prime Numbers: 161.9CPU - SSE: 1.6CPU - Compression: 608.9CPU - Encryption: 1.7CPU - Physics: 24.1CPU - String Sorting: 300.6Graphics 2D - Solid Vectors: 0.3Graphics 2D - Transparent Vectors: 0.3Graphics 2D - Complex Vectors: 24.8Graphics 2D - Fonts and Text: 50.5Graphics 2D - Windows Interface: 18.8Graphics 2D - Image Filters: 82.2Graphics 2D - Image Rendering: 122.2Graphics 3D - Simple: 167.3Graphics 3D - Medium: 42.0Graphics 3D - Complex: 7.2Memory - Allocate Small Block: 2428.1Memory - Read Cached: 1353.8Memory - Read Uncached: 935.3Memory - Write: 733.2Memory - Large RAM: 211.6Disk - Sequential Read: 64.1Disk - Sequential Write: 48.8Disk - Random Seek + RW: 3.8CPU Mark: 502.62D Graphics Mark: 77.3Memory Mark: 373.5Disk Mark: 422.03D Graphics Mark: 114.4PassMark Rating: 299.2System information: This ComputerCPU Manufacturer: GenuineIntelNumber of CPU: 1Cores per CPU: 1CPU Type: Intel Celeron 900 @ 2.20GHzCPU Speed: 2194.5 MHzCache size: 1024KBO/S: Windows 7 (64-bit)Total RAM: 1978.9 MB.Available RAM: 987.1 MB.Video settings: 1366x768x32Video driver: DESCRIPTION: Mobile Intel(R) 4 Series Express Chipset Family MANUFACTURER: Intel Corporation BIOS: Intel Video BIOS DATE: 2-20-2010Drive Letter: CTotal Disk Space: 213.7 GBytesCluster Size: 4.0 KBytesFile system: NTFSWill Be UsingCurrent up to Date Screen ShotsThank you to my one and only contributor on indiegogo you will receive you reward.","Risks & ChallengesThere are alot of risks when creating a game and one is playability, that has to do alot with the principles I grew up with. Pay to play is what I am going to start a revolution to get rid of. Noone should have to play a game that you have to pay for levels. One of the Challenges I'm Going to face is getting the game to alot of people, especially when there are hundreds of thousands of games on the mobile platform that are popular. One way of getting rid of Pay to play is Use advertisers in the game without pop ups, Suck as Incorporating them in a poster etc, I'm going to bring back the good old principles and Show future generations how a game really should be.There is risks with every project as i am doing this by myself time is the big risk as I am still learning always learning about programming on the Mobile platforms.Another risk is acceptability of the project after it launches, including os updates in which certain pieces of code may no longer work if the Mobile os is updated. I will continually ad support for as many mobile platforms as possible so everybody can enjoy playing.Popularity is a main risk, no gamers = no fun for the game.This is where substantial advertising on my part will come in.Every setback will be posted in an update on here I will continually update daily as the project continues as soon as I can get funding the project will make a serious start, as right now I am playing with ideas, most will not be posted on here as it will not be fun if all features are revealed.I work full time in the medical field and have 10+ years experience in art. I've dabbled with 3d graphics for last 8 years and now I am comfortable enough to do this project. The challenges are resources in order to complete my project. I am learning C# right now and hope to dominate it soon. I hope to complete this project by the end of the year. The challenges Ill face are just challenges, they will be overcome whether they will be difficult or not I will find a way I always do. I will continually update of the challenges and successes. The only risk I can see right now is it wont become popular, with the multifaceted depth of the game.Other problems could include the debugging process and beta testing process. Beta testing may be limited to a few number of people, as there may be a fee to purchase the entire game with no in app purchases for a low price, will be needed to maintain multiplayer servers.The one big challenge that I face is finding a suitable gaming engine for both platforms that will work well with both mobile platforms. The programming challenges with that alone will need to be overcome to get the game the way it is supposed to be.The biggest challenge I know I will face will be incorporating detailed 3d models with out eating RAM and processing power, I will however keep the textures to a minimum in-order to bring you a game style that you may have never seen before on a mobile platform, techniques used in ""DEAD SPACE"" and ""Skyrim"" as this will be a casual game to test out this new technique I have come up with. More actionesque games may come in the future incorporating new technique to build a console quality game without the use of 2d sprites.There is one challenge that every game faces is acceptance and the vote of confidence by fans in it. I am hoping by pioneering this new style of mobile game that it will be accepted by those who play it. I want to say that the game will be infinite but it wouldn't be a game if it was. I'll do my best."
https://www.kickstarter.com/projects/955009457/massive-kit-ultimate-wordpress-plugin?ref=discovery_category_newest,955009457/massive-kit-ultimate-wordpress-plugin,"WordPress is the major CMS in the world, used for various usages: simple blogs, ecommerce, dating, reviews, auctions, events, radio, portfolios, and hundreds more.Of course, some premium plugins showed a new way to build websites on WordPress: Visual Composer, to visually design posts and pages. The work done is impressive. And, we all have to admit the life is easier since Visual Composer has arrived. And today, Cornerstone is a rising star in this domain.Pods, or WP Types are amazing, too, regarding the Custom Post Types side. For someone who has specific needs in content management, this is really helpful.Lot of plugins like this can be mentioned here, with no doubt: Flow-Flow, Gravity Forms, Members, EventOn…But, hey, what’s the final price? You’ll invest hundreds of dollars, if you need several of them. And this is only the starting point of your problems… You will face some others, like incompatibility between ones and others. And invest again if you want an additional feature. And invest again and again to buy a bridge between them (if it exists!). Some of them will follow the WordPress versioning, others won’t.A simple example: in a hand, I can have Pods to create Custom Post Types. In the other hand, I have Visual Composer to design my pages. But hey, they are not friends! Impossible to design my Pods views in Visual Composer. They do not talk to each other.For a client, I had to implement a subscription system and an ecommerce system. Just to have a PayPal processor for the payment, I had to invest 79$ (ecommerce) + 197$ (subscription). How can you announce this kind of thing to a client?You guess: this can be an incredible source of problems, headaches and hair (and money) loss.The ideal solution? To get all these amazing features in only ONE WordPress plugin. Here are a few lists of benefits: Because it is not the philosophy. Several plugins should say that some users have this plugin and not this other. So it would be more complicated in term of functionalities.And, probably, more expensive for website’s owners, as they should pay each plugin separately. I’ve decided to design Massive Kit to avoid this.To avoid to miss up the key features listed above. It is important, for an optimized integration and to keep control of the development.Working with existing plugins would be a (partial) solution, but not powerful enough, as we can’t work on the plugins themselves, to integrate some capabilities. So, the best solution and the easiest way are to develop all the features by ourselves.Let's have a look to the main features of Massive Kit:The Custom Post Types features will allow you to create your very own custom post types. That means you are not limited to simple articles anymore. With this feature, you can add specific custom fields to your posts, to fit your needs. More than that, you can link them together, even with custom attributes.The View Designer is a view constructor, which allows you to create your pages, posts and custom posts views. It is a Visual Composer-like, but with a modern look. ;)Here are the key features of the View Designer:Here is the power to have a real ecosystem: the fields available in the Form Builder are also available to build your Custom Post Types.Which fields are available? Here is a list:Imagine if you could create your own system, and export it on another website? Yes, possible. And really useful to create your own Apps, and deliver them on your customers websites. Here are the features:The User Roles features will be really useful, once it is considered in the ecosystem: admin can create specific roles, add some special capabilities, and use these roles in its system: set some conditional displays in the View Designer, for example.As the User Roles feature, User Points will help to give more power to your website. Engage your users with badges and rewards. And user the points for various usages in your ecosystem: conditional displays in the frontend forms or views, for example.Here are the features list of the User Points feature:Just as the all sides of Massive Kit, this feature will help you to customize your very own website.The plugin will benefit of a great, clear and modern interface. This theme is already done and will be purchased to be adapted to the plugin.Developing a complete theme from scratch would be really a time/money-consumer task. So, to reduce development tasks and budget, the choice has been made to buy an impressive theme.The bill is quietly big, but about 10 times (or more!) less than the required cost to develop the same.The elements of this theme will be used to:So it will be widely profitable and this cost is completely optimized.The integration part is really interesting. When you have to buy several plugins, you often need to buy some extensions too. Payment processors (PayPal, Authorize.net, Stripe, 2CheckOut…), Social networks integrations (Facebook, Twitter, Google+…), musical and videos platforms (YouTube, Vimeo…), Images platforms (Instagram, Tumblr…). And, sometimes, you need to purchase these integrations twice, as you need PayPal integration for your subscription system, and your ecommerce plugin, as explained before.All the integrations in Massive Kit will be available for all the sides of the plugin. What does it mean?This means that integration for YouTube will allow you to:For a payment gateway, it will be used for:So, no need to purchase the same payment gateway several times!Integrations in the Massive Kit Core:Integrations as extensions (deliveri December 2016):ImagesSoundsContent networksSocial networksEmailingPayment ProcessorsEcommerce (for an affiliation system)StorageAs you can see, there are lots of integrations. All will be able to grab information from the web, for various usages.So many things to do with Massive Kit!Here are some examples:All previous examples at once! You can build really complex websites with Massive Kit.So much features to come!All is about fields… Take an ecommerce website. Listings are just a title, a price, a description, some medias, reviews… And we will have all this in the Massive Kit plugin. There’s virtually no limit.So, Massive Kit will be able to handle other features than those planned in the first release. Here are some of them, already planned to be added in the future:Some of them will need specific development, as a cart system for the ecommerce solution, but it is on the roadmap if the first release is a success. Once these pieces of code developed and integrated to the core system, we will be able to prebuild Apps, ready to install on your website.User driven! That’s the main philosophy for the Massive Kit plugin.We don’t talk about features pleasant for the developer. We talk about a plugin built with users in mind. The incoming features (and their priority) will be defined by the Massive Kit community (customers). We plan to add a user voice system on our website, to collect user needs, and plan future releases and bug fixes.This project will be fully outsourced, to ensure the developers have all the required skills needed.All of them have been reviewed. Their profiles, skills, work history and availability have been verified. The goal is to work with them on a long timeframe, to avoid a loss of time for next releases and extensions/integrations development.Massive Kit is a premium plugin. It will be available on the Envato marketplace (Code Canyon) in the beginning of 2017.I’ve decided to sold it as a premium plugin, because it is really, really difficult to make a product grow properly if it is free… And my goal is to ensure a long time support and development.The disadvantage with Envato is that author does not decide of the sale price. Envato team reviews and considers the sale price, to ensure a good market price. So, I cannot decide the sale price by myself, I can just estimate it in comparison to other (similar) plugins. But there’s no similar plugin…If we take the features of all plugins that Massive Kit can replace, and add the prices, they can fly to the sky… Here is a quick overview  of the plugins that can be replaced by Massive Kit:Bill: 219$, in the best case. For example, if you want a repeatable field for your Custom Post Types’ forms, you’ll have to buy WP Types, at 150$. The bill jumps to 369$. And if you need a Paypal integration for Gravity Forms, you’ll have to buy the 199$ license instead of 39$. Damn, 529$.So, Envato Marketplace is a good place for reasonable prices. The most expensive plugin on the plateform is about 80$, and integrations are about 15$ each.I can therefore estimate the Massive Kit plugin to the highest price, about 80$, and integrations at about 15$ each.With no surprise, the development step is the most expensive. But prices have been negociated. Taxes, Kickstarter fees, and various other fees (to build the sale website, and the demo website, for example), have been added.Here are the dues:Let's create a complete ecosystem, with the following Stretch Goals:As the quotes will be received, the stretch goals will be updated.The Stretch Goals will be submitted to a vote. Priority of these goals will be defined by Bakers (please refer to the rewards to see who will be able to vote on Stretch Goals).I just would like to thank you for your pledges. Sure, it will be a fantastic adventure!If you have any question about the project, just let me know. ;)","- This project is not feasible: the project feasibility has been verified by several different freelancers / web agencies before launching this Kickstarter campaign. So, yes, it is! :)- What about the quality of the final product? The general specifications have specified the quality constraints of the final product, so this side has been anticipated.- What about bugs in the product? The contract with the development team includes a bug warranty of at least 3 months. So the product will be tested and tested again for several weeks before going in stable release.- What if the product does not include all the promises? I will have a weekly meeting with the Development team, to ensure the things are going on the right way. More than that, I will have an permanent access on their server, to see things growing, and make functional corrections if needed.- What about the Development team? Are they serious? Yes, all their references have been verified. I wouldn't hire a team I don't trust. So, all have been checked about them.",https://www.kickstarter.com/projects/955009457/kitflow-automation-plugin-for-wordpress?ref=discovery_category_newest,955009457/kitflow-automation-plugin-for-wordpress,"A few examples of tasks that can be automated:SecurityMarketing / EcommerceIn other words... You can make marketing automation without any limit.Content / PublishingOnce the conception step done, a first version of the KitFlow prototype was made to prove the concept. This first version was pretty awful, but the main goal was to develop the main code. Of course, this code wasn’t good enough to be included in a stable version.A second, then a third version were made to improve the design, and make some bug fixes. Some features were added too, as some live counters, workflow edition, and some other little stuffs.For the first stable version (V1), the design will be reworked again, especially the workflow designer page. Indeed, the actual structure of the page may not be the best. The space for the setting of the elements is not ideal. And the overall structure may not be the best from an ergonomic point of view.Anyway, some page wireframes will be submitted to bakers, to get their opinion about designs.Integrations will be one of the strength of KitFlow. There will be a huge amount of integrations, for several dozens of popular WordPress plugins and 3rd party services.Here is a list of some integrations we plan to develop (or we will suggest to our developer friends):This is a first basic list. Lots of other plugins integrations will be developed, thanks to our developers community! And if you want an integration that is not listed here, just feel free to suggest it.Of course, every plugin author will be able to create its own elements, and 3rd party developers will be able to create elements too!Our goal is to make KitFlow developer friendly.As a developer, you’ll be able to develop new elements and offer them for free (or not!) on the marketplace.Offer elements for free will allow you to increase downloads, and be more popular. So, your paid elements will be more visible to KitFlow customers. So, offering free elements can be a good plan for you. And, of course, you can develop free elements, and make some Pro versions of the same elements, with more settings. That’s up to you!Sell single elements or group them in bundles.In a short time, you can develop lots of elements, and get many benefits:Be among the first developers to sign up, and start building your reputation right from the beginning of KitFlow's history. We highlight popular developers by presenting them first on the KitFlow site, and the most popular items will appear first in the KitFlow plugin. The more popular you are, the more visible you are, the more you can monetize your items.For example, we suggest you to offer free items, which will ensure a lot of downloads and use. Then, you can either make other paying items, or make pro versions of your free elements, which you can monetize.Register today for the Developer program by choosing the Developer Special Pack. An early access to Beta versions will be provided, to allow you to start developing your elements as soon as possible, and before the first stable release.Here is a comparison table about the free and pro versions of KitFlow.Elements included in Free / Pro versionsGood news! KitFlow will be available in a free and a pro version.The free version comes with basic features and elements. But it's not because it's free that it's limited! You’ll be able to build and fire unlimited workflows with the free version.The Pro version comes with advanced features, shaped for advanced users, KitFlow lovers, and web-agencies.Additional elements can be purchased separately, whatever version you use. If you need a single action, just get it from the marketplace, and pay as you go.You can get the free plugin, and add some additional elements, or get the Pro version and use it as is. That’s up to you!KitFlow Free VersionThe free version won’t be limited, so you can enjoy the automation magic in WordPress as much as you want! You can build unlimited workflows, with unlimited elements, and add free or paid elements.KitFlow Pro VersionKitFlow Pro version will be available for 39€.This price includes:An ""Agencies"" version is also available for 79€. It includes:A lot of elements will be free, including in the marketplace. Some others will be payable (Pro Elements), as they will offer more options, or they have more options or a more complex operation.Pro elements will be at 1€, 3€ or 5€, regarding the element’s complexity.The payment gateways will be at a fix price of 10€.Each element includes a lifetime usage, support and updated for 1 year.BundlesThe bundles will allow you to make maximum savings. They will group elements (Triggers, Actions, Restrictions) by theme (example: security, marketing ...), or integration (example: WooCommerce, ACF ...). The bundles will group at least 10 elements, but sometimes up to 20, 30, or 50 elements.The price of the Bundles will depend on the number of elements contained, as well as their complexity. Be that as it may, the basic rule will be 0.50 € per element, so for example, 25 € for a bundle of 50 elements. If the elements contained are particularly complex, this price can be adjusted up to + 30%.Each element includes a lifetime usage, support and updated for 1 year, for every element of the bundle.We want to share benefits of the KitFlow plugin for helpers. So, an affiliation system will be created, to reward bloggers for their work. We will offer 15% of all the sales made by our friends.Here is the planning for KitFlow development:","One of the biggest difficulties will be to develop many integrations. That's a success key to make KitFlow grow. That's why all the funds will be injected in those developments in the next year (no personal salary). Every single penny will be used for the project.Another challenge will be the participatiçon of third-party developers, as well as owners of third-party plugins. This side of the project is crucial, and a lot of time will be spent on this population. The development of KitFlow will be oriented to build new elements with ease."

Brian Severi: (www.brianseverimedia.com) Brian will be the primary camera operator and visual partner in the production of the ""Jersey Pawn"" show. Brian has ample experience in video production and consistently delivers under the pressures of a production. Notable film/media experience of his includes working with ESPN, serving as a primary producer on all media ( video, web, photo) on CCG Models, and then executing independent media projects for clients across the tri-state area. Working with Brian will help the production flow easily since he personally owns all of the camera/lighting/sound/editing equipment needed to execute the production and that grants us peace of mind, the ability to take our time, cut down on costs, and concentrate all efforts on delivering the highest quality show to everyone.OTHER RISKS:* In the case the full funding is not reached, as per the rules of Kickstarter, you are NOT charged for your pledge... no return is necessary because Kickstarter does not charge until the goal is hit and the campaign has ended... We must hit our goal of $46,000 for all the pledges to be charged and the production to happen. This is an inherent risk of being involved with supporting a Kickstarter campaign... the only risk is your time... as your money will be fully refunded ( it's not charged until the campaign is successful).DELAYS: We are realists, especially with all of the recent activity going on with the economy and with the world... We aspire to do our best to deliver the content, rewards, and experiences in the most timely manner, yet, we do understand we do not know everything... and there is a chance of the unforeseen creating delays in our production and fulfillment process.

https://www.kickstarter.com/projects/survivingisolation/surviving-isolation?ref=discovery_category_newest,survivingisolation/surviving-isolation,"I plan on living in an underground survival bunker for an extended period of time (up to one year). My time spent in this shelter will be in complete isolation from the outside world. In effect, I will be living as the sole survivor of a catastrophic event.During my time in isolation I plan on making regular video diaries so the outside world can monitor and record how the isolation is affecting me both physically and mentally. This will be a one way communication – I will record the videos and a link will be set up to allow a team outside of the shelter to receive them, but I will have no contact with them during this process.I think a key point to this experiment is that humans are built as social creatures. There are different personality types and some people are obviously more social beings than others. However, all human beings interact with a number of people in some way pretty much every day of their lives. In my opinion social media is the perfect example of how people need to feel involved and accepted by the masses in order to feel happy. This project will show what happens when a person is taken away from the safety net of others. It will also show what happens when an individual is completely and solely responsible for their own mood and their own motivation.Also, during my time underground – I believe it will be the perfect opportunity to conduct secondary experiments. I think this will be an ideal project to increase knowledge on growing seeds for food with no natural light. Food and drink production methods can be tested. With no outside materials can a seed be grown, processed and turned into something that is enjoyable to eat?Isolation is used as a punishment and as a control measure in prisons and there are a number of stories of prisoners spending days, weeks and months in isolation for most of their sentences. My experiment would be able to test the effectiveness of this as a deterrent to re – offend or whether it actually makes an individual alter their behaviour and personality in a positive or negative way.In the modern world we live in we are never more than a few clicks of a mouse away from interacting with someone anywhere in the world. I strongly believe that every person has the raw instinct to survive no matter what situation they are in. I think the way we look at tasks and things we consider to be important would change significantly and I think lots of people will be surprised at how many adaptations an individual can make and go through in order to survive from one day to the next with no one to lean on for support.The Challenges• Just one man – alone, Just one bunker – underground, Just time – one year, no company, no interaction, no safety net. Just me – alone, trying to survive!• Supplies to last half of the planned duration of my stay. The second half of the project will be reliant on me being able to produce my own supplies. Growing food, keeping clean, staying sane – success based on my decision making. Can I make the right ones after living in complete isolation?• Survival – is emotional and social survival possible in complete isolation? Can a person fully return to normal life after being alone for an extended period of time?• Is it possible to source everything a human needs for survival without ever going outside?• Can a comfortable standard of living be achieved after a world changing event?• Does being prepared mean you are more likely to survive?","I have a high level of survival knowledge and skills. I have been writing survival based articles for Boomerpreps.com for around a year now and they have been very successful (see below testimonial): ""I have been fortunate enough to have worked with Rob since some of the earliest days of BoomerPreps.com. He has been an excellent writer for our site - engaging the reader with his brand of ""how to"" detail that is not often found in the Emergency Preparedness/Survivalist sphere. He talks to you, paints you a picture of the purpose, then explains how to accomplish the task. In fact, a number of his articles are in the ""top read"" category. He has written 5 of our Top 10 articles, including the second-most read article on our site, ""Ziplock Every Day Carry Kit"". All of his nearly 50 articles for BoomerPreps have been top notch. Rob is passionate about preparedness and being a survivalist. This daunting project - living a year underground with no outside contact - could not be a consideration, let alone have a chance of being accomplished, by most of his contemporaries. While I have had reservations about this project - the duration and intensity, in particular - Rob's enthusiasm and determination leave little doubt he will accomplish his goal. I wholeheartedly support Rob in this venture!"" Michael Schwedhelm(""Chief Instructor"")Managing Editor/OwnerBoomerPreps.com  I am a qualified first aider and CPR/AED instructor so I have a great ability to stay calm and focussed even in high pressure situations. This will help me to be successful in this experiment. I have been a Personal Trainer for 8 years so I am fully aware of what my body needs in order to survive and to be able to complete all tasks required throughout this experiment. My passion for survival has led me to learn many skills not only in survival but also in mental and physical preparedness. I consider myself to be a very strong match for what would be seen as the person who could be a sole survivor.",https://www.kickstarter.com/projects/survivingisolation/prepped?ref=discovery_category_newest,survivingisolation/prepped,"Prepper - a person who believes a catastrophic disaster or emergency is likely to occur in the future and makes active preparations for it, typically by stockpiling food, ammunition, and other supplies.There are an increasing number of Preppers in the UK. Whilst it is difficult to know the exact number due to most keeping quiet about their plans - it is safe to say more and more people are preparing for emergency situations. Some prepare for natural disasters such as floods, snow etc while others prepare for the end of the world as we know it. Up until now the majority of regular release preparedness magazines come from America. Prepped! is about to change that. Prepped! will be the UK's first regular release preparedness magazine. It will feature unique content such as articles, prepper stories, interviews, product reviews and so much more. It will be a one stop shop for all things preparedness in the UK.This campaign will fund the launch of Prepped! and ensure that the first issue arrives with a bang! The funding will:With the backing of this campaign you will be helping to create an extremely successful and groundbreaking UK based magazine. ","The magazine market in the UK is pretty competitive. The bushcraft, camping and outdoor pursuits materials are already full of exciting offers and content. The niche in the market which is not being directly covered - The UK Preppers. This in itself is a challenge as most Preppers tend to keep to themselves to prevent others finding out about their level of preparedness in case the worst happens and people come knocking on their door. However, I have been involved with this niche for a long time - I have written preparedness material for a number of years which has enabled me to make some great contacts within this hard to reach audience. I fully understand the need for privacy and this will be supported fully by Prepped! Printing costs, website creation and management costs are a challenge that will take a lot of hard work and time to overcome but I am prepared (pun intended!) and I am confident this project will reach an extremely high level of success."

Wehave incurred some unexpected costs with our NEW location due to structural andmechanical issues. We unfortunately had to use a chunk of our operating moneyfor the build out. We had to install new electrical supply and plumbing, newwall and flooring. The $2,000 is the minimal we are in need of. Our prayer is to raise at least $5k to fully finish our design, purchase of aPOS system, tables & chairs, as well as inventory and marketing. We are a community driven company whose main objective is to serve while also givingback and helping to build our community. It is very important to both Karen and Ito buy locally. We buy most of our meats and vegetables from local farmers andour breads come from a local family owned bakery here in Dixon.We are looking for supporters who believein us and want the opportunity to join us in fulfilling our vision. If you love great foodand would like to supportourlocal community oriented small business,then The World’s Sausage Café & More is for you. Please help us openour doors and build our community together. You will not be disappointed.Our Story Fourteen years before opening the doors of The World’sSausage Café & More, Chef Richard and his wife Karen were awakened to acalling from God. Rather than open another restaurant to simply feed the body,the Lonkert’s were called to start a ministry that would nourish the soul as well.In 1998, Richard started G.S.G (God's Saving Grace) construction company. As a carpenter, Richard used this business as a way to share theteachings of Christ as well as remain open to the ways God called him to serve.Over time, Richard recognized the relationship of his two passions – servingfood and serving God – and was led to the ministry of feeding the people.The FoodThe World’s Sausage Café & More is locally owned by ChefRichard Lonkert and his lovely wife Karen of Dixon, IL, whose heartfeltapproach to slow food is inspired by Italian cooking visionary Chef Haussy aswell as French cooking visionary Chef Wolfgang Puck. Following their lead, ChefRichard began using local organic ingredients to prepare meals for his ownfamily. A Napa, California native, Chef Richard learned the benefits of pairingexcellent wines with expertly prepared meals that inspired him to open arestaurant, showcasing his food philosophy. Our menu will showcase our homemade sausages; beef brisket,corn beef brisket and rib tip meat, double ground fresh daily for all of ourburgers; fresh cut hand pounded breaded fried pork tenderloin & vealsandwiches; House made BBQ pulled pork sandwiches; and a grilled chicken club sandwich,just to mention a few items. In addition to our daily menu we will also beserving daily specials like fried coconut shrimp, blackened pan fried fishsandwiches, BBQ ribs, Hot wings, and whatever else we think of. The one thingyou can count on is the freshness of everything we serve. We will expand our menu to include dinner items like, dry aged steak’s thatyou would expect to find only in the finest steak houses in Chicago or NY,salmon and other sea food dishes, pasta dishes, soups and salads, coffee, tea andfresh gourmet desserts. Opportunity for growth is limitless. Our product line will expand to includea wider assortment of freshly made sausages and desserts as well. We willcontinue to use the highest quality ingredients in all of our products!Partnerships with local businesses we will offer catering for parties andmeetings which would increase our presence in the area market. Our trailer would be ahome base for catering orders serving the multitude of businesses and familiesin the area. We would expect significant foot traffic from several officebuildings and other complexes immediately adjacent to the trailer during lunchand dinner hours as well as late night on Fridays and Saturdays serving the tavern patrons.The World’s Sausage Café & Morewill have a major competitive advantage with our new location in downtown Dixon.My wife was born and raised in Dixon and I have lived here for 20 years, withour daughter attending local schools. The ""buzz"" created over the newfood trailer is already growing strong.The lot has been delivered to The World’s Sausage Café & More withutility hookups per our space plan.

Now in our second year, we've been completely overwhelmed by the outpouring of support we've received from our community. We've met hundreds of wonderful customers and served thousands of schnitzels. We're now excited to grow T.W.S.C & M. into a permanent business by opening a restaurant on the West Side of Dixon.Our MissionThe World's Sausage Cafe & More began with a simple idea: To make the kind of food we would want to buy and to be the kind of people we would want to buy from. With that in mind, we try our hardest to use fresh, local and regional ingredients in the food we make. Beyond great food, we also strongly believe in building community. We absolutely love the amazing and diverse group of customers who visit us at our location each week. We believe a permanent restaurant will help us expand that community even further.We have designed a space that is open, family-friendly, and relaxed. We hope to provide a place where people meet and the spirit of hospitality comes not just from our team but from our customers as well. With that in mind, we plan to use the flexibility of our design to host community events at T.W.S.C. & M. i.e. Live music, art showings, and more. Beyond encouraging community and creativity, we also want to provide well-paying jobs for our employees and encourage local farmers.Reviews :Carissa Yardley — 5 star I LOVE their food! Try the sausage or the blue burger! You won't be disappointed.Brenda Carlson Spratt — 5 star Yum! Yum! Yum! Just tried for the first time tonight. I had the pulled pork and coleslaw. Fabulous. A nice smokiness with a Carolina sauce and hubby had a huge blue cheese stuffed burger and fries. Fries were so good and the burger was divine. Definitely one of the best places to eat in town. I'm thinking of calling Guy Fieri from Diners, Drive-ins and Dives :)Dan Munroe — 5 star Tried them for the first time today. F'n delicious; worth every penny. Super nice; great food.Chris Campbell — 5 star Excellent food. Unbeatable burgers. And they donate a portion of profit to charities locally. Definitely a business to shop locally. Step out of the box and shop/support local businesses like this one.Bob Pilling —4 starHad the Apple and Onion Brat with fresh cut fries. The brat was big, fresh cooked and very flavorful. It is a unique style of brat versus the norm around here, regular or cheddar brats. I like those too but this is unique and very tasty.Vicky Biddle Clark —4 starThe fresh cut fries are exactly what they sound like....fresh cut fries from a whole potato with the skin. What was nice is these were actually kind of crispy as opposed to the greasy mess you sometimes get when restaurants attempt to do this.Very nice taste all around and a filling lunch!For more reviews just check out our FB page.The PlanEvery restaurant needs a hood, and it usually costs a lot. In our case, the hood is more expensive than all the rest of our equipment combined. We’ve been floored by the enthusiastic support of our customers, neighbors and friends. As we planned a permanent location, we thought it was important to include this same community in meaningful ways.Funding GoalsGOAL: We're asking for $8,000 to help us pay for our ventilation hood. After things like the installation of fire suppression and the hood itself, the cost is closer to $17,000, but we’re only asking our community to help us with the actual equipment.STRETCH GOAL: At $10,000, we’ll be able to add some things like a stainless steel backing panel and automatic control unit. The backing will make it much easier to clean our cook area. The control unit turns the hood on automatically, making the whole operation safer and more convenient.ULTIMATE STRETCH GOAL: At $13,500 we would be able to cover the cost of what we could call the VENUE PACKAGE. This would include a high-quality video and sound system for all kinds of sporting event performances. It would also allow us to play music in the restaurant in addition to having performers play covers. We believe music is a major part of our culture in Dixon and we want to encourage that!ShirtsThe shirts. OH BOY THE SHIRTS. They are wonderful, high-quality cotton shirts. We chose a simple design to be printed locally by Quick Quality Signs and T's Tee-shirts. The best part is, when you wear your Kick-starter-exclusive t-shirt into the restaurant you'll get 10% off your order for life! You'll be able to pick the shirt up at T.W.S.C. & M. after we open. For you out-of-towners, we realize you likely won't be able to take advantage of the in-store discount that often, so as a consolation we'll ship your shirt to you for free. After the Kick-starter ends we'll be in touch about sizing.Recipe cardGet your very own personalized recipe card from Chef Richard. It will have step-by-step instructions as well as any tips that he may use. Just let the Chef know what you would like, i.e. lunch or dinner entree, a dessert or one of his spice blends.Sausage SausageIn this video you will see Chef Richard make a run of sausage as well as receive a copy of the sausage mix.

From the inception of The World's Sausage Cafe & More in 2013 to our first day at the Farmers Market in May 2014, to now. With opening our own restaurant, the one thing that has remained constant, has been support from our customers, friends, and families. Opening this restaurant has presented its fair share of challenges, but we've always carried on with the simple mission of serving the community we love.As with any construction project, the primary risk or challenge is always the time frame. There have already been a number of setbacks, but we're very close to the end. At this point, if this Kick-starter is fully funded, we plan to open in October!"
https://www.kickstarter.com/projects/hopeswake/read-a-story-for-me?ref=discovery_category_newest,hopeswake/read-a-story-for-me,"Seven Years ago I walked into Beech House Recording Studio in Nashville, TN to do an album. The plan was 8 songs (3 with symphonies composed by me to be performed by members of the Nashville Symphony).We ended up with 22.But there was a problem. My vocals. I couldn’t get them quite right. So I said I’d come back.Then I got the call about my dad.The creative endeavors were put on hold to help him at home. He really wanted to hear them though. Unfortunately he never got to.Nor has anyone else since.Every time I had a studio date set to finish these tracks some strange twist of fate blocked the path. A commercial truck ramming into me, an ulcer, lost voice, you name it.Then a couple of months ago Ian Stahl of Kingsize Soundlabs invited me to their studio. On May 31st I went in.....And the curse was broken!This EP is without a doubt the best creation of my entire life (sorry grandma, it’s not a child). And the best way to cement this feeling is to get it etched in internet stone: with a music video.My last music video (below) was done last minute on absolutely no budget thanks to exceptional and supportive buddies...As a much more experienced filmmaker since then...I wanted to take Read a Story for Me a step further with a more thorough approach. After all, this is seven freaking years in the making.Jake Macpherson - Director of PhotographyKatie Mamie - Production DesignerHelyn Rain - The Woman & My Vocal Partner in Crime in the SongTheo Linder - AD & ProducerAn exceptional director in his own right and an even better human. He's helping me every step of the way with our shotlist, budget, crew, etc.The theme of this Trails for Lost Souls EP is overcoming the loss of loved ones. Not in a sad ""why me"" kind of way, but as a celebration, a reminder to ""keep fighting on.""Read a Story for Me, in particular, is the story of a boy losing his mother, as I lost mine as a child.In honor of her, 50% of my earnings that the music video and this song generates upon release will be donated to the Cancer Research Institute.The music video will star Helyn and I and three other to be named actors. I don't want to give too much of the video away, but like Ron Burgondy before you: you may end up in a glass case of emotion. A more productive one though. Think: Death Cab for Cutie's ""I'll Follow You Into the Dark"" music video, but with warmer moments.The funds raised will go towards paying Helyn and the to be named actors, as well as:- Renting film & lighting equipment.- Paying Jake, Katie, Theo, and the rest of the crew (Camera, lighting, make-up & hair, etc.)- Paying for wardrobe, props, and supplies (the little things make a huge difference)- Paying for post-production services (editing, color correction, sound mixing).- Paying for insurance and permit fees.- Feeding crew & cast.Any pledge funds above and beyond our goal will be put towards feeding your ears further with Hope’s Wake’s full album: Memories.Thank you for taking the time to stop by. The thought alone rocks my world.And since this is a celebration, I've added a few interesting rewards. Join the fun!","The only thing holding us back from creating this video is not reaching our goal here on Kickstarter. Otherwise, my main team is set.

As one who experienced it twice at a young age, I wanted to create and share something to speak to those going through it. And what better way to do that than by creating something that also supports the cause?My last music video (below) was done last minute on absolutely no budget so that I could release it on the one year anniversary of my father's passing. And I couldn't have done it without my exceptional booty kicking buddies Matthew Wozniak and Chaz Moore.While I am proud of what we accomplished, as a much more experienced filmmaker since then....And over 20 years since my mother's passing, I want to do something that speaks to and helps more people.That is why half of every cent that Read a Story for Me makes (including on here) will go to Stand Up 2 Cancer.Jake Macpherson - Director of PhotographyKatie Mamie - Production DesignerTheo Linder - AD & ProducerAn exceptional director in his own right and an even better human.

https://www.kickstarter.com/projects/1119108433/whitehead-ebooks?ref=discovery_category_newest,1119108433/whitehead-ebooks,"About Whitehead EbooksWhitehead Ebooks is our attempt to create an English as a second language book design social enterprise. We are located in NYC, but we want to service the world. We consider our plan to be the ultimate student-centered learning model. We plan to develop ESL books for as many non-native English speakers as we can, but we plan to start in certain countries based on the contact that we have already established with teachers in those places. We want to start in Turkey, Korea, United Arab Emirates and Bronx/ East Harlem, New York to develop our language books for Turkish, Korean, Arabic and Spanish speakers. These are places where we have contacts and/ work experience. First, we plan to partner with schools. In those schools, I want to interview teachers (to learn about their difficulties teaching English and complaints about the materials they are currently using), study the materials they are already using, observe students to learn about their learning/ study habits, issue surveys, learn about the country and culture more extensively. Then to take all that information and work with book developers, graphic artist, teachers, and software developers to create new digital reading material that can help people learn English. I have already started to develop material for Turkish students. I have seven small readers for my Turkish profession series. The books are filled with useful vocabulary. The story-lines come from the region, including places like the famous Topkapi Palace, popular foods and information about relevant topics like the war in Syria. We have developed a comprehensive website that is still being updated but is a good start.www.whiteheadebooks.comWe need more capacity in order to produce more partnerships, reach out to more schools to inform them about our products and to produce more products. It is a long and tasking experience trying to produce, market, interview and build partnerships with just two people. This means adding people to our team, new computers, new software, and a studio to work out of. Access to quality education around the world is limited for those in need, offering only the wealthy the chance to learn in enriching environments. According to the latest UNESCO Education for All report there are 774 million illiterate adults and the number is just as deafening for children. This gap in the educated vs the non-educated significantly accounts for increases inequality, stagnation in development, perpetuation of poverty and ineffectiveness of democracy.Our organization is seeking to challenge those statistics by providing quality education materials for schools. We seek to improve literacy in English by providing educators and students with student- centered English learning materials that integrate culture and technological skills in an innovative approach, revolutionizing the way we teach and learn English.Our products focus on the region and culture acknowledging that “one size does not fit all.” We cater to our constituents by learning about the students through teacher interviews, first hand observations, culture studies, and etc. to create learning materials that are unmatched by other developers.Jenny Abamu is the founder of Whitehead Ebooks has spent years living in many countries and gaining understand about the diverse populations in those places. She also spent years teaching in those countries. Since she was young she has had a fascination with different cultures and has been exploring them first-hand since she was 19 years old. She has been teaching herself coding and digital development since she was 12, coding her first website from scratch. She is now a graduate student of International and Comparative Education at Columbia University in New York City. Here is a piece from her old video blog:","We imagine that it will be hard to build partnerships with schools who do not know our brand and currently work with other producers. That is why we first want to partner with schools, non-profits or other organizations that are in-need. We plan to produce free materials for them with our model and track student use and development for the year. During which time we plan to update materials and showcase results. I think when schools and organizations see our products and results they will start to invite us in.",https://www.kickstarter.com/projects/1119108433/international-education-news?ref=discovery_category_newest,1119108433/international-education-news,"A few colleagues and I have started a small web-based news group called International Education News at www.internationaleducationnews.com.

Also, anyone that donates $100 or more, will be entered into a drawing for the Diamondback binoculars as seen below.Here are some examples of what I will be accomplishing with the Engraving machine.· Engraving shell casings for the families of service members being laid to rest· Plaques for benefits of local and national Veteran organizations· Custom engraving for Veterans and Service members families by request..","The only challenge I foresee is the obvious one of raising the money for the machine, but I feel my biggest risk is not being able to memorialize these heroes for their loved ones to remember.  I want to make a difference in the lives of these families and show them how much their sacrifice means to me and their fellow Americans."

We are not using the money for equipment, but for the actual remodel. The old 2 story garage needs extensive work, from new dry wall and supports, to a new floor on the second level. The building is about 30 years old, and before we bought the property it was used as a storage area and not taken care of properly. It has an area for a bathroom in it, but the fixtures and walls of it have obviously been destroyed by years of neglect.I want to be able to provide people with a chance to feel like the beautiful and wonderful people they are, even if they dont have the money to do so. Since most studios charge hundreds for things like studio settings, senior pictures, and the like, I would like to be able to offer them settings and packages that range in the $20 to $40 range without skipping on the extras of the bigger studios. I take pictures for the love of photography, not for the purpose of making thousands.If you have ever seen a single mother who has 2 children, believes that she is no longer beautiful, doesn't have any pictures of her with her children, and believes she has no worth any more, it is amazing when you take pictures like a professional studio and their eyes light up that they would look so nice, that is what I want for them. I have a lot of the equipment and lights, but I feel so bad when they see the run down studio I have. I would like them to feel like they are going somewhere nice not a rundown building. It changes the whole mood of the photos.The funds are for the materials. I have several people who will do most or all of the work like electrical,plumbing and drywall for little or no money. And I have a person who will do an outside landscaping for just the cost of materials. The biggest cost is fixing the electrical and the plumbing, as well as getting the permits required by the city.Once again, thank you for taking the time to even look over this, and many thanks if you help with this. Even if this doesnt raise enough I will continue to strive little by little to make it happen. But I hope and pray that it does. Thank you.","Permits, material costs, and the city codes are big challenges to the project, as they are mandatory to get the work done. Especially the electrical, which must be done by a professional by city code. But as I have stated before, I am working to make it a reality, just hoping for the help to make it happen quicker rather than a year or two down the road.",https://www.kickstarter.com/projects/677174309/cronas-photography-traveling-the-states?ref=discovery_category_newest,677174309/cronas-photography-traveling-the-states,"Cronas Photography is about taking pictures of real people as they are, not photo shopped versions of them. There have been many people in many different states who have said they would love for me to come and do pictures with them, but as of yet, I don't have the funds to do so.My goal is to travel to at least 10 different states, to take the pictures of the dozens of people who have talked with me and to produce a photo book of these amazing people, complete with a description of them, their reactions to the pictures and the way that I see each of the people. These are people who at times don't see the beauty in themselves, and yet, they are amazing people who don't need the filters and changes of photo shop to show that beauty. They have not had the chance to actually try modeling, as they are not the standard of the normal magazines, but to me they are more than worthy.I hope to be able to do this in the early fall, but that is up to the people who donate to make it possible.","This project has several challenges to it. I have a family to support, which means I have to have the bills covered before I can actually leave and travel. As the plan would require almost a month worth of me not working in order to do so, it means covering the 1800 in bills we have. Add in the amount for things like gas to travel, airfare, and hotel stays, and it is more than I can currently do. But the chance to actually do it and bring not only joy to these people, as well as possibly show the world that people are beautiful without photo shop would be worthwhile to me."

It is not a study of the people, where people do feature, the emphasis will be on their relation to the environment, the latter always dominates those that inhabit it.I am primarily a landscape photographer, the book will consist of approximately 80 monochromes, most of which will be landscapes.  There will be a small bio and intro but text will be minimal.I have already been working on this project for one year. The funds will be used for travel and lodging, but mostly to buy the time to dedicate myself fully to completing the project. By the time my application through Kickstarter is finished I will have completed my exploration of the Southeast. Already I have spent time taking shots in Glen Coe, Snowdonia, London, Essex, Oxford, Cambridge, Sussex, Portsmouth and Kent. Priorities to visit are: Cornwall, Belfast, the Giant's Causeway, Yorkshire, Norfolk, the Lake District, the Isle of Skye and Torridon.

Some money will need to be spent on film and darkroom chemistry, but again the time in which to develop, edit and print is most important. Short of a better suggestion as to how to get sufficient quality monochromes in low volume, I will have to fork out for an inkjet printer with which to produce the book.

All images are handheld and are not in a highly polished or staged style. It is a varied overview and interpretation of the city, and as such does not fit into one particular genre.

I live on a farm my grandparents purchased in 1947.  I was taught by my grandparents and mom how to plant seeds, grow a garden and live off the land. I grow my own items to design eco friendly jewelry.  Once the potatoes are dried and cured, they will not rot or mold.  By combining design and fashion, you are teaching others about preserving earth and recycling items, thus no waste.We support Samaritan's Purse International Relief.Families that live off the land are particularly vulnerable to floods, drought, or conflict that can destroy crops or force people from their homes. Samaritan’s Purse works in displacement camps around the world, distributing food staples to hungry families.

Anyone over 18 basically, maybe not those of a nervousdisposition, so maybe if your granis a bit prudish, don't give her it for Christmas).Yes I am using my cleavage to fund the book, it might star in the book at some points but the real stars are the sex toys from around the world.WHY SO MUCH FOR SEX TOYS?Have you ever tried to buy the weird and wonderful sex toys? I have. I love sex toys and already have quite the collection (my partner keeps tripping over them) but when ordering from China or where ever you need to buy in bulk to compensate for the postage, packing and tax. Plus the more exclusive sex toys do cost quite a bit. Of course I will get things as cheap as I can, as I do love a bargain, but sometimes there is a very select number of retailers that cater for the more adventurous.I would also publish a very limited number of hard copies of the book and see how they sell and maybe go into a more mass production.A rough breakdown of cost would be:£1500-£2000 Sex Toys (Some of the ideas I have would include ALOT of toys, will upload an example soon)£500 Photography£750 - £1000 PublishingWHY ME?Did I mention I love sex toys?

https://www.kickstarter.com/projects/2114365821/tropical-noir?ref=discovery_category_newest,2114365821/tropical-noir,"The ProjectTropical Noir is a photographic exploration of nocturnal urban and suburban spaces in Puerto Rico. The project integrates traditional analog photographic methodology with contemporary digital techniques. The specific focus of the work will be to build a visual experience that reveals an underworld where social and geographical elements coexist in dramatic scenes. The project is divided into three stages: The first, and most important, focuses in Puerto Rico. The second and third stages will incorporate The Dominican Republic and Cuba respectively in the coming years. The title of this project refers to the cinema gender Film Noir or "" black cinema "" of the '40s and '50s. This type of cinema is defined by its dark content both thematically and visually.  This style has been adopted by some filmmakers and to a lesser extent, expressive photographers and artists in recent decades. It is precisely this ability of the photographic medium to dramatize spaces and people that inspires and guides the development of this project. The central thematic focus of the work will concentrate on revealing sociological aspects of Puerto Rican society. The decline and transformation of urban and suburban spaces and its subliminal anxiety are urgent concepts perfectly fitted to the interpretation and scrutiny of the photographic medium. The popular photographic representation of Puerto Rico and the Caribbean is generally composed of easily recognizable elements. Our collective relationship with this these images is one of immediate familiarity. It is a visual language where bright daylight, primary colors and sandy beaches predominate and is commonly accepted as the ultimate tropical reality. With Tropical Noir, I aim to reveal and re-interpret this very familiar geography by utilizing the night and the properties ofartificial lighting as dramatic elements.  More than a dramatization of a collective space, is an exploration of Puerto Ricans and their symbiotic relationship with their environment. The night of the “island-universe” provides us with heightened perception of reality. It is a world of subjective nature that reveals itself subtlety. It is also, sometimes subversive and full of a mysterious essence.  That frugal brevity has sometimes been difficult to capture and reveal using non-digital digital techniques.  Traditionally, I have used a contemplative approach and methodology in my work by using the large format film camera. The physical nature of the 8x10 format requires the photographer to carefully compose and to ""imagine"" the final picture. It is an instrument that requires patience and pre - visualization. By contrast, digital technology frees us to take pictures with complete abandon. However, some of the advantages that the digital medium offers is the ease of use and its ability to operate in low light levels. For this project I have chosen to utilize digital technology but integrated into my classic large format cameraphilosophy and methodology. This project also gives me the opportunity to integrate the element of color for the first time in my work. MethodologyThe sheer number and variety of sourcesof light in public spaces impart theatrical qualities that will be central inthe final pieces. However, I will also exert color control using additionallight sources. In a way, the construction of each piece carries a methodologyreminiscent of a film set. To achieve visual uniformity, I will be also limitedto a specific visual range. I will be utilizing fixed focal lenses on the 35mmand 50mm range, allowing me to work in a more organic manner. Thisprocess is a slow and meticulous one which requires hours of pre -visualization, planning and execution. To preserve image quality it will benecessary to push the limits of digital technology using long exposures and lowlight sensitivity settings. This technical approach not only ensures arich final color saturation, contrast and definition in the final print, but italso affects the relationship between the photographer and the subject matter.Finally, by adopting this slow photography processes, I am consciouslyestablishing a direct and emotional connection with a photographic traditionwhile simultaneously re- defining it. Thedevelopment phase will last one month and will cover all aspects ofitineraries, technical tests, relationship with the photo printing lab andcollaborative staff outsourcing. I will also explore and choose the maingeographical areas where the pieces will be executed. The nature of thisproject requires a close relationship with the photo lab responsible for thefinal prints. This is perhaps one of the most important aspects in the processof creating the work. It's an ongoing relationship through all phases of theproject. This process begins with the initial production of work prints, whichwill become a guide to the most effective way to reproduce color and the choiceof scale for each final piece. Theproduction phase will last three months. Tropical Noir will includelocations around the entire island but ultimately will maintain a creativebalance between urban and suburban areas. A necessity that governs the creationof each piece requires the use of a tripod and the video monitor. I willalso utilize continuous lighting sources such as halogen film lights on variouscontrolled situations. To this end, I will employ the services of agaffer or motion picture lighting technician. In other words, the processof transportation and production will be slow, sometimes requiring meticulouscollaboration. The final edition will consist of 50-60 pieces with printsizes of 24” and 44” wide. I will be utilizing a 22MP DSLR to produce smallerpanoramic images, and a medium format film camera for single larger prints.The final photographs will be exhibited at a gallery in San Juan, Puerto Rico.There will also be an accompanying book with reproductions of the photographswhich will be available through Blurb.Where will the money go?TransportationI will be covering large areas within and outside the SanJuan metropolitan area.This willrequire expenses in gas, car maintenance and food.Security and AssistantsThere will be times when I will be shooting around areasthat are not that safe. On thosedays I will need to hire the services of a security professional. Having an assistant throughout theentire shooting process will be essential due to the amount of equipment thathas to be handled.FilmMany of the images will be shot on medium format film toallow for better 44” enlargements.The cost of film stock and processing is high these days.There is also the added necessity toship the film to New York because of the lack of photo labs in Puerto Rico thatcan handle film.Gaffer or Lighting technicianOn specific situations I will require the servicesof a professional gaffer who will provide me with the ability to control the lighting designof a particular scene.Thisservice will be used only on very special occasions.PrintingThis is probably one of the most crucial elements of thisproject.For Tropical Noir I willbe producing large exhibition quality prints from hefty digital files.The price for each final print will beconsiderable.Exhibition and BookThere will be a gallery fee for the overall handling and setup of the final show.I will alsohave several limited edition books made to accompany the exhibition.","This is a project that will require long working hours at night. It will also require constant traveling around the country during extended periods.  There is always the danger of being involved in an accident or being at the wrong place at the wrong time.  However, I believe that through careful planning and effective communication, most potential problems can be avoided.

A necessity that governs the creation of each piece requires the use of a tripod and the video monitor. I will also utilize continuous lighting sources such as halogen film lights on various controlled situations. To this end, I will employ the services of a gaffer or motion picture lighting technician. In other words, the process of transportation and production will be slow, sometimes requiring meticulous collaboration. The final edition will consist of 50-60 pieces with print sizes of 24” and 44” wide. I will be utilizing a 22MP DSLR to produce smaller panoramic images, and a medium format film camera for single larger prints. The final photographs will be exhibited at a gallery in San Juan, Puerto Rico. There will also be an accompanying book with reproductions of the photographs which will be available through Blurb.Where will the money go?TransportationI will be covering large areas within and outside the San Juan metropolitan area as well as rural parts of Puerto Rico. This will require expenses in gas, car maintenance and food. I will also be traveling to Havana,Port-au-Prince and Santo Domingo for one to two week stays. This will require additional airfare, accommodations and meals.Security and AssistantsThere will be times when I will be shooting around areas that are not that safe. On those days I will need to hire the services of a security professional. Having an assistant throughout the entire shooting process will be essential due to the amount of equipment that has to be handled.Gaffer or Lighting technicianOn specific situations I will require the services of a professional gaffer who will provide me with the ability to control the lighting design of a particular scene.This service will be used only on very special occasions.PrintingThis is probably one of the most crucial elements of this project.For Tropical Noir I will be producing large exhibition quality prints from hefty digital files.The price for each final print will be considerable.Exhibition and BookThere will be a gallery fee for the overall handling and set up of the final show.I will also have several limited edition books made to accompany the exhibition.ElProyectoTropical Noir es unaexploración fotográfica de los espacios urbanos y suburbanos nocturnos enPuerto Rico y el Caribe. Elproyecto integra la metodología análoga tradicional con técnicas digitalescontemporáneas. El enfoqueespecifico de la obra será la de construir una experiencia visual que revele unsubmundo en donde los elementos sociales y geográficos coexistan en un mismoescenario dramático. El proyectoesta dividido en tres etapas: laprimera, y mas importante, seconcentra en Puerto Rico. La segunday tercera etapa incorporarán a La República Dominicana, Haiti y Cubarespectivamente en los próximos años.El titulo de este proyectofotográfico hace alusión al genero cinematográfico Film Noir o “cine negro” delos años 40 y 50. Este tipode cine se definía por su contenido oscuro tanto temático como visual. Tambiénempleaba la iluminación de claroscuro la cual hizo a este genero universalmentereconocible. Este estilo ha sidoadoptado por algunos cineastas y, en menor grado, por artistas fotógrafosexpresivos en las ultimas décadas.Es precisamente esta capacidad para representar dramáticamente losespacios y personas, el que inspira y guiara el desarrollo de esteproyecto. El foco temático centralde la obra se concentrará en revelar aspectos sociológicos de la sociedadpuertorriqueña. La decadencia ytransformación urbana así como la ansiedad suburbana son conceptos urgentes yque perfectamente se acomodan a la interpretación y escrutinio del mediofotográfico. Estaelucidación se lograra a través de la construcción escénica fotográfica. De este modo, cada pieza se convierteen una viñeta que funcionara, dentro de la totalidad de la obra, como unaescena mas en una película. La representación fotográficade Puerto Rico y el Caribe generalmente se compone de elementos familiares ysencillamente reconocibles.Nuestra relación colectiva con este lenguaje es una de inmediato entendimiento. Es un lenguaje donde predominan la luzdiurna, los colores primarios y una geografía rural y urbana comúnmenteentendida. Con Tropical Noir, elartista se propone revelar y re-interpretar esta misma geografía familiar pero utilizandola luz artificial urbana y suburbana como elementos dramáticos. Mas que una dramatización del espaciocolectivo isleño, es una exploración del puertorriqueño y su relaciónsimbiótica con su medio ambiente.El universo nocturno de la islanos permite una percepción alterna. Es un mundo de una naturaleza subjetiva y reveladora. Es también, a veces subversiva ymisteriosa en esencia. Esafugacidad ha sido a veces difícil de captar y revelar utilizando materiales yfrugales técnicas digitales. Tradicionalmente este artista ha utilizado un acercamiento ymetodología contemplativa empleando la cámara análoga de largo formato. La naturaleza física del formato 8x10obliga al fotógrafo a observar e imaginar. Es un instrumento que demanda paciencia ypre-visualisacion. Por elcontrario, la tecnología digital nos libera y nos permite tomar fotografías concompleto abandono. Sin embargo,unas de las ventajas que el medio digital ofrece es la sencillez de uso y sucapacidad para operar en niveles bajos de iluminación. Para este proyecto el artista utilizaraesta tecnología digital pero integrada a la filosofía y metodología clásica dellargo formato. Este proyectotambién le ofrece al artista la oportunidad de integrar el elemento del colorpor primera vez en su trabajo. Lagran cantidad y variedad de Fuentes de luz en los espacios publicos le impartena estos unas cualidades teatrales que serán un elemento central en las piezasfinales. Sin embargo, el artistatambién ejercerá un control de color mediante la utilización de fuentes deiluminación alternas. En ciertomodo, la construcción de cada pieza conlleva una metodología reminiscente a unset cinematográfico. Para lograrun efecto de uniformidad visual, el fotógrafo también se limitara a un alcancevisual especifico. El artistautilizara lentes fijos de 35mm y 50mm exclusivamente lo que le permitirátrabajar de una manera mas orgánica. Este proceso será uno lento y meticuloso el cualrequiere horas de pre-visualisacion, montaje y ejecución. Para preservar una calidad de imagenserá necesario empujar los limites de la tecnología digital utilizando largasexposiciones y sensibilidades de luz bajas. Esta forma de trabajo no solamente asegurara unas piezasfinales ricas en saturación, contraste y definición, si no que tambiénafectaran la relación del fotógrafo con los espacios. Finalmente, al adoptarlos procesos lentos de la fotografía clásica analoga el artista establecerá unaconexión directa con la tradición del medio y tratará de re-definirlo.El proceso de ejecución de laobra se dividirá en tres faces: Una fase inicial de desarrollo, una segundafase de producción y una final de post-produccion y exhibición. La fase de desarrollo tendrá una duraciónde dos meses y cubrirá todos los aspectos de preparación de itinerarios,pruebas técnicas, relación con el laboratorio fotográfico y subcontratación delpersonal colaborativo. Es en estaetapa donde se conducirán las pruebas técnicas iniciales que indicaran lascapacidades y limites del equipo fotográfico y proveerán un índice general parala iluminación y exposición.También se exploraran y escogerán las localidades principales donde seejecutaran las piezas. Ademas, secreara un itinerario detallado de producción que incluirá las fechas ylocalidades especificas de trabajo.La naturaleza de este proyecto requiere una relación estrecha con ellaboratorio fotográfico responsable de imprimir las piezas finales. Este es quizás uno de los aspectos masimportantes en el proceso de la creación de la obra. Es una relación continua a traves de todas las faces delproyecto. Este proceso comienzacon las pruebas iniciales de imprenta, donde se decidirá el modo mas efectivode reproducir la paleta de colores escogida por el artista y la escala final decada pieza. Este desarrolloculmina cuando el artista revisa y aprueba las fotografías finales para laexhibición. Finalmente, seidentificaran aquellas situaciones dentro de la etapa de producción quenecesiten la contratación de personal especializado.La fase de producción tendráuna duración de ocho meses. Esdurante este tiempo que se crearan las piezas individuales en localidadespredeterminadas, y en ocasiones, casualmente encontradas durante el proceso detransportación. Tropical Noir incluirálocalidades alrededor de la isla pero tratara de mantener un balance creativoentre lo urbano y lo suburbano.Una necesidad que rige la creación de cada pieza requiere la utilizacióndel trípode y el monitor de video.En algunas ocasiones se utilizaran bancos de iluminación fílmica detungsteno. En otras palabras, elproceso de transportación, colocación y ejecución será uno lento y meticulosoque en ocasiones requerirá colaboración.Semanalmente se crearan alrededor de 20 imágenes para un total aproximadode 650 a 700 fotos. La ediciónfinal se compondrá de 50 a 60 piezas con una dimensión de aproximadamente 40por 60 pulgadas. El proyecto sedocumentará en su totalidad poruna unidad de video que producirá un “making of” el cual podrá utilizarse parapropósitos promocionales y/o formar parte de la exhibición.La fase de post-produccion yexhibición tendrá una duración de dos meses. Durante este periodo se editará la obra en su formafinal. Una vez escogidas ysecuenciadas, las imágenes finales se someterán a un proceso de preparaciónpara ser impresas. Esto incluirála corrección de color, contraste y conformación de las dimensiones aescala. Finalmente el artistaaprobara la edición final de prints fotográficos que se presentaran en la exhibición. Uno de los propósitos finales delartista es la de producir una publicación del proyecto en edición limitada. La viabilidad y éxito de esteproyecto dependerá en gran parte de la colaboración con personal técnico y deapoyo estratégico. Las áreas masimportantes en el proceso diario de producción serán la transportación y eltrabajo del luminotécnico o “gaffer”.Este tendrá la tarea de interpretar el concepto de la pieza e iluminaraefectivamente con supervision del artista. Ademas se utilizaran ayudantes de cámara y de producción enocasiones que sean necesarias. Loscinematógrafos Nickolas Rossi y Karlo Ramos estarán a cargo de la filmación delvideo documental del proyecto en distintas etapas.Es un momento crucial para lafotografía. Los adelantostecnológicos en el medio han permitido su accesibilidad y uso. Sin embargo, este mismo acceso hacausado una continua proliferación y saturación de imágenes en los espaciossociales nunca antes concebidos.La fotografía digital ha creado una segunda revolución democrática querivaliza a la que Kodak creo cuando introdujo la cámara Brownie a las masas enel año 1900. Este fenómeno hamotivado a los artistas de la fotografía a re-inventar el medio y su lenguaje. Con este proyecto el artista busca estableceruna directa conexión con el pasado fotográfico al re visitar las técnicasclásicas y simples del medio.Finalmente, mediante esteacercamiento, el artista aspira a descubrir nuevas posibilidades que continúendesarrollando su voz individual como autor dentro de un medio igualitario. El proyecto ambiciona a inspirar aotros artistas y motivar a la audiencia en general a reflexionar sobre lasposibilidades creativas en un nuevo mundo renacentista. Este universo es uno que pertenece, masque nunca antes, a aquellos que entienden el poder de las ideas dentro de unmedio dominado por la tecnología. Tropical Noir representa elpróximo nivel en la evolución estética y temática del autor. Es con este proyecto donde el artistafinalmente sintetiza sus influencias mas relevantes. La importancia de este proyecto es también de carácterprofundo dentro una carrera que manifiesta la relación emocional del artistacon Puerto Rico. Finalmente, esteproyecto marcara una definitiva ruptura con el estilo tradicional del artistahacia uno mas conceptual.","This is a project that will require long working hours at night. It will also require constant traveling around the country during extended periods. There is always the danger of being involved in an accident or being at the wrong place at the wrong time. However, I believe that through careful planning and effective communication, most potential problems can be avoided. Because of the inherent complexity and time consuming nature of this project, it will be a challenging task meeting deadlines on an exact date. I will be posting weekly updates of the development of the project on my website."

How it got in my pajamas I'll never know.” ― Groucho Marx    Stand-UpNeurotica´s unique concept relies on both the chemistry and relationships betweenthe characters, and on the novelty of different comedians starring in eachepisode. The show is currently written as an ""Adult Comedy"" to beaired on a cable network (HBO, SHO, Netflix, Amazon Prime etc.) The showfeatures cursing, vile humor, freedom for each comedian's act and, of course,the occasional hot ""sexual content."" This show will blow yourneurotic mind! Actorschosen will contribute to the show, the final version, the comictiming,through rehearsal and improvisation.The show will be filmed in classicsitcom style, in front of a live audience to create the energy that only a liveperformance can bring. The idea is to film the pilot in a small theater withseveral ""performances"". The best parts of the each performance can beedited together to make an excellent pilot episode.    Now, with a show with this much potential, we need a pilot that oozes with professionalism. From what I have researched, $50,000 is a good goal number. With this amount (or more) a true performance can be put on, a comic can be paid, and a wonderful pilot can be produced.The plots and subplots revolve around the central characters, the employees of a comedy club. The six of them have become close friends. Other characters may include the club's audience members, family members and passing relationships. A comedian would ‘guest star’ each episode and get a five to seven-minute time slot during which they perform their act. However, no matter how famous the comedian, on the show, he or she is depicted as an up-and-coming performer.SettingClub Neurotica is a small, average-looking comedy club in the West Village of New York City. An outside similar to surrounding clubs: walls with peeling posters of adverts, a display case showcasing the upcoming performance, well-worn windows and doors, on a busy city corner. Inside, there is a long bar along one wall, a stage across the room, and about 20 tables scattered around the room. The décor is understated -- posters, candles on tables, a beat-up wood floor and a tin ceiling.Characters:Seth Stevenson: (34) The manager of the club. He is decent-looking, not model-like. He enjoys his work and chasing women. Seth always seems to be nervous, as though he has forgotten something. He hopes to find the love he once shared with his ex-wife, Julia, for whom he still has feelings. He was devastated when Julia left him after she had an affair with a woman. Their break-up is fresh, under a year, yet they are healed enough to lust after others.Julia O'Malley : (32)- Owner of the club and Seth’s ex-wife. Her beauty is a very natural one. Raised in Manhattan, she attended tony prep schools. She is used to getting what she wants, and likes the finer things in life – upscale mani-pedis, up-to-the-minute fashions, and whatever the New York Styles section touts as “in”. Julia follows the latest in pricy wellness fads—she is currently in the midst of another $350 juice cleanse and recommends it to everyone.    Julia’s parents purchased the club when Julia married Seth, who had already been managing the place for eight years. This, Julia thought, would bring them closer together, but it has created and continues to cause friction between them. She knows little about the business of the club but she insists on being involved.Nella Petrini – (48) Nella is short and voluptuous. She is an Italian firecracker; loud, crass, vulgar and honest to a fault. Her look and attitude are evocative of a “mafia wife.” Nobody messes with Nella. She is also intelligent and flirtatious (with special attention to Jaime).  Later, we come to find out that Nella is married, has a son and older daughter, but she is very guarded about her private life and offers few details. She jokes about the ""wise guys"" from the Arthur Avenue section of the Bronx. (i.e. ""That guy should watch it or he'll end up in a fucking freezer. Of course, we'd need a huge freezer for that fat fuck."", etc.) However, none of her comments make any reference to actual family and friends, so we are left to wonder.  Additionally, she had dreams of having a family, dreams she thought were coming true when she married her college sweetheart. She put off going to law school and had two children with him. But her marriage fell apart due to his drug addiction and his enabling parents. Now she is a single mother with mountains of debt. She is attending law school (CUNY) part-time during the day. Her concentration is in family law, for which she now has a lot of personal experience. Whew!This ""kickstarter"" for the sitcom pilot Stand-Up Neurotica is the culmination of a dream I have had for many years. I came up with this concept almost 20 years ago and now I am hoping for ""crowd funding"" which, for those of you who don't know, is a way for lots of people to sponsor a big idea and help it come to fruition. So I am hoping YOU, or maybe people you know, may want to be a part of this. Even a few dollars counts! You will NOT get charged unless I reach my goal of $50,000 in 30 days. But NOW is a crucial time. Most projects that succeed get many sponsors within the first week! Then others are more apt to follow. I know I am dreaming big here...

https://www.kickstarter.com/projects/1866188127/limitless-0?ref=discovery_category_newest,1866188127/limitless-0,"The idea behind Limitless came to us when we saw a need for a high quality CNC that was smaller in size, but not small in features. We then also saw the capabilities of the 3D printer and how rapidly it is becoming a standard part of engineering tools. Then we thought, let’s put the two together. Behold, Limitless was born.Limitless is a revolutionary new automated multi-tool. With Limitless, projects and ideas can be brought to life using one of many methods. Inventors and engineers can bring projects to life using the milling machine, 3D printer and other tools we plan to add such as a laser cutter. Limitless is a dynamic platform which is always changing to suit the needs of its users.Unlike all other personal platforms, Limitless uses a robust controller, similar to the ones found in industrial machines. We do not use all-in-one controllers for our automation. Each one of our large stepper motors has its own motor driver with separate power supply. We also provide the largest work space out of any other brand! With a gantry clearance of 14 inches and a table size of 23.5 x 33 inches, we are the largest, most versatile CNC combo tool one can buy!We didn’t like that all small CNC machines and small 3D printers used all in one stepper drivers/controllers to save money. These type of controllers are limited on feature and upgradeability. Limitless uses a high quality state of the art controller that is user configurable. Not all the inputs and outputs are being used on the controller, which allows for a lot of flexibility for the user.          Pictured, Limitless’s ControllerWith Limitless real prototypes can be produced! Since we have such a large work area, projects often do not need to be scaled down. By upgrading to our 6 axis controller, a lathe option can be added as well, adding even more versatility to the platform. Also, all of our tools (Spindle, 3D printer and potentially a laser) are always installed on the “Z” axis, so there is no need to swap out tool heads. You just choose the profile you plan on using then, you are good to go!Limitless comes with a spindle vs a router. The main difference between the two is, a spindle has a variable speed control. A router is fixed and usually has a slower rpm. With a spindle you have more control over the speed at which material can be cut and a much higher rpm can be achieved as well. Currently Limitless has a spindle with an rpm of 16,000. The other thing I really like about spindles are, they're very quiet. Spindles are usually found on higher quality machines, as they require a controller and usually cost more. Spindles are standard on our systems. We also include a semi-auto zero on our systems as well. What does this mean? When you have to change tools on the spindle, you simply put the next cutter to be used in the collet, set the zero plate on top of the material to be cut and click the auto zero button on the screen. The machine will touch the zero plate and enter the values in the software automatically.Another great thing about a CNC machine is its versatility. We often find ourselves needing to cut gaskets. Sure we could buy a laser cutter, or maybe a water jet. But that would be expensive! A better option is to buy a drag knife. A drag knife is simply another tool that is inserted into the collet of the spindle. With a drag knife many types of material can be cut and offers another use for the machine. Other things a CNC is commonly used for is, printed circuit board making, engraving glass and embossing.Limitless will eventually be configured to have multiple extruders. Currently it comes with one extruder, however, the plan is to have four to six, depending on customer’s needs. We also have our own extruder that is in development. With our new style extruder, many types of material will be able to be extruded. Such as HDPE, PVC, PVD and polypropylene. With these materials, much tougher prototypes can be made. Also this new extruder will use powder or granules instead of filament rolls. This means that any prototypes that get scrapped can easily be ground down and immediately be used again with little effort.  Currently, we are using a standard extruder which operates on 24 volts.Another issue we saw with the 3D printers is the filament storage and how the filament can get tangled while the machine is working. To solve this, we simply made Limitless strong enough to carry its filament around where ever it is working. Limitless has storage enough for 4 - three pound rolls or many smaller rolls. This also means, when the multi-extruder option is available, there is no need to worry about where to put the extra rolls of filament.Limitless does not come with a heated bed, but is instead offered as an option. We are trying to keep the price for this high quality machine as low as we can, so we offer the heated bed separately. We feel that some customers may want to buy their own and this may allow for a cost savings. However we offer a heated bed for Limitless, but at an additional cost of $400. Our heated bed is a seamless 24” x 24”, very high quality bed. It is made from heated silicon, G-10 and aluminum.  Shown below unfinished.With Limitless, you get many features that would be considered extra in other table top machines. We offer an extra high gantry (about 14 inches), semi-auto zero, vacuum control, regulated compressed air (controlled by Limitless), automatic spindle control and a large work space (23.5 x 20 inches workable), plus many others. 	Below, we have many pictures for you viewing pleasure.        ","We don’t feel there are any risks to this project, however it is a challenging project. The main thing we would like to continue to improve on is intergrading the milling side of the platform to work better with the 3D printing side of the platform. Also, we would like to instigate further development of the 3D printing software for tool path technologies. Let’s not forget that this is a dynamic platform and we are going to be adding a laser cutter and multiple extrudes to the mix in the near future.",https://www.kickstarter.com/projects/1866188127/collideoscope-multi-filament-3d-print-head?ref=discovery_category_newest,1866188127/collideoscope-multi-filament-3d-print-head,"See a higher quality video at: https://youtu.be/ippN1qqscwQSkip to see CollideOScope in action:https://youtu.be/0uUViCEo0Ns Advanced Automated Multi-Tools is a maker of combination 3D printers, 3D clay printing, laser and milling machines. Hence the name, Automated Multi-Tools. In our endeavor to continuously fit more tools on our machines, it was brought to our attention that we needed to save space. Most of our clients want to be able to 3D print with multiple filaments, for color and material purposes. 3D print heads can take up a lot of space, so instead of having multiple print heads, we thought, what if we could have one print head that was able to use multiple sources of filament. This is how CollideOScope was born.     We call it the CollideOScope because it is a collision of multiple colors and materials. From concept to working product was quite the challenge, but once accomplished, its simplicity was as brilliant as its appearance. Shown here is the CollideOScope with our hot end installed.The current version is for 1.75mm Filament and comes with a .3 mm nozzle.The weight of the aluminum version is 272g without the hot end installed. The plastic version will way about 50g without the hot end installed (plastic version to release at a later date). See dimensions below.The CollideOScope is made from one piece of aluminum and comes with our own specially designed hot end.Pictured here, is the multiplexer installed on one of our test machines. As you can see it is a very simple device. How does it work? It uses 7 push motors multiplexed to one motor driver. With some minor connection and changes to your coding script, you will be able to interact with our device. Although there are 7 filament slots, this does not mean you have to use them all. However, they are there when you need them.So where are we at now? We are currently in the final test phase. We have been working with the software to make sure that when the product releases, we will be able to send proper instructions so that setup is hassle free. We are testing this new product with Simplify3D’s software, so anyone using this software will be at an advantage. We also plan on setting up a website so that people will have a place to view all our products and keep up to date with products that have been released. 	On top of developing the CollideOScope filament multiplexer, we have been working with Newfangled Solutions to develop a version of Mach4 that will easily turn any milling machine into a 3D printer.Mach4 is a customizable CNC motion controller interface.  Those familiar with Mach4 will be able to just create a new profile and be able to switch from mill to 3D printer at the click of a button. This provided, all the hardware is in place. This version of Mach4 will be available from our website, which is in the process of being completed.Included in this version of Mach4 will be the ability to multiplex motor drives. What this means is, a single motor driver could be used to drive many different motors. This is the basis of how the CollideOscope works on our Limitless Automated Multi-tools. ","The biggest challenge for us was the software. With the help of the people at Simplify3D, we were able to overcome all the obstacles that came our way. There will always be some process issues as every multi-colored 3D print is different. Different prints have different issues that have to be sorted out. We think it will be interesting to see how people will use our product.  All in all, software was our biggest challenge, however with the team from Newfangled Solutions and Simplify3D along with our engineering team, we overcame the big obstacles and made a complex situation very simple."

Hawaii is the gateway to Asia. And I will take you there through my lens. Volume 1 will be ""Exploring Oahu, People Culture and Landscapes"". Volume 2 will be decided upon the successes of volume 1.I have hiked walked, motor biked, taken trains, taxi's, tuk tuks, motorized tricycles, cyclos and boats. I even rode a horse which I found out I am not really good at.Been nearly bitten by a snake (Philippines), bitten by a monkey (Vietnam) and just plain got lost! (Cambodia) just to get that Images you will see. I love what I do, and would would like to share my visions. And further, have the world enjoy the beauty of the unique scenery Hawaii and Southeast Asia.With over 900 quality images so far and still going, it is going to be hard to really choose the ""best"" for my volume 1. Every photo tells a wonderful story,which I will author along with the photograph. I have invested countless time and effort to have now what I possess, and what I will continue to get. My goal is to publish and have people around the world not only enjoy my photography but enjoy the countries they come from. Book format will be hard bound. The fund raising isfor the publishing andequipment to finish the project. I finance my own travels ( I need to visit 2 more places), so there IS effort and time on my part. :-) of course. I Just need a little ""kickstart"" to complete the project.The book:My intent is to have the first limited edition printed between 50-150 copies initially. The book will include, but not limited to, a short introduction section that will be presented at the beginning of the book. a showcase of around100+ never-published-before images with the story and location.

This show will encourage and promote unity (through dance), no matter your race, religion, ethnicity, or native origin.We created this fundraiser for everyone to provide the best promotions we can offer along with deals to attend the show, and free merchandise as well. We hope to see you at the show, and even get to meet, and learn more about our donors!Your donation means the world to us, as it will assist us in uniting the different cultures that make up this melting pot called America. Our first show was a great hit in Saint Louis Park, Minnesota, and we are hoping to raise money to tour not just the state of Minnesota but other states as well. Our first location we want to kick off the next show will be Minneapolis, and our goal is to travel the Midwest, stopping at cities mentioned in the video above, along with Manhattan, NY, and LA, California. Thank you for supporting our cause, and fueling these passionate dancers’ goals!","Because this performance involves 40 dancers and life happens, we have to expect sickness or injuries to occur so we will hire understudies to take over various roles as needed. We may also have to rent sound equipment and lighting if the performance venue's equipment is lacking.Flooring is also important, to avoid injuries to our dancers we make have to rent and install a portable floor.The stage set up for a performance like this can take as much as 3 days so we might have to pay the set builders extra for working overnight."

As I matured, I grew increasingly interested in comics and manga and always wondered if I could blend the two together somehow. Seamlessly. With Crystal Story, I think I was able to.  Crystal Story started out as a passion project. I set out to create a world where the reader could turn into the main character. Inspired by The Legend of Zelda series, the MOTHER series, and Final Fantasy, as well as an art style influenced by the works ofShotaro Ishinomori,Yoichi Kotabe,Bryan Lee O'Malley, andBenimaru Itoh, the world of Crystal Story began taking shape. It grew and consumed elements of the things I loved and felt familiar with, but kept itself original. Its own world. Its own adventure. Four years later, its fanbase, while small, has been immensely dedicated. As the story progressed past the first episode (Crystal Story: Dawn of the Knight), it seemed like the right time to create something special for the people who’ve been there since its inception, as well as newcomers to the series, which is why I created the concept of the Special Editions.Crystal Story is not a traditional comic, in the sense that you’re not just reading a story. It’s designed to be more immersive to where you feel like you’re part of the long haul with everyone inside it, borrowing RPG elements like Hit Point counters (or HP, if you’re savvy), Magic Points for spell casting (MP), a leveling system and even new abilities to be learned.You! Yes, you! You take the role of Mina Mahaulu, an aspiring freelance adventurer.On the inside, Mina is half Human and halfFireEsper.True Espers have infinite MP because their hearts are made entirely ofelemental gems calledCrystallicite. Depending on what element their Crystallicite is atoned to, they can limitlessly conjureand manipulate those elements as magic spells.Since Mina is only half Esper though, her abilities are somewhat “nerfed” and she becomes easily exhausted if she overuses them, so she has to come up with creative ways to make do. A good, pointy blade helps a lot!In the world of Rydia, Mina must traverse the lands of Falsung and Norsung to find, collect, and combine four crystal shards in order to seal away Termina, a colossal demon that threatens unknown horrors once fully revived. Mina must learn new abilities and master ancient weaponry to defeat the beast! Grow and become strong with Mina, while taking on evil enemies, badass bosses, and dangerous dungeons!Short answer – No, It’s not a real game, psyche! The Special Editions of the comic are meant to be an awesome companion piece to the book. They’re a bit of loot to help enrich your experience the comic and are essentially collectables. The end goal of this Kickstarter campaign is to raise $20K to manufacture at least 1000 copies of the complete Crystal Story: Dawn of the Knight - Special Edition set.For a long time, I struggled with an idea on how to distribute Crystal Story in physical format. I knew from the start that I didn’t just want to print a book and call it a day. Since it’s a comic that reads like a game (or is it a game that plays like a comic?), packaging it like one sounded perfect. An excellent way to kickstart the experience for someone checking out the comic for the first time, or for endearing fans wanting to have something they can hold onto.  There was a certain magic to opening up a new game in the past that is lost nowadays. I wanted to bring some of that magic back with the Special Edition sets. Since the series is inspired by games mostly from the SNES era, having it in an SNES-themed package seemed like the only right thing to do – all the fun and charm of unboxing a classic without having to pay a ridiculous premium.  The process that went into making these was a huge learning experience for me, but the design of the packaging received a lot of love because of it. I designed it to be as true-to-life as possible, while still being a joy to unbox and display.  Uncle Tusk is an awesome dude who re-creates and prints retro game boxes, manuals, labels, etc. You name it.

Our beta website can be found here https://www.brasskangaroo.com/We also have a brasskangaroo blog where we are updating our users with progress and website developments.I've had previous experience and exposure to this area in the past, I ran a website called Article Alley which was very popular in the period 2006-2010 but was hard hit when Google launched their Panda Algorithm update, the issue site with that site was that it used a concept called Article Marketing which meant re-using the same content over and over again on many different sites. The lesson I learnt from that experience was to make a success in the future you need to focus on higher quality - both in terms of the quality of the content that makes up the site and the links from other sites back to it, which are known as backlinks.My intention with this new site is just that, to focus on a very high standard of editorial content and build links from only very well respected sites. All this of course takes time and dedication.

Customer lists what they are looking for anonymously.  They can be specific or vague.2.	Applicable merchants receive a notification to review and respond with their proposal and bid ($). 3.	Customer selects the winning bidder.4.	Winning merchant gets to see the customer’s contact information and can then reach out to complete the transaction.Well that was easy…what else?•	Flexible personal bidding platform almost ready for launch•	Patent Pending•	Over a year in the making•	Starting Categories:  Cars and Vacations•	More Categories can be easily be added with agility and without writing code•	Funding is needed to complete the marketing, advertising components, as well as a few minor enhancements to streamline user experience.All great things start simpleThis platform was built to solve a problem.  I was tired of constantly doing all the research and spending hours online and then even more time calling and contacting different merchants/retailers/wholesalers to try get the best price.  I didn’t think it was fair for me to invest all this time and then for the merchant to get the business/commissions/etc.  So, this is how the idea was born.  Don’t let the user interface and the simplicity trick you.  Under the hood, there are tons of complex rules and features to make things easy for all.  	Initial launch and then what?  The funding is needed to complete the initial launch and advertising but the platform is built to generate revenue and will self-fund once traffic is driven to the site.  Every time the merchant wins, they will only see the customer’s contact information by paying a small fee.  This referral fee is similar to the hot leads that most of the merchants already are used to paying for or rewarding current customers for referrals.","The biggest challenge with a new concept like this is to get the word out.  This is why the funding for a promotional video, search engine optimization and advertising are critical for the go-live.  Having a great product but no one knowing about it serves no purpose.  The low risk that exists, is the vendors that I will use will not deliver the quality of services needed to get the site off the ground the right way.  The way I plan to mitigate this risk is by using only preferred and first-hand experience recommended vendors from people/companies I trust.  Vendors will have proven track record with other major companies and organizations.  Funding after the launch is another challenge.

So I looked online for a website that can do this but to no avail. There are plenty of websites that allow you to do the research and look for deals but nothing that allows you to put whatever you are looking for and let the merchants bid (at least for Cars and Travel) Basically I wanted to create somewhat of a reverse of eBay and something that:It took me some time to get this built as a flexible bidding platform, where I am able to add categories without writing code. It also took time to make sure it can be built in a way where both parties find this valuable (customers saving time and money and merchants getting hot leads)The platform is live (website and mobile responsiveness) and is working well end to end but now we need to take it to the next level.Next level means:1. Get the word out. Advertisement funds are needed. I have tested various ad campaigns via Social Media and Google and have a plan of attack between social media and Google but the focus will be on Google. Actually, when I tested Google Ad Words, it brought so much traffic for a minor test budget that it nearly crashed the site. 2. Minor enhancements to drive user conversion and enhanced experience. I have taken time (2 years) to slowly build out the platform via various iterations and slowly exposing the capability and testing out the behaviors on both the customer and merchant end. I have a list of enhancements that will drive conversion from someone hitting the site, to registering and then putting out a bid request. To do that, I need to build separate landing pages that will tell the story: past bids with deals that others have received, quotes from existing customers, reiterating that this is FREE to use for customers and they are anonymous until they select the winning merchant. I also want to introduce pictures into the bid responses and other minor additions, to enhance user experience. ","There is always a challenge of getting a new idea out there and that is why advertisement is key as the next step.  I tried to mitigate the risk of idea failing by spending 2 years on development, testing, piloting, enhancing and collecting feedback.  I have also invested over $50k of my own personal funds to date."

I Dreamt I Was a Butterflyappears to be the first ever book published of the butterfly photographed in flight.The significance of this, as with the beauty of the butterfly, is in the eyes of the beholder. Either way, we are proud of its place in history and delighted with the result.What has emerged from the creative chrysalis is much more than a book: it is a stunning photographic collection presented as an exhibition in your hands.Inside, the butterfly draws us into Nature’s chaotic world of wind, light and shadow, the random yet precision accuracy of its flight patterns leading us into the depths of a wonderland we think we understand.For this collection, we are publishing a limited edition of 250 handmade books. The images, printed to the highest standard of museum archival quality, are hand-stitched and hand-bound into an elegantly crafted hardcover, then numbered, dated and signed by the artist.The book is constructed of acid-free archival materials and housed in a matching hardcover archival slipcase, ensuring both book and photo art prints are of lasting value for generations, even centuries, to come.Creating this level of archival quality is not just an artistic striving. It grows from the necessity and a deeply held belief in the collective will of all people to heal the earth so that tomorrow's children can continue to delight in the butterfly as a brilliant and mesmerizing aviator, a dream maker and a powerful symbol of health and love.I Dreamt I Was a Butterflywas born on a dream, the images meditations on fragments of time. We hope you will join us in celebrating the beauty and importance of the butterfly with ownership of one of these unique books.Oliver & Chuck East, Publisher & Photographer respectively""Once upon a time, I, Zhuang Zhou, dreamt I was a butterfly, fluttering hither and thither, to all intents and purposes a butterfly. I was conscious only of my happiness as a butterfly, unaware that I was Zhou.Soon I awakened, and there I was, veritably myself again. Now I do not know whether I was then a man dreaming I was a butterfly, or whether I am now a butterfly, dreaming I am a man.""庄子 or 莊子 Zhūangzi c.369 BC – c.286 BCZhuang Zhou's timeless twist on perception and reality inspired the title of the book. With razor sharp wit and linguistic nimbleness, his dream-paradox teases us to un-see the world in absolute physical terms. Put simply, do we dream the universe or does it dream us?With dream-like clarity, Chuck's images reframe our perceptions of the iconic butterfly. Rather than the butterfly captured on a flower or leaf, his camera arrives at improbable intersections within the butterfly's turbo-charged, random flight labyrinth. And then equally improbably the shutter releases at the exact moment the butterfly graces the frame and crosses the focal plane ... the flight now a single point in spacetime ... a pristine unending now.I Dreamt I Was a Butterfly is an exhibitionThe book itself is an elegant, understated work of artThe whole is conceived to create lasting value for future generationsI Dreamt I Was a Butterfly will be offered at £875 RRP. Kickstarter Backers will receive a 34% discount, the book offered at £575, throughout the entire Kickstarter project. As a launch incentive, there is an Early Butterfly Special reward for the first 4 days of the project, with 10 books offered at £475 each, an exceptional 46% discount.To bring his archive of the butterfly photographed in flight to a wider audience, in December 2017, I gifted Chuck - the photographer/artist and my dad - all the time, energy and TLC required to publish a book of his photographs.Together, over the past year, we researched, soul-searched and tested extensively, seeking the optimum book format to present the work without compromise ... eventually there was only one path. And the first handcrafted book of this collection (there are three more volumes underway) is now finished and in our hands. And we are delighted with the results ... it is well beyond what we imagined or even dreamed when we began this journey.With your support, we will give wing to this limited edition of 250 books. OliverAt the very heart of our search for a book format was one that could allow an uncompromising presentation of the museum quality, archival prints of these unique photographs of the butterfly in flight. Each print of the series is rendered with rich pigment inks applied to Hahnemuhle's fine art paper ... thick, beautifully textured, fine art papers that feel good to the touch. Retaining that quality was paramount. However, most book publishing formats involve a replication of the original prints rather than binding the actual museum archival prints designed for exhibition. This approach does keep the per-book cost down ... butat what price?We chose to keep the faith and find the format that would house the original prints. Significantly, we could continue working with Rupert Morley, whose passion for art and masterful photographic printing are reflected throughout Chuck’s work.As if on cue, the age-old art of handcrafted books revealed itself as the right path. And we discovered the work of Rachel Ward-Sale, a professional designer bookbinder, who has run her own bindery for 35 years. Rachel's work is stunning.Once into designing the book, the ideas that stuck were ‘stone’, ‘architecture’ and ‘space’ ... the book evolving into an architectural structure with an art exhibit waiting inside. Applying the simplest of strokes, Rachel created a book as simple and natural as a boulder resting in a meadow … a place where Zhuang Zhou might have had his butterfly dream.Handcrafting the book - the very act of hand stitching and binding the thick signatures of Hahnemuhle art paper - completed our quest. The exhibition had found a home in I Dreamt I Was a Butterfly, the book we had dreamed about ... Zhuang Zhou might say that it was the butterfly that dreamt the book ... and us.I Dreamt I Was a Butterfly is made rich by artists/inventors across more than 5 millennia. The papers of Hahnemuhle's mill in Germany, which has been making fine art papers for nearly 500 years, receive archival pigment inks, known by China in the middle of the 3rd Millennium BC and applied by 21st century digital printers to create unmatched image permanence in photographic prints ... photography itself an iteration of the camera obscura of ancient China. Then, using a bookbinding tradition invented in the 1st century Roman Empire, the photographic prints are stitched and bound by hand. Hour upon hour is invested in the making of each book. When finished and approved, it is immensely satisfying to number, date and sign each book, certifying its place in the limited edition.SHARING IS CARING To celebrate and contribute to conservation efforts around the world, for every two prints that you pledge, we will donate one print to a nature or butterfly conservation organisation of your choice. The recipient organisation can use the prints as it wishes e.g. to archive or raise funds.* The selection for the print rewards is from the numbered images on this page. There are 11 images available, numbered in the caption, one through eleven (#1,#2,#3 etc.). Once the project is successfully funded, we will send out surveys to collect your choices.Hopefully there's a reward that will work for you. Either way if you think it's a project worthy of sharing it would be great if you could reach out to family, friends and colleagues who might enjoy I Dreamt I Was a Butterfly. Thank You!24 May 2011 (The day it all began!) The sun was rising over the low hills when I walked out of our front door and into a field of wild grasses and flowers tangled between the roots of ancient grape vines and olive trees gone rogue. I had been drawn out by the flickering brilliance of a butterfly … and I had the vague notion of photographing it flying.I had been thinking about this for a few days and, while I wanted to photograph a butterfly flying, I knew that I had no interest in controlling the butterfly’s surroundings (wind, sun, foliage) or influencing in any way its flight. What I imagined was a butterfly flying through the frame, on or near the focal plane, exactly when the shutter released.The reality was a bit different. I realised fairly quickly that photographing a butterfly in flight might not be all that easy. I panned right and the butterfly went left. The butterfly flew down, camera flew up ...focus near, butterfly far ... random is a mild definition of the butterfly's flight patterns. I've since learned that with 5 to 6 forms of lift at its disposal, the butterfly spins on a pin head, tumbles and somersaults within a few millimetres along with endless other mind-blowing manoeuvres ... little wonder that this brilliant aviator is study religiously by aeronautics engineers.Hours arrived, stayed a bit, flew on. I snapped away suspecting that the odds of the butterfly passing through the frame were nil-to-zilch ... not important. I was dazzled, intrigued, mesmerized, the sun arching through its zenith, me blithely snapping away ... then sitting among flowers in the twisted shade of an olive tree, sipping water ... watching, breathing, thoughts fluttering around, passing ... and, in a ‘down the rabbit hole’ manoeuvre, I dropped into the butterfly’s world ... shards of light, shapeshifting shadows, intense colors, the smell of warm earth rising through wild herbs ... it seemed like the right place ...15 June 2012 These moments spent with the butterfly delight and inspire ... meditating on fragments of time set against backdrops of foliage swept by wind and sun ... occasionally I pan the camera, spin the focal ring (I hand-hold and focus manually) and release the shutter and if the butterfly graces the frame it is a gift … Chaos, the Quantum universe's micro perturbations and the butterfly’s random flight patterns all at play ... predicting the moment of take-off, the direction of flight, the fall of light is quixotic at best.Chuck’s first taste of photography, at the Art Center College of Design, Los Angeles, was cut short when he was commissioned to write and direct a documentary film. This led to a 35-year career, during which he produced and directed documentaries and commercials, eventually specializing in theatre drama and dance. An avid skier and trail trotter (he walks when no one's watching), Chuck climbed extensively in his teens, worked for REI (Recreational Equipment Inc) when it was one small shop above the Green Apple Pie in downtown Seattle. He nearly failed high school due to truancy and poor grades, trading time away from school for the mountains where he climbed and skied when the weather was right ... which was pretty well any time.Oliver's first taste of photography was having a dad who unrelentingly photographed him and his brother, Nick ... there was no place to hide (Dad's more considerate of butterflies). After university, where he studied languages, Oliver aka Olve decided to embrace the beast and learn more about photography as a-tool-in-the-box for exploring gardening, vegan dishes and climate change. This project, I Dreamt I Was a Butterfly, Book I The Butterfly in Flight has pretty well filled his calendar in the short term. Spare time is spent working with his family building a hempcrete eco-home in the French Alps, learning about permaculture and constantly tinkering with plant-based cooking.Worldwide conservation efforts are enrichened by UK Butterfly Conservation.

His dream parable makes us wonder if rather than viewing humans as the chosen ones who can save the butterfly we might turn that vanity on its head. Given a chance, it just might be this amazing wee creature that can save our calloused species.OliverWhy are you not guaranteeing the images or the book?If you feel that damage has occurred before you received the reward:SchedulePrintsBooksDamage*‘Truth in advertising’: As an example there was a successful photo-art publication by Roger Camp, titled Butterflies Photographed in Flight but, as Camp explains, he used dead butterflies place on a black card with their wings rearranged to simulate various stages of flight.

He nearly failed high school due to truancy and poor grades, trading time away from school for the mountains where he climbed and skied when the weather was right ... which was pretty well any time.Oliver East - Publisher and Creator of I Dreamt I Was a ButterflyOliver's first taste of photography was having a dad who unrelentingly photographed him and his brother, Nick ... there was no place to hide. After university, where he studied languages, Oliver aka Olve decided to embrace the beast and learn more about photography as a-tool-in-the-box for exploring gardening, vegan dishes and climate change. This project, I Dreamt I Was a Butterfly, has pretty well filled his calendar in the short term. Spare time is spent working with his family building a hempcrete eco-home in the French Alps, learning about permaculture and constantly tinkering with plant-based cooking.Thank you for being a part of this project.

A Graphic Magazine, in a cohesive style (something like the old ""Heavy Metal""), that allows storytellers unlimited access to our artwork, so they can produce their own plot-lines and storyboards. Working together in a single Graphic Magazine, makes it much more convenient to get these stories in the hands of film and television producers.  We want the website to be somewhat like this one (Kickstarter), a front page with options to choose from: Subscriber's Independent Stories (The Issues Archives),or the Collective Story (""A True Story""). These would be able to be accessed by anyone. Also, we would have the section reserved for Subscribers, this will be the Repository of Images they can access to create their Stories. There will be a Gallery of available Original Artwork as well, the paintings (22""x15""x5/8""), that can be mailed out. While I myself can't create a website, I know people whose business it is to do just that. This will be the first step to making our unique artwork available to Subscribers. We will have to work long hours before everything is finished, and there are a lot of materials needed because we produce paintings, not drawings. Which is why I estimate that it will take until Spring before we can start giving Subscribers access to the images Of course, it will take creative people to fully appreciate the potential of our online Magazine. But, the first time they see one of their own stories presented in a comic-book,or storyboard, format (and published online) they will want to continue to participate. We will want to know what our Subscribers want most, and Patrons will want to peruse the ""stock images"" before commissioning Original Artwork for their own stories. We want to be able to use our artwork to give storytellers the chance to have their stories become visually available. With this project, they can. submit storyboards to the film and television industries. If this goes well, we'll be completely ready for Subscriber by May 2015.","We want to hire a few more people, who can learn this animation style I developed in college.and there is also the expense of the materials, and a Tech to set the web-page up the way we'd like.  For now, we have plenty of room in our studio, but if we want to produce 150 pages a month we will absolutely need to move to a shop.    Otherwise we foresee no big setbacks, other than meeting the challenge of too many commissioned paintings.  Resources are the real issue, since resources are what gives us the time and materials we need.   I've painted for years, and not being able to work at it full-time is what makes the process difficult.      When it comes to fulfillment, every project has potential obstacles, from production delays to permits to collaborator mishaps, we can only do our best and stay clearly focused on the goal.  As with so many endeavors, lack of needed resources is the preeminent obstacle.",https://www.kickstarter.com/projects/1336121764/phonostage?ref=discovery_category_newest,1336121764/phonostage," PHONOSTAGE is a theatrical project which centers on an appreciation of Art Rock ""Concept Albums"", and songs, which lend themselves to the visual interpretations by a Theater Group. Essentially, a presentation in pantomime based on the music. There is a Junior High School theater, the school has been renovated, but the theater retains its original style. We would like to maintain it as it is, with improvements that contribute rather than alter its character. This is in the heart of Conservative Kansas, but this progressive project can move ahead if we can get help. Our audience are not just those lovers of this genre of music locally, but all of those fans throughout the World who listen to ArtRock music fifty years later, because we intend to produce films of the live shows, augmented with video enhancements.  There is a lot involved in putting together a theater group, not just props and costumes, but a website as well.  The film production can also be costly in the beginning, as well as DVD production. ","There is an out of town promoter who wants the theater ""updated"" so it can accommodate his more commercial needs, for business seminars and that kind of thing.   If the theater goes unused for too long, locals may be on the hook to dump a substantial amount of money into the theater in order to facilitate His needs.   So, we are in a race with time to get started.    It will also require that a few of us spend much more time than others coordinating the theater group, this may cause us to lose money because of an inability to invest time in other business."

https://www.kickstarter.com/projects/ifnotnowwhen/e-learning-that-starts-with-student-interests?ref=discovery_category_newest,ifnotnowwhen/e-learning-that-starts-with-student-interests,"I am in the process of creating e-learning that can be used in a variety of ways in schools and other educational avenues. The e-learning modules will start with student choices related to their interests. They can dive into their chosen interest to find out more about what those interests look like out in the world. They will connect with people in their local area to solve tasks within that area of interest, and they will see that the options for their career or life interests are limitless. Students will also plan and organize a service project that gives back to their community, because philanthropy is a valuable experience to promote. Kids sit all day and get ""filled up"" with a multitude of learning pieces, but in a crazy busy world, they are not always asked what SPARKS them up. We need to ask that, and when kids see that we value WHO they are, regardless of WHAT they can achieve in a traditional sense, they are more likely to put forth the effort in all areas of learning. Connect kids with their dreams, their passions and their talents, and get them thinking critically about whatever floats their boat in this world. It matters.","The challenge I am facing at the moment is getting these modules created before the start of our next school year with the website subscription pieces in place.  I have a few teachers, curriculum writers, graphic designers, marketers and learning management system designers who are able to help get this up and running, but I need to be able to pay them for their time and effort.",https://www.kickstarter.com/projects/ifnotnowwhen/why-your-neighbor-matters-100-neighbors-connect-fo?ref=discovery_category_newest,ifnotnowwhen/why-your-neighbor-matters-100-neighbors-connect-fo,"WHY - Sometimes you see a need, and you just have to do something about it personally, because you know it could have a positive impact. I am raising funds to help our youth have a clearer picture of what their interests, skills and passions look like in the world, locally and globally, now and in history. I believe that we have great materials to teach kids WHAT they need to learn, but nothing to teach them WHY it's important. Young people who have no dreams, no goals and no hope for their tomorrows are not likely to be very positive and productive today. WHAT - The e-learning courses, or ""journeys"", that I'm creating will ultimately have 4 levels, geared towards 4th-12th grade students. They explore interests, connect with field experts, document what they learned into a PPT and optional choice of presentations, and organize a philanthropic event that celebrates everyone who contributed to their learning and their event. When shown they are valued for their unique skills and interests, and when they are guided through the process of reaching out to local experts for advice, young people feel empowered. They feel supported and they gain hope and perseverance to strive for their goals and dreams. The ripple effect of this, paired with inherent mentoring within the ""journey"" (e-learning course), can lead to some really good changes, probably better than we can imagine. HOW - I'm not trying to create a stand-alone static product. I'm beginning a journey of laying a foundation that can be used systematically and customized per region or community. The way this happens is through converting student presentations into further e-learning journeys/courses to offer access to on my website. This creates an ever-growing variety of interest fields to choose from. Students leaving their legacy for future students with what they learned has been very powerful. Students love creating presentations, and it benefits everyone. WHEN - My plan for creating the e-learning courses + rewards for my backers is as follows:By 2/15/19 - send updates to backers, rewards and sneak peek on projectBy 3/15/19 (~200 hours) - Level 1 courses revised (these are already developed, but I've added some better ideas) - Teacher materials for turn-key curriculum that can be used during silent reading, early finishers, behavior incentive, ELL and Title 1, etc.By 4/1/19 (~200 hours) - Level 2 Template finished and at least one course to show in marketing and conferences- send updates to backers, rewards and sneak peek on projectBy 4/15/19 (~200 hours) - Level 3 Template finished and at least one course to show in marketing and conferencesBy 5/1/19 (~200 hours) - Level 4 Template finished and at least one course to show in marketing and conferences - send updates to backers, rewards and sneak peek on projectBy 5/15/19 (~100 hours) - Upload to website, create back-end LMS for student log-ins, last revisions, etc. - send updates, rewards and thank you to backersWHERE - For a demo of a current prototype, CLICK HERE! ","One of the potential obstacles in this project is the continued learning curve in the development of a log-in page of my website, creating the content for the e-learning courses/journeys (video and audio auditing) and other components that I'm getting better at every day!  This challenge is like most others in life, in which the right attitude and plenty of passion prevail. Another obstacle will be gaining viewership and support for my project during its development.  So far everyone I've asked to review my materials has loved them, including principals, teachers, superintendents, curriculum directors, and most importantly students.  Gaining viewership and developing marketing outside the local area might be tricky, but I know the quality of the product and the effects on students will make it very marketable.  Because I taught locally, I have been fortunate enough to have had educators at every level give me feedback.  I know it's good, I just need to refine my marketing strategies."
https://www.kickstarter.com/projects/theblastapp/blastchat-instant-messaging-app?ref=discovery_category_newest,theblastapp/blastchat-instant-messaging-app,"I thought Thursday August 9th 2018 was going to be the best day of my life. An investor I had been in talks with emailed that morning and asked if I could come into the office. He said he and his partners had ""figured out what to do with Blastchat"". When I walked in the office the head partner got right into it. They had offered me an investment; $200K for 40% of my company. (Watch video). I replied to him immediately and told him that number was way below our internal valuation. And after 5 more minutes of them rambling about their experience and why they were a great fit I declined the offer and asked to leave the meeting. On my way out I decided to take the steps instead of the elevator. I had 12 floors to go and then it hit me. I decided that I never wanted to take another defensive investor meeting again. Meaning, the next time I speak with investors, they will be working on our terms and we will be in control.But first we need to grow our community and raise some small cash to build and test a few features and growth ideas and we need your help. We want to start making money through in app purchases and advertise on popular Instagram accounts like The Shaderoom which is one of the most effective places to advertise on the internet.Below I am going to explain how and why it took me 20 years to build Blastchat, an app that is opened 14 times a day on average and used monthly by nearly 70% of our total user base. Both of these numbers are larger than Facebook, Instagram and Twitter. (According to former interns at Instagram). Hopefully this will prove to you that my team and I are the right people to change the way we communicate online.The idea of Blastchat is pretty simple:One day while in graduate school at Dartmouth College I wanted to play tennis so I went to Facebook and Twitter to post and tweet:""Anyone free to to play tennis with me today?""No one replied. I did some research and learned that less than 3% of our tweets and post on Facebook are seen by friends and followers. I knew there had to be a more efficient, effective, and authentic way to for me to communicate with my friends. This was 2014 and I had just ended a startup with some friends from China. During this time, they introduced me a messaging app named WeChat. After using their version of WeChat for a week I knew messaging apps were the future of online communication. So in 2014 I had decided that I was going to build the WeChat of the West. And in 2017 messaging apps surpassed social media apps in terms of overall usage. This means today in 2018 more people are using messaging apps over social media apps.I CALLED THIS IN 2014!But I know what you are thinking? Where did I get the confidence to build the American version of a $500 B company. In this article entitled ""THE 20 YEAR MVP"" I explain how and why it took me 20 years to build a mobile app named Blastchat. If you don't want to read ""THE 20 YEAR MVP"" here is a brief summary below:In 1998, I was 10 years old and I lived in a 12 story apartment with nearly 20 units on each floor. I don’t have the official numbers but let’s assume there were 240 units and let’s also assume there was a family of three staying in each apartment. (For some context: I lived in a two bedroom apartment with eight people. But there were many elderly people who lived alone.)And of the 720 people living in this apartment building, my mother was the first one to own a personal computer. And by the age of 11, I was a power user of AOL chat rooms and Instant Messenger.Facebook was the main source of communication for my friends and I. The movie “The Social Network” was released and I watched it in theatres over 20 times. I was so inspired by Mark Zuckerberg that I teamed up with a couple of friends and decided to build a startup named Socialnate. It was a platform that allowed you to exchange your personal goods for money that was then donated to charity. Think ebay but the proceeds wouldn’t go to your pockets, they would go to the charity of your choice.One day while in graduate school at Dartmouth, I woke up wanting to play tennis. To find a partner I did these three things:1. I started a group chat of people I thought would be interested.2. I posted something on Facebook.3. I posted something on Twitter.Here were the results: My friends didn’t enjoy the random group chat because no one knew each other. And no one replied to me on Facebook and Twitter. I did some research and came across the startling statistic that less than 3% of my friends and followers saw my posts on Facebook and Twitter. I immediately thought “there had to be a way I could get one message to as many of my friends as possible and get individual responses seconds later”.Here is what the first version looked like:Kyrie Irving joins Blast. He only sent three blasts but those three blasts proved my theory that people would rather have the information they care about the most delivered directly to them without them having to search for it on noisy platforms like IG, Twitter, and Facebook.The Epoch Times covered me, refering to me as The Black Mark Zuckerberg.Blastchat won a grant with the city of Newark in NJ for $50,000 to build a safety feature to help protect women and teens from domestic violence and street attacks.After three and a half years of intense dedication, here is what Blastchat looks like today. Again, we have nearly 3,000 users and the community is super active.After 20 years of unconsciously doing market research I launched Blastchat with one goal: I wanted to build a tool that allowed me to connect with groups of people faster than any other time in human history. There isn’t much I know about in life. But one of the few things I do know about is online communication. I’ve been communicating online with different communities for 67% of my life. I know what the golden days of online communication were like and I’m trying my best to bring it back but I need your help!If you believe in me or our idea, think about donating and joining the Blastchat community.

Idia studies Anthropology at Dartmouth College and is a member of the women's rugby team that won the 2018 national championship. When Idia joined the team she shared stories all of her friends who have lost internships, and are now feeling uncertain about their future. To help her friends and other college students, Idia pitched Julia and I a solution that would connect current college students with professional mentors and other opportunities that will help them get through the current COVID-19 pandemic. That idea blossomed into Opportunity2020.Thank you Idia!","Is running a global mentorship program through software difficult? To be honest, we are not sure. But we do know that we are up for the task because this a problem that we truly care about helping to solve. Our students are feeling lost and hopeless, and the last thing we need them to do is to spend most of their free time on social media. There is a correlation between social media usage and the rise of anxiety, depression, and overall stress amongst our most important age groups; teens and young adults. And during the last decade children’s hospital admissions for suicidal thoughts/actions doubled. If there were an over the counter drug, food or beverage that had such alarming effects on our youth, the product would be banned by the government. However, government intervention and assistance seems impossible or a few months away, at a minimum. So if we can’t rely on the government to help us cure this problem, what can we do? Opportunity2020 is our step forward."

It indexes global public free math teaching videos. When you input your math problems it searches the video database and returns the similar video to help you learn how to solve your math problem.The idea is raised when I teach my kids math. There are huge of math problem solving videos in youtube but you can not search it by the video titles because the math formula is unable to be input in its video title. And it's hard to input a math formula in a search box.So I am going to find the public math teaching videos, analyze them and index them. The information of the math problem solved in the videos are extracted and stored.An app is built that accepts hand writing math formula. Someone who want to solve a math problem can input the math formula and the app will display the searched result videos. In this way math is learned.There are huge public free math videos world wide. Math is a global language so it's easy to learn by video in spite of what language the teacher speaks. This is a perfect way to learn math based on global resources. ",The challenges are analyzing the math video and extract the math formula information in the video. AI technology is applied to analyze and index the math videos.

But in youtube and google there is no way to search the math video by a math expression. There is no search engine for math videos while there are huge amount of math tutoring videos. It took a lot of time to find an appropriate math video when you want to learn how to solve a math problem by watching video.There are so much math masters' videos but there is no way to search them by math expression! It is a great waste of the learning resources.I am going to create a Math Search Engine that analyzes the math tutoring videos and indexes the math expressions in the video. When you search with a Math expression you will find all the videos regarding with the expressions. It provides a quick and easy way to learn from the math masters!,I have indexed some of the math videos but I need to index more and improve the performance and accuracy of the math search engine. There is no risk now. The challenges are how to improve the performance of math expression recognizing algorithm and the search engine.

It does not surprise me that almost every young person's dream in Africa is to someday somehow relocate to a country like Germany or the United States. I would like to change that. Not by creating immigration barriers but by creating great opportunities for young people to acquire the technology and skills and opportunities they need to compete with the first world countries. People can do that without having to leave their home country.I am building a platform that will be a bridge between ambitious and gifted entrepreneurs and customers who have the ability and buying power.This platform comes in the form of a website and an app that will allow people to upload and display their products in a safe and trustworthy environment where millions of potential customers can easily access the products. It compares to the Alibaba website but custom made to open up the African Market to the world ..This is a great technology because it makes it very easy for sellers to market their products to buyers who need those productsThis will in turn help enrich their neighborhoods and elevate the standards of living for everyone. It will also open up a whole new market for the world. The sellers and Entrepreneurs will be held accountable to deliver through a rigorous method of screening as well as making deposits that guarantee a refund in case the seller does not deliver.We will work with different investors to determine and provide avenues of profitability for the serious entrepreneurs.To succeed in this project me and my team have been working very hard. We have broken this project into three phases.please note that these phases do not have to take years to be achieved. with the availability of Funds.it could be a matter of months.Phase one: Setup a multi-vendor website specifically engineered to connect the African Market with the western world.We already have set up a standard eCommerce websiteURL www.customafricangoods.com . The next big step is to transform this site into a multi-Vendor website and a create a user friendly app . This is where we need help.In order to set up a first class site that has all the plugins and security that is necessary, we are going to have to dig deeper into our pockets. frankly i have dug as deep as i can so far and i need your help to take this project to the next level. To accomplish this phase we need about $5000 to $7000. these funds will go into paying for the technicians, ensuring security, creating the app for the site and doing a bit of advertisement...Phase 2: Bridge the GAPin this phase we will expand our base by connecting with more with African Entrepreneurs. We will use all the available avenues to introduce them to the opportunity and offer training for them to be able to use this tool and make profit.These avenues include online and on site seminars. and onsite training and introduction meetings.we will train people on how to work together as a team and how to build profitable and legitimate online businesses.We will encourage women entrepreneurs by encouraging women to form teams of 2 to 5 women and work on specific projects for accountability and greater profitability.i see In some cases whole families will be involved where the parents can do the raw planning and producing while younger people help with the internet part of the business.Phase 4: Going Global:This is a pilot program and depending on how well this program works, we intend to duplicate and multiply this across the continent of Africa and beyond.At this level, we will have the ability and resources necessary to expand this model and make it available to more people from other parts of the world who would like to use this tool.I am confident this will work because i have looked over and seen the promise land and it looks very promising. my team and I will continue to work very hard. With your help we will be able to turn this noble idea into a life rewarding reality that will help countless people.thank you.Martin",The greatest risk is investing in all these young people and not seeing  most f them rise to the call of reaching their potential.  I still consider this a worthy risk because if we  equip 10 people and only one of them goes on to succeed. that was time and money well invested.the other risks involved in this project are travel related. for this we are taking every possible precaution to ensure that both the team and the trainees are as safe as they could possibly be.,https://www.kickstarter.com/projects/622950894/the-ultimate-salad-spoon?ref=discovery_category_newest,622950894/the-ultimate-salad-spoon,"Hi my name is Martin and I am a father and an entrepreneur,  One of my passions in life is cooking.Like me every good chef appreciates a good cooking and serving accessoriesAs a cook I’m always looking for better ways of improving the cooking experience.That’s why I have developed a great set of salad serving spoon.It all started in my workshop. I decided to experiment with different spoons but none of them were working well. Most of the serving spoons are made of cheap plastics and are prone to break easily. Not to mention, they just don’t look as good.I have been working on this project for almost a year now.I come from a tribe that is known for producing quality crafts and wood products. Last November, i visited Kenya my country of birth and I spent some time with some of the craftsmen. I wanted to learn as much as i could before launching my product. I have designed a serving spoon set that will put a smile on every one who appreciates cooking.The salad serving spoon is a set of wooden serving spoon with a great design and a nice finish that can be used together or separately.To make sure that I had the right concept, I also paid a visit to the people who are famous for making amazing furniture out of wood.  The Amish.This experience gave me a lot of knowledge and wisdom. I then returned to my workshop and got my juices flowing. And boy was I on fire.I gave out a few of these serving spoons to several people and asked them for their honest feedback. I have gotten some of the best feedback. This has boosted my confidence and now I feel that I’m ready to make my product available to the world.I feel that now I have the salad spoon that every chef has been waiting for. What makes this spoon unique?The Spoon is carved from the Olive tree which gives it a clean natural luster. The Olive tree is known to be resilient and hard to break. Therefore these spoons have the potential to serve families for generations to come.  This spoon can be dropped kicked without breaking. In Ancient civilization, the Olive branch was a symbol of peace. Ancient traditions and in the Scriptures, Olive oil was used to anoint Kings and Priests into positions of authority. They used olive oil because its very essence represented all that is celestial, all that is good and all that is full of love and charity.In Ancient Greek, the Olive tree represented Health, wealth, wisdom, hope, light, fertility, and balance.I feel that by bringing this salad serving spoon to the kitchens and dining tables of all around the world, I am continuing to represent and spread all that is good and blessed. Finally I use soapstone from California to give the handle a nice finish. The soapstone is a natural It is product of  dynamothermal metamorphism and metasomatism, which occurs in the zones where tectonic plates are subducted, changing rocks by heat and pressure, with influx of fluids, but without melting. It has been a medium for carving for thousands of years. It gives the spoon a very nice finish and compliments the nice clean luster of the olive wood.I’m am ready to get to production. I believe in this product. This is a great solution to many families and restaurants. Thanks for your support.","Risk:  probably my biggest risk is competition with other similar products.Solution: My solution here is to continue being creative and innovative. My experience is That  creativity beats competition every time.I have tested this product with many different people and have gotten very good feedback. The other  challenge I could run into is having too many orders than I am able to fulfill at he moment;I think this is actually a good problem to have because it means there’s a great demand and we have a good product which we do..Solution I can overcome this problem by increasing my production and recruiting new talent.I also need to acquire better equipment that can help make the production go faster.Challenge:  What about the trees?One of the concerns and question i want to address is ""are we destroying the trees?"" The answer to that is NO. We don't cut any trees down Ever, We just trim the overgrown branches which actually helps the tree in the renewal process.. The olive tree can last for many generations. some olive trees have been estimated to be 1500 years old. we are not about to destroy that tradition. we are committed to preserving the trees."

SPS is projecting performances from one space to another---on the street, in a space, on the mountain, etc.A play on GPS tracking technology, Strange Positioning Systems (SPS) looks at the aesthetic, cultural and psychological peculiarities of positioning the self and collective enterprises in a fluid, electronically - dislocated environment.We are looking for funding for high end live streaming capabilities as well as for furthering a global network for artists doing live action work and helping artists and curators financially realize the work by creating an action fund. We also want to further develop our website so that it is a live portal for the works for the events.Given that this time in history seems to be seminal in terms of the horribly strange positioning systems such as the oil in the gulf, the planetary uncertainties both geo-physical and geo-political, we feel that our global community project is even more imperative.SPS, Strange Positioning Systems is evolving as a “strange system” or temporary environment with feeds from various places in the world and led by a different artist(s) or presenter(s). One space overlaps another creating a ternary--triple-based architecture. Plunging into the mix a cross breed of formats, moments and actions inform and reflect the actual strange positioning systems that we must all bear in our culture(s).Our first presenter in the U.S for live streaming is the Outpost in Queens, NY. http://www.outpostedit.org The Outpost has received a small grant from the Annenberg Foundation for our first presentation but we need additional funding for high end streaming capabilities.We are collaborating with artists and organizations from around the world (Norway, France, Iran, Austria, multiple locations in the U.S. and more) and are looking to expand our network into more remote areas.CURRENT ARTISTS INCLUDE: ALEXANDER VISCIO; PASHA RADETZKI; ANDREA WOLLENSAK; HOPE SANDROW; MATTHEW ROSE; ELISE MARTENS; EBON FISHER; ZOHREH ESKANDARIPLEASE SEE OUR WEBSITE FOR MORE INFORMATiON AND REWARDS IMAGES.http://www.strangepositioningsystems.org",,https://www.kickstarter.com/projects/sps/occupy-air-by-alexander-viscio-may-10th-17th-2012?ref=discovery_category_newest,sps/occupy-air-by-alexander-viscio-may-10th-17th-2012,"“Occupy, A.I.R.”Tuzla, 2012AlexanderViscio, an American artist from New York comes to the city of Tuzla to install,perform and exhibit a new work specifically designed for the InternationalAtelier Ismet Mujezinovic in Tuzla, Bosnia and Herzegovina’ inaugural ArtistResidency Program. The word“Occupy” will be built as an outdoor sculpture large enough to allow 150 peopleto enter and fill the space to capacity. A film crew documents the progressionfrom directly above the installation until the entire space is filled. Video,photographs, models and other support materials will be included in anexhibition at a following date.This workrepresents the culmination of the last 5 years where architectural models of profanitiesare considered as public space as the viewer enters the physical domain of aword becoming a transient agent and the content simultaneously.Since the word Occupy has been the cornerstone of publicdemonstration in the US aimed at drawing attention at the severe economicinequalities among classes, I wanted to offer the actual space of the worditself to be Occupied in a country that only 20 years ago people were payingwith their lives to simply exist. Therefore it’s no co-incidencethe artists’ residence comes on the 20th anniversary of thiscountry’s war with Serbia. Yet the artist wants to maintain that the mission ofthis work lies in the visual/physical experience of those who visit the work whileaccepting all the social/political parallels as poignant.“The verb the action becomes a form, an inhabited form. The transient molding agent creates the form of language in which a “human” forms new forms. The form is the manifestation of language that inhabits and in-forms, becoming the seed which is the catalyst for the action.”-Caterina Verde SPS.Intent: To build a 3 Dimensional version of the word Occupy largeenough for alarge crowd of citizens of Tuzla to gradually enter until theentire space is filled to capacity. The process is filmed from directly abovethe structure (which has no roof).How it’s done: With a local crew; architect, carpenter and a groupof High School students from surrounding areas, we will set out to build theword Occupy using wood as the main material. It will take one week to constructand when completed the public will have access to enter at a designatedentrance/exit. This will allow the piece to be exposed to the elements andgoings on in the city square before the actual performance and filming.It is my hope that people will ride their bikes or bring their babystrollers in with them so that the space acquiesce with the general populationand even pick up a few tags (graffiti).How the funds would be used: The essentials; Funds raised will payfor the materials required for the completion of a structurally soundenvironment that can endure the elements of an Eastern European mid May Spring.And for the documentation process that will include, photography, video and alive video stream (made during the performance) available over the Internet.The funds will also be used to update my homepage to contain the entire processand completion of ""Occupy, A.I.R."" and list all its backers. All thismaterial will then be exhibited at the official opening a week later attheInternational Atelier Ismet Mujezinovic or at the InternationalPortrait Gallery in Tuzla, along with models, drawings and artifacts collectedduring my Residency. The crew needs to be fed so of course there will be afood/drink station for the duration of the building process to re fuel.Projects' Status: As I'm writing this on KickStarter I have built the architectural scale modelout of form core. With one 5sq. cm. representing 1sq. meter the model is 150long x 50 deep and 20cm., making the actual structure 15 meters long by 5meters wide by 2 meters high without a roof, Approximately the length ofparking spots for 9 cars.Team: I have most of theteam in place and will arrive in Tuzla April 28th. I will have 3 weeks tocomplete this task and then I will leave Tuzla for my Viennese studio toprepare the shipments to my backers.Alexander Viscio: Artist in Residence, Edina Seleskovic, Program Director, Bosnian born, New York basedAmerican artist.

Different company starts to develop straws that can be environmentally friendly.One day, I am using straws to teach students with artwork. I think I am wasting the resources and not environmentally friendly. Suddenly, I think of the use of eco friendly straws. I search over the internet and find some straws that can even be eatten. I am wondering what if I modify the structure of these straws and make art sculpture using these straws. People like to buy things but at the same time they like to throw things when they find things old. This is why an eatable art can fulfill the wants of having buying but can save the world by either eating it or dispose it (can decomposite in landfill).The money is used for paying for set up of the company, investigate the modification of straws and develop own artwork. The investigation would be like the structure that can be better used in artwork, the flavor and other ingredients that can be used as glue.The first step would be using existing straws to develop artwork. Then, I would investigate in modification of straws and develop art sculpture. Lastly, I would add the flavor and other ingredients as glue or ornaments.I am a fresh graduate student from City University of Hong Kong. I study engineering.

Or are you looking for an IoT microcomputer that enables connectivity in small spaces or at edge of network? Virtualette V1 is a dual stack Allwinner A20 microcomputer weighing 39g with an 8GB onboard NAND flash, a real time clock including onboard battery and wakeup function and multiple IO interfaces. More than a SBC, the new product is a fully-equipped microcomputer suitable for use as a deployable hardware platform. Supporting Linux/Android operating systems and with an ultra-compact design, examples of V1’s potential capabilities are:  Virtualette V1 is a ‘virtually anything’ microcomputer – just requiring your Linux/Android software app to drive it. Virtualette V1 will be shipped with its own optimized Linux-based OS, which can be tuned to suit the distro of your choice.This device is capable of big data processing and storage through the Serial ATA port and can operate either individually as a single device, or connect as a clustered group to members of a larger collective to enable large scale combined processing power.Whether you are a student, teacher, hacker, software creator, DIY developer, IT professional or industrialist looking for an embedded solution, V1 is being developed for everyone with an interest in deploying their solution into the IoT space.The History - Several years back we developed an IoT power conversion/storage management product using the Allwinner A13 ARM chip. Around the same time we were developing a Xilinx FPGA board and associated software projects for Apple II enthusiasts, called Carte Blanche II. Enjoying working with Allwinner's products and looking for ways to miniaturize our designs, we saw a way to combine all the technologies we were working with into a brand new design using the more powerful A20 chip. So we prototyped a compact 'double decker' footprint and Virtualette V1 was created.Today - we have six working prototypes that have successfully passed each stringent test cycle. Now, hopefully with your backing, we would like to move to the first production run, and give backers the Virtualette V1 board as their physical reward. We will provide your device with a robust OS in Linux that is ready to go out-of-the-box. Or you can load whichever of the Linux OS flavors you like best.Future road map - after five years of designing with Allwinner products we have built libraries enabling us to create a road map for future designs based on quad-core and octo-core versions in the same efficient footprint as the current dual core - treading lightly on this earth.We have also prototyped a number of Virtualette add-on peripheral boards including 3 video interfaces, a desktop development unit and an 'AIO: All in One' to enable Virtualette's potential to be extended; due for release in 2017 (see Prototype Gallery).http://www.virtualette.com/peripherals.htmlThe small footprint of 7.6cm x 3.7cm x 1.8cm (3"" x 1.4"" x 0.7"") with mounting feet and weight of 39g make it one of the smallest yet most powerful microcomputers available today.The Virtualette V1 CPU is a dual core ARM Allwinner A20 32-bit processor that runs at 1GHz. The GPU is a dual core (dual head) ARM Mali400 MP2 and runs at up to 350MHz.Virtualette V1 is an IoT 32-bit, 1GB capable, fully expandable, dual stack microcomputer. Designed to take software applications into places where it can be difficult to deploy a hardware solution, with PoE 9-48v, USB OTG 5v and lithium battery power options, Real Time Clock + Wakeup functions and CAN bus we think V1 is an agile device capable of being re-purposed as industry trends change.For a basic working set up, connect V1 to a display, mouse and keyboard and you are ready to go.V1 can be used either individually or in a collective cluster to enable large scale processing power. Try experimenting with Virtualette V1 and BOINC!V1 is highly receptive in its adaptability, and we are excited about seeing how this board can be adopted by others as the core of new designs and hopefully seed many future ideas.We have a few proven examples of how V1 can be used here:http://www.virtualette.com/extras.htmlVirtualette V1 is a hardware platform for Linux/Android code, so you can load your choice of OS Linux flavors.Virtualette V1 will be shipped with its own optimized Linux-based OS, which can be tuned to suit the distro of your choiceUsers can change the OS by swapping over the micro SD card with their choice of OS. V1 has the option of booting from an external micro SD card or from its onboard NAND 8GB flash.Additional storage can be added by inserting a USB2 drive or external hard drive (SATA compatible). V1 can be optionally booted by USB or a dedicated SPI ROM port.OS Example Video 1 - Virtuette V1 running Armbian:https://drive.google.com/open?id=0B6UD-1FjUTjkeWhpUzY1YlRyTG8OS Example Video 2 - Virtualette V1 running Android:https://drive.google.com/open?id=0B6UD-1FjUTjkTWh0QXNDZEFZWE0Following are some technical details to help get to know Virtualette V1.The Virtualette V1 PDF manual and schematics will be available for download from our website http://www.virtualette.com/resources.html on completion of the campaign.SRKH Designs are a team of technology designers and product developers specializing in electronic engineering and manufacture.Our design portfolio is here: http://www.srkhdesigns.com/We’re serious about making quality well-engineered products, but we also enjoy the fun stuff – like the Virtualette V1 immersion 'cool pool' experiment.1. Raise enough funds to cover the first production run, using the devices as rewards for our backers, and develop a customized Linux OS specifically for Virtualette V1. 2. Establish awareness of Virtualette V1 together with a group of 'Seeder' collaborators (our initial 100 backers) who are supporting us in this first production run - to whom we wish to offer future V1 devices at exclusive prices.If this campaign is successful and there is a demand, we will prepare for a second production run. In addition we will be developing the existing prototypes of the following peripheral boards into production candidates: a.	VDT – Virtualette Desktop Stand b. VVA - Virtualette video adaptor kitc.	VAIO – Virtualette All in One 21” integrated display computer. d. VIO – Virtualette installed with VIO carrier peripheral onto CBII Xilinx FPGA board.e. Carte Blanche II FPGA peripheral board - production run 2Every penny received from you goes into manufacturing with a minimal buffer.As we’re more about making great hardware and associated software for an out-of-the-box solution, you’ll probably find that our website is more technically-oriented than ‘glossy’. Maybe that will change if we can move forwards to a time when spare funds are used for marketing rather than making.We hope that everyone who backs us really enjoys using our devices, and that Virtualette V1 can open up new ideas and opportunities for those in hardware and software wanting a platform to design on, and a technology to develop with. 1. Back our campaign and leave a comment on our Kickstarter page.2. Send a direct message to us on Kickstarter.3. Email us: srkh28@gmail.com.","MANUFACTURING We’ve reduced the risk of issues arising with Virtualette V1 by funding its creation, prototyping, characterization and testing stages ourselves, to the point where we are very confident in the robust and powerful nature of the product.V1 prototypes have performed as expected in their test phases, making this design a potential candidate for mass production. Our manufacturing process is completely debugged, and we have a long-standing and positive relationship with our contract manufacturer  who will make the devices. We have worked with this production team on our designs for over fifteen years.Virtualette V1 is designed with manufacturing in mind where electrical test, X-Ray and automatic optical inspection techniques are used to confirm correct assembly in controlled batches to mitigate risk. Units have been on test in various conditions to extract any possible areas where problems or errors may exist.The majority of our components are sourced from US-based companies, which is one of the world's largest and most reliable. We look forward to posting videos and pictures of the manufacturing stages to give backers insight into how their products were made.CROWD-FUNDING EXPERIENCEWhile this is our first KS campaign, we have successfully run two privately funded technology campaigns as part of our hobby interest in vintage computing, thanks to the fantastic support and collaboration of the Apple II community:2009 Carte Blanche - production run of 50 boards.2015 Carte Blanche II - production run of 60 boards.http://www.applelogic.org/CarteBlancheII.htmlLOGISTICSInternational deliveries: we have engaged a proven courier/freight service provider operating to Quality Management Standard ISO9001:2000, working with companies such as TNT & DHL for tracking and secure consignment delivery.

We decided to go ahead and manufacture NP01, and they are all looking great.Here's how they look confirming mechanical fit in a stack:NovaPi NP01 is a new Xilinx Virtex-5 FPGA hat designed to suit Raspberry Pi and its clones. Only 25 available!""NP01 + Raspberry Pi makes for an ultra low cost crypto currency mining system""Using the very large and fast Virtex-5, NP01 is currently the most powerful FPGA hat available for direct interfacing to the RPi using the 40 pin GPIO connector - it also works as a standalone FPGA device for independent applications.The prototype NP01 board in our pictures has passed initial bring up tests and is ready for manufacture. To supercharge your RPi and bring the limited run of 25 boards to life, please click Back This Project. Please note: this project is intended for experienced users.With the popular Raspberry Pi as a base and with access to an FPGA, you will have the power of high speed complex logic, combined with all the benefits of the well-known RPi connected platform.With the new addition to the RPi family the NP01 pin out appearscompatible, and we have thrown together a comparison to demonstrate this.Anything you can program it to do with Verilog and VHDL.There are also 4x Digilent Pmod™ compatible headers that connect to an extensive range of specialized peripheral boards, opening up a huge range of applications.The NP01 is ideal for porting activities due to its large amount of resources, high speed capability and generous IO (eg porting projects from Intel (Altera), MicroSemi (Actel) to Xilinx). You could explore state machine ability, pre- and co-processing, low latency trading, crypto currency mining, large scale parallel peripheral and IP block interfacing... and more.The RPi paired with NP01 via the RPi GPIO header becomes a powerful resource for building and developing new applications where fast, complex logic enables new features and technologies.The NP01 hat below is operating on a Raspberry Pi Model 3 B+ with the power supply busy executing memory tests. The interfaces on the left are (lower) JTAG and (upper) soft JTAG for access to chip scope-style internal FPGA instruments.NP01 can also be used standalone (no RPi) for FPGA independent applications such as designs based on soft core processors (MicroBlaze, TSK3000, 6502, Z80 etc) in conjunction with PMOD-based peripherals for the creation of complete systems.The photo below is a view of our prototype NP01V01 board powered up as a standalone device using the Virtex 5 FPGA, four PMOD headers and the FPGA RPi interface.By changing the board orientation and using multiple boards, NP01 is designed to optionally interface in series or in parallel for alternative configurations and applications.The example diagrams below demonstrate that with two NP01 boards on the RPi base and topped with a basic display screen hat, you can alter the purpose of the entire computing unit.If NP01 is stacked in series, it allows bus interpretation, data modification/conversion, caching/buffering and data path control, eg running a splash screen prior to boot.If NP01 is stacked in parallel it allows bus monitoring, bus decoding, bus copying, bus mastering, and multiple interfaces of the same type, eg multiple RPi interfaces to multiple hats.Pmod™ devices are Digilent’s line of small IO interface boards offering an ideal way to extend the capabilities of programmable logic and embedded control boards.PMODs communicate with system boards using 6, 8, or 12-pin connectors that can carry multiple digital control signals, including SPI and other serial protocols. These modules allow for more effective designs by routing analog signals and power supplies only where they are needed, away from digital controller boards - Digilent Pmod™ Interface Specification. We bought our Pmod selection at Digikey.There are four PMOD compatible headers on NP01 opening up a large range of applications for RPi/NovaPi. We have implemented our PMOD interfaces to include 4x differential pairs, with 1x differential pair capable of being a differential clock input or 2x single-ended global clock inputs on each PMOD interface.Example 1 This photo below shows NP01 porting several arcade games with the use of 1x double PMOD for VGA, 1x PMOD for sound and 1x PMOD with an 8x LED array to indicate status.The LEDs show:Example 2 This photo below shows NP01 loaded with a socZ80 example where a PS2 PMOD and microSD card are used in the project. The LED and breakout PMOD are for debugging.We can offer a series of 22 open source software projects and 38 tests plus full schematics that are on our site - www.nova-pi.comHere is a snapshot below of what you can download. The projects are created in Altium Designer and use Xilinx webpack ISE to compile and synthesize. https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1I_ajZihSpTtUMBaUW_WApxSg8ftw7Lcp?usp=sharingNP01 has been designed with battery applications in mind, allowing it to operate between 3.3V - 6V with reverse polarity protection. It is capable of operating down to 3.3V thanks to the 100% duty cycle capability of the TPS82 series DC DC converter.NP01 is optimized for low power by disabling the power heavy Virtex-5 high speed rocket IO circuitry. Due to the board's low power operation it can be powered by the RPi header pins and also operate with the RPi 5V connected power supply.The photo below shows a test application for the simultaneous and independent testing of SRAM1, SRAM2, and DRAM which utilizes approximately 50% of the device and operates at a current of ~370mA from the RPi 5V supply, including the RPi at idle.The image below shows the Device Utilization Summary for the same test application as above, indicating that we can use a Virtex 5 FPGA at 50% with a very low power consumption.The Virtex-5 FPGA is supported in Vivado and ISE. It is very large and fast, has a lot of high speed internal memory and high performance resources, and retails as an individual chip for ~US$788.00. Link to datasheets: XC5VLX50T-1FFG1136C datasheetsNovaPi NP01 will be manufactured as a limited run of 25 boards. We are splitting production costs equally per board so there is one price and tier of reward.The orders will ship from Sydney, including boards destined for US, Europe and Asia.Please note that you will be responsible for any duties or taxes levied by your country.The images in this campaign can be downloaded here:https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1XJkEX2RxqC_lJNec38IF_KzvWGpkvFUi?usp=sharingSRKH Designs is a small design team making high quality precision electronics hardware for military, industrial, university research and commercial applications.We have on hand a limited number of Xilinx's powerful Virtex-5 FPGAs so the production run is small. Due to size, speed and especially how they are programmed with a highly time-stable language, we think the NP01 board will be a useful, long-lasting development tool for designing, testing, porting and experimenting.Depending on the success of NP01 we will make NP02 with exactly the same form factor and a different FPGA.VirtualetteHigh density microcomputer supporting Linux/Android operating systems.CBIIApple II peripheral card with 5V DIP IC interface and FPGA.

Our BOM is robust with no supply issues with devices in stock, and the front end engineering tasks have been completed with our contract manufacturer. We have a very long track record of successful design and manufacture. As we have already taken care of pre-production and covered the risk, the good news is there is a very short time frame between end of campaign and delivery of reward. Please note that NovaPi boards are designed for users who are familiar with electronic design and debugging, and familiar with safety precautions when working with electronic equipment. The prototype NP01 is a development board that will be the responsibility of the user to program."

These stories will consist of subjects such as; numbers, sight words, phonics, reading music, imaginative, and adventures inspired by my own children. I had several stories already in the making and was giving free portraits out as requested on my page while I built up some hype for the grand reveal, when my drawing tablet suddenly and magically picked itself up and went flying across the kitchen floor. I blame leprechauns personally. I had plans to get an upgrade as my tablet does allows drawing features, but is not a professional drawing tablet. It was also becoming out dated although was still a pretty awesome tablet.I plan to use a professional drawing tablet and a screen recording device. What this means is while the story is being told it will also be drawn. However, with a screen record the viewer will only see brush strokes and not my hand. In order to do this I am in need of an upgrade to the tablet I have, because well that leprechaun threw it. I aim to purchase a wacom cintiq companion 2. This is a professional high resolution drawing tablet for professional digital artists. This tablet allows users to draw without the connection to a computer. It also has a super cool anti-glare screen so that I can draw on the go. My last tablet did not have this feature, and had me stuck in the house. You can help make this a reality by purchasing to have your portrait made.All these examples are of sketches I made while promoting my services.

https://www.kickstarter.com/projects/myslotcars/my-slot-car-collection-application-suite?ref=discovery_category_newest,myslotcars/my-slot-car-collection-application-suite,"OverviewThe My Slot Car Collections application suite is designed for use by anybody who has a slot car collection, whether that collection is Scalextric, Carrera, AFX or any other type. The suite consists of a Windows desktop application, a web browser application and a Mobile device version, suitable for tablets and mobile phones, such as Android and iPhone. You may choose to use any one or more of the application platforms with data being able to be synchonised or exchanged across all your devices via your own unique user account. You also have the ability to share all or selected items within your collection with other people, such as friends or club members, making it perfect for use by slot car clubs and their members.The DetailsAlong with being able to add any number of slot cars into the My Sot Car Collections software, you may also add your slot car accessories, such as building, figures and other track components, along with track designs and layouts.All versions of the application will be fully configurable, meaning that you are not just limited to adding the properties about each slot car or accessory that we have defined, but you may also extend these with your own property sets. You may even create your own slot car and accessory templates and use these when creating a new slot car or accessory item. Current StatusThe Windows desktop version of My Slot Cars Collection is already complete and running, as you can see from the images below. While I have almost completed all the design work for the server API's and the web browser and mobile device versions of the application suite, the work now is to get these developed and running.The images below show the currently complete Windows desktop version of the My Slot Cars application. The web browser interface version will contain the same functionality, simply build to operate through a web browser using C# and MVC. The mobile device version will also be of a similar construct but with slightly less functionality, due to mobile device limitations.The login screen allows each user to be independently identified and thus to create and manage their own slot car collection sets. This also allows them to use the same login credentials on any My Slot Cars platform and synchronise their data between the different platforms.The image above shows the addition of a new Slot Car. Note that all the drop down fields; Make, Scale and Condition and customisable by the user (this is the same for all reference fields through out the application). These slot car details are also editable in the Edit Slot Car Properties screen shown below.The Edit Slot Car Properties screen allows users to not only edit the main slot car details but also to:The Race Information screen provides a wide range of information about a race and race result, including the ability to enter a list of the drivers participating in the race, along With their details, using the ""Drivers List"" button and associated screens.The Slot Car Collection Navigator screen provide access to all items in your collection and includes both a context sensitive command bar and drop down menu within the tree. Items may be dragged and dropped within the tree to allow for reposition. Any slot car or accessory Item may also have one or more information pages added to them for the addition of further information, as shown below.Next StepsNow that I have a complete an operational Windows desktop version of the My Slot Cars application, containing all the required functionality, this set of functionality now needs to be translated into both the Web browser version and the mobile versions of the application. Additional work will also need to be done to create of a set of web API's in C# against an AZURE DB. These will be used for the storage and exchange of data between the different application platforms and for the sharing of data between users.Where Will The Funds Go?The funds raised will be spent on the items listed below. To see a more detailed cost breakdown of this please refer to the financial spreadsheet:How Can You Track My Progress?Progress of this project can be tracked either through the KickStarter website or through the My Slot Cars page of my MORC Creations software website, located at www.morccreations.com, under the products heading.

Dynamic Scripting allows users to create and execute scripts which allows objects within their universe to interact with each other based on the objects attributes and properties and through the use of assertions to test the expected outcomes against the actual outcomes. This is an innovative new way of allowing people to script sets of actions which will test the interaction of objects within their universe structure to observe the outcomes based on user defined scripted events.BackgroundUniverse Builder is an existing application created 1 year ago. It allows users to create Universe structures for use as reference tools for the creation of games and books. A universe can be anything from as small as a single room to as large as a galaxy.Using Universe Builder users define a universe by first defining the Universe Name and Size. They then begin adding objects to their new universe in order to build a universe structure. Objects can be grouped within a universe by using folders and sub-folders. A very basic universe structure is shown below. It contains a folder for Spacecraft, one for Races and one for Planets, with one spacecraft and two races already placed into this universe, as shown below.Each object contained within a universe can contain a range of different attributes and properties. These items are grouped into a number of categories as shown in the image below, and include Properties, Actions, Rules, Associations, Notes and Links.Each object with a Universe, be it a spacecraft, person or even a chair, is able to perform one or more actions. Each action is given a name and a value and an action type, such as fly, run, jump and then whether this action is currently active or not. The action screen is shown. Along with Actions, all Universe Objects may contain multiple rules that they must adhere to. The Rule entry screen is shown below. A Rule consists of a Rule Name an optional Value and the Rule Type (i.e. motion, action or interaction - which is user definable), and whether the rule is Mandatory and Active or Inactive. The Association screen allows for the definition of multiple associations between this objects and other objects within this Universe. Each Association is given a Name , a Description and whether the Associations is Active or Inactive.Where Does This Project Fits In?The aim of this project is to do something no other universe building software can do!To allow users to write dynamic scripts which simulate how objects within their Universe interact given a set of Rules, Actions and Conditions!!User will be able to make use of their Universes Objects and Attributes, as described above, to create dynamic scripts which they can execute to see how these objects would interact given the set of circumstances defined by the script.Such a script will look like this:You can see that this script use a combination of actions, such as:""Object <Object Name> LocatedAt <Object Name>""and assertions, such as:""Assertion: Object <Object Name> Leaves <Object Name> ToGoTo <Object Name> AtSpeed <Speed Definition>""Using these commands, this then defines what actions each object can perform and the assertions define what the expected outcomes are. The output from such script would be similar to that shown below, showing at each step what happens and then changes int he environment. In this case the Script fails during execution due to an insufficient time allocation statement as to what time the Firefly spaceship is expected to arrive at Planet Y.What is Need To Implement This Script Functionality?To implement this functionality correctly within the Universe Builder application, the following things must be completed:The image below shows the basic construct of the Universe Builder scripting window. This window contains an area at the top of the screen for writing scripts. The bottom section of the screen is divided into two section: an Output section and an Error section. The Output section will display the output from the execution of the script while the Error section will display any errors the occur during the script compilation.The image below shows the Scripting screen toolbar with the Name of the Universe that this script belongs to, the Script Name and then the following toolbar buttons and controls: Save Script, Reload Script, Compile Script, Run Script, Copy Text, Cut Text, Paste Text, Font Type, Font Size, Increase Font Size and Decrease Font Size.This project section has provided a detailed summary of what I am aiming to achieve with this project. As far I can find, no other universe building software that can do this - so this will be a complete first in this area of Universe Building and now simulating!!Once we have built the first iteration of the dynamic script builder functionality including the screens, compiler and execution engine, we will then be able to expand this functionality by adding additional keywords and assertions structures and implementing them into the execution engine.Please fund this software project so we can venture into this new and very interesting area of Dynamic Universe Structure Simulations!",Finding appropriate assistance to create required components

None of what I found fully satisfied the requirements for an independent solar solution. Most backpacks were either laptop bags yet didn't even have the power to charge a smart phone, let alone a tablet or the laptop housed inside. Poor bulky design also plagued my search, these offerings utilise a single solar panel that covers just a fraction of the backpacks surface area. This is a failure in capitalising on the real-estate and potential for more power with additional solar panel installation. Most solar backpacks are heavy & expensive yet do not offer more than 4 Watts of power. Solofy Mesh One is affordable, lightweight yet capable of charging any USB device at the same rate as a wall charger would.I wanted something that could eliminate my need for the wall. Not because I hate the seemingly reliable power that comes out from the wall sockets or because of my Eco-Friendly mentality disapproves of our heavy dependance on fossil fuelled power, simply because I didn’t want to incorporate multiple hours of a day sitting next to a wall outlet just to keep my device charged. While most devices claim all day battery life, with excessive use of GPS, data and media functionality I find myself needing a charge at the most inconvenient times. Many of us challenge this limitation by going into airplane mode and lowering the screen brightness. this temporary fix helps keep the vice on standby until reaching a wall plug. but is not the solution. The long-term answer being independent power provided by solar power. This solution when done right requires no ties or restrictions. Be free to explore, anywhere, while charging quickly and efficiently. regardless of being on the beach, a boat or camping.I started brainstorming about the feasibility of a solar backpack revolution, what would be needed before such a movement could become successful.The answer: low cost, high power and most importantly, convenience. Having to worry about whether the device is charging, or if such a solar device was angled properly at the sun wasn't the way to entice mobile device users to consider a self sustaining solution.Throughout the year I devoted time to coming up with an answer that didn’t compromise on efficiency or power yet was affordable enough that all nature enthusiasts could utilise the product to keep their devices going, no matter where they may venture to.iPad Air 2 charge time from competing solar backpacks, none of which produce as much power as Solofy Mesh OneSolofy Mesh One allows continued charging even in non ideal conditions such as cloudy weather since it is capable of producing twice the power required to charge an iOS Device. This leaves room for scattered sunshine and low performing circumstances.The goal was to create a lightweight, foldable backpack with a low profile and a unique design, focusing on simplicity yet providing function. Something that incorporates easily into everyday use without requiring attention or concern. Solofy Mesh One is built for adventure, it handles weather very well and provides the required power to sustain the recharging needs of iPads, iPhones and any other USB chargeable device. The limitations of previous solar backpacks do not apply as Solofy Mesh One aims to provide a no compromise solution. Charge quick and efficiently while securing devices in the water resistant tough mesh fabric, inside its 12L capacity.Instead of relying on fossil fuelled power that travels hundreds of miles to get to your wall socket and then into the required devices. forgo the polluting power of the wall. Solar power is an excellent alternative to generate power, especially when it comes to low energy charging, such as mobile devices. Typically these gadgets charge via a USB port from a computer or dedicated USB wall charger. While our handhelds arepower hungry, they donot require large and heavy solar equipment to keep recharged via solar power. This is why Solofy Mesh One is a viable way to keep gadgets going, a lightweight, water resistant, everyday backpack with sleek style and function. It can recharge USB devices just as quickly as any other charging solution as thelimiting factors of solar power have been eliminated, speed of charge and reliability is matched to conventional charging methods such as wall powered charging.The same revolution that took place with the advent and popularisation of mobile devices We aspire to break through with a simple, functional and powerfulalternative to charging our devices. Solar backpack don’t have to be slow and unattractive. Making solar products that appeal to the mass market is the mission. To provoke thought in mobile device users about where their energy comes from and how convenient it really is to have to rely on a wall plug rather than 'being your own charge captain'. Solofy aspires to manufacture products that serve an important function without removing style and design aesthetics from the equation.Go on, stay cool and charged!We’ve experimented with all kinds of panels, the main requirements being high current ratings and unrestricted angles of the sun. The right solar panels are not temperamental, perform as needed, even under challenging conditions such as cloudy weather, is tough and capable of receiving a beating without damage or malfunctioning. The panels used in the Solofy Mesh One are connected in parallel and are capable of sustaining charge even when half the panels are covered, this is possible entirely due to the high current rating of each individual panel. Four panels working as a team ensures a reliable charge for all those power hungry devices. Charge at 2000mAh (2A)Requirements & what's needed.Just a month after the Kickstarter campaign wraps up, delivers will begin to be sent out. Orderfulfilment isprioritised based on a first come first served basis. The 249$ (two backpack reward special) will be fulfilled no later than the middle of March, with the possibility of delivery earlier in the month.A happy perk, we’ve experimented with different colors for the main material used in the Solofy Mesh One and will be offering three variations should the Kickstarter campaign surpass it’s funding goal.Please add your color option should you desire a backpack color other than black. Nearing the end of the campaign pictures will be added of the Pure White and Navy Blue options.","The biggest current issue is custom ordering the silicone moulded frames for the solar panels.

A quarterly magazine, Uomo Moderno is designed to be a guide to “living in Italian style,” as it features articles on Italy’s fashion, décor, cuisine, music, travel destinations, interviews with celebrities, and much more.I have an awesome lineup for the first edition, including an interview with Italy's most famous rapper, Mondo Marcio. The first issue of the magazine, which is the Fall Edition, is set for the end of August.In the meantime, I am securing advertisers that wish to support the project and finance subsequent editions..","The challenges that I face are those of every publisher: ensuring that the magazine is laid out perfectly in every detail. Since I have been engaged in this type of work for decades, I have the attention to detail to rise to the challenge.Most importantly, the content for the first edition is ready, and the layout will begin mid-June, so that the magazine can be printed in August.An additional risk is not securing enough advertisers for ongoing publications, but with the spectacular presentaiton of the first edition, they will most surely be convinced.

We launched the magazine in the Fall as a tablet edition, which had thousands of downloads.We then went to print for the Winter edition, distributing 6,500 copies to major cities in the US and Canada, with smaller orders to 10 other countries. The magazine in completely in English.Now we have an amazing opportunity to distribute 20,000 copies in stores like Barnes & Nobles. However, we need a kick start to cover marketing and the additional printing costs.The reason why we would like to increase our numbers for the next edition, which will be released in March, is because March is international fashion magazine month in Barnes & Nobles.If we miss it, we will just have to wait another year. With your help, we can do it!The Spring 2014 Edition will feature interviews with Italy's new rock sensation Moda', world champion swimmer Filippo Magnini, and Nino Cerruti's son Julian. We will also take you to the outstanding mosaics of Ravenna.","The Spring Edition is written and being laid out by our graphic designer. The only risk/challeng that we foresee as a vague possibility is a low sell through rate and not being able to recuperate costs so as to continue.However, part of this kick start is to raise funds for the marketing, which should garauntee a successful sell-through rate."

We blend texture and spirit from every corner of the planet, and our objective is to inspire a fresh sense of connectedness in a complete range of global diversity. An international presence of children in our music carries a colorful message of unity (please watch the video above). The songs are meticulously crafted with a high standard of excellence, which has put us on the Grammy ballot twice in the last three years. We believe this album will be the one to brand us internationally, and help inspire a world of tolerance and promise. The success of this album will be chronicled in a feature film documentary from CineVision.""Children populating our cultures today naturally enable our transition through the present changes, because they are a living providence of hope, and we should nurture each one as though kindling a flame for our survival. Many of the choirs we record come from depressed regions of the developing world.By backing this project, light shines ever more brightly on their future.""We are raising these funds to help cover travel expenses for production our new album, and a small video crew for the film documentary.

As well, kickstart manufacturing and a promotional campaign through online channels,regional/national venues, and good ole' creativity and hard work. Music for us has always been so much more than just notes or songs, more than just practice and routine.

We want people to think outside of the ""box"" when listening to Blue-J. In addition to the music, the artwork associated with Blue-J will be an important aspect of the project... ""Blue-J"" is essentially our avatar and for the most part the face of the band. The character ""Blue-J"" has his own story and is a mysterious, dimension shifting, guitar wielding wanderer that destroys demons, monsters, and all around evil with the power of rock n roll!! He, in a sense, represents and symbolizes how we feel about creating/playing music and facing our own demons and dealing with the negative forces in the world. This is something we would like to convey in the art and music ofBlue-J. Definitely a concept band but still grounded in reality somewhat. Sounds weird I know, we just want to do it a little different with the presentation, keep a level of anonymity and let the band be represented by the music and art put out for others to enjoy.      The Art will hopefully stand on its own and be something that people would like to have in a collection whether it be vinyl, cds, t-shirts, posters, wallpapers, and eventually if things go well, video/animation, comic art, etc. The ""Phasmophobia"" release date is targeted for June 2018 and we are very confident and excited about the execution and fulfillment of this project. The vision is clear and it would truly be a dream come true to get backed and take this project to the next level.

With the funding help we will be able to do that. We have the production facility ready to make the additional tools we need.,https://www.kickstarter.com/projects/hotshotheels/protect-your-heels-with-style?ref=discovery_category_newest,hotshotheels/protect-your-heels-with-style,"Valerie designed  Hot Shot Heels© as an inspiration when her son Scott placed a 45mg colt shell casing on his wife’s Samantha's stilettos to cover her worn heels. Those stilettos looked brand-new. Valerie was seized with inspiration and knew that she had to bring this product to the market.Knowing that when a woman has discovered her favorite shoe, the last thing she wants to do it throw them away when the heels get marred or scuffed.The truth is, before Hot Shot Heels© entered the marketplace, most heel protectors were made of plastic and other materials that not only were unattractive – they didn’t last.  She knew that heel protectors needed to be clean, glossy, and fit any form of stilettos.That’s why she tirelessly toiled until she had the perfect, high quality design.Reason we are raising fundsUp until now, our customers are excited about our product and ask us if we have more sizes available. As much as we would love to offer more sizes, we need the funds.","Our biggest challenge is manufacturing tools to create 3 sizes to accommodate more high heels. The size that we have at this time is  medium - 8mm to 11mm heel.     The cost to have these tools made is very expensive, but is mandatory in order to bring this project to the next level.  We have a tool manufacturer in place for the next step to offer all 3 sizes of protectors.     The risk is minimal since we've already secured a successful manufacturer who developed the first tool now on the market. We will keep our backers in the loop throughout the Kickstarter process and to be transparent about progress and how we handle any potential set backs."

Boulder students and interfacing with the Film Program to provide a launching pad for showcasing and distributing experimental film to the masses.In the spirit of Shudder, IFC, Sundance TV, Netflix, and Hulu; The Experimental Film Channel will be the premiere streaming destination specializing in cutting edge experimental film and First-Person Cinema.Where will I obtain the experimental films?Over the years I have built relationships with experimental film artists as the operator of The Denver International Experimental Film Festival.  From 2002 to 2004 I operated a micro cinema located on 38th and Tennyson at 3822 Tennyson St. in Denver.  This brick-and-mortar venture was called The 1896 Fine Art Film Gallery.I also spent two years in Hollywood working as a producer, editor, and Director of Creative Acquisitions which, again, enabled me to interview and befriend dozens of experimental film artists attempting to break into the industry at that time.In addition, I currently have a film festival listing for The Denver International Film Festival and The Experimental Film Channeland have over 150 experimental film submissions that can be tapped to provide content for The Experimental Film Channel. Submitted films include shorts and feature length experimental films.I believe that now is the time to launch a paid subscription service for fans of experimental film.My goal is to present experimental film to the widest audience possible and it is with great excitement that I inform you of what I’m planning with The Experimental Film Channel through this Kickstarter project.Here are some links to further illustrate what I’m thinking.

I also will be hiring a Web Designer capable of building a website similar to Netflix, Shudder, and IFCFilms.

I currently make cakes and cupcakes on a daily basis with my children. I never thought I would or could make sure delicious and beautiful creations. I grew up on the streets of Philadelphia and never had a direction in life. I was brought up without parents or much of an example of professionalism.  I took it upon myself to teach myself a trade. Now I'm in need of some funding to officially license my business and get a space or food truck. I currently make at 2 cakes a week as well as sell about 100 cupcakes per week.,Currently I need to get my kitchen cleared to bake from home.  I just have to take a class and have an inspection but I don't forsee any problems.,https://www.kickstarter.com/projects/awesomelittlecupcake/cuppa-cupcakes-and-coffee-shop?ref=discovery_category_newest,awesomelittlecupcake/cuppa-cupcakes-and-coffee-shop,"Awesome little cupcakes is currently a small cupcake business that is opening a non-profit cupcakes and coffee shop. We are looking to hire low-skilled, recovering addicts that are looking to re-enter the work force and start a new life in a sober 3rd space. It's a one year intensive job training internship. We will be focusing on retail and customer service, job skill training, resume making and interviewing skills. Giving the people who are usually overlooked by society a second chance at a sober life style. All money raised will be used for myself and my partner Mia to get this space opened as soon as possible. We are based in the far Ne part of Philadelphia. Looking for a location in a family friendly area. Our focus is on having a 3rd space for people to come to and feel at home without having to spend a lot of money, like you would at a restaurant or children's play place. Our space will have 3 different sections, one small area for children's playdates, including a chalk board wall, a quiet area for those whom would like a space to do work, and a room or space where meetings can take place. This coffee shop is a very personal thing for me because I, like most people, have been affected by addiction. My mother was an addict. Growing up was not easy. My older sister and I had to fend for ourselves, literally. My mother, as much as I loved her, was not very good at her job. She got hooked on drugs shortly after I was born and unfortunately wasn't able to break free. This left my sister and I, alone most of the time. Our mother would take us places, get high, and tell us to find our way home starting around the ages of 10 and 3. We grew up in the Kensington area of Philadelphia and I've probably walked this whole city a thousand times. My mom didn't make it to my 9th birthday and this was devastating for me. As a child I never realized just how dangerous this was but as an adult, I want to do what I can to prevent this from happening to other kids. So, I want to put my talents to use. I feel as someone who knows what addiction can do to a person, I could show and help people who are really willing to, to make a change. I would like to think that if my mom had the opportunity that I am offering that maybe, just maybe, she could have broken free and had a better life with me, my sister and her 3 grandchildren.We truly appreciate you taking the time to hear us out. If you have been affected by addiction and feel like you can help us get started, please donate anything you can. We appreciate it and EVERY penny counts.",Funding is our biggest challenge right now.  I am a single mother of 3 young kids.  I just want to continue to prove for them while helping out those who need the support.

They are standard decks of 52 playing cards that can be used to tell fortunes orbe used to play the thousands of regular card games.The ""Novice"" blue deck has the full meanings right on the cards in the upright and reverse positions. No memorizing! You'll be able to tell fortunes right away.The ""Intuition"" red deck takes exactly that...intuition. You read the cards using your intuition. Features one word for both the upright and reverse positions on the cards to spur your intuition and is a helpful reminder of the meanings. Hello, my name is Jen and this is my project!The use of a standard deck of playing cards for divination is called Cartomancy and a person who interprets meanings from the cards is called a Cartomancer.Playing cards were first choice as the tool to foretell the future for a very long time. Playing cards were not only familiar, they were accessible. Everyone had a deck of cards in the kitchen drawer or in the cabinet. Tarot cards, on the other hand were very expensive and difficult to find.The popularity of playing cards being used for fortune telling peaked in the 1920's and left behind a trail of magnificent cards from that era. Oddly enough, they are now the cards that are hard to find. They were easier to use than the Tarot and they really worked! I'm bringing them back...sorta...haha!Cartomancy's relationship to Tarot...Playing cards are closely related to Tarot in a lot of ways. There are four suits in both sets of cards. A Tarot deck has 56 cards in the Minor Arcana, whereas a standard deck of playing cards has 52. Both sets have 1-10 and court cards, but the playing cards are less the Knights seen in the Tarot. The Knights were excluded by French Cartomancers in the late 1300's. In fact, some still believe the origin of playing cards actually rooted from the Tarot.Caravan of See'ers' written meanings and illustrations are interpretations of the cards that I've come to know to be true. They are scenarios based on a mixed collection of mine and thousands of other people's visions and insight into Tarot and Cartomancy throughout the centuries that have now become almost universal.Anybody can use this deck for fortune telling. It's easy. Everything you need is right on the cards. No memorizing or studying. You will be a fortune teller the moment you unwrap the deck!This deck has full written meanings and illustrations right on the cards in both the upright and reverse positions. An extra card with brief, easy instructions and spreads are included. The ""Caravan of See'ers"" Fortune Telling Playing Cards also work well with almost any Tarot card spread.After you use the cards a while the images begin to add to the written meanings and intuition takes over. You will amaze yourself!speaking of intuition...Even though the images are the same as the ""Novice"" deck, this deck somehow feels a tad ominous. The cards have one word that describe their meanings in both the upright and reverse positions and illustrations.This deck is meant for the more experienced Cartomancer or someone who is willing to explore their own intuition as they interpret the cards. There are so many different styles of fortune telling with playing cards and Cartomancers develop their own methods of reading the cards over time. Full meanings on the cards can be distracting.If you enjoy the feel of the ""Intuition"" deck but need the full meanings to read fortunes, the 11x17 folded poster is the perfect companion. The information on the poster works just like the ""Novice"" deck. The poster can be used alone with ANY deck of 52 playing cards to read fortunes.If you've been known to pack around more than one deck of cards at any given time, this distressed genuine leather bag can handle it! The bag measures: 8 ½” L by 6” W. with a leather drawstring closure. It's even big enough to carry most Tarot cards with room to spare. Smells SO good!!!The scarf is 22""x22"" and available in Blue or Red. This is no ordinary scarf...it can be worn, used as a cloth for protecting and laying out your cards, used to wrap your decks or..and this is the best part...it can be used for the extended method of fortune telling with the Caravan of SEE'ers DICE and poster. If you decide to wear the scarf it is designed for you to choose your suit with each corner featuring a different suit and it's Tarot sign.Will fit most adults...The Caravan of SEE'ers Fortune Telling dice come with a poker size card that slips neatly in your tuck box for storage. The card includes instructions for 2 different methods of fortune telling with dice and a game that is similar to ""Drop Dead Dice"" only twisted to the Caravan. A game of fate that will keep the little gypsies happy for hours! (Only available as an add-on..see list below.)Throw the bones, cast the stones, draw the lots.. Cleromancy...another ancient method of divination. Much like playing cards, dice and bones were very common for use of fortune telling throughout history. Even author, Herman Melville had a character in his famous novel ""Moby-Dick"" who cast the bones to see his fate!(Choking Hazard: Not for children under 3)""Caravan of See'ers' poster. - For use with ANY standard deck of 52 playing cards for fortune telling.This poster features the meanings seen on the cards in the ""Novice"" deck and the one word meanings seen on the cards in the ""Intuition"" deck. Also included is a brief explanation of the numbers 1-10, the court cards and the suits for a more in depth reading.The poster will be professionally printed on heavy cover stock paper for durability in 11x17. This size is large enough to have all of the information needed and still be manageable for use. For extra manageability, it's scored and folded to a neat 8 1/2 x 11 size, making it easy to use, display or store.Take it anywhere...Spice up your decor with these jumbo ""Caravan of SEE'ers"" court cards. They look amazing framed! They are genuine over sized playing cards printed on Premium 310gsm Linen playing card paper. Includes a set of 3 cards...a King, Queen and Jack. You choose your suit.

I'll discard your email information. It won't be shared with anyone and I promise I won't spam you either. Would love to hear your comments too!(These readings are intended for entertainment purposes and are to show how the cards work and how much fun they are. More often then not, you will relate to the cards immediately.)Yep...a third deck! This deck is intended for the experienced Cartomancer, card player or magician who's looking for something fancy and different. The same illustrations as the ""Novice"" and ""Intuition"" decks but with a gray back and elegant border. No writing other than the suits and numbers on the face of the cards.To produce this deck (""Cartomancer"" gray) the stretch goal needed is $30,000 to meet the minimum order requirements from the manufacturer. Once the deck is being produced we can add stripper decks to the project at $31,500.If this is reached the decks will be available to add-on for the same price as the ""Intuition"" and ""Novice"" decks at the add-on prices listed above.This will be the ultimate deck of Gypsy cards. - Fortune telling, poker, trickery and beauty!!Thank you!Kickstarter, thank you for this opportunity.

This year I have been concentrating on still life paintings, but another love of mine is abstract art. As I write this (September 5th, 2019), there are 116 days left in the year. I would love to create 100 paintings in 100 days, of the remaining days in 2019. I started this project today and have one finished and 99 more to go. To continue the project I will need more supplies, which is why I created this campaign.I have bipolar disorder and anxiety and painting helps me by nearly eliminating my symptoms during my art sessions. Painting is invigorating and relaxing, and gives me an extra layer of purpose in my life.My abstract paintings are based solely on intuition and driven by emotion. My goal is to capture my state of mind while creating the painting. Very bright colors usually signify that my mood is good, while darker paintings can mean I am depressed or anxious. I create both oil and acrylic paintings, but my abstract work is usually done in acrylic.In the 100 days, I'll be creating a visual diary and I plan to create a book that contains an image of each of the 100 paintings at the end of the project.I will be creating nonobjective abstract art which relies on form, color, and other elements of art to communicate. The size of pieces will vary from 5x7 to 18x24 and I will probably be using acrylic most of the time.I am a visual artist living in Evansville, IN and am mostly self taught, with the exception of taking a still life class early this year.My portfolio can be found on my website at www.loririverafineart.com.","The challenging part of this project will be that on some days I might have to create more than one painting to make up for days I am unable to paint. Budgeting may also be an issue, which is why I’m hoping for help from my supporters and collectors.",https://www.kickstarter.com/projects/loririvera/book-100-paintings-and-writings?ref=discovery_category_newest,loririvera/book-100-paintings-and-writings,"I am raising funds to create a photojournal book of 100 paintings that I create this year and a written piece to accompany each painting. I care deeply about this project as art has been an excellent healing tool for me. I struggle with depression and anxiety, yet when I create art, time stands still, and I truly believe the act of creation itself helps alleviate my depression.To create 100 paintings by the end of this year for my book, I will be painting nearly daily. I will also be writing several times a week. Most of the paintings will probably be abstract in nature and be smaller sized, anywhere from 8x8 to 24x24.The book will make an excellent coffee table book as it will have 100 photos in it, or it will be a great book to serve as inspiration for anyone wanting to begin painting or wanting to start painting more often.I will be writing about how I am feeling, artist tips, reflecting on my career in the past, now, and where I am headed, and just fun and random things. I plan to self-publish my photojournal book with amazon.com and sell both paperback copies and eBooks.I self-published my first book in October of 2019 and it has received good feedback from readers. You can read about the book here.I have been painting since 2009, but painting seriously for only a couple years. I live in Evansville, Indiana with my husband and daughter, and our two cats. I have a degree in Business (concentration in marketing), from Murray State University. In addition to painting, I enjoy reading and writing, traveling, and sipping iced chai tea lattes. You can visit my website to learn even more about me and my work.","The only risk I really see is if my depression comes back. If it does, I will have to fight against it and I may not be as inclined to write and paint. The good news is that my medication is helping a great deal and I believe it will continue to do so. Summer is also approaching and I feel better in the summer than in the winter. I have more energy and have more motivation to paint and do other things  in life during the summer months. I expect to get a lot done this summer!"

I have website development experience, but additional funding would allow us to on-board a team of programmers to get this project well on it's way to completion.","One of the challenges that we face in completing this project would be finding a team of bankruptcy lawyers who would be willing to assist us in phrasing the questions needed to correctly fill out the form. Additionally, we would need assistance in wording disclaimers.This is not an insurmountable obstacle.

You were so ready, right!?At that age, most of us make less-than-intelligent financial decisions that might have muddled our credit. Sometimes, it gets so out of control that the only option available to us is filing for bankruptcy.This couldbe the only way that you can truly live the ""American Dream""; owning your own car, house, starting a family, etc.If you're like me and most other people, you don't have $1,200.00+ dollars to spend on bankruptcy attorney fees.Where does that leave us?We have the option of self-filing, but if you have ever done research on that option, you probably learned pretty quickly that it's not to be taken lightly.

Unfortunately, $10,000.00 is not a very large amount of money when it comes to creating a complex website. Having said that, my research indicated that a minimalist, but functional website could be achieved with this amount of money available for the project. We may also have the obstacle of obtaining professional review of the terminology used in the ""ruptsy"" platform. We would likely need consultation with a bankruptcy attorney, which could prove difficult as ""ruptsy"" would be seen as a competitor. We can, however, utilize local bankruptcy clerks when deciding on terminology for ""ruptsy""."

The son, Josh, is a rising soccer player with ambitions of going as far as the sport will take him. Because of our shared love of the game, we have created a weekly podcast named Let's Talk Soccer that focuses attention on specific areas, such as the English Premier League, youth soccer (including training and fitness), organizations that are helping others through soccer-related initiatives, and the digital world of soccer (from gaming to apps and websites). This is definitely not a scam or hustle. We are legit and in an infancy stage and need some help to see this grow. This is truly a passion project by a boy and his dad that love each other and the game of soccer. Because we love it, we want to see it grow.We are seeking money to help us bring a quality product to the people, especially soccer families (because of we are a soccer family and have a well-spoken, bright, talented footballer as one of the co-hosts). The money will help fund things like server space, graphics design, equipment like microphones, and other online expenses such as website building, etc. This is not a fly-by-night pipe dream. We have been doing this each and every week since mid December. We've taken the quality as far as we can with our amateur skills, so now it's time to refine the podcast so that more people can access it.Thank you so very much for your consideration of the Let's Talk Soccer podcast!","The biggest potential obstacle we face is that people might not listen to the podcast.  But, that's ultimately what the money is for:  to make it more refine and more professional sounding so that people are not turned off by its low quality.",https://www.kickstarter.com/projects/322255208/lets-talk-premier-league-and-fantasy-pl-multiplatf?ref=discovery_category_newest,322255208/lets-talk-premier-league-and-fantasy-pl-multiplatf,"It's called Let's Talk Soccer, and it started off as a fun way for a pre-teen boy and his 40-something father pass along their love for - and knowledge of - football (or soccer, depending on where in the world you live!). A podcast was the first platform. Then a social media presence followed. The focus quickly turned to the most popular league in the world: the English Premier League and it's gaming companion called Fantasy Premier League. Even as Americans, we have a deep understanding of the PL. The more we played and tinkered with our FPL teams - and the more we studied and learned - we became authorities on the topic. As we turned the focus towards England, things began taking off! Our Instagram account, which consists primarily of content dedicated to the Premier League and Fantasy PL, quickly and steadily gained followers. Our followers are not only loyal, but they're extremely communicative. They love interacting with us and with each other. They're smart, engaged and loyal. Similarly, our podcast - which started it all - has consistently gained listens and downloads. Because of the Let's Talk Soccer brand presence, we've even had partners approach us: Organizations have requested podcast interviews and social media posts on our platforms. Other brands have requested we help cross-promote them on Instagram. What began as a fun little way for father and son to hang out, share and show our common love of The Beautiful Game, has turned into something much larger: We are approaching 20,000 followers on Instagram. And the podcast grows by 8-11% each week. Our audience is all around the world.Gary is a longtime professional in the marketing discipline. He knows how to create successful brands, grow them and evolve them across many platforms. Although only 13, Josh is extremely knowledgeable about soccer, and particularly the Premier League. He knows more about the league, the clubs, and the players than probably most on-air broadcasters do. He's very well-spoken and creative. If you were starting a football-related brand, you'd want him leading your team!This is where we need your help! We want to turn this dream into a professional-quality multi-platform brand. The money raised will be reinvested directly into the equipment and other assets that will help us take it to the next level. Things like server space, photo/video editing software and equipment, and recording equipment will allow us to do things much better, much faster, much more professionally, and of a much higher quality. Our followers, listeners and partners deserve it.With your generosity, what once was a hobby could turn into something serious for a teenage boy. Maybe it helps get him into the college of his dreams. Or maybe it becomes a career. We would like to turn our small growth brand into a revenue-generating global brand. It's amazing to think that a boy who lives, eats, sleeps - and loves - football could spend his adult life working in that sport. Thank you for your consideration.All the Best,Josh (13) and Gary (too old to say!) ","RISKS:  This project is not dependent on any other people or entities.  We control all of it.  So from that standpoint, the only material risk is that we cease to grow the Let's Talk Soccer brand.  And that's never going to happen.  Even at periods of slower growth, we are always very positive and actually grind even harder to make the brand flourish and successful.  CHALLENGES:  Our biggest challenge, aside from having the finances to fund the equipment necessary to grow this brand the proper way, is time.  Because this brand is attached to the world's largest, most popular sport, it's constantly in motion.  And that means we're constantly in motion to either cover it or be proactive with it.  We've worked out the timing as best we can from our standpoint, now the equipment we'd like to acquire will take care of the rest.  It will allow us to be much quicker and nimble. It will be a game-changer for us."

A simple thought from one person and execution from another. Instead of writing an entire book first, I decided that the best plan would be to kickstart a webstore dedicated to products that all have one very simple message: ""Don't fuck up.""A small note may help people in situations where all they need is a reminder. Or better yet, a motto to live by.Picture yourself in a grand situation:A bank suddenly being robbed by men with trained bears, and you're forced in the middle of it. The police are all outside and among the radio commands and microphone babble, they suddenly hear an eclectic cloud of sounds coming from behind the doors. BANGS, SLAMS, and shouts coming from all directions. Dust begins to form from all the commotion. Soon enough all they hear is shouting, but no one outside the building can see anything indoors.And it stops. The sound, the movement, everything. Twenty seconds of deafening silence and a shadow emerges out of the dust. It's you, casually strolling out of the bank.""The bears are subdued,"" you say, ""the robbers are out cold, tied up.""The chief hurriedly walks up to you, demanding answers. ""What happened in there?! How could you have survived that?!"" he shouts at you.If you smoked, this is where you'd take a drag. But you don't smoke, because you know if you did, your response would be for nothing.You reach inside your front pocket and slip out a business card. ""I followed the rules,"" you say coolly, almost with a shrug.The police chief is baffled. His face red with embarrassment of having been so easily shown up. He begins walking towards his police team and looks down at the card you gave him, stopped in his tracks by what it reads:""Don't fuck up.""Of course:You shouldn't fight a bear or thwart a bank robbery. But what if you DID.What I have done so far:I have ordered some of the product line. By next week I will have pictures up of the actual product. I have also completely designed the website and it is ready to be published. As soon as I reach the funding goal, I will be posting the website here.What I still need to do:All I have left that is unfinished is adding all the products to the webstore. The other products will be added at some point within the next few months, but with immediate funding, I can include them on the webstore right away (mugs, keychains, shirts, etc). I will also be adding a store page for the book mentioned in the conversation, as right now it is marked on the website as ""Coming Soon"".The current Product Line:All stretch goals will be added to the reward list upon their completion.","The only risks I see with this project would be delayed product shipping. I plan to set up the website with the proceeds of the kickstarter, then use the remainder to order stock of all products offered. Ideally, this will move far beyond pens, mousepads, and fridge magnets.The challenges I've set for myself are simple:Open an online store dedicated to one simple product line.Use the proceeds from the fund to order stock, and write a new book titled ""Common Problems and How to Survive Them""."

https://www.kickstarter.com/projects/missioncandles/impacting-the-world-with-mission-candles?ref=discovery_category_newest,missioncandles/impacting-the-world-with-mission-candles,"My passion has always been to help non-profit ministry organizations succeed by helping them with marketing, leadership training, fundraising, and more.As someone who spent many years working in the NPO field, I understand how hard it is to get this support withing an annual budget, so my goal has been to offer leadership training, marketing assistance and much more at no cost to the various organizations through a for-profit organization called Forthright Ministries.Launching a for-profit organization that gives away free support seems strange, but I have never wanted to take from other organizations to build my own. This means that I have to find a creative way to bring income into the organization without taking from the same people who would help local NPOs. Because of this, I have acquired a large fruit sale that has grown since I took over, and I began selling hand-poured, soy candles that I make at home. Mission Candles was created after I started to make candles for the fun of it and had a co-worker ask if she could buy some, then another person asked and soon more people were wanting my candles! I couldn't believe the response! In the past 2 months I have sold over 200 candles and have begun talking with the owner of a doughnut shop chain in Louisiana who would like to feature my candles in her shops, so the proof of concept has definitely been proven to me and it is time to get busy(er).So now it is time to ramp up business. I am currently only able to make 1-2 batches of candles at a time and need to be able to make much more. The funding that I am asking for will help buy enough stock and candle making equipment that I can make over 400 candles at a time! The more candles that I can make, the more I can help others succeed.Please understand that no money from the requested amount is going to salary, this is all going to help streamline production and increase revenue so that the business will be self-sustaining within 6 months. None of the money raised via this Kickstarter campaign will be donated to charity.I currently have plans to expand Mission Candles in two directions. The first is through retail sales at small businesses, which is already beginning. The second avenue is to sell these amazing candles through doing home parties.Through home parties, I am able to share first-hand what work Mission Candles supports while marketing the products in person for future purchases.Over the past year I have been able to do leadership training and help ministries with marketing in Illinois, Wisconsin, Florida, Mississippi, South Africa,and much more! All of this was done while working full time at a job that held me back from helping even more. My goal is to get the candle business up and running within the year so that it can provide an income while allowing me the ability to also help other organizations in my own time.I know that through Mission Candles, I can help make life easier for those in the non-profit field, and I would ask that you would come on board and help make this little light of mine shine brighter than the sun!","As of now, the greatest risk that I face is too many orders, which is a good problem. Currently I am the only person making candles, so when this takes off, I will have to quickly hire on people to help make the candles. I currently have a team of people that are ready to help if needed, now I just need to grow to the place that I need them.",https://www.kickstarter.com/projects/missioncandles/mission-candle-launch?ref=discovery_category_newest,missioncandles/mission-candle-launch,"Mission Candles is a hand poured scented candle company that started out as a simple hobby. As a missionary to South Africa, I realized that raising support the way that we use to, wasn’t really working anymore, so I was trying to think of a way to raise support, and candle making came to mind.In just over a year, Mission Candles has grown from a hobby to a budding business. We have sold over 500 candles throughout the United States and South Africa and we are currently receiving purchase orders from 2 business locations in Baton Rouge, LA, have sold candles in Cape Town, South Africa, and are also in the process of launching retail sales in Utah and Iowa. Not only have we begun retail sales across the country, but it is now time to launch our own store-front business in Beloit, Wisconsin.We currently sell Soy and Paraffin wax candles, scent cubes, and scented soaps. A retail location will allow us to also sell candle making products that would include, waxes, scents, candle containers, dyes, and much more as well as start our candle making lessons for other people who want to sell candles.According to the National Candle Association, Candles are used in 7 out of 10 U.S. householdsand U.S. retail sales of candles alone (not accessories) are estimated at approximately $3.2 billion annually.Mission Candle sales have been great and a proof of concept has been established, but we are only selling when locations like Farmer’s Markets are available and when I set up in my front yard. This means that we are missing recurring and new customers by not having a consistent location set up.I am currently looking at a few locations that are strategically placed for our target market, but we need your help to make this dream come true! I am seeking an initial investment of $10,000 to launch a store front location that will have limitless potential.This campaign has been started to help purchase shelving and store display equipment, to help with marketing, purchase a new melter to help expand productivity, cover other business expenses for the first six months. This amount does not include any pay for myself or other employees.I would ask that you come onboard with our mission, and help Mission Candles fill homes with the scents people love!","The risk for this business is minimal as the overhead is limited and candles are largely made to sell. This means that we do not have to stockpile large amounts of inventory and, therefore, minimize our overhead. The biggest challenge for us, is customer acquisition. Though this is a challenge, I believe that my 15 years of marketing experience will help us beat this challenge. I also know that the majority of our customers become repeat customers which means that word of mouth becomes a great marketing tool. The other aspect that will help us meet this challenge is that many people light candles when they know that there is a group event or family get together at their home. This allows for 1 person to purchase a Mission Candle but for multiple people to enjoy that purchase which will lead to more purchases."

Every version has brought a new layer of increased detail and clarity to the original grainy and faded print of the film. As Giorgio Moroder made with his colourised and contemporary alternate version of the 1927 film Metropolis in 1984, we are now in a position to license the original negative film rights to ""Phantom"" and conduct our own alternate restoration of the film along with a newly-commissioned soundtrack to accompany. The ultimate aim is to license a 35mm copy of the film which we have attained permission to use for a set price, and with our hard efforts, apply digital colourization to this gem-of-a-film to breathe an air of new life into a classic and make it available for everyone to enjoy. We are innegotiationswith various distributionhouses who seem interested in the concept and are willing to distribute a Blu-ray release of the finished film. The finished project would result in a two-disc dual formatted edition of the fully-colourised film including one Blu-ray disc and one DVD disc compacted into a specially-designed case with graphics. The colourization will emphasize the large-scale production values of the film in a new light and provide another great restoration to the classic masterpiece. This something we just want to share with everyone as we truly believe in the project. With your help, it would further motivate us that you want this to happen. With a long journey ahead once funding is complete, our team's joint efforts will carry out the trying process of applying full digitised colour to the film once an initial restoration has also been applied to restore it to a further high level of visual clarity.A successful example of this kind of modern colourization would be to the 1946 film, ""It's a Wonderful Life"" which managed to tap on a new layer of visual entertainment whilst still maintaining the respect of the original black and white film.We really appreciate all your support, and over on the right-hand-side we have a wonderful selection of lovely rewards available including art works to high limited edition collector’s pieces such as prints and more importantly…your name on the final product itself. Whatever your pledge, go one hundred percent towards making this dream a reality.Like filmmaking, film restoration is a costly business, and we based funding goal on what is essentially-needed to make sure we do this process justice, giving it the long time and attention it deserves and will be needed to achieve the best final result. The money will go toward covering the team's production costs, including:What happens if we make more than our goal? Then we can make the vision even BETTER and reach a further level of excellence in our endeavour! Ultimately, everyone can be a part of making this dynamic process happen by helping us reach our intended goal and bring this classic back to life. Every contributing donation will be credited in our special packaging of the film.","Like every film, or film restoration, there are obviously risks and challenges/obstacles. Ours is solely technology time. The techniques being applied to this restoration require long periods of time with constant resources at our disposal in terms of sourcing new technology software to achieve the intended vision we have set our sights on achieving.   The primal challenge we currently face is the *financing, itself. The project cannot go ahead unless we have the funds to immediately purchase the licensing rights from the owner of the original negatives who is willing to license the 35mm negative dupe to us to use as the basis of our new version with their best of luck to us. However, should the financing target be met, this would help to eliminate one of our prime challenges.",https://www.kickstarter.com/projects/20433385/the-devils-hour?ref=discovery_category_newest,20433385/the-devils-hour," The scenario follows us into an enchanted wood one hour to midnight and within a circle of trees, a little imp child wearing a cotton red costume resembling a devil, manifests within a whirling cloud of brown autumn leafs and red smoke. Becoming familiar with his earthly surroundings, the little devil’s lifeline is timed by a strange stalking hourglass containing precisely one hours-worth of sand meanwhile the unbeknownst little red imp continues exploring his surroundings.As the sands of time pour away against him, the young devil searches for something to mark his time on earth, something big and spectacular, yet fails after multiple attempts to fashion something beautiful out of the natural surroundings and objects around him, each failing after the next. During this he is unaware that he is rapidlyageingas a result of the hourglassand that he has transformed into a teenager in the space of a few minutes. Then, he sees what appears to be a shooting star, comet across the starry sky, and down behind the trees to which he follows. Following its oddly colourful flames, trailing across the ground, the devil discovers that the landed object is a seemingly ordinary screwed-up ball of paper. Confused by it, he keep monitor of it should it do something unexpected.Whilst trying to conceive what to do with his remaining time, sitting in a tree, the devil begins to feel drowsy. The paper ball on the ground slowly begins to trail its way up the trunk of the tree and along the branch where the devil rests much to his shock. Eventually he feels everything beginning to turn upside down as he holds onto the tree and sees the paper ball fall up into the sky. He then realises the chance he has to send himself into the sky itself to which he riskily releases the tree and falls into the sky, almost flying-like. He pursues the paper ball whilst experiencing the beautiful tranquil flight as he falls through the sky. Eventually he begins to feel the gravitational pull back to earth which results in him falling back down. Landing back in reality he assumes it to be a dream until the paper ball from sky and back by his side. Moving on away from the woodland, the devil carries the paper with him whilst the hourglass rests on the branch with half of its time remaining, reminding us of the impending time limit.Gradually arriving within a small town, the wandering devil transforms once again and into a more maturely-grown figure unbeknownst to the devil still pondering how to accomplish something on earth. Passing the closed shops, the red devil stops by a curiosity shop due to an old black antique bicycle with flowers and a shop sign attached to it. Staring in through the window, the devil notices a strange object; a floating Chinese lantern. Realising he may be able to use it for his purpose, the lantern manifests within his hands through the shop window, most impossibly.The red devil satisfyingly examines the lantern whilst unbeknownst to the presence watching him from above in a window; a little girl silently staring down at him which he then notices. Still watching, the devil is gone from sight, along with the bicycle.On the shores of a beach, with but a third of the sand remaining in the hourglass, the kneeling red devil finishes assembling the floating Chinese lantern ready for its ascension. Behind it, we see that the red devil has once again transformed into the final stages of his deterioration; a frail, withered old man with but one ounce of life remaining in him. However, when releasing the lantern into the sky, the rough winds cause it to tumble and burn itself much to the elderly devil’s dismay. With all seemingly lost, something begins to glow outward from the crack of the paper ball most strangely; a warm yellowy ray of light. Whether willed by the wind, or by its own force, the paper ball then begins rolling off away along the shore and out to sea. The elderly devil with whatever strength and energy he has left, mounts the bicycle and hastily pedals across the surface of the water after it. Coming to a stop on the water, the old withered devil un-mounts the bike which sinks through the surface. Within the paper, is revealed to be a glowing orb that, once released, begins to hover up in the air, casting a warm glow on a within sight much to the devil’s initial fear as he shrouds himself from the light thinking it will harm him. He soon overcomes his fear and braves staring at what is shown to be the dawn of day, the new tomorrow he has helped to bring about and accomplish on earth.Having brought about the new dawn just in time before the last grain of salt hits the bottom of the hourglass which cracks, the devil finally is able to disappear in a gust of red smoke in the wind. As the sun continues rising majestically in the background, the crinkled paper floats open on the surface of the water, slowly making its way after the sun. Within the paper lands a single brown autumn leaf, the last surviving remnants of the red devil; perhaps on his second journey.Our Goal The goal of this particular project is to create a visual and audio piece within a space of 15-30 minutes. To showcase an array of visual effort with soundtrack to make one beautiful composition of sight and sound incorporating fantasy with the backdrop of reality. This is a real ambitious story-line told through simple yet realistic means and surroundings/locations that aims to capture the essence of fantasy within a realistic setting for audiences who like the combination of both and wish to see this practice progress in more personal independent features.The funding process is required to help realise the scope of this project/story by attaining the necessary tools needed to capture the essence of the story we wish to tell and show to audiences. With the screenplay and overall look of the film envisioned and all set to begin, the achieved financing would contribute solely to hire:•	Cameras •	Lenses •	Dolly tracks •	Audio mikes •	Lighting •	Tripod •	Props/costumes•	Van hire•	Cast and crew servicesAs this is only a small project not many resources are required as it is a very in-house-made production with a minimal of actors all playing the same role so the costume is the same design/material, however it will be set outdoors which we want to be most prepared to endeavour. In terms of location, the main setting is a woodland area so there are only minimal technical requirements in terms of lighting and generators.","Like all aspiring projects, there are challenges and obstacles to overcome; this one is predominantly finance and outdoor-related, however, if the necessary fund goal is met then production will be much smoother and time efficient and will allow us to reach location destinations on time and for the exact time scale necessary.Once funding is (hopefully) completed, the process of constructing the necessary props and set-pieces, acquiring certain location permissions, and hiring specialist filming equipment will enable us to bring this beautiful story to life for ALL to see and show that both our endeavour and your contributions truly were well endorsed."

If you have any questions, ask away.Why the name GoTruckYourself? Besides the humorous play on words, it just made sense. The best and worst feature about a food truck is its mobility. The perks of having your favorite food truck appear outside of your work office during lunch versus the difficulty in finding your favorite food truck when its nowhere to be found.

The old version is available here:https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z-lbr1IL4BQTwo of the songs are well-known, ""The Christmas Song"" (Chestnuts roasting on an open fire... by Melvin Tormé and Robert Wells) and ""Silent Night"". The latter, I will sing in five languages: English, Swedish (my native tongue), Norwegian (my father's native tongue), German and French - to give the EP an international feel and send an international message of Christmas joy and peace!I will have wonderful, gifted and well trained musicians to help me record instruments such as the cello, the viola, the guitar, the piano (on ""The Christmas Song"") and the djembe. And I sure want to pay them fairly. There will also be a need for funds for mixing and mastering, and marketing. (I play the piano and the violin myself.)","One risk I see is if any of my musicians get sick or for some other reason can't complete their part/s. If that happens, I do have people in my network, who could fill in or know others who could.Another risk is of course if I myself get sick, so I can't finish the project. If that happens, I will get the extra help I may need to get it done on time."

We all love to listen to music during oursports activities, and especially during outdoors.Wearingheadphones and in-ear true wireless earbuds is probablythe best option but to be truly hands-free having a wirelessspeaker allows you to do virtually anything with your handswhile enjoying great music.One of the constant challenges Ihave is to be able to enjoy music while ensuring I'm awareofwhat's happening around me.With a device over my ear(especially those with in-ear design and noise cancellationtechnology), I have minimal knowledge of any danger that Imight be exposed to.And with a great speaker, you canshare good music as well with your friends.My first idea about designing a Bluetooth speaker for sportsand outdoor is to make it virtually indestructible.The initial design i done was a hexagonal shaped speaker, but finally, i've designed it rounded to allow users to have a comfortable and good grip.Code named BTS-NPLUS2 will have PLUS2 features on top of (N=Normal):1. Drop resistance up to 1m2. IPX5 water and dust resistance*And to make it more accessible to use in multiple scenarios, we have included a free carabiner and a suction cup.**The special feature of the NPLUS2 speaker is it's ability to be able to connect two speakers simultaneously from one source to boost the sound volume and bass.After several 2D drawings we proceed to work with our design engineers to create 3D design of BTS-NPLUS2. With 3D software we are able to measure every detailed dimensions of the speaker structure and work on a 3D model prototype.The structure of the speaker is important, to withstand drops at 1mit must be able to protect the internal circuit module and speaker architecture. To do this we have housed a rubber absorption cover around the speaker to minimize the impact. At the same time, we use a dual-layer ABS plastic with a softer outer layer and an inner hard layer.At the heart of this speaker will include an IPX5 rating which allows the speaker to withstand low jet water pressure and resistant to dust. The speaker will come with a 40mm 4W double wave-type diaphragm design internal speaker which offers good sound reproduction at a frequency band between 100Hz to 16KHz. The built-in battery will use a polymer lithium battery that comes with a soft layer protective cover to ensure safe from knocks and prevent an explosion. The battery will have a variation of 500mah and 1,000mah. Charging the speaker will be around 2 hours while usage can last up to 6 hours for 500mah built-in battery and up to 12 hours for 1,000mah version.The name of the speaker will be D.LAB Sports Bluetooth Outdoor Speaker. The model number will be BTS-NPLUS2 for 500mah battery and BTS-NPLUS2X for 1000mah battery. BTS translates to Bluetooth Speaker and more importantly, NPLUS2 refers to Normal + 2 unique features. The principle behind N+2 has got to be my time working at Asus which designs and manufactures PClaptops. We will win the competition only if we have a unique strength. Each product we design must have at least one unique strength which sets us apart from the competition.The speaker strengths would be1. IPX5 rating also known as International Protection Marking or Ingress Protection Marking classified under 5 which offer:a. Dust protection - Ingress of dust is partially prevented, and cannot enter unless over-excessive quantity to interfere with the satisfactory operation of the equipmentb. Water-resistance - Water projected by a nozzle (6.3mm) against the enclosure from any direction shall have no harmful effects against the equipment2. Double wave diaphragm design which is actually a combination of lightweight metal and plastic cone at the front of the speaker. The design architecture of the diaphragm is two-fold, one which is fastened to the outer part of the speaker outer metal rim and the inner part fixed to an iron coil (field magnet) that feed electrical signals through the speaker cables into the coil. With the double wave design, it effectively moves the coil and cone in a more stable motion and reproduces higher quality sound into the air.We have designed the speaker keeping in mind comfort and a good grip. Since our initial prototype, we have continued to find better materials to construct BTS-NPLUS2.Finally, we have achieved our desired results for BTS-NPLUS2 after months of continual improvements. We are proud to say we have made it possible for small but powerful sports and outdoor speakers.With the round and hexagon shape design, you can rest assured you can have a good grip on the speaker without any discomfort.You don't need to bring a big and heavy speaker, weighing less than 125 grams bringing along this speaker is a breeze.You can hang it on your bag pack, perfect for any outdoor activities.You can also hang it on any personal mobility device (such as mountain bike or e-scooter) using a carabiner.And even while showering, you can mount onto the wall using a suction cup.Apart from direct Bluetooth connection with your mobile devices, you can also playback from a 32GB SD CardEnjoy hands-free call with BTS-NPLUS2 which supports active noise cancellation. You can have a conference with your friends while having fun outdoors.The speaker is powered with a polymer lithium battery (PLB) with an outer layer soft protective coat to protect it from hard knocks, so do not worry about any explosion caused by impact.With all these features, head out to your sports and outdoors with D.LAB Sports Bluetooth Outdoor Speaker BTS-NPLUS2 and BTS-NPLUS2X and enjoy great music on the go!For product specifications and how to use, every speaker will come with an English and Mandarin manual. At this stage, we might not be able to provide different languages but we can provide the English words in the manual in PDF or Microsoft word upon request for your translation purposes. You can email to customer@dezign-lab.com.There will be 3 accessories included:1. Micro USB charging cable2. Carabiner3. Suction cupThere are also 3 exciting colors for you to choose from.Bringing BTS-NPLUS2 out to the resort makes the experience so much better.You can bring BTS-NPLUS2 out to the outdoor showersTune in to some romantic music while at the sea side.Do not worry about sand and rocks, BTS-NPLUS2 is strong.Laze at the beach with some nice music.Hang BTS-NPLUS2 at the beach tent to enjoy good music.Use the suction cup (included) to mount BTS-NPLUS2 onto surf board or boats.If you do extreme sports, hook on with the carabiner (provided) and take BTS-NPLUS2 for your activities.I hope you enjoy my story and contribute to the success of my kickstarter campaign.For more enquiries please email to james@dezign-lab.comYours sincerelyJames Yip","1.

I'm pretty excited to share this new project because this Bluetooth speaker is really nice with a minimalist design and offers high fidelity sound reproduction. You can pair 2 speakers together simultaneously on one mobile phone via Bluetooth which gives you that extra boost in volume and bass on the go!BTS-NPLUS3 will offer 3 PLUS features:1. IPX6 rating water and dust resistance.2. Ultra high fidelity sound reproduction3. 12 hours continuous battery usage*And to make it more accessible to use in multiple scenarios, we have included a free carabiner and a AUX in 3.5mm jack cable support.At the heart of this speaker is a robust 50mm 6W double wave-type diaphragm design internal speaker which offers exceptional sound reproduction at a frequency band between 150Hz to 17 KHz.The built-in battery will use a polymer lithium battery that comes with a soft layer protective cover to ensure safe from knocks and prevent an explosion. The battery is 1,800mah. Charging the speaker will be around 3 hours while usage can last up to 12 hours.Apart from Bluetooth connection and 3.5mm Aux cable connection, you can also use Micro SD card direct playback.BTS-NPLUS3 can also be used as a handsfree bluetooth speaker which also comes with Noise Cancellation Technology.You can use BTS-NPLUS3 while driving!BTS-NPLUS3 can be connected to many different devices like handheld gaming consoles, tablets, laptops, desktop PCs, etc.BTS-NPLUS3's ring carabiner makes it easy to use for different scenarios.BTS-NPLUS3 is easy to use with large key buttons.**The SPECIAL feature of the NPLUS3 speaker is it's ability to be able to connect two speakers simultaneously from one source to boost the sound volume and bass.The design of BTS-NPLUS3 is very streamlined, minimalist and compact. It comes in 3 cool colors: Raisin Black, Light Grey and Rose Red. In terms of audio quality, it delivers exceptional sound quality, great for any music genre you prefer. It utilizes aluminium, natural fabric and soft polymer base which gives that rich sound and bass experience powered by twin built-in speakers.At the beginning of 2019, we have done several 2D drawings before we proceed to work with our design engineers to create 3D design of BTS-NPLUS3. We replicated the 2D drawings with 3D CAD/CAM software to scale every detailed dimensions of the speaker structure before working on a 3D model prototype.The main showcase of BTS-NPLUS3 is it's twin speakers which can offer 6W high fidelity sound reproduction.The speaker architecture comprise of:a. Double wave diaphragm design which is actually a combination of aluminium, natural fabric and soft polymer base at the front of the speaker.b. The design architecture of the diaphragm is two-fold, one which is fastened to the outer part of the speaker outer metal rim and the inner part fixed to an iron coil (field magnet) that feed electrical signals through the speaker cables into the coil.c. With the double wave design, it effectively moves the coil and cone in a more stable motion and reproduces higher quality sound into the air.After the 3D design is completed we start to assemble the prototype. We chose among several factories one which we believe can help to manufacture good quality speakers at a reasonable cost. We faced several challenges at a start due to minimizing the size of the twin speakers and at the same time fitting the cables and battery inside a small frame. But after a few weeks of improving and trying, we finally make it possible for BTS-NPLUS3.BTS-NPLUS3 is 1m drop resistant through a dual-layer ABS plastic with a softer outer layer and an inner hard layer around the speaker to minimize the impact. To do this,we source for good quality plastic molding factory to ensure the outer plastic encasement for BTS-NPLUS3 is robust and unbreakable.BTS-NPLUS3 is IPX6 certified which offer:Water-resistance - Water projected in powerful jets (12.5 mm nozzle) against the enclosure from any direction shall have no harmful effects. Test duration: 1 minute per square meter for at least 3 minutes. Water volume: 100 litres per minute. Pressure: 100 kPa at distance of 3mFinally get to enjoy BTS-NPLUS3 to the fullest!Bring BTS-NPLUS3 to the pool side.Bring BTS-NPLUS3 to the seaBring BTS-NPLUS3 to the beachBring BTS-NPLUS3 to a boat rideBring BTS-NPLUS3 to the golf courseBring BTS-NPLUS3 to the villageBring BTS-NPLUS3 to the resortThere are so many places which you can enjoy great music with BTS-NPLUS3.

A study by the Boston Consulting Group concluded that “1.6 billion tons of food, worth around $1.2 trillion, are lost or wasted every year,” and that “by 2030, food waste will increase to 2.1 billion tons, worth around $1.5 trillion.” For New Englanders, the most common food waste problems occur at the retail and consumer level.The challenge becomes how we can eliminate the need to send this waste to a traditional landfill. The answer? Composting.Composting is already popular with your neighbors! Compost is a great natural fertilizer that doesn't use any chemicals. It revitalizes the earth, and yields better, healthier crops. Many people already make compost right in their backyard. Others lack the means and the land to be able to compost themselves, while others lack the time. We’d like to be able to offer people in this category a different option. A container, with liner, that you can store and seal food scraps in, then place out on the side of the road, where its replaced with another container on either a weekly or bi weekly basis.Diverting your food waste has many benefits. You’ll be able to see more clearly how much food gets wasted. Many residents we asked actually see a savings in their grocery bill. Gaining a better knowledge of what and how much is thrown out helps make wiser shopping decisions. This is great for families, because it teaches kids important environmental practices. Households are prone to making better eating habits, and they are less wasteful all around.A separate container for food scraps means a savings for your city as well. By having compostable waste discarded in a separate container, this is less waste having to be discarded through traditional recycling systems. In April 2018, the city of Cambridge Massachusetts began requiring food scraps to be diverted to separate bins. What they found was that in just the first 4 months, they reduced overall garbage by 9%. More than a million pounds of food scraps! The city has set the goal of reducing 30% of trash by 2020, and 80% by 2050. A separate container also means your other recycling bins are less contaminated.Economically, it makes sense. Environmentally, composting can make a world of difference. Aerobic and anaerobic composting creates less methane gas, a greenhouse gas that is 25 times hotter than carbon dioxide. By composting food scraps, the waste is disposed of using basic composting ""recipes,"" which emits mainly carbon dioxide. This is a huge reduction in our overall impact towards climate change, and is a great way to help reduce your carbon footprint. Great, because it helps contribute to local environmental impact. You can take pride in contributing to a New England company, and you’ll be able to see the results for yourself, right in your own community!Granite State Commodities is no stranger to food waste.

When the album is funded, it's going to be packed with the most talented studio musicians Colorado has to offer. The song order on the album hasn't been finalized, but the 11 songs chosen for the album are as follows.About The ArtistCameron Hays (aka Professor Grownup) was the bass player and songwriter for a number of bands of varying success over the last 20 years. His former music project Choke The Word became the first Colorado band to use Kickstarter to fund an album, and later received a Westword Music Showcase Award. He's also a professional educator who has worked with infants through graduate students at various times in his career. He is currently completing his dissertation for a PhD in Curriculum & Instruction and he feels he's too old to play in bands anymore, so the Professor Grownup pseudonym isn't arbitrary.In recent years, Cameron has developed a rare medical condition that largely prevents him from playing instruments, so songwriting, composing, and now singing have become his musical outlet.Cameron started working with Brad Smalling at Evergroove Studio when recording the Choke The Word CD, and has partnered with him for a number of other projects (including the orchestral techno-industrial project Violent Science and the ongoing ""heist music"" project The Mile Heist Club).About The StudioNestled in the foothills of Denver, Evergroove is Colorado’s first and best affordable, solar-powered, recording studio. They offer audio recording, mixing, & mastering for most genres and have worked with local, touring, & national artists.","The 11 songs for the album are already written. In fact, the acoustic guitars and vocals have already been recorded. However, the album won't be released until we think it's ready, and that means studio musicians. The funds from this Kickstarter will go to paying for these musicians to add their flavor to the songs and make them truly sing. That said, musicians can be unpredictable, and scheduling may run into some snags, which would delay the album. We fully anticipate being able to release the album (and the other rewards like t-shirts and songbooks) in a timely fashion, and we'll keep you in the loop if things go off the rails."
https://www.kickstarter.com/projects/1573057555/portokali-restaurante?ref=discovery_category_newest,1573057555/portokali-restaurante,"Queridos amigos, cuando tras siete años de vivir en Naxos, una isla griega de las Cícladas donde mantuve abierto Anda Jaleo, mi restaurante de gastro española, volví a Madrid, vine con la idea de montar un restaurante dedicado en esencia a la gastronomía del Egeo elaborada con las últimas técnicas de elaboración de la cocina profesional, en un ambiente moderno y distendido. Por desgracia, un hecho imprevisto en aquél país me impidió poder venir con los fondos que esperaba para iniciar este proyecto. Así que a través de esta iniciativa espero vuestra contribución para poder crear este restaurante, que será recompensada si llegamos al objetivo marcado en la forma en que veis en la columna de la derecha. Durante estos siete años mi experiencia como cocinero se incrementó notablemente al poder añadirle los secretos de la gastronomía de las islas Cícladas, repleta de sabores que, aún siendo netamente mediterráneos, están más cerca de los aromas del medio oriente que de nuestro occidente. El romero, el tomillo, el orégano, la albahaca, la frescura de la menta, la yerbabuena y el perejil recién cortados, la contundencia del baharí, del comino, de la pimienta negra, de la canela, del clavo, son usados en una forma a la que nuestra cocina no está acostumbrada, pero que tratados con mano experta, acrecienta los placeres de los sentidos olfativos y gustativos.Tiene 193 metros cuadrados y se encuentra en el Madrid de los Austrias algo que cumple mis expectativas de ubicación para iniciar este proyecto, un lugar al que acceder fácilmente en metro o autobús, incluso en coche. El metro de Opera está a cinco minutos del restaurante. Desde allí, tras una agradable caminata pasando por delante del Palacio real, atravesando el viaducto y pegadito a Las Vistillas se encuentra el local donde quiero montar Portokali Restaurante, Sabores del Egeo. También está a tan sólo diez minutos del metro de Tirso de Molina tras recorrer la plaza de la Cebada y la calle de Don Pedro hasta la de Bailén y tomando también las Vistillas como referencia final. Si vais en coche podréis dejarlo en el aparcamiento de la Plaza de Oriente, a cinco minutos del restaurante.He diseñado ya un menú que consta de unos treinta platos, de los cuales 18 son veganos o vegetarianos, como la Mousakás vegetariana elaborada a base de Berenjena, cebolla, pimientos, calabacín, patata y apio y con o sin bechamel y queso Feta gratinado, dependiendo de si uno es vegetariano o vegano, en cuyo caso la bechamel y el queso se sustituye por una deliciosa salsa de tomate spitikó, es decir, casera.Los gastos iniciales de alquiler del local, más los gastos de montaje del restaurante rondan los 45.000 € que han de ser invertidos en sillas y mesas, cubertería y cristalería, mantelería, cartas, instalación de hardware y software profesional más todos los utillajes imprescindibles para montar la cocina, que es el motor de cualquier restaurante, desde mesa de fuegos, armarios de frio y congeladores y mesas frías, mesas de trabajo y emplatado, mesas calientes, freidoras, instrumentos de cocción para la cocina Sous Vide, (a baja temperatura) horno de convección y un etcétera muy largo, que incluye la contratación del personal pertinente y la compra inicial de la materia prima necesaria, a lo que hay que sumar una partida dedicada a profesionales de la decoración.Ahora mismo el local está vacío, como podéis ver en las fotos, (depende de vosotros que se llene de sillas y mesas) pero cuenta con salida de humos y las licencias municipales pertinentes para locales de restauración, algo esencial para poder operar de inmediato en una zona en que ya no se conceden más licencias para restauración.Mis presupuestos se harán efectivos si vuestra ayuda se hace efectiva, y así podríamos estar funcionando en agosto de este mismo año,antes, si es posible.El restaurante estará abierto a presentaciones literarias y artísticas. No en vano, el propio chef es escritor al igual que fue periodista durante toda su vida hasta que se reconvirtió en chef profesional, lo que hace que tenga el honor de mantener amistad con un número bastante elevado de escritores.Y recuerda que si no conseguimos el objetivo de los 45000 € nunca se te cobrará tu contribución, sea cual sea. Y si colaboras ya sé que sí quieres que lo consigamos y entonces es buena idea que, durante los 45 días que dura la campaña, se lo comuniques a todo el mundo que conozcas, lo compartas en redes sociales, o a tus compañeros de trabajo o estudios, a los responsables de prensa que conozcáis y a todo el mundo.Muchísimas gracias a todos","Un proyecto así, tiene sus riesgos, por supuesto, como cualquier otro proyecto empresarial. En el caso de un restaurante, el principal es que nadie acuda al establecimiento. Para evitar esto hay que basarse en tres fuertes pilares: Primero, elaborando un producto de calidad que haga que el boca oído funcione. Segundo, realizando una gestión profesional del negocio. No en vano, yo estudié los dos años de la Formación Profesional de Grado Superior para titularme como Técnico Superior en dirección de cocina y en cuyas enseñanzas venía incluido un curso completo de un año dedicado a la gestión de establecimientos de restauración contando, además, con una experiencia en gestión de cocina y restaurantes de más de diez años.

Our plan is to buy a food truck so that we can expand and offer our delicious, authentic BBQ for catering, and varied events and locations throughout Eastern CT. Everything is made from scratch.  No event is too large or too small. I am currently a school Principal planning to retire from public education to follow my passion for cooking barbecue for people as well as following my dream of running the business full time. We currently rent a commercial kitchen and are looking to get the funding for the down payment on a Food Truck for the business. Our barbecue rub just placed 2nd in the 2017 National Barbecue News ""Rubs of Honor"" Competition in the Pork division. We use a Myron Mixon G33 commercial smoker and have been catering out of a rented commercial kitchen space. Our business has just taken off, we have been extremely busy, and have had outstanding reviews! All 5 Star! Here's some samples: ""OzN'Bones catered me and my wife's Rehearsal Dinner Last weekend. Everything about Oz N Bones was amazing! Chris and his Wife are Super nice, they set everything up for us and even stayed to serve (which we thought was a really nice touch!). Oh yea, and the BBQ.. OUT OF CONTROL! So Good! We had pulled pork (Awesome), brisket (awesome), their Homemade Mac-n-Cheese (amazing), corn cakes, and coleslaw! It was all great! We tried all their homemade sauces and salad dressing and it was just spot on! These two really know how to smoke some meat. I am recommending to everyone I know. Chris even went as far as making a special request for me (BURNT ENDS!) and he nailed it! Let's just say we are so glad we booked Oz N Bones for such an important dinner for our family and we're so happy to hear all the great feedback from our guests about the food that night! Plus you can't beat that these two are genuine, sweet, down to earth folks who obviously love what they do. Keep it up! Cheers!""""Had the pleasure of being served OZnBones delicious BBQ last night while attending a Lions meeting! The pulled pork, smoked chicken, bean, corn bread.. all were wonderful! Highly recommend as a caterer for an event.""""Oh My gosh..... Some of the best food I've ever eaten. Had it tonight for the first time and my belly is full and all I want is more of the bacon Mac and cheese!""""Had the combo platter at the Tag Sale on the Green today. Pulled pork sandwich, 3 ribs, slaw and bacon mac and cheese. Amazing !! Super tender ribs with good chew, and a great mix of chunks and fine shred in the pork, and luscious mac(not that blue box stuff the kids love)""""OzNBones hooked me up with some amazing pulled pork, rolls, kick ass slaw and two sauces.original and maple bourbon! Maple bourbon is now my favorite, but original is great too. Reminds me if the Salt Lick back in Austin. By the way, try their bacon-you will not be disappointed.""""I'm from the south and am super picky about my bbq! These guys are the real deal and are some of the nicest people you will ever meet.""","Starting a food service business is always challenging. There is a much competition in the Food Truck industry at this time, but also great opportunities, We believe our product and service set us apart from other barbecue  food trucks in the area.  We have been in business for almost a year and we already have events booked (including two weddings) for the summer of 2018. We have already established some great collaborations, including partnering with a local seafood market and an area microbrewery.",https://www.kickstarter.com/projects/771448244/oznbones-barbecue-sauces-and-bbq-rub?ref=discovery_category_newest,771448244/oznbones-barbecue-sauces-and-bbq-rub,"Oz'NBones has brought bangin' southern barbecue up north to Colchester, CT. Run by Chris & Diane Ozmun. We specialize in authentic and artisan barbecue. Everything is made from scratch using only the finest ingredients including our barbecue sauces and our own award winning dry rub. We think it's too good not to share - in fact, our barbecue rub placed second in the National Barbecue News ""Rubs of Honor"" competition in the Fall of 2017.Our own homemade barbecue sauces are no joke, either. We've got our original sauce, a sweet and tangy Kansas City style sauce. Then there's our sweet Maple Bourbon, made with superior bourbon and organic Grade A robust maple syrup from the Northeast Kingdom of Vermont. Finally, our spicy Chipotle Sriracha infused with chipotle peppers and original sriracha sauce has got a little kick and a lot of flavor. Because they're unlike any other sauces out there, we've been told countless times we need to spread the love - that's why we're going to have our rub and sauces commercially bottled and sold at local stores so that people can enjoy them at home. It's no small task - bottling and ingredients have to be of the highest quality and making the first run happen takes a lot of bacon, so-to-speak.OzNBones isn't just something we do for fun (although we'll admit that's a big part of it) - we're serious about our barbecue. That's why you'll find our food truck located at the corner of Broadway and Clark Lane in Colchester serving up our tasty meats and sides, when we aren't catering or providing food truck service at private events.The demand for Oz'NBones has been nothing short of amazing - we've been in business since April 2017 and have been smoking' the whole time. Business has grown out of Chris’ passion for cooking and especially for cooking authentic southern BBQ. We fell in love with BBQ when visiting Chris’ older brother while he was stationed in the Army in Tennessee over 20 years ago. Chris learned the craft of smoking and barbecue, and has been perfecting his recipes since then. All of our recipes are his own original creations, and everything is made from scratch using fresh ingredients. Some say he's a bit obsessed; we won't argue with that.Chris spent his high school, college and grad school years working in restaurants and in the food industry. He started as a bus boy then worked as a waiter, bartender, and a cook/chef. He took a brief haitus from the culinary world to have a successful career in school administration, but once he gotthat out of his system it was back to the barbecue.Oz'NBones caters for graduation parties, birthday parties, rehearsal dinners, weddings, and many other events. We provide our food truck at several different food festivals, concerts, microbreweries, and much more. With your help, we'll continue to grow and expand, and share our home-grownflavors with more barbecue enthusiasts like you. THANK YOUTo learn more about OzNBones check out this PodCast from Table to Stage: https://www.podbean.com/media/share/pb-qbb7q-9267bb","Getting the sauce and rub to market is a challenging process that requires a great deal of leg work , including have them tested a laboratory  for acidity and other things, as well as for the nutritional and allergen information.

One day while visiting a local nonprofit with her mom, Collins was able to play with a group of feral cats the organization had currently trapped, spayed, and released. The feral cats arrived at the nonprofit some time ago and had since become part of the family for all who were involved. Inspired by the joy that was received by the cats but concerned about the rising number of abandoned pets, Catty Collins was manifested. Our goal was to create a playful fashion line for young and old that reminded those of their beloved pets while encouraging those in our path to create change through kindness.Catty Collins was founded on the principle that kindness is the most influential agent of positive change. Anxious about the current state of abandoned pets, our emotions inspired us to take action and create a clothing line that encourages positive vibes and good karma. Each Catty Collins shirt is enthusiasticallydesigned to invoke feelings of optimism, compassion, and most of all, love! All of the qualities we believe exist in our pets. We are so grateful for your generosity and helping us create a better tomorrow.","The challenges with this project are reaching people, getting designs created and manufactured as well as fulfilling orders.

Each structure will have a light behind the stone thats in the wooden frame. There will be a cord feeding out the back so people can plug it into an outlet. The light will shine through the onyx and be very transparent on each and every one I build. Lighting through the onyx is made to help the Cross itself stand out. At night, its very easy to see how pretty the structure is. My profile picture is an example of how it looks at night. The way it is seen in the video is how it looks in the day time.

The foundation of this business is to provide a creative and stress-free experience for our creative crafters. Daily life and weekly schedules often become bombarded with commitments, and the way we de-stress becomes monotonous. These kits allow people to disengage from the digital world, engage with their friends and family, and create DIY crafts from start to finish (with no stress over finding materials or having failed projects). Flower City Bitties, the founding company of Craft N a Box, originally began with teaching in-person craft classes. These still occur and are the backbone of our kits; instead of finding a class to fit your schedule, you purchase a kit and gather on your own time and in a location best suited for you.The video attached to this campaign demonstrates what an in-person class looks like and what one of our kits could look like in someones home!Funds are being raised to invest in equipment (die cut machines, woodworking machinery, etc) so we can expand our kit offerings with as little overhead as possible. This is our first priority, as having machinery that allows us to create contents for our kits instead of outsourcing materials is instrumental in keeping the kits affordable and profits high.We also need funds to launch a full marketing campaign; this business was started on a shoestring budget which leaves little for marketing. This is a new concept, as most craft kits available currently are for individual people and not groups AND are usually monthly subscription kits, so we need to market heavily to generate sales. While we offer individual kits and subscription kits, we fully believe that embarking on a crafting journey with other people is more than 50% of the Craft N a Box kit experience. While we guarantee great products, we also guarantee long-lasting positive memories in the company of friends and family.","There are minimal risks with this campaign, as the business is already launched and running.  At this time, in order to grow and offer our more diverse products to a larger population, we need to invest in additional equipment and marketing.Being able to truly market these craft kits will ensure that sales are strong and consistent.  Being able to offer kits that are affordable to all demographics will ensure that sales increase and we have repeat customers.  Being able to offer a large variety of kits will ensure that customers will return and lead to amazing word-of-mouth marketing."

Other companies, depending on the purchased product, will only want the electrical cord / plug to be sent in by mail.For certain items, such as printers, fax machines or old scanners, the manufacturer may only request compliance with smart recycling practices that adhere to municipal and federal environmental standards.When requesting assistance with a purchased product you (as the customer) should note the date and time of each telephone call, during which you express a complaint about your purchased product.These details are very important and should be provided to the manufacturer upon your request for a replacement item.

På avstånd ser du motivet klart och tydligt men går du lite närmare så ser du att bilden består av hundratals eller kanske tusentals mindre bilder.Det som gör vår fotomosaik unik och verkligt intressant är sättet vi sammansätter och renderar verket på. Motivet är nämligen inte ""tonat in"" över ett vanligt kollage av bilder.Istället analyseras motivbilden och sedan placeras samt sorteras var och en av de små bilderna som motivet skall bestå av in efter färg och ton för att verkligen skapa motivet!

What I am trying to do is create the worlds best potato salad, in my opinion. I'm in no way trying to be conceited but anyone who as ever tried my potato salad couldn't get enough. Lets be honest that stuff they call ""potato salad"" at the store I feel bad even giving it to my dog to eat. The recipe that I use to make what I call ""love in a jar"" lol came from my grandmother. Who gave it to my mom, who then gave it to me. I grew up eating this potato salad and I believe everyone deserves to have their taste buds explode as well . There aren't any words that could describe the taste. But there's great news, I plan on sending everyone who donates a jar of my famous potato salad. Ok its not famous yet but it will be. I want it to be so famous that when people think potato salad, my family's potato salad comes to mind. I would use the money raised to start my plan, execute it with perfection and feed America an amazing potato salad. Why Jar of Love for a name? The answer is in the name, I feel that the sensation that comes from eating something that taste's amazing gives you a warm loving feeling inside. In my opinion mason jars are the perfect way to package my product. It will make its look fresh and it is also unique. So I feel Jar of Love just fits.My plan:Well i completed my first step by gathering up information on how to start a small business. I often look into these things on my free time. The second part was to get the courage to start a kick starter, boom done lol. I'm planing on using a local farmers market to purchase all of the ingredients I need. I have also been looking into company's that sell potatoes at wholesale prices. I will have to purchase liability insurance, and also will have to submit an application to the Pennsylvania Department of Agriculture to get a permit in order to sell food. I also found a website where I can order mason jars in bulk, and I found an industiral kitchen to prepare my product. I would also like to try and get a patent for my recipe because it's my grandmothers and I would like to be the only one able to make it. After I have everything I need to get started I want to open a booth at the local farmers market. I will offer free samples in order to get people to try it, and once the do I know they will buy it. After building up the brand I would go to the local supermarkets and ask how to be apart of the local vendor program. I am hoping to start off with a small amount of shelf space and I would of course offer free samples in order to help promote my product. I would create a website for those who don't live near by and would love to enjoy an amazing product. Which would arrive 1-2 business days at most.","One giant risk that I have is literally losing everything. If this dream becomes a reality then I would have to be putting all of my time and energy into it. As things start to grow then after a while I would have to leave my job to help purse this dream even further. My worse fear is for everything to go down hill. But on the other hand I know how hardworking I am and I am a go get er and would stop at nothing to make this dream a reality.  One of the biggest challenges would be finding a good place to get fresh product in bulk. I am very picky when its comes to the products I use. But I know I will find somewhere because I am very determined. As far as finding people to buy my product, I am certain that won't be an issue because with the free samples my product is for sure to sell.",https://www.kickstarter.com/projects/bucchansfinest/bucchans-finest-potato-salad?ref=discovery_category_newest,bucchansfinest/bucchans-finest-potato-salad,"What I am trying to do is create an amazing potato salad, in my opinion and of those who have tried it. Since the very first time my father in law tasted ithe hasn't stopped talking about it. He always asks me why isn't it on shelves yet. Lets be honest that stuff they call ""potato salad"" at the store looks a lot more like soup then potato salad. The recipe was passed down to me from my parents. I grew up eating this potatosalad and I believe everyone deserves a chance to try something truly amazing. There aren't any words that could describe the taste. What I want is for my potato salad to be well known. I will use the money raised to start a life long dream of mine and that is becoming an entrepreneur. The amazing part will be sharing this experience with my wife. She has always been there for me and has always believed in me. I realize potato salad may sound like something funny to invest in but I guarantee it's one of a kind. I will only be using a few ingredients but when combined together create a unique taste. The image I will upload will show no comparison to anything found at the grocery store. We want everyone to know thatevery $1 counts and we appreciate any amount donated. We will use the money to apply for a patient, rent an industrial kitchen space, apply for SafeServ Manager certificates, food product, and all miscellaneous supplies.My wife and I often do research on how to start a small business in our free time. This is something that we have put a lot of thought into and I'm confidentwe have what it takes to run a business.

All other orders would ship the next day overnight mail.","One giant risk that we have honestly is failing. We have tried this product in the past and the funding didn't go to well. We have put a lot more thought into it before starting this time. For instance we decided on changing the name, designed new T-shirts, and created a swag bag!!!! We believe in the product that much and we hope you will as well. If this dream becomes a reality I know that we would stop at nothing to assure our success. My wife and I are very hard working people and can do anything we set our mind to. One of the biggest challenges would be finding a good place to get fresh product in bulk. I am very picky when its comes to the ingredients I use. I only like to use the most fresh ingredients you can find. As far as finding people to buy our product, I am certain that won't be an issue because with the free samples our product is for sure to sell. Our project is defiantly a work in progress but there are a few things we know for sure of. 1. We have finally gotten the recipe down packed after many attempts. It took us about ten tries to get the taste absolutely right.2. I found an industrial kitchen to prepare our product. 3. Once we have the funding we can start production right away."

I made some research on internet to found few similar projects made by others but never exactly what I want! At the end, I want to make cocktail with more than 50 bottles on the wall, the biggest list of cocktails available in one dispenser, multiple heads dispenser, head movement for shot, medium and large cocktails, random selection mode and more. I didn’t find any with that specification! And those I found are very expensive. I decided to start project from bottom with the specifications I want. I want to offer it at lower cost too. I made it for me but I’ll made it also for you and all your dispenser project! Important Note  This dispenser can be convert to anything you want! Not only cocktails can be made with it. Only the tube used need to be compatible with the product you want to control. A lot of possibility! Juice dispenser? Chemical dispenser? (for pool as exemple) and more!Please help me to make my project a sucess.A website will be create for the project after the first objectif will be reach.First Objective (7 500$) To start I built a prototype of the ''Single bottle dispenser'' with a small microcontroller. It will deliver 1 to 5 oz (selectable by a knob) and a dispense push button. Generous backers will receive one or more single head dispenser as a gift. Go to the video page to see it! Real prorotype with peristatic pump will be done soon, samples pumps ares in the mail...! Vising my page frequently to see future update!  This system you'll receive will be configure to fit future update of the project. All pumps will able to fit on the new board with 3.5'' touch screen. This board should be ready before the end of the first objective. I'm working to make a prototype with 50 LEDs output before the end of the first objective. You'll able to see it work with the database! New update about it expected in 30 to 40 days. Continued to visit my page to see changes.This first objective will help me to make that new board running with database and real peristaltics pumps and your gift!What do you think of having your personnal UAD? (from 1 bottle to 50), your donation will help me to make it possible! Second objective (15 000$)  After the first 50 bottles dispenser will be made, I want to make it bigger. I planned to add a 2 others heads to the dispenser! 3 cocktails will be fill at the same time, in short period of time. It will be very easy to fill a lot of drink in few minutes. Third objective (30 000$ to 50 000$)I want to push the project from 3 heads to fill a box of 12 cocktails at the same time. Only 30 second to one minute will be needed to fill a box of medium or large cocktails. Very interesting for bar or big party setup!Final Objective (60 000$ and more)- Optimization of the dispenser environnement.- Send task by mobile application (for home user).- Built a frame to fix the pump- Portable unit on wheels- Self-service with card payment- Suggestion from you!At the end it will become the Ultimate Automatic dispenser! (UAD)","The biggest challenge will be to make the entire programmation of microcontroller to work properly. I need to have a high precision system, I dont need to lost alcohol on the ground! The challenge will be to reach this high precision. A lot of test will have to be made. If something go wrong, I'll never stop the project! I know a lot of peoples who can help me to solve them. There is no reason to stop it before the end! You'll able to see the first board working before the end of the first objective.

I found few models available on the internet but never included all the functions I need for my dispenser!As a robotic and automation technician, at this time, I decided to build my own one.After talking to others, most people said that it's a very good idea, but they could be interested by a smaller system. I finally designed different size models to fit the needs of everybody! Not limited too few one. The U.A.D. Cocktails will be available in standard or any shape to fit your place.I worked on this project since 2015. I didn't only create a new product, I had to do a lot of different steps to produce and promote it. Creating website, video, logo, are all different skill needs to manage a project!This Kickstarter campaign will push the project at the next level. The objective is not very high, it will be to buy a small CNC plasma cutter. This machine will be use to cut the material to build U.A.D. Cocktails units.This CNC plasma cutting machine will give a way to cut the material at low cost. It will give the chance to make customs shape units at respectable price!All the units will be built at our shop. Delivery time will be shorter and price will be kept lower.Our first objective is to produce more than 100 systems!Make your selection and enjoys your favorite cocktailsThank you for your help, it will be greatly apreciate!***Delivery is marked as October but will be probably sooner than that! First arrived, first served***","Our production plan is already ready! With the help of this campaign, we will have everything to produce units on a large scale.The only real problem that could occur is if something go wrong with the installation of the CNC plasma cutter. If it happens, we will use the B plan and ask a company to cut your units for us.The U.A.D. Cocktails is already working.Everything could happen, but we are ready!"

Or imagine driving behind that car that either forgot to turn the blinker off or have a brake light out but you can't get their attention to let them know. Now imagine an app linked to your car’s license plate. You downloaded the app, link your license plate, which pulls up your vehicle type for you, and generate a profile.Now all your vehicle information is generated and your set to communicate with any other driver. Now on that cross country trip you can play games with the other cars even if you can't see them anymore. You can send a message to that attractive person and if they are willing they can write you back. With the app, once you put in their license plate you can continue to talk; for as long and from as far away as you both want, or at any given time either one can block the other to avoid harassment.Now you're driving down the road at night with a brake light out but no idea until that other car behind you with the app sends you one of the few dozen automated messages alerting you of the situation. You can set in your preferences to be able to receive these messages and no others, or all messages with the ability to block people whenever you want.Now thanks to the message you can click the link which populates advertisements for nearby part suppliers showing their logo the part number and pricing and when clicked on shows directions to the closest one of your choosing. Or if the problem is more severe like a flat tire or something dragging underneath, the app can take you to a list of repair facilities. Use the app to keep track of services done on your car and set reminders for future services. The App will also be complete with GPS and maps so no need for any other apps while behind the wheel to get where you want.

You downloaded the app, link your license plate, which pulls up your vehicle type for you, and generate a profile.Now all your vehicle information is generated and your set to communicate with any other driver. Now on that cross country trip you can play games with the other cars even if you can't see them anymore. You can send a message to that attractive person and if they are willing they can write you back. With the app, once you put in their license plate you can continue to talk; for as long and from as far away as you both want, or at any given time either one can block the other to avoid harassment.Now you're driving down the road at night with a brake light out but no idea until that other car behind you with the app sends you one of the few dozen automated messages alerting you of the situation. You can set in your preferences to be able to receive these messages and no others, or all messages with the ability to block people whenever you want.Now thanks to the message you can click the link which populates advertisements for nearby part suppliers showing their logo the part number and pricing and when clicked on shows directions to the closest one of your choosing. Or if the problem is more severe like a flat tire or something dragging underneath, the app can take you to a list of repair facilities. Use the app to keep track of services done on your car and set reminders for future services. The App will also be complete with GPS and maps so no need for any other apps while behind the wheel to get where you want. The App will also be voice to text and hands free friendly so no need to take your hands off the wheel to communicate or navigate to your destination.Thank you for your time in going through this project and I look forward to your support in helping make this App a reality. Most people would pay between $1-$5 for an app when downloading in the Playstore or Appstore, however my goal is to make this app free for everyone when it launches but this requires support now to be able to build it. My name is Jeremiah and i am trying to build this app not only to fill a gap that will allow everyone to communicate on a different scale but also to help my family. I thought of the idea for this app one day driving down to the hospital to see my daughter who has been battling leukemia since she was 4 months old. She is doing great now but still has a long ways to go and all the driving back and forth gives a lot of time to think. I hope you can help in creating something that I know one day we can all enjoy.Thank you,","Extra time in coding phase needed for integrating Google maps, Bluetooth and voice to text."
https://www.kickstarter.com/projects/spencerfox/smoke-ez?ref=discovery_category_newest,spencerfox/smoke-ez,"This is a dramedy (drama and comedy ) about the Smoke E.Z., a secret mobster nightclub that deals with a Modern Day Prohibition. The US Government has declared smoking, any use, and the possession of tobacco, illegal.  The Ghosts of Al Capone, Ben Siegel, Meyer Lansky, and Charlie Lusciano approach Graziano Rodolfo to open the Smoke E.Z.  This club would be like the clubs from the 1920s,  Capone's Speak Easies. The members of the Rodolfo Crime Family thought Graziano was crazy but then they  decided it was a good idea to open The Smoke E.Z.   The club is similar to Al Capone's Speak Easies in the 1920s where it was illegal to drink liquor. This club takes place in modern times, where tobacco is illegal to have. Again it's a modern day prohibition. Now, instead of calling it a Speak Easy, it is called the ""Smoke E.Z. "".(This is not a Pro Smoking or Anti Smoking story. There is nothing political about this movie. It's only about a group of mobsters taking advantage of a prohibition and making money from it.)In the story, the club will have a secret opening. Inside there will be a dance floor, a band, cigarette selling and lighting of cigarettes and cigars for customers. There will be a casino, a bar, a restaurant, and an abundance of beautiful woman. The club will feature every week a different dance routine by our famous Smoke E.Z. Burlesque Dancers.Right below here, Spencer J. Fox will tell you a little more about theSmoke E.Z.

This film was mainly an idea for Don Sill  and I to work with each other.However, my life took a turn:About two years ago I suffered a heart attack. I wound up in the Hospital in intensive care for a week and had 3 stints and a defibrillator put into my heart.  At times I thought I was going to die. However, while I was recuperating, I made a pledge to myself that if I make it out alive, I would pursue the Smoke E.Z. and make sure this dream of mine would be pursued all the way through. And with your help here will make my dream of the Movie come  true!What Entertainment will entail in the Smoke E.Z.?Smoke E.Z. will be a variety of different entertainment.

In the story of the Pilot Movie, the Ghost of Al Capone comes to mobster, Graziano Rodolfo, to explain to him that an opportunity has presented itself to open a secret business like the old Speak Easies, called a Smoke E.Z.In this clip below, if you want to see what Prohibition in the 1920's was all about when the US Government banned the sale and consumption of liquor, take a look at  Al Capone, Speak Easies, Flappers, and bootlegging liquor.This is what the Smoke E.Z. is based on, except that it takes place in modern times.Take a look at this clip about Prohibition right below!The cast of the Smoke E.Z. will have over 50 characters.

One thing that worries me about Smoke E.Z. is that is not a Pro or Anti Smoking film. We are not here to encourage or discourage smoking, the story is about gangsters opening up a secret nightclub to sell an illegal substance such as tobacco to make money. This story is more about the club and it's crazy characters than is about smoking.The only problems I can see here is filming outside here in North Carolina, if we get rained out, we will always have a rain date for another day of filming.All cast members will be put on contract to make sure once they are in writing it is binding and they must fulfill the commitment to complete their role that they are cast for."

WE AIM TO CHANGE ALL THAT.Wouldn't it be better of a fan could pay you directly at the show for a digital download (instead of having you wait for your check to come from a music hosting service)? This way, you get paid immediately and they get your music immediately. FANS: Imagine a bunch of your fans buying a CD at a show, getting in their cars afterward and having to wait until they find a computer with a CD player to then rip it into their music library, then sync it to their phone or MP3 player? WHAT A PAIN.More often than not, the CD ends up on the floor mat, only to hope to see the light of day. The band's music might not ever get played.Instead of all the hassles of physical CD and the hassle of entering credit card info through a phone, fans can pay the bands directly, at the show, and still get an instant download to their smart phone. WHAT IT DOES:""GET PAID NOW: AND GET BACK ALL FEES""Here’s how it works for bands:1. Sign up and send us your album or EP, along with album art and bio.2. Purchase a ‘download package’. You pay ahead of time for your downloads, let’s say they’re a $1 each (we have to pay for hosting and transfer of the data).3. A fan pays $10 (or whatever you charge) to you at the merch table and you give them a unique download code.4. The fan instantly downloads your music TO THEIR PHONES!5. You recoup your $1 for the download and you keep (right then and there) the $9 profit; no waiting for a delayed check from some music hosting service.","iPhones and Android phones can get a little tricky when it comes to downloading Zip files, locating them, unpacking them, then moving files. We need to come up with a solution for this either via free apps or create a programmatically smart way (probably our own app) to do this quickly and easily. Then, the product will be done and ready to go. But, then, we need a little seed money for marketing. Otherwise, our creator, Joe Schaefer, has been in digital marketing since 2003; so implementation is taken care of!",https://www.kickstarter.com/projects/1144653752/anti-greetings-cards?ref=discovery_category_newest,1144653752/anti-greetings-cards,"Don’t tell people what they want to hear. Tell them how you really feel. Go ahead, express yourself! Why buy a stinkin’ greeting card that anyone can blindly buy at the store? We design limited-run (limited to 100 pieces, then they get archived and are gone forever) anti-greeting cards. We can either ship to you or ship one to anyone, anonymously.We’ll even create a custom card for you. Just answer our questionnaire and we’ll send you 2 ideas, you choose 1 and we’ll create and ship it. ","Printing and marketing. Those represent the biggest challenges!

https://www.kickstarter.com/projects/1362141390/danny-bautista-debut-album?ref=discovery_category_newest,1362141390/danny-bautista-debut-album,"My name is Danny Bautista and I love to worship in song. I have been doing so for many, many years and currently I’m the Worship Minister at Esperanza Christian Church in West Orange, NJ. At the moment I'm working on creating my first full album that will be available in Spanish and English.It’s amazing how easy it is to become so busy doing God’s work and continue in the same circle day after day and forget that God has greater things in store. God had to literally bring me to a halt and say “Danny! I’ve called you for so much more! Ever since that moment, I have grown passionate about sharing my gift to the world.Now I am so clear of my calling. But I also understand that God’s purposes for my life are just beginning to unfold. My first single “Caminar en Victoria” is a testament to that. It took a lot of work and finances to produce this single recording, but it has been a great blessing. This project has provided a glimpse of the potential I have in God.  My Facebook has over 39,000 likes and is full of inspiring messages. Producing ""Caminar En Victoria"" has allowed me to collaborate and work with many wonderful people and studios that are happily waiting to collaborate with me again.I'm currently in the process of selecting songs from my collection and writing new ones that will be included in the album. This has been a delicate process because all songs have to work well in both English and Spanish.1. Throughout my experience as a worship leader I have sung to 10 people or a 1000 with the same passion and intensity because it’s not about me but about bringing people to the presence of God. So my main objective is to glorify God with what he has given me.2. God is purposeful in everything, so when I write a song inspired by God, I know with certainty that it will touch someone’s heart, motivate a change of direction, uplift those who are brokenhearted, and lead those who are straying away closer to God. It’s not by chance that someone would approach me in the parking lot after a performance and say “The words to your song have truly changed my mind about committing suicide today”. If it came from God then God has a purpose for it. And that is what I hope to continue accomplishing in a larger scale.","While working on ""Caminar En Victoria"" I established connections with many wonderful people and studios. Reaching my goal will allow me to produce, mix, master and print a substantial number of CD's. I have also the support of my church who will help cover any unexpected expenses. Although I have planned thoroughly to have my project finish by January of 2015 it is possible that through unforeseen circumstances like scheduling and studio availability that my project would extend a month or two. It is also very likely that I might finish before my proposed deadline. In any case, I promise to keep all my backers updated on my progress of this project in the event that it is funded.",https://www.kickstarter.com/projects/1362141390/a-music-project-with-original-songs-in-english-and?ref=discovery_category_newest,1362141390/a-music-project-with-original-songs-in-english-and,"Welcome! I’m Danny Bautista, a singer/songwriter/worship leader with a passion for writing songs that touch the hearts and motivate.I’m very excited about this project. I’m compiling songs that I’ve written many years ago and also writing new ones for an album that will cover different themes that will bring about an attitude of gratitude and awe of the wonders of God. Yet, what is special about this recording is that it will be available in English and in Spanish, giving this project the potential to bless even more people.I have been giving my one hundred percent and then some for this project. Writing, arranging, recording tracks and collaborating with other musicians. It has been such a great experience and I can’t wait to share with everyone the finished product. I know this project will be a great blessing just like the single “Caminar en Victoria” released in 2012 was and continues to be.I’ve put together a cool list of prizes for those who would like to partner with me in this ministry. Your contribution will not only help these songs get printed on a CD but you will also be part of the purpose of this project, to change people’s lives, to bring them closer to God and give hope, encouragement and healing.I will keep updating this page with progress reports, pictures, videos, music, and pictures of the prizes I am offering, so check back often.This is a breakdown of how the funds will be used:Session Musicians: I am blessed to have some great musicians helping me out with this project helping me keep the cost down. Background vocalists are included in this budget.Vocal Recording / Studio: This is where it gets fun, recording ten songs in English then in Spanish. $2000 will cover for 20+ hours in a quality studio. I'm currently researching for my choice of recording studio from the many great choices in New York City.Mixing & Mastering: In reality the engineer is mixing and mastering 20 songs, hence the hefty price tag. Mixing engineers range from $50 per song to even $500 per song. I'm looking at the middle ground of the two.Duplication: I'm using Discmakers to reproduce 1000 of each English & Spanish Projects.Some of these songs were written many years ago, some are recent and some I am currently finishing up.If you want to help me bring my first album to life and realize my dream of completing my Album and bringing my music to more people, please donate to this campaign.After you complete your transaction, Kickstarter will give you the option to send a message to your friends and followers on Facebook and Twitter. This message will inform your friends that you just backed my campaign and will include a link to our campaign page (you'll be able to edit the text). Please send these messages! It only takes a second and it'll be a huge help! For more information visit: www.dannybautista.com THANK YOU","Just like everything in life, this project doesn’t come without it’s challenges and risks. But the outlook for this recording looks great. I have great musicians that have offered their services, family and friends that truly encourage me, and a church community that will back me up to see this ministry go to the next level. In other words, the biggest risk I see is taking a little longer than planned."

Although I think the games we've made are great and very entertaining, it's hard to make a successful app unless you have the big marketing budget of the big companies. I want to prove that wrong. I think small companies can and very often do make great apps, we just don't have the huge marketing budget that the big marketing companies have. I would like to get my app in front of a bigger audience and have a great way to get my app noticed but lack the funds. I know there are others that feel the same way as i do and if I can make it happen then I know others won't be so discouraged to follow their dreams. Let's show everyone that you don't have to be a big development company to have a successful game.""Bumpy Rider"" is the game we would like to get everyone to play. Highly addictive and very entertaining. It has a nostalgic old school theme and graphics. Its definitely one of a kind and no other game like it in the app store. You can try it out for yourself from the app store, its free.","There really are no risks or challenges besides not getting any downloads.

We are Fresh Apps LLC. We have a few apps in the app store but since we are small and not one of the big dogs, with the big budgets for marketing, its very hard to get our apps any exposure. We already have the Emoji Me Keyboard app made which is a very cool way to make all types of emojis and have it be assessable through your device keyboard, Its not an app where you need to exit and open multiple apps to use your emojis. You simply enable the keyboard through the settings, create an emoji in the app and it is automatically sent to your keyboard where you have access to it in your messaging apps. There will never be an emoji that you'll want simply because now you can create it. We need help to fund a marketing campaign and get the word out and try to get this to everyones hands, we strongly believe in our app and think it can be very successful with the right exposure.Here is the download link to Emoji Me Keyboard:https://itunes.apple.com/us/app/emoji-me-keyboard-custom-emojis/id933016909?mt=8",The man challenges is to market in the right places which we have a few ideas of where.

They find that there are teachers, administrative staff, some law enforcement, and a mysterious creature which disguises itself as a wall, involved in the disappearances. As Afrel and his friends start investigating the disappearances they also become targets of this creature and corrupt individuals in law enforcement.Good thing Afrel has his powerful Afro to save the day.","The risks/ challenges are securing the funding.

I plan to do all of the production work myself but I will use my friend's studio in Hollywood for post production.  I am not familiar with his current schedule so I don't know all of his availability; and this could lead to some unforeseen issues.  However, I do have other local studio resources i can use should he not be available.Another big challenge is getting it finished before Halloween; that's my very ambitious goal.

ICh treibe leidenschaftlich gerne Sport, insbesondere im Fitnessstudio. Zudem habe ich das Reisen vor einiger Zeit für mich entdeckt. Als ich dann auf Bali war, war es schwierig passende Fitnessstudios zu finden. Die meisten wurden einem zwar angezeigt, jedoch haben wichtige Informationen gefehlt. Beispielsweise der Preis für ein Tagesticket oder andere Tarife die angeboten werden, die Geräteausstattung, Sauberkeit und vieles mehr. Nach einer bösen Überraschung, als ich nämlich in einem kleinen, dreckigem Gym stand und dafür einen gefühlt viel zu hohen Tageseintritt zahlen musste, kam mir die Idee für eine App.Das Ganze funktioniert im Endeffekt so, dass man irgendeinen Ort auf der Welt suchen kann, und einem dann jegliche Gyms im gewünschten Umkreis angezeigt werden. Dazu findet man auf einem Blick die wichtigsten Informationen, sprich die Tarife die angeboten werden, Geräteherrsteller, Größe, aussagekräftige Bilder und natürlich Rezensionen. Das Ganze ist sehr übersichtlich und ansprechend designet. Das Wichtigste wird natürlich im Vorfeld sein, dass man Aufsehen erregt, sodass Fitnessstudiobesitzer oder User die Gyms mit den passenden Informationen und Bildern einstellen können. Zudem wäre es cool, wenn man direkt über die App schon einen Tageseintritt kaufen könnte, oder dass User der App bestimmte Rabatte oder ein Gratiseintritt bekommen.",Dass man nicht genug Aufsehen erregt und nicht genug Fitnesseinrichtungen oder Informationen hochgeladen werden.,https://www.kickstarter.com/projects/jannik2803/gymfinder-app-no-excuses-to-not-do-your-sports?ref=discovery_category_newest,jannik2803/gymfinder-app-no-excuses-to-not-do-your-sports,"Hey to everyone who's going to read this,My name is Jannik and I am 20 years old. I am passionate about sports, especially in the gym. I also discovered traveling for myself some time ago. When I was in Bali, it was difficult to find suitable gyms. Most of them were displayed and some important information was missing. For example, the price of a day ticket or other tariffs that are offered, the equipment, cleanliness and much more. After a nasty surprise, when I was standing in a small, dirty gym and had to pay a much too high entrance fee, I had the idea for this app.The whole thing works in such a way that you can search for any place in the world, and then you will be shown any gyms within the desired radius. In addition, one finds the most important information at a glance, i.e. the tariffs that are offered, equipment, size, meaningful pictures and of course reviews. The whole thing is very clear and attractively designed. The most important thing, of course, will be to attract attention in advance so that gym owners or users can set up the gyms with the appropriate information and pictures. In addition, it would be cool if it is possible to buy a day pass directly from the app, or that users of the app get certain discounts or free entry.",That not enough attention is paid and not enough gyms or information is uploaded.

Then you know what you are pledging for (Note: I don't require a minimum pledge, just what you think my food is worth :) )**I started this project because I have a passion for cooking and making unique and classic dishes with a twist.I come from a Middle-Eastern background and grew up with very flavorful foods. Some of my favorite home-made classics are kabobs, tabbouleh (salad), hommous (garbanzo bean and chickpea dip), foul mudammas (fava bean dip).These foods while great, gave me inspiration to create my own classics. My favorite dishes to make are my Guacamole, Indian-inspired tacos (By this, I do use a corn tortilla, but the Indian theme comes in with the flavor of the meat used). I enjoy making a good chicken, lamb, beef, or salmon kabob anytime as well. Some of my favorite sweet plates to make are grilled cinna-pineapple, chocolate dipped fruits of all kinds (watermelon, strawberries, orange slices, pineapple slices, apples, peaches).If funded, I will open a food truck in the heart of Seattle for street food (Capitol Hill) where I will be able to share my passion for cooking and delicious street food with those who are looking for an awesome tasting late night bite to eat. Please help me in making this a reality, I promise your tastebuds won't be disappointed!","Challenges and risks I am assessing is staffing.

Even in 2019 there has been no automatic toilet flush system for the home use, this show that our home toilet system still unchanged from the past. I've an idea about automatic toilet flush system for the home because I hated touching the toilet flush handle with my hand, sort of germ phobia especially in public places. At the beginning I plans to built my automatic toilet flush system using infrared sensor instead and I found out that infrared sensor are very sensitive to temperature fluctuation such as when use for home. Temperature fluctuations will cause the infrared sensor to detect the person at different ranges depending on how hot or cold the temperature and may cause automatic toilet flush to flush by itself from the wrong range reading. This is a very big problem for homes use because not all homes have steady temperature like in the mall or hotel because they use air conditioner. Other than infrared sensitivities to temperature fluctuation when using it to detect a person at a distance I also found out that infrared have a problem when detecting dark color clothes. Infrared sensor will be able to detect brighter color clothes at a longer distance when comparing to dark color clothes. When the infrared temperature sensitivities and dark color clothes problem combined it become very difficult to build a good reliable automatic toilet flush system for the home with infrared sensor. This is the main reason I built Magic Toilet Pro using ultrasonic sensor instead of infrared sensor.  Magic Toilet Pro are designed to be used in regular homes or office toilet with no modification to the existing toilet. It is very easy to install Magic Toilet Pro. Magic Toilet Pro comes with the Console unit and Flusher Device Box (the black box). You can install the Flusher Device Box on top of the toilet and all you need is to peel the tape underneath the Flusher Device Box and position it above the toilet flush handle then position the Console box in the middle of the toilet cover and you may need to run extension wires from your bathroom power outlet to near the toilet then plug the Magic Toilet Pro power adapter and turn it on and that's it and you now have a futuristic automatic toilet flush in your home! Most toilet don't have power socket nearby but there is at least one in the bathroom and all you have to do is to use extension wires and you can cleverly hides the extension wires from a plain sight. If you want to hide the Flusher Device Box then you can install it inside the toilet tank very easily too. All you need is to open the toilet tank cover and then hook the chain from the Flusher Device Box stick to the flapper inside the toilet tank and then hook the Flusher Device Box to the toilet tank lips and then close the toilet cover and that's it! Isn't that easy? The disadvantages of ultrasonic sensor requires more power than infrared sensor but ultrasonic sensor is the only way for home usage because of infrared sensor temperature sensitivities and dark color clothes detection problems. Magic Toilet Pro are equipped with Patent Pending MaxBatSave Technology and when powered by 12V 50,000mah rechargeable battery will be able to run around 2-3 months. You can buy this kind of battery from Amazon for around $130.Magic Toilet Pro very easy to use even equipped with all the advances features listed above.

In today's age, when most of the initial stage house search happens online, so you can narrow down the list of houses you would like to see in person, information like the age of the roof, the HVAC unit(s) in the house or when was the kitchen or bathroom last renovated/remodeled, etc. can prove very helpful and aid home buyers with selecting the right home for them. Just like before you buy a used car, you go to carfax.com to know the history of that car and the potential impact on its price, there is a need for information on the history of a house, specifically, things that may have an impact on the price of a house.DigsFact was founded to help people who are part of the process of buying, selling or investing in real estate, such as home buyers, home sellers, real estate agents, home inspection companies, lenders & appraisers and insurance companies. DigsFact will be launched in 15 major cities across United States by mid August 2018, and will be completely FREE for all users. The funds collected here will be used to launch DigsFact nationwide across these 15 cities listed below AND more importantly, to further expand it in other remaining cities across United States:I am VERY grateful to everyone who took the time to read through this, and for all your help and support that will ensure that millions of home buyers AND sellers can take advantage of DigsFact in the future. Your contribution will help millions of home buyers make a more informed decision - one of their life's biggest decisions.

With kNEEBU, these individuals (aka kNEEBU Providers) will have the opportunity to connect with their customers, and realize their dream of having their own business or source of income, without the burden of any upfront capital needed to set up their business or marketing cost or hassle of creating their website!! Simply, download and sign-up via the ""kNEEBU-Provider"" app.kNEEBU is FREE to join and allows its providers to keep 90% (sometimes even MORE) of the payment collected from the customers. Every provider goes through a BACKGROUND SCREENING, at NO COST to them.How many times have you needed a house cleaner or a nanny or a plumber or an HVAC person right away? Do you go on Google or Home Advisor or Angie's List or some other ""listing site"" that gives you their name and maybe, their contact information? If you use Home Advisor or some other similar ""listing site"", then you have to wait for emails from those sites which contains service provider's phone number. And then WHAT HAPPENS NEXT? Do you usually have any idea how expensive or economical their rates are? Do you get hold of the service providers when you call them, to understand their availability, their rates and schedule an appointment? You probably call them multiple times only to get their voicemail or if they answer their phone, they are either too expensive or not available to come to your house for at least next 1 to 2 week - if you are lucky!kNEEBU is here to CHANGE all that!! Services like Caregiver, Nurse, Home-Aide, Nanny, House Cleaner, Tutor, Painter, Electrician, Handyman, Mover, and all 40+ service categories like these - can be at your home ON DEMAND, when you need them! Best of all, kNEEBU is FREE to join!You shouldn't have to wait for some snow plowing truck to come and clean your driveway when someone in your neighborhood may have a heavy duty snow blower and does not mind earning extra income while helping their neighbors. You shouldn't have to go through tons of bureaucracy and unnecessary paperwork and delay to get a nurse come to your house, when you have a certified nurse within your community, who happens to work at a nearby hospital only 3 days a week and is available/willing to earn additional income while helping folks within the community, for another couple of days per week.kNEEBU was launched as a PILOT in the Greater Chicago Area in late September 2018. Our plan is to learn from this pilot phase over the next 6-9 months, and then scale it across United States first, and then globally.In order to have a successful pilot, we need to raise awareness about kNEEBU in the Greater Chicago Area and be able to make changes to the app based on the feedback we receive, to the product before we roll it out nationwide. The app is currently designed for individuals and businesses but as we talk to more business owners, we are building a roadmap of features that are required by majority of businesses and WE WILL NEED THIS FUNDING TO MAKE SUCH PRODUCT IMPROVEMENTS AS QUICKLY AS POSSIBLE:Additional USEFUL INFORMATION:All the action happens through our two apps, available on iOS & Android:We have a website as well (https://kNEEBU.com), which is only informational for now, but continues to evolve.Here's some DEMO Videos:https://drive.google.com/file/d/1L7MojUk5kWUNEwVTu23tTxHRRz_dPEd6/view?usp=sharinghttps://drive.google.com/file/d/1X35ztQUbQfXOz_VHpirQN2CPNF-HFZBC/view?usp=sharing","Biggest risk is to not have enough funding to carry this forward, after all the hard work, time, money and energy from the team has already been invested to launch it in the Greater Chicago Area."

The goal will be to show people how to safely operate these machines and also get the best performance. I have seen that children and their parents alike are mesmerized by the 3D printers as they do their work, and they all want to know where or how they can use one.So, I hope that I have done a fair job of convincing you why I believe that this 3D printing retail store is not only a good idea, but a necessity.Please donate whatever you feel appropriate, and thank you for your help in bringing 3D Printing to the Bay Area","The biggest challenge of my project will be to educate as many people as possible about 3D printing.

I want people to be able to fully realize the capabilities that 3D printing can offer them in terms of expressing their creativity, or fixing everyday problems with tools that they create, or even simply cutting the time between idea and invention.Everyday it seems that 3D printing has taken on another practical use in some industry where it seemed pointless just the day before, and the more people that are educated and involved in the ""maker"" movement.... the better.",https://www.kickstarter.com/projects/1552697291/heavenly-taste-toffee?ref=discovery_category_newest,1552697291/heavenly-taste-toffee,"Hello All,My name is Matt Elkins (Owner / Candymaker)Heavenly Taste Toffee is a family tradition spanning three generations. Invented by my grandmother and scrolled away in her recipe book; my mom, Marilyn Elkins, passed on the recipe to me.I pride myself on using rich Guittard Chocolate manufactured right here in Burlingame, CA, and C&H Sugar made in Crockett, CA. My policy is to source as many ingredients and supplies from sources within driving distance of my kitchen.Each pan of toffee is hand made with care, which is why it's so darn good! It even won a few Bronze Medals for my Milk Almond, Coconut Macadamia, and Cherry Pistachio toffees in 2015 from TasteTV's International Chocolate Salon Top Artisan Toffee Awards!!We also just sold at the Ghiradelli Chocolate Festival 2015 in San Francisco which was a huge success! Here are a few pictures of people enjoying our toffeeMy toffee is sold atMy rewards are basically a pre-order of toffee for the Christmas / Hannukah / New Years season, and boy do we have a lot of toffee for you!Check us out on Yelp to see what others have to say about us :)http://www.yelp.com/biz/heavenly-taste-toffee-danvilleI am asking for $10,000 to cover the cost of operations. So far, it has just been me running the farmer's markets, doing wholesale, operating the website, making the toffee, etc.However, Heavenly Taste Toffee has developed a big following, and I would like to expand to other farmer's markets, festivals, and retail stores around the bay area. This means hiring people to run those booths, having the materials for the booths themselves (tables, signs, packaging), and money to pay my employees.I would also like to improve the packaging to make it more fun and inviting (not that the toffee doesn't look great on its own). This means custom printed packaging.Costs for operating farmer's markets are astronomical. For example, health permits sometimes cost $500 per county, on top of hundreds of dollars for fees per market, and sometimes a city tax.... not to mention the stall fees at the market and paying someone to run it!This $10,000 will allow me to expand into SF, San Jose, and North Bay areas. Since literally every single person I have ever met loves Heavenly Taste Toffee, I know that I will find the necessary support to help bring this delicious, sinfully good treat to more people than ever!Keep in mind that so far, it has just been me running all of this (for real). So imagine what Heavenly Taste Toffee could become with just a little outside help :)","As with any food product, if it is truly delicious it will have quite the following. If my project is successful the biggest challenge will be packaging the products to be shipped. This can easily be handled by hiring part time workers in order to increase the speed of packaging. As for production, I can easily produce more than 120 lbs of toffee per week by myself, so I don't anticipate that to be a problem."

A 20-year journey which began after the passing of my dear mom to depression, she was my teacher, arts champion and culture guru. A feisty feminist to add too! I grew up in a small manufacturing turned tourist town of Ipoh, Malaysia in the 80s and 90s. Void of large shopping malls and clubs, the humble TV was my creative escape as I fantasized about being on the set of 21 Jump Street, Doogie Howser MD, Twin Peaks, the Misfits, Beverly Hills 90210, the great Michael Jackson's Thriller entourage and being a backup singer for crooner Bryan Adams.A survivor of severe depression, dengue fever, domestic violence and societal oppression has pushed me to chase my dreams at all cost. Exotic Pearls is my way of saying thanks to the female gurus and artists that have molded me into who I am. It is a gift to my hometown of Ipoh, a valley of dreams where anything is possible if our imagination and thoughts are not restrained or oppressed.It is my desire to use the power of media and film to shine a light on the struggles of mental illness, domestic violence, gender inequality and political bias. It is also my wish to use my gifts and talents to my best ability to honor my earlier teachers, create positive change and help boost the tourism sector in my small hometown so that my fellow Ipohites can have a chance of a better quality of life.

In 1963 Andy Warhol said, ""I want to be a machine."" Similarly, yet within a very different context,Sören Kierkegaard wrote in Fear and Trembling (under the nameJohannes de silentio) ""For the moment of faith must ever be made by virtue of the absurd."" Thus, this project is my attempt to become machine in both performance and practice. To mechanize (as Warhol did) the act of art production, and to carry it to an absurd (absolute) dimension. ""The single individual is higher than the universal,…[he] determines his relation to the universal by his relation to the absolute.”It will include the production of these elements over the course of one year paralleling the typical ('universal') work schedule of an American (ie ""daily grind"" or ""work machine""). During this time (performing the artist/robot) I'll be producing the following items, necessary traces to index the performance itself.- 10,000 Signed and numbered ink prints (x of 10,000) (average of 40 prints per day)- 5,000 Signed and numbered original ink drawings (x of 5,000) (average of 20 drawings per day)- 3,000 Signed paintings(average of 12 paintings per day)",,https://www.kickstarter.com/projects/866184182/over-under-the-fiscal-cliff?ref=discovery_category_newest,866184182/over-under-the-fiscal-cliff,"OVER / UNDER: The Fiscal Cliff is an attempt to document this very important period in American history.

That's why we've started our pledges at the ""Crazy Low"" price of £1 for the e-book.Being   young is a lonely place. Max has friends, some money, and dreams ofsuccess – but  taking   responsibility for  how he got here leaves himalone,   facing unemployment, guilt and even   prison.Antonia has  success   in  Sing for Me - a popular TV song contest, butshe  feels alone. Her father doesn't support her. She is almost famous, butall the money and fame in the world can’t buy her the love she desperatelycraves.Written by Rachel Rouncefield & Morten Toft and co-created with young people from across Europe, this action-packed story is sure to make you think, laugh, cry and ultimately take it's theme of change-making and act for yourself.Step 1: Read the fictional adventures of Max, Antonia and their friends and enjoy the story.Step 2: Go deeper using the reflective pages and questions at the end of the book.Step 3: If you like it, get further involved by creating something yourself and sharing through www.maxandantonia.com or from careaboutYOU Facebook.We realise we're not as young as we used to be, and through 25 years of working with and for young people, we're both committed to empowering them to run their own lives and decide upon the changes they and their communities want to make. So we co-created and workshopped using forum theatre techniques and asking three basic questions:1. What's the best thing about being young?2. What's the worst thing about being young?3. Who's around to support you when you're young?When we asked ourselves those questions we began to realise there wasn't one simple theme emerging - the picture above shows our inital ""scenes"" from our own discussions (I think there were over 48 different dilemmas in that one day's writing):Authors, Educators, Facilitators of Change, and Global Empowerment Agents for Young People.Rachel Rouncefield worked for many years with Young People’s Services in the UK, where she managed to integrate local youth services and reduce youth unemployment in an area where young people faced difficulty and disadvantage. Rachel now teaches and writes reality-based fiction and plays for young adults.Morten Toft has a background in personal development, innovation, leadership and change. He is also the author of several books and holds lectures and courses on these subjects. Morten was part of the Butterfly Project in England and Humor &Health (now Danish Hospital Clowns), two other successful community service organizations. He says:“All people have a talent, a greater potential and the opportunity to make a difference in the community, in their own lives and those of others. The question is how to find it, and use it.”",We've written the book - with many joys and tears and tantrums - so that bit is done!We have a super designer waiting to do the work and put the finishing touches to the cover.The challenge is now for us to get enough edited final versions printed and formatted - and distributed to young people as far and wide as we can.,https://www.kickstarter.com/projects/1303205938/bring-changemakers-to-all-young-people-around-the-world?ref=discovery_category_newest,1303205938/bring-changemakers-to-all-young-people-around-the-world,"If you are a young person you can read the story about Max & Antonia as entertainment. But...you can also decide to do something more:We believe every young person can choose to become a Changemaker and make a difference. This project offers young people the tools to achieve their own dreams and goals and add to the change they need in the world right now.This is a fast paced, action and emotion packed story.Max and Antonia are from different backgrounds but holding out for what they want from life. Nothing ever seems simple - because nothing ever is! The very people who should support and help, seem caught up in their own dramas. Even friends betray you if their dreams are at risk of being trampled on. Max has friends, some money, and dreams of success, but taking responsibility for how he got here leaves him alone, facing unemployment, guilt and even prison. Antonia has success in a song contest, but she feels alone. Her father is not there for her. She is famous, but all the money and fame in the world can't buy her the love she desperately craves.Rachel talk about ChangemakersWe started to talk to young people about the dilemmas and issues that mattered to them. We ran workshops using Forum Theatre and Thought sharing techniques. We ran story development sessions to ensure our characters were realistic and relatable. In short, we co-created with young people to come finally to the “Changemakers” story we have produced. Here's a taste of how it all began with young people in our 2012 workshop run by our organisation Care About You.Video from 2012 Co-creation WorkshopIf you're a parent/youth worker/supportive adult you will no doubt want to support young people too. Help us to offer this story and development questions as an opportunity for young people to take co-responsibility with us all to develop their own approaches to change - even more so in the current situation of physical isolation.In the meantime join the Facebook page Max & Antonia to keep in touch and be part of our Live Events.See what young people have to say about it here: Young people on the Facebook PageChangemakers is written as a young adult novel; the main characters are in their early adulthood and it has themes and issues often brought up in young people’s co-creation workshops that happened as part of the story development. However adults, parents, carers and those who have been young at some point in their lives have also read drafts of the novel and fed back that they too find the story inspiring for them and that it has helped them understand and converse with young people they live with – so watch out they may “steal” this copy!1. To bring the novel CHANGEMAKERS to schools and colleges all over the world.2. To continue the co-creation process with young people that has already started a Changemaker movement.To create three additional short stories. This story process has powerful long-term potential.3. Get CHANGEMAKERS onto screen.We want to create a compelling film which can strengthen the rising tide of CHANGEMAKERS around the world.","We are really good at developing creative projects projects and supporting young people to change things  for themselves, but getting a wider message out via consistent branding and marketing is not our biggest strength. That's why we've teamed up with a wonderful publishing company to help us get this story and the personal development workbook out to more young people. We're hopeful this process will see the e-book and printed copies available to supporters by September."

It requires hours and hours of footage. Stop motion. Sound editing. Special effects. Digital compositing. And google doesn't even know what that last thing is! But we can do it. By the grace of the dice Gods and the mighty God Emperor of Man we shall overcome. For we shall know no fear.We have done it before, folks. We have produced film and theater both and all and it has been fantastic. We have a baller cast and crew, and a whole legion of supporters out there, just waiting to kick this epic down the road. Into the warp. Hamlet is long. Warhamlet is longer. When Kenneth Branagh directed himself in Hamlet, it was 242 minutes long. Just a shade past four hours, for those not  math educated.

We weren't sure if we wanted to show you this, but what the hell? To preface things, this test footage encapsulates the questions of what our risks and challenges are, which is to do an unfinished, poor quality work. Also, nobody might show up. It is not like there is a union or anything. But, if we all began projects based on expecting anyone to show up, we would not do any projects at all.",https://www.kickstarter.com/projects/1618066760/river-research-vessel-victorious?ref=discovery_category_newest,1618066760/river-research-vessel-victorious,"This project is a proof of concept for flow based habitation, specifically as it relates to power needs. Earth is unique among the planets in its surface water, but flow-able material, in general, is a component of a number of surfaces. This project seeks to experiment with the feasibility of carbon-neutral and potentially limitless power production if a source of flowing materials can be found and harnessed. The vehicle for this experiment is a dilapidated boat in Saint Paul, Minnesota. Its incredibly low cost allows for the 50/50 funding goal of vessel and retrofitting. Ultimately, the vessel will be transported to Bemidji, Minnesota, where an investigation into sustainable, non-dam hydro turbines could be a concrete and feasible solution to sustainable and carbon neutral living. The primary goal of the experiment is to test a number of underwater turbines from an anchored point. There have been a number of progressive experiments with sub-aquatic turbines as power sources, but most of them are tidal experiments, and ignore the vast river networks inherent to a number of biomes available to us.Available to the vessel will be secondary power supplies of a less experimental nature, that are meant to provide variable testing for weather and flow, record this data, compile it, distribute it off shore, and make it available to the public at large. Below is the traditional power budget. Lateral to the secondary power goals are the very real need to find suitable grid tie in solutions that equitably distribute power where it needs to be, when it needs to be there. As an experiment, it will be a matter of recording power consumption and use, and provide interesting insight into potentially carbon negative lifestyles.A tertiary objective of this experiment is to broadcast it, free, and sustainably, for as long as people care about knowing. The potential outcomes of this experiment would place potentially unlimited power without dams into the hands of millions of people, struggling in developing nations. Provided those people have a river. The broadcast ability of the station is limited by the successes of the primary and secondary objectives. Moreover, it could all be crazy! People!? Living on BOATS!?! In THE WINTER!? In Minnesota?Ultimately the entire venture is a proof of concept that reliable and near infinite power can be harvested and sustained through a moored habitation placed in range of liquid material. There is very little sunlight that reaches Titan, but if, below the surface, there is regular movement of predictable currents, a sub-ice habitation could be constructed, using this technology, to solve power needs in an environment that provides little in way of other resources. Which is why the sub category for this venture involves space travel.Moreover, the ability to test sub-aquatic turbines in a reliable and sustainable way is reason enough to fund this venture.","Because of the television show Fargo, everyone considers the people of Bemidji country rubes who, in 2006, somehow all decided to dress and act as if it were 1978. After everyone was gassed. This is not a direct commentary on Fargo, merely an observation. The boat may sink. As a disclosure, it bears mentioning that we, the scientists, are not willing to go down with the ship. We claim pre-preemptive salvage rights. But there is room for Jack and Rose on the lifeboat at the end of this picture. Much like Warhamlet, people may not care to fund lunacy. Evidence would prove contrary. I may not be able to make a snappy video. I may be too drenched in terror to do that. The Mastress might shut the whole works down with a well timed explosion. I may not actually be a scientist, or an artist, or an astronaut, for aren't we all hurtling through space? But. I can assure you I am ALMOST a scientist. Which should count for a lot. In the age of the interweb. Wyoming may explode and then we all die in a sub-nuclear winter."

Users are sometimes stuck printing other objects than the ones they created.  The software to make things can be expensive and hard to learn. So not only did we create a world class 3D Printer, the Q, we also created a 3D Design program that is easy to use, in fact if you can use modeling clay you can use Eureka. The best part is that Eureka comes with the Q printer and will take you almost no time to learn and be a real 3D object maker.From the first moment you get your Q 3D Printer, take it out of the box, install the included software, you will be able to make your first object in no time and print it right away. Your object, not some downloaded object that everyone else has printed, it will be yours.The Q printer is fast, sturdy and very cool looking. It is backed by a a great warranty, and comes with everything you need to be a noteable 3D Maker right out of the box.If you are a person who likes total control, the Q system is fully open source so you can change the system to your exact wants and needs.The Q is affordable. The Q is fast, quiet and it looks great sitting on your desk. The Q is made of sheet metal, it is sturdy. Once you set up the Q, which takes only a few moments, the Q stays calibrated because of the design and the fact that its made out of metal. Your Q printer can print with almost no maintenance, change the filament and and let the Q printer work.The Q printer also is very accurate and holds its calibration because its metal not wood or plastic. Put your Q to work.Why we need your help?First you need to know you will not be paying for development, the Q is ready to go. We are ready to begin production the day we meet our goal so we can get you your Q printer as fast as possible.We want to keep the pricing of the Q as low as possible, in order to do so we have made great deals with our suppliers but as always they want volume, this first production run is based on the best pricing we could attain with our parts vendors. You will get a production printer, made in the USA by our dedicated staff, with a 6 month simple to understand warranty. ""If the Q breaks for any reason in the first 6 months, simply return the printer to us here in Las Vegas, we will fix it and send it back to you as fast as we can. You pay the shipping to us and we will return the printer to you with free shipping. In many cases if there is a problem our tech staff will be able to help you get up and running via email. For those who are local, you can simply bring your Q printer to our shop and we will fix it while you wait. If we decide your printer is beyond repair we will in the first 6 months give you a brand new printer. ","Our biggest challenge is getting to you the inventor, the maker the creator.  We are ready to begin production and foresee no major obstacles to delivering the Q printer on a timely basis.  Our vendors and manufacturing is ready to go.  All we need is your support to get the first production run in QueWe have spent months perfecting the software and hardware so it is now ready for your use.....Also our software has been tested and is ready to use from day one.

You can get a dual head printer and get 2 colors from the printer but this limitation holds makers back from creating great objects with dynamic color. Our world is full of color and so should your 3d printer.be. Chameleon brings your 3d printer alive with color. Its like landing smack dab in the middle of a rainbow that you can use.Chameleon is a simple to use filament coloring system that works WHILE you are printing. Chameleon colorizes on the fly, to change colors, simply change the ink cartridge to the color you want and its done. Here is a video that shows you Chameleon setup and use. See its so easy even a caveman could do it.Our specially designed inks and cartridge are easy to handle and last a long time. Each color cartridge can color up to two football fields of filament from end to end. The end of the cartridge has a patent pending design that colorizes the filament evenly and completely. Just remember to put the cap back on when you are not using a cartridge so that the ink does not dry up.Here are a few images of some objects we colorized with Chameleon, just imagine what you can do.So as you can see, all you need is Chameleon and your creativity and the rest is color magic. Remember, Chameleon is easy to use, no fiddling with filament starting and changing, just change the cartridge and its done.The next big question is which level do you want to support, from 16 colors to 64 colors.","RISK ASSESMENT...

https://www.kickstarter.com/projects/1029342742/build-your-own-tiny-home?ref=discovery_category_newest,1029342742/build-your-own-tiny-home,"From YouTube to Tiny House Nation on FYI, the tiny house movement is sweeping across the nation and becoming increasingly popular, and for good reasons too. Tiny homes offer many benefits and you'll typically hear more common benefits, such as financial freedom, less clutter, more control and management of your time, etc. But is this lifestyle ideal for everyone? Maybe not, but for those who are willing to give it a shot and are intrigued by this lifestyle, you will find that anyone can do it with the right knowledge and instruction. That is what I am proposing to offer, a good example and comprehensive instructions on how to do it yourself with little or no experience and in an affordable manner! I will be producing DIY Book and DVD on building a tiny home which will include plans and graphic renderings of the project. All projects need careful research and planning to be successful, thus I have put together some strategic phases of this project to easily break it down and complete this project on time.The planning phase has already begun with this project. I have researched tiny homes extensively. There are several things to consider when making the transition to a tiny home. How much space is needed and how do we use space effectively? What type of trailer do you need? What about laws and building codes? Bottom line costs and estimates? These are just a few things that I have researched and planned out for this project. For this project, I will be setting a firm budget of $10,000 from start to finish. I have put together several estimates and anticipated many costs for this project including the trailer, building materials, fees and appliances. This is no easy task, but can be accomplished with the help of friends, family, penny pinching and sweat equity. I decided that I wanted to do as much of the work as possible to avoid the higher price tag and demonstrate that anyone can do it. Crowd-funding success will be achieved through http://kickingitforward.org and other marketing strategies.Before construction starts, all aspects of the project need to be prepared. This includes finances, build location, acquiring materials and careful documenting of the process. I am well prepared and have many of the resources needed to complete this project which includes the actual tiny house build and development of the DIY guide. The major component that is missing from the preparation of this project is the finances. With your help, we can accomplish this and move forward towards successful completion.This is where the fun really begins! The duration of the construction phase will take about 6 months. This is a realistic expectation for the scope and size of the project for one or two people. The biggest problem people experience with trying to complete projects is funding. Based on the pledged amount, funding should not cause any delays and the project will be paid and planned for adequately. In the event that resources or funding may be limited, I am prepared to complete the project through personal sources of funding. However, I am extremely confident that this project will be operating within the budget. Brief videos will be posted on YouTube periodically during the construction phase, giving an update and progress report for this project. Anticipated date of completion for this project will be May 2015.This is the final stage of the project and will be primarily focused on producing and editing the book and video tutorial. Considerations and reflections on the project will be made in regards to unanticipated problems, transitioning to the lifestyle and possible improvements. This will be an equally important phase of the project as my goal is to share this experience with others and provide a clear understanding of the steps, skills and knowledge necessary to be successful in similar projects.In an nutshell, this is the project at a glance and what I hope to accomplish. I strongly believe that the tiny house movement should be embraced and taken seriously when considering the advantages on our environment, our society and an improved quality of life. This DIY project will provide an invaluable resource and instructional guide for someone who wants to get started in tiny homes. Please help make this dream a reality and let's pioneer a future together!","There are two potential challenges that will need to be considered with completing this project. The first challenge is time. Like most Americans, I have a full-time job and hours that sometimes go beyond the normal 8-5 routine. I am extremely dedicated to this project and will be disciplined to work afternoons and on weekends to complete it on time.

Tiny homes offer many benefits and you'll typically hear more common reasons, such as financial freedom, less clutter, more control and management of your time, etc. For those who are willing to give it a shot and are intrigued by this lifestyle, you will find that anyone can do it with the right knowledge and instruction. That is what I am proposing to offer, a good example and comprehensive instructions on how to do it yourself with little or no experience and ifor less than $10,000! I will be producing DIY Book and DVD on building a tiny home which will include plans and graphic renderings of the project. The planning phase has already begun with this project. I have researched tiny homes extensively. There are several things to consider when making the transition to a tiny home. How much space is needed and how do we use space effectively? What type of trailer do you need? What about laws and building codes? Bottom line costs and estimates? These are just a few things that I have researched and planned out for this project. For this project, I will be setting a firm budget of $10,000 from start to finish. I have put together several estimates and anticipated many costs for this project including the trailer, building materials, fees and appliances. This is no easy task, but it can be accomplished with the help of friends, family, penny pinching and plenty of sweat. With a little help from Kickstarter backers and Kicking It Forward, I hope this goal can be reached.Before construction starts, all aspects of the project need to be prepared. This includes finances, build location, acquiring materials and careful documenting of the process. I am well prepared and have many of the resources needed to complete this project which includes the actual tiny house build and development of the DIY guide. The major component that is missing from the preparation of this project is the finances. With your help, we can accomplish this and move forward towards successful completion.This is where the fun really begins! The duration of the construction phase will take about 6 months. This is a realistic expectation for the scope and size of the project for one or two people. Brief videos will be posted on YouTube periodically during the construction phase, giving an update and progress report for this project. Anticipated date of completion for this project will be July 2015.This is the final stage of the project and will be primarily focused on producing and editing the book and video tutorial. Considerations and reflections on the project will be made in regards to unanticipated problems, transitioning to the lifestyle and possible improvements. This will be an equally important phase of the project as my goal is to share this experience with others and provide a clear understanding of the steps, skills and knowledge necessary to be successful in similar projects.In an nutshell, this is the project at a glance and what I hope to accomplish. I strongly believe that the tiny house movement should be embraced and taken seriously when considering the advantages on our environment, our society and an improved quality of life. This DIY project will provide an invaluable resource and instructional guide for someone who wants to get started in tiny homes. Please help make this project a reality and let's pioneer a new future together!","There are two potential challenges that will need to be considered with completing this project. The first challenge is time. Like most, I have a full-time job and hours that sometimes go beyond the normal 8-5 routine. I am extremely dedicated to this project and will be working diligently and consistently to complete it on time. Maintaining a balance between family and work will be important though.The second challenge will be budget. The amount pledged is operating on a very lean budget. To stay within the budget, I have planned on identifying and reducing the costs through careful evaluation of needs versus wants. Although materials for this project do not have to be the cheapest in quality and price, I can put effort into finding second-hand materials or clearance items to be flexible and stay within the budget."

My tool of choice is of course my camera. I create images with an artistic flare. I seek to invite the viewer into the soul of the image. I want my viewers to walk away understanding they were viewing something more than a mere image, but an invitation into one’s epic story.By Epic I mean “Big”. There is a largeness, a bigness that very few of us enter into even though the summons, the invitation is there calling us all the days of our life. My job as an image maker is to provoke my subjects who will ultimately become viewers to pause and gaze at the timeless image and began to understand their role, their part in the larger dynamic of life. I want the image I create to take my subjects from where they are (here) to the large place and purpose they were designed to fulfill (there).And yet there is a larger vision that I seek to unfold to you.

A post apocalyptic series, that focused on surviving in a postwar-creature-infested world, with no future to be seen. Everyone lost, and oblivious to happiness. A world where not only do you have to go against the ""Risen""(the living dead), but also go against the corruption that is trying to wipe out humanity. Whether they'd have your back, or if they're out there to put you down, and keep moving forward. A show titled, ""The Eidolon"".July of 2016, I was able to find amazingly passionate, and driven people who not only drove miles from Oshawa, London, Caledon, Burlington, and Ottawa, but also were willing to do it for free. It humbled me.But...with everything, money is required for a project of this sort. The production was stalled due to the lack of funds to support the production, and the fact that my family were in refusal and the lack of support from them.The Campaign will be divided into various factors. The first $5,000 will go towards camera equipment. Once that is done, the next campaign with a goal of $5,000 will go towards production props, the third campaign with the same goal will go towards the special effects, and last but not least the fourth campaign that will be used to pay all the cast and crew will have a goal of $7,500. Everyone who puts in their all and gives it their best effort to be in such a project deserves to be compensated. For everyone who donates will forever be gratified, and given the right rewards.Campaign #1: Camera EquipmentCampaign #2: PropsCampaign #3: Special FXCampaign #4: WagesIn terms of how soon, patience is a super important factor for myself, and the show. We are in the late stages of pre-production, so we are getting everything ready for when we finally shoot. We are in hope that the funds will be raised by the end of January! That's our aim, and hopefully we'll do it as a team!Thank you!Vineeth Vomaseelan (portraying Myles Jenison): ""Growing up in an Indian family, it is difficult to receive support from my parents as their perspective towards a theatre program is different than mine. My goal is to show my parents that I can succeed in what I love doing and show them that acting is my passion. I cannot see myself doing anything else in life, except acting. I need to prove to not only my parents, but the future generation that you do not need to become a doctor or an engineer to be successful in life; it is about doing something you love, something that pumps up your adrenaline, gets you excited, and keeps you motivated. Acting and performing is not my hobby, it is what drives me to the best I can be.I decided to join the team of The Eidolon to play Myles Jenison becuase i was offered the role by a close friend of mine, none other than our director.

It should be more. It should have great story telling, and Eidolon brings that to the table, when it explores all the dynamics of each character. Exploring how they deal with survival, and cope with their losses. ","The Eidolon faces the usual risks that occurs in Film & Television Production. If the director somehow manages to get bitten by a creature, or if a creature drags the camera man away! All of these are possible, believe me!In all seriousness, a ton of challenges that we’ll face are the availabilities for every cast, and crew member. The project is destined to take at least 2 weeks for an entire episode, and we need to figure out which days accommodate the best for each and every cast member. Whether it’s the main actor, or a secondary role, all the way to extras.Distribution is a HUGE challenge with low-budget projects, but our producer is going to help find a company that loves the pilot, and try to get it to the right network!With respect to rewards fulfillment, we will be working with a professional fulfillment partner to get all your DVDs, digital downloads, and other goodies delivered safely and on schedule.We’ll be sending regular updates about our progress to all backers, so you’ll be the first to know about what’s going on. The biggest risk is that the show is never picked up by a large network which can ensure us that we have funding for future episodes. One of the biggest factors to our success is funding.

Their request yields a list of qualified professionals.(Note: they can click on any professional and view their credentials like; licenses, certifications, references, ratings, and reviews from other users like the asset owner)3. After the request is defined, it plugs the professional directly into the workflow management system to commence satisfying the asset owner's request on the selected asset.4. System defined protocols and user defined protocols require, for example: Contractors to take photos of the property when they arrive from their mobile device, which notifies the asset owner's system that there is a contractor on site. There are a copious amount of other procedure triggering protocols in order to fully automate an Asset Owner's business.5. When the task is ready to be closed out by the 3rd party professional, there are protocols set for quality control that require a sign-off by either the asset owner, 3rd party inspector, internally or externally maintained contractor, or even a real estate agent.6. If a sign-off is refused/failed based on the performance of the 3rd party professional, the system generates a notification to the professional to correct the issues noted by the non-signer.7. Last, the task closes out, pushing the payables/receivables into the accounting segment of the system, for full reporting.I have spent the past 2 years in development on this project, and a lot of my own money trying to get it launched. Phase 1 will be launched for ALPHA testing this month (February) Your contributions will help our marketing efforts, design consulting, and the next 2 phases of development.","Risks:I have already overcame all of the risks of getting PropertyManageMATE to market because I believe in it.  I have spent so much of my time and money on development before requesting funding, because I am an individual that always delivers on my promises, and I know if you can see this system in action, you will want to be part of this revolution and help me branch it into other industries.The risks that are on my shoulders to overcome in the near future are:1. gaining traction2. market saturation3. building the brand4. competition5. staying ahead of the trendsI began investing in real estate when I was 25, with less than $500 to my name.  I bought 5 houses, developed a system to manage my company and success, and turned my company into a million dollar real estate business within 2 years.  I have proven that I can overcome obstacle that gets in my way, and break barriers by creative structuring and problem solving.  I appreciate you taking a chance on me, and I am confident that I won't let you down!",https://www.kickstarter.com/projects/168882658/save-28-41-on-buying-a-house-disruptive-real-estat?ref=discovery_category_newest,168882658/save-28-41-on-buying-a-house-disruptive-real-estat,"Fact #1Buying and selling real estate can cost 3-6% in brokers fees. 6% is $6,000 on a $100,000 house.Fact #2The average retail house sells for 25%-35% more than the average foreclosure in the same area. That same $100,000 house just cost you $35,000 more buying it at retail, and an additional $6,000 in fees.Fact #3There are hundreds of thousands of properties each year which are sold and not recorded in public records. This is from real estate wholesalers who sell their properties to real estate investors.Fact #4Real estate investors in Tuscon, AZ have been making over 50% profit on their properties. There's nothing wrong with making money, but there is a point where people feel taken advantage of.One of the largest problems with the housing industry, is the inflation of home values, forcing home buyers to be financially irresponsible. (Because they might not know that they can save 41% on a house)  Then a majority of home buyers take out a 30 year mortgage, and over the course of the mortgage, they end up paying 2 times what the market value of the house was at the time.  When the inflation recedes, home values drop.  If the homeowner is affected (Directly or indirectly) by the recession (Either by their boss's business, or local economy) then they can be upside down on their home, or even worse be facing foreclosure.Most real estate agents are fantastic for selling properties close to retail and they are great at navigating complex paperwork, scheduling showings, setting up closings... We suggest working with an agent when you have the time and don't need the money. But if you are looking for a great buy on a property or if you need to get multiple offers on your house right now, then Zinksy is the perfect option.Zinksy currently connects real estate wholesalers to real estate investors, saving investors hundreds of thousands of dollars since our soft-launch in February. We have found a way to connect homeowners who want to sell their properties directly to cash-paying investors. And connecting real estate wholesalers directly to home buyers who want a good deal. This ultimately eliminates brokers' fees, and can help save the over 5 million people per year who buy houses a great deal of money.Together we can solve a problem which hits close to home for all of us.Check out our site!

Then one day, speaking to one of my friends, I finally figured it out… because everyone understands the fundamental principles on how a house is built. So, I translated it into terms used in the building of a house, hoping that my friend might understand… and she did!Since that time, I’ve had the idea of this book on my mind... about how I compare the way houses are architected and built to how software development teams architect and build software. Actually we use many of the same principles, such as starting off with a good solid foundation. With out that, the project is doomed to fail. So, if you know people that don’t understand the software development world, and if you suffer thruogh some of the fustrations of trying to make them understand, then this book “What If Software Developers Built Houses” is for you!",No real risks with this project.

Two girls, very creative, with lots of skill and experience in their field that wants to make something unique together.Linda is living in Oslo. She learnt crochet from her grandmother and her mum as a young girl, and then after some unforeseen difficulties gave her the chance to start making this into a business, she grabbed it wholeheartedly. She gets inspired by everything around her, as well as books, magazines and www. For her to be able to share her creativity is a dream come true.Vesna moved from Serbia to Oslo in February of 2015. During the last five years she developed her jewellery business in Serbia and she is determined to continue her work in Norway. She is very much inspired with epic fantasy, mythology and history. She is also very interested in recycling and it is big part of her designs.We both have creative minds and very much the same way of thinking. Although we are both from Europe, we come from different cultures. That helps us to see things from different angles and to learn from each other. Our creative minds tied us together in this project. The first idea which popped into our heads is to collaborate and make matching products - shawls and pins. Then we started to develop this idea. We could make artistic project with following story. The shawls are going to be made of pure, high quality Norwegian wool. Pins and brooches will be made from recycled copper wire. Since we both have an interest in history, the main theme will be Vikings. A big part of our project will be our blog where everyone will be able to follow our work and learn more about crochet, jewellery making, recycling, Norwegian wool, the history of Vikings and much more. Our whole idea is therefore to join quality, cultural heritage and recycling in beautiful applied wearable art pieces which we hope to exhibit in a gallery in Oslo when it is all done. We both share that passion for creative work and same desire to run our own businesses. From the very beginning this project showed us how much in common we have and that gave us more energy to carry on. This project started out as an idea to make matching products and just in one month developed to an artistic project with so many other elements involved. Although we are still in planning stage we already learned so much from our research and brainstorming. That is why we are so passionate about it. It gave us opportunity to do something new, to gain experience, to learn and grow and to make some beautiful art.Our style will be based on the old fashion with a very modern twist. We want to take elements from Norwegian history and nature and adjust it to today's trends. The whole design will be based on elements of Norwegian nature on one side and Viking art and symbols on the other. We will use wool like the Vikings did, so a part of our product will be based on a material which is rooted in Norwegian history. The other part of the product will be made from repurposed material - electric wires which people do not use anymore.How we design our products?We brainstorm on regular bases. Once a week we have meeting to discuss ideas and how our final product should look like. We are talking about inspiration, some new ideas and further steps in this project. Then we go each to our own, sit down and sketch.Vesna is doing research of Vikings art and then draw shapes inspired by that, so it can be turned into wire art. Linda is making some pattern samples to see what can fit and match with brooch designs.Then we exchange sketches and discuss them. Next step in design is making prototypes. When we are satisfied with that, we are ready for making the final products.The overall process of product making will be shown on our blog - http://woolandpin.blogspot.no/- There you will be able to follow every step of this project, from the first sketches to the final product. We will guide you through our story with posts and photos. During our making process we will also like to hear your thoughts, so feel free to ask, comment and discuss with us about anything and everything you find interesting on our blog. We are also planning small giveaways and everyone who backs us up, will ofcourse recive an invitation for the gallyr viewing.

We could end up without any gallery to show of our art, we could end up with to litle funding, we could find ourselves arguing, and the list goes on and on. But, when this is said, from the getgo we agreed to talk to eachother if we had any issues with anything. Also there are alternatives, like we could borrow the venue for the local volunteercenter, we could do the project on a lower scale and so on. But we do not want to limit ourselves from the start, and we are therefor asking you guys for any help on the funding side. Thank you!"

But by criticizing them in a comedic way, we are giving rise to yet another one. Our animated series is there to help you see how. 3 Real Records is an animated series based on the lives of 3 friends who are pursuing success in the commercial music industry, while experiencing everyday political and social issues going on in today's society.  Our purpose behind creating this animated series is to raise awareness of young adults, and all audiences for that matter, pertaining to political and social issues that are inherent in our society. We want to keep our content from being stale by mixing the writing staff up for each episode to keep viewers intrigued as to which direction the series will end up. A lot of animation/cartoons are becoming more and more predictable each episode, and most of the audience knows what to expect from episode to episode. We don't want to be another one of those cartoon series. With only one or two writers, and just a handful of voice over actors, we would be in the same boat as other series. We need additional financing to partner with others to change the dynamics of animated web series and how they go into production.Millennials have been perceived as a generation that does not care about much of anything. On the contrary, we believe that statement to be untrue.A lot of the traditional ways of getting the younger generation to care about important issues might not have the same affect as it did with previous generations such as baby boomers.There are not a lot of animated comedy series currently on the internet or network television that really digs deep into introducing political and social awareness as our series will.The three friends have known each other since high school, freshman year. After graduating high school, they set out to get signed to a major record label, referring to it as “gettin dat deal”. They believe that the current music industry is watered down, and they are currently what the music industry is missing. The friends main motto is being as real as possible. MST insists that he is “Too Real”. Since the group consist of 3 members, they decide to call themselves “Three Real”. They go through different adventures trying to get their demo tape finished and heard by the right people. Until they get signed, they decide to live their lives as if they already are. From a combination of trying to solve the most popular conspiracy theories known to man, including the theory that the United States never sending a man to the moon, to why well known comedian, Dave Chappelle walked away from his hit show, along with debunking current political and social issues that are present in our society, there is never a dull moment when the 3 friends come together.One simple webisode, if done well, can propagate like wildfire. As it spreads from person to person, so too do the ideas it espouses. But this only works if the series is funny, and so good that people who see it feel compelled to share it. It has to stand out as a brilliant comedy in its own right. By using animation, we can hire incredible artists and storytellers to ensure that our web series is poignant, compelling and captivating.What impact will the show have?If our production is done correctly, and it will, the impact of this animated web series could be immense. Using 3 Real Record's online presence (via our social media, website and mailing list) we have immediate access to  thousands of supporters to get the ball rolling. Once the sharing of the project begins, the growth and viewership can be exponential. Beyond this, we can submit submit the web series to animation awards as well as video streaming services, including Hulu and Netflix.  What do we need and how we will use it?Almost everyone today is a fond of animation. So we have tried to initiate a spark of change and awareness by its use.

It contains my art work in a number of medias and poetry that accompany each works. I've written this book to be made available to readers of all ages, but would like to make it available to schools so young people may read the motivational pieces in it.This book is a reflection of the author's life experiences, his love for art and poetry, his admiration of both the Jamaican Society in which he was born and American Society his adopted homeland. The illustrations in both poetic and visual art medias of important experiences in both cultures is now shared with the world. In his artwork he reflects much of the landscapes scenes and people he recalls from memory and artistically interpret and transfer these memories on canvas and in writing. Glendon wishes to share these experiences with the world, as of all these beautiful places he's traveled and experiences he's gained. But by bringing it to the readers of his book in simple but poetic language, some of it designed to be  compatible with the rhythmical musical beats of the Jamaican Society, yet being able to resonate with the day to day life experiences, and the social traditions of the American Society.Below is the link to see an electronic edition of his book as well as to obtain a paperback copy in full color.http://www.amazon.com/Musical-Lyrics-Art-And-Poetry/dp/1477620265/ref=sr_1_1?ie=UTF8&qid=1347380336&sr=8-1&keywords=glendon+mcfarlaneMy hope is that there is a message of spiritual, cultural and artistic revival and transformation to all my readers. That there will be an enrichment of their knowledge and awareness and appreciation of the art and culture of both the Jamaican and American Societies as both subjects and topics are intermingled in the pages of this book. Looking forward to your comments and hoping that you will be motivated enlightened, entertained and informed as you view and read these works.

These works are of greater significance with differences in style and substance from other literary works. They are written from the history and experiences of my people, the “Maroons” of Jamaica, that fought against British Rule in ten Maroon Wars, the last of which ended with the Maroon Peace Treaty of 1739, thereby giving the Maroons autonomy and their full emancipation, 101 years before worldwide Abolition of Slavery in the British Colonies, that came to implementation in the year 1838. This book will also be of interest to the greater student population, in universities and colleges and to even the younger readers.

Many of the landscape scenes I've painted are scenes I saw in different states that I've lived, after migrating to the United States 14 years ago. “Journeys from the South”, is one of my poems that expresses southern cultural and musical talents, from their style and perspective. I've visited many places and have made many friends that are dear to me in America. My documentation of these moments and scenes, are very special to me. I've lived in five states of the USA in the last 14 years and have produced about 120 pieces of art in memory of these experiences that will be included.A unique collection of works covering Art,Comedy, Romance, Motivational Topics, Social Justice, Politics and Spirituality.

Lastoria di Mario che viaggia verso Mantova per riportare il cofano nella città dove il Campione è vissuto fino alla suamorte, raccontando a suo nipote la grande storia di Tazio Nuvolari: il grande amore con Carolina, i suoi amici/nemicicome Achille Varzi, il suo rapporto con Enzo Ferrari, l’amante segreta, l’incontro con Padre Pio e le tragedie che lamorte gli ha riservato. Un lungo flashback pieno di emozioni e poesia fuori dalle corse in un’inedita storia che mainessuno ha raccontato.[ITA]''Realizzare un film su Tazio Nuvolari non è stato facile. Ho impiegato sette lunghi anni, persi dietro produttori improbabili e promesse non mantenute. Un film su Tazio Nuvolari non è stato solo il mio sogno ma anche quello di tanti altri registi. Poi quest'anno finalmente con la Format di Mauro Venditti ce l'ho fatta. Dovevo incontrare un produttore come lui, indipendente e che ama le sfide, per portare a termine il progetto. Girato interamente tra Castel d'Ario e Mantova e utilizzando le vere case dove è vissuto il Campione, le strade dove sfrecciava prima con la moto e poi con la macchina, settimana dopo settimana l'emozione di ricreare la sua vita è stata forte. Ne è uscito un film potente, forte, e pieno di emozioni, dove si racconta più l'uomo che il Campione , i suoi momenti dopo le corse, i suoi dolori, la morte dei figli, il grande amore con sua moglie Carolina. E tutto ciò attraverso il racconto di un nonno, che fu il ragazzino che trovò il famoso cofano perso nella leggendaria Mille Miglia del '48, a suo nipote. E’ un film di immagini, sentimenti, respiri e parole di vita che ci portano in un finale travolgente quando Tazio Nuvolari entra nella leggenda e a più di cinquant’anni corre in testa attraversando l’Italia tra ali di folla urlante e impazzita. Un film su un uomo che ha segnato con le sue imprese eroiche la storia dell automobilismo.'' Tonino Zangardi[ENG] ""Make a film on Tazio Nuvolari has not been an easy task. I spent seven long years looking for unlikely producers and broken promises. A film about Tazio Nuvolari has not just been my dream but the one of several other directors. This year, thanks to Format of Mauro Venditti, I finally made it.I had to meet an independent producer like him, who loves challenges, to make this project finally achievable. Completely shot between Castel d’Ario and Mantua, using the real houses where the Champion has lived, the roads where he has actually whizzed, first with his bike and afterwards with his car. The emotion of recreate his life week after week has been great. The result is such a powerful and very emotional film, where it is told more about the man than the Champion, his moments after racing, his sorrows, his children’s death, the great love story with his wife Carolina.And everything told through the words of a grandpa, the kid who found the famous hood lost during the legendary Mille Miglia of ’48, to his grandson. It’s a film of images, feelings, breaths, words of life which bring us to a overwhelming ending, When Tazio Nuvolari becomes the Legend, and in his fifties races ahead crossing around Italy among the crazy and roaring crowd. A film about a man who has written with his heroic deeds, the history of auto racing.''Tonino Zangardi(ITA) Italo-britannico,  nato a Roma, nel 1986 dopo aver frequentato l’American School di Rangoon in Birmania, si iscrive a un corso di espressività corporea presso l’istituto di Scienze Umane e ottiene il diploma di maturità linguistica presso l’istituto Gaetani a Roma.

La vita di quest’ultimo è il soggetto della docufiction che si propone di illustrare le opere e il pensiero del grande architetto, pittore, scrittore aretino. Il grande artista racconta in prima persona, come in un diario, gli avvenimenti della sua vita e le opere compiute per onorare e diffondere i contenuti e i temi stilistici appresi dai suoi maestri Michelangelo e Andrea Del Sarto. La narrazione è scandita dalla presentazione delle opere e dei modelli a cui fece riferimento. Vasari mette a fuoco i suoi rapporti con i Medici, che governarono il Granducato per molti anni, e i personaggi che conobbe da vicino, come Michelangelo Buonarroti, Francesco Salviati, Tiziano, Pietro Aretino. I fatti della sua vita si collegano alla produzione artistica e svelano i motivi che lo spinsero a determinate scelte stilistiche e contenutistiche. Sono dunque messi in risalto i legami con i committenti, che all’inizio della sua attività furono i monaci del monastero di Camaldoli, i Medici, i frati di San Michele al Bosco e parallelamente non sono trascurati gli aspetti della vita privata nella sua bottega, i rapporti con le sue modelle e i suoi allievi. Nella maturità i legami con la famiglia Farnese diventano stretti e il cardinale Alessandro lo chiama a Roma per gli affreschi del palazzo della Cancelleria. La vita di Vasari è totalmente dedicata al suo lavoro che svolge con coscienza critica e con una attenzione particolare agli artisti del suo tempo, ma non trascura lo studio dei  “primitivi” e su sollecitazione del cardinale Alessandro Farnese e del Vescovo Giovio concepisce la stesura dei volumi composti in due edizioni  delle “Vite degli eccellentissimi pittori, architetti” che saranno per secoli lo strumento fondamentale per la conoscenza degli artisti italiani dal Medioevo al Rinascimento. Il racconto non si limita alla semplice esposizione delle opere ma si propone di svelare l’aspetto privato del carattere e dei propositi del grande artista aretino, nei suoi rapporti con il Gran Duca Cosimo I, Michelangelo e i suoi allievi.(ENG) Mannerism shines in Tuscany with the artistic production of Michelangelo Buonarroti, Andrea Del Sarto, Jacopo Pontormo, Baccio Baldinelli, Rosso Fiorentino e Giorgio Vasari. The latter is the main subject of this film which aims to illustrate life, works and thinking of the great architect, painter, writer from Arezzo. Giorgio Vasari tells himself, as in a diary,  his life’s events and works done to honour and spread the contents and stylistic themes learnt from his masters Michelangelo and Andrea Del Sarto. Narration is defined by the presentation of works and models he referred to. Vasari focuses his relation with Medici family, who has ruled the Granducato for many years, and all the many names he closely met, as Michelangelo Buonarroti, Francesco Salviati, Tiziano and Pietro Aretino. His life's events are linked to the artistic production, revealing the reasons behind specific stylistic choices. Therefore the bonds with buyers are highlighted. At the beginning, they were the monks of the monastery of Camaldoli, Medici, friars of Saint Michele al Bosco. At the same time are not neglected the aspects of the private life of his studio, the relations with his models and students. Afterwords, in maturity, Farnese family's bonds become closer and closer and cardinal Alessandro commissions him the frescos of the Palazzo della Cancelleria in Rome. His life is totally dedicated to his job which fulfils with critical consciousness and great attention to the artists of his time, without ignoring the study of “primitives”. Pushed by cardinal Alessandro Farnese and bishop Giovio, he conceives the writing of volumes composed in two editions of “The Lives of the Most Excellent Painters, Sculptors, and Architects""which will be considered as the essential instrument of knowledge of the Italian artists from Middle Ages to Renaissance for Centuries. The story is not confined on a simple displaying of works but aims to reveal purposes and private aspects of the personality of the great artist, in his relations with the Grand Duke Cosimo I, Michelangelo, and his students.(ITA) Luca Verdone (Roma, 5 settembre 1953) è un regista italiano.Figlio del critico cinematografico Mario Verdone, è fratello dell'attore e regista Carlo Verdone e della produttrice cinematografica Silvia Verdone.

https://www.kickstarter.com/projects/celebconnect/celebconnect?ref=discovery_category_newest,celebconnect/celebconnect,"A key feature of celebrity culture is that celebrities, willingly or not, put their life on display for the public to view. Their actions, activities, and opinions are all packaged, distributed, and consumed as a product. The most important kind of information that celebrities share is personal information, as it establishes a relationship between them and their public. This is a purely parasocial relationship, a one-sided relationship in which the public is interacting with the celebrity but the celebrity is not aware of this interaction.CelebConnect is an astonishing project that will put this parasocial relationship between fans and celebrities to an end. This mobile based app will provide an opportunity to fans to interact with celebrities in real-time as they never done before. It will also include interactive ""Feedback Feature"" that will allow Celebrities to get feedback in the form of community votes on any topic of interest. Award and other industry shows will also be able to solicit the votes of community for their favorite shows, favorite celebs and other areas of interest. Community members will be provided timeline for casting their votes and the results of community voting will be available instantly. Country specific feedback will also be available.Prototype of our app could be accessed at http://demo.celebconnectapp.com/frame.htmlCelebConnect App Demo Video:",As with other social media channels there is risk of fake celebrity accounts but just don't worry our app is completely foolproof with no place for fake accounts. Our Artificial Algorithm will intelligently verify each celebrity signing up and will block all fake account attempts.CelebConnect is a unique app with no competitors right now. Our only challenge is raising seed funds for bringing this app to life and to make it rocking everywhere.

As per another survey more than 89% people in Pakistan, 93% people in Bangladesh, 99.5% people in Myanmar, 97.8% people in Ethopia, 95.4% people in Tanzania, 94.8% people in Congo, 85% people in India, 84% people in Indonesia & 62% people in Nigeria have no access to internet. Additionally 60% social media complaintsare about harassment of females.CelebConnect is going to launch social media app TownChat & web platform TownPals with unique features not provided by Facebook or WhatsApp. It will address privacy issues by providing secure sign up & sign in through facial recognition. TownChat will provide augmented connectivity to more than 4 billion people worldwide who are not connected to internet.TownChat is first ever app that will allow off internet messaging.Organizations can create public rooms for customer experience.Through TownChat every user will be assigned unique TownChat ID so that phone numbers of users could be protected from being revealed. For initiating messaging both users will need to follow each other.All users particularly females will have option to keep their accounts private so that no one could search and follow them and they could engage in messaging only with friends and family members.TownChat protects the identity and privacy of its users by providing users the option to keep their profile totally private. All private profiles will not appear in any search except search on the basis of TownChat ID. Also on TownChat users can create only 1 profile per user which means no fake accounts will be allowed on TownChat.On TownChat no one else will be able to track private profiles and even for public profiles no one will be able to send message unless the user follows that person back.On TownChat we have used AI and ML based filters that will not allow any toxic comments and pornographic content to be uploaded in any form.On TownChat Users including Tourists can search other users based on name, cityand profession based search. Users can also search for nearby users and can follow them and upon following back they can start conversation with each other. TownChat allows users to send scheduled and off internet messages. Through TownChat users can schedule their messages for any specific date and time without any hassle.Our app is Android based and is downloadable from Google Play Store. Additionally those users who do not have access to Internet they can get APK file through Bluetooth or by copying on media card. All signing up users will be asked to take Selfie which will be saved in our database and on local device folder so that Users can sign up even if they are not connected to internet. We will compress all outgoing off internet messages and will get them delivered to recipients through our Out of the Box Technology. Our off internet solution is also capable of processing payments without internet. Politicians and Celebrities will be able to share live updates and to Live Stream.",Our biggest challenge is to find funding so that we could launch TownChat commercially by Q1 2020 as per our Go To Market Timeline.

https://www.kickstarter.com/projects/spaceport/spaceport?ref=discovery_category_newest,spaceport/spaceport,"Quick Look -Spaceport is:Reward Details -Let's explain what you are getting.Membership cards - Everyone who joins Spaceport will get a membership card so that all your hard work in missions can forever be stored. As a backer you will get your membership card with your rank printed on the card (depending on how much you've pledged), which normal members will not get. Also should you ever lose your card we will replace it for free, so you never have to be without your rewards.Name on Wall of Fame - To thank every one of our backers we will create a wall that will have everyone's name and rank on it. We will always make sure this is somewhere that you can come and show all your friends.Game Credits - As a thank you we will give you 5,000 credits. This will be enough to buy a second ship.Poster - An A3 poster of the spaceport logo.T-Shirt - We will be creating a limited run of T-Shirts that show off the Spaceport logo, as well as having your rank on the back. These will only be offered to Backers. NOTE if you get the combo pack, you will have COMMANDER as your rank.Hoodie - Just like the T-shirt, we will be offering a limited run of Hoodies just for our backers.NOTE if you get the combo pack you will have COMMANDER as your rank.Artwork Book - All the artwork we have created will be collated and placed in an A5 hardback book. - Just like the rest of our rewards these are onlyavailable for backers.Name and backstory - There has to be a history behind the Spaceport game and we are offering you a chance to write the name and backstory for one of these important AI characters. We will pretty much give you free roaming in terms of what their history is, so long as it's not offensive.Name a faction - Along side these characters, there are the 5 AI factions who have a big part to play in shaping the future of Spaceport; and you have the chance to name them as well as outline their characteristics. Again, as long as its not offensive you can chose whatever you like.Design your own in game ship - We are offering the chance to have your very own unique in game ship - one of a kind, which no one else will have - so, when you are in game flying around people will recognise you by your ship.Right, let's get down to it -What is Spaceport?Have you ever watched Star Trek, Star Wars, Firefly, or any other sci-fi showand thought to yourself “Hey, I would love to be on that ship”? Well, that’s basically how I felt when I came up with the idea for Spaceport! Let’s face it – other than the cost – it wouldn’t be difficult to turn your living room into to the Starship Enterprise, but that achieves nothing. So, Spaceport is creating that very idea with our own ship bridges which will work with our game to create a realistic and immersive space simulation. When you step inside one of our space pods, you’ll notice that everything in the room has a purpose; no more arrays of 1,000s of buttons that just flash, but actual buttons that if you press will affect the outcome of your mission.The captain will be the leader of the mission, and it is up to them to chose which mission will be undertaken, as well as which of their ships will be used. However, it is probably important that I stress that with this leadership comes great risk. IF you fail to return your ship to a spaceport in game within the time frame, you will lose your ship and any cargo you had on the ship at the time. There are ways to protect yourself but they will be revealed when the product is finished. If you and your crew can overcome the odds and complete the mission, you will be rewarded!When you step foot into one of our pods, there will be a variety of seats depending on how many people your bridge is designed for. You and your friends will take a place at your relevant seat depending on what role you want to take. Once everyone is ready you will undertake take off and then your mission will start – along with the timer – which is relevant to how much fuel you have on board. Run out of fuel (time) and that’s it – Game over! So, sometimes it’s better to admit defeat and run.Will you accept the mission, captain?What are the roles? -. What will you do at each station?Captain – The one in charge – but also the one with everything to lose. You won’t actually be able to affect what’s going on with the ship directly, but will bark out the orders to everyone. Rule with an iron fist!Weapons - The one who fires the right weapon at the right time. It’s also up to the weapons master to keep an idea on weapon reload times and ammo to maximise the fighting ability of a ship. Don’t get caught short!Helm – The one who steers the ship in the right direction, but also the one who will make sure the ship keeps on the tail of a fleeing enemy ship. Ride hard, space cowboy!Comms - The one who will communicate with enemies and friends alike. When you find yourself in a sticky situation it will be down to comms to persuade the enemy that a fight would be a bad idea, or to call for help from a passing friendly ship. Silver tongues, ahoy!Science – The one who scans enemy ships to find out exactly what is going on; heading towards the wrong ship could end up in disaster – especially if you’ve just finished a fight and have no more photon torpedoes when they would be really handy. On point, Dexter!Engineering - The one who holds everything together. A solid engineer is the one who puts the power in the relevant areas. There’s no point in having full weapons when you’re outgunned and trying to out run an enemy fleet. You’re the glue that keeps us together!What's the point? -Why will you come back?So, now you know that this is a physical product that you will travel to take part in - but, why will you come back? You are probably thinking 'I've done this once but won't it be the same'. NO! it won't. With every mission you pass you will gain credits; these credits can go towards buying new ships, or parts for your ship, to take on bigger, harder enemies. This will mean you can take on harder missions with bigger rewards. We will also be doing mass Player v Player battles with BIG rewards, so you will need to sharpen your skills and tailor your ships ready for these events.Your investment -What is your money going on?Your money will be spent on creating the pods themselves, it's as simple as: the more money we raise, the better we can make the pods. If we hit our target we will be able to build one of each size ship. Being a sci-fi project, we want to make the pods out of this world, which means we will pay attention to every small bit of detail.The future -What's the long term goal?There are quite a few ideas on where we want to take this project - some are right down the road, but the one thing we want to do is expand from just being a pod, and push into creating a real spaceport, tooffer you the chance to experience a whole new world - so that when you walk through our doors, you leave your life outside and step into a new reality and make new friends.In terms of where we want to take the pods: with your help in making this a success we want to be able to approach the creators of some of sci-fi's most iconic spaceships, work with them in recreating these ships for your enjoyment, and take part in special battle simulations of some of the biggest battles we have seen on the big screen.We look forward to seeing you on the bridge!","Trying to find the right location will always be a huge issue, our first spaceport will be based in Folkestone, Kent (an hour away from London), I can confirm that much, but we want to expand from that very quickly. However, banking on such a small town generating enough interest is going to be a big challenge. Our hope is that such a unique idea will draw people to us, meaning that we can build new spaceports in London, Manchester, Sheffield, Glasgow and Bristol, so that we can offer our unique experience to those further afield.Building the pods will always have major risks in trying to find the right property, and, though at this moment in time we have a few places in mind, by the time we are ready to produce the pods they may be unavailable. This could add a massive delay to the project, one that we will have to persist with until the right property comes around.The other real concern is 'What if it's not up to people expectations and they decide that sitting in front of a PC is more fun?' This is also tied into the reason for our first spaceport being based in Folkestone - over the first year we will be offering all of our players a chance to give their feedback, and we will seriously consider everything that is passed back to us. We hope that our pilots will stick with us, and see this as a prolonged Beta phase.",https://www.kickstarter.com/projects/spaceport/spaceport-flight-simulator?ref=discovery_category_newest,spaceport/spaceport-flight-simulator,"Not a console game, it's a physical spaceship bridge simulator.Total of 6 roles on ship -  Captain, Weapons, Helm, Comms, Science and Engineering.Between 1 - 6 man teams, depending on how many friends you are with.Timed missions against both AI and Real People.No subscription - just pay with real or in game credits to fuel your ship.Missions are tailored around what happens in game, creating a world evolving around you.Why not check out our film promoting the product over on youtubehttps://youtu.be/sX228KochHave you ever watched Star Trek, Star Wars, Firefly, or any other sci-fi show and thought to yourself “Hey, I would love to be on that ship”?

The brand is set to produce women’s clothing and is set to operate in the UK and Europe. INNA will be following simple strategy of producing a collection for each season (Spring/Summer and Fall/Winter) 6 months prior the start of the season, then run a production for the season ahead in order to stock up before the start of each season.INNA brand is looking to become a popular topic and become a ‘must-have’ clothes creator. Having Celebrities, public figures, fashionistas and generally brave, feminine and classy women wearing unique and limited edition statement pieces, INNA is aiming to be a luxurious addition to the fashion industry. INNA brand has been created to bring some life into modern women wardrobes, filling streets with bright colours, refined patterns and feminine silhouettes.Positioning the brand as an affordable luxury brand and aiming to have a first boutique shop in London by 2018. After FW16 collection is manufactured, INNA brand will be working on opening own INNA Showrooms (boutique shop). Aiming for the location to represent INNA style in the UK as it is heavily shopped by international customers.We don’t buy in prints, instead, we are hand drawing and painting own prints, using a print house in the UK. We only aim to make 30-75 pieces of a lot of its products - you can see INNA label will have some very exclusive product. At the moment, I - the designer (Inna Sergejeva), am planning to create womenswear, including skirts, dresses, trousers, blouses and tops. Introducing outwear, knitwear, swimwear/holidaywear (seasonal), footwear, and girlswear (ages 3-8) by 2017.I am now looking for £20,000 to kick-start this journey for INNA Limited (registered company).The money will be spent on making SS16 collection sample by sample and then CMT (Cut-Trim-Make) in limited edition quantities (30-50 items of each style and colour) and on participating in Fashion Trade Show in February 2016 (PURE London) in order to sell to Boutiques shops! We will also be looking producing catalogues and lookbooks for each season.I really hope it will appeal as an excellent idea for you and you will invest! And my first Pilot shop will be in Reading!Please let me know if you have any questions and I will get back to you as soon as I can (innashowrooms@mail.com)!I look froward to hearing from you!Yours,Inna","Competition and lack of marketing expertise!! So if any one of you want to help establish my brand and help us run it - please feel free to take part - I'm really passionate about it and I know it will be really good addition to UK clothing market - but, of course, only passion isn't enough - so I'm open to all help I can get! Inna",https://www.kickstarter.com/projects/innasergejeva/mazices-moroccan-style-sandals-and-accessories?ref=discovery_category_newest,innasergejeva/mazices-moroccan-style-sandals-and-accessories,"Mazices is an emerging brand. Young Partnership that has developed into a business. After identifying a gap in women’s footwear retail industry in the UK, Mazices decided to take upon a role and import Moroccan stylish sandals into the UK. Mazices sells them to individuals and independent businesses, usually with the promise of exclusivity in the area, since Mazices has exclusivity from the manufacturer.   Morocco's mystical allure is attracting fashion designers, celebrities and holiday-makers all over the world. Moroccan style increasingly becoming THE look. Not only are they the best interpretation of modern Morocco, but they also reflect the quality of our highly-skilled shoemakers. Hand-stitched heel to toe in the heart of Marrakech's famous Medina, Mazices footwear is comfortable, light and very versatile. Whilst we are working hard putting together a beautiful website, in the meantime we collect individual orders via our social media channels and word of mouth. With a variety of different sizes and colours in the works, we collect all the orders and order on request.The main product Mazices brand is currently offering is women’s sandals. They are handmade in Morocco by the established shoemaker and made of ceramic, metal and plastic beads, leather and woollen strings. The styles are the only styles found in Morocco (and now in UK), unique Mazices styles and the shoemaker, that makes for Mazices, does not sell it to any other UK retail companies. At the moment we are negotiating an exclusivity contract with them and will be the only one’s having the skill and knowledge to make this kind of a shoe. The product is for women only, but as soon as we make enough profit, we are looking to develop the product further and produce more designs, including children’s size, and other matching accessories. The product is proven to be high quality, luxury and exotic product, that would attract upmarket clientele. Mazices shoemakers are producing products that are not easy to recreate, as the production process requires some complicated and hand-made additional details that are unique. The process of producing these additional details are not disclosed to the general public and are kept only within the company. In addition to this, Mazices brand will be adding SecureScan barcodes that are impossible to fabricate to ensure the authenticity of each product by placing it on the product tag.Another strength of the brand is its’ location and the location of the production and warehousing (Morocco and UK). Customer service and reliability is on the top, compared to brands that produce their product in China, India, Bangladesh, etc.Mazices brand is producing a very unique product that is Moroccan culture influenced statement pieces that always attract women. Since there is no brand that is oriented on Moroccan fashion – the factor of uniqueness and distinctiveness is obvious.The quality of the products is outstanding, as the products are made by true professionals, by hand and using high quality materials.Since Inna Sergejeva and Nadine Dinc (Owners) are both a 'hands-on' managers, all items will be closely inspected before and after they arrive to the UK and carefully packaged for our customers. So the items won't only look good, they will be easy to care and last for longer than if they were made out of poorer quality materials etc.Location of Mazices will be prime locations, giving the opportunity to attract the best clientele and higher sales and delivered nationwide if ordered online.The currency of the product will never be outdated, as Mazices Brand is aiming to bring the best trends and newest designs and update the shelves several times per year.Product retail price are slightly lower than competitor's average retail price for particular products, so is the cost (in some cases), but the quality is higher. We are looking for £10,000To be spent on:£8,000 (stock and packaging)£1,000 (marketing and advertising)£1,000 (PR and events)We really hope it will appeal as an excellent idea for you and you will invest! And my first Pilot shop will be in London!Please let me know if you have any questions and I will get back to you as soon as I can (mazices@mail.com)! I look froward to hearing from you!Yours, Inna and Nadine","In the first year of trading (2016) there is a risk of production delays due to the fact that manufacturers and shoemakers are exclusive and might need some more time to hire extra employees to fulfil Mazices high requirements and increase capacity.Once Mazices shoemakers and manufacturers are working at the same pace as a demand for Mazices product, there is a risk of having to have a faulty with the equipment, but Mazices brand will make sure the equipment is insured, updated regularly and well maintained.The company lacks marketing expertise, but there will be marketing professionals / companies hired to provide a full marketing strategy each year as an advisory consultancy. In the long run, company will be hiring permanent employees to form a team of professionals to cover this area. New competitors can enter the market Mazices brand is aiming for, but we will be able to stand out in order to have our market share and not lose any of it to new competitors.Larger competitors, of course, can undercut Mazices' pricing, but there will be lack of quality that Mazices product will have."

It is currently in its 1st phase of development. We are seeing way too much gang violence, drug abuse, assaults, weapons charges and many other issues. We want to create a community resource that is one of a kind. The power of human interaction is undeniably strong. One of the main focus points would be an open community discussion board. While discussion boards are common, this one will have a unique purpose. Many of the residents in Stockton, including the youth, are left without a voice in the community. In reality they are the ones most in tune with what is really going on. They have an incredible insight into the city that an outsider looking in would not posses. There would of course be heavy monitoring and moderation, in order to maintain a safe, all ages friendly environment. This is and will continue to be a work in progress, tools and resources are ever changing.  We realize that not everyone has the resources to access the internet and benefit from this website in its computer form. One of the main goals is to discover the positive aspects that come from this virtual environment, and implement them in the real world. By having this place for the community to share thoughts and ideas, we can work together to find solutions that can become fairly widespread. We realize that we are not able to stop all of the problems in the community, but if we can solve even 1, then our mission is a success.  The reason we are requesting pledges, is to be able to further develop the project and website. We are asking for a minimal amount, just enough to purchase some stickers, flyers, pay for some graphics and further site development. It will all remain on a small budget, but we expect to reach great lengths. A little bit can go a long way. We promise to spend every dollar wisely and completely towards the success of this project. Thank you, and wish us luck on our journey to give back.","Outreach can be difficult, We have devised ideas to help maximize this, by offering community events and prizes.",https://www.kickstarter.com/projects/1678719146/local-froyo?ref=discovery_category_newest,1678719146/local-froyo,"This is a very simple mission I am a 31 years old father of 3, with a wife and a career.

We want the community to be understanding and know that the majority of our mission is teaching the children, so if there's ever a slight imperfection we will simply turn that into a learning experience and try our hardest to make sure that it remains a positive experience for our consumersThe city of Belfair has a population of 6200, This gives us the ability to operate as a small local independent business. We currently own a windshield repair business in this town also. This will help since we already have our license to operate a business we will just need to add a few additional details to it. I also have had a chance recently to talk to some of the owners of small vacant buildings that would fit our needs and the store's seem to be well within reach.Thank you for your time and kindness, I really hope that this works out and we get a chance to make our dream a reality.","Any new business is risky,  food or anything that is highly competitive this will really be a challenge but I feel that we can reach our goals and grow together through this adventure and that alone will be our motivation.

We have a passion for what we do and would like to share the enthusiasm we have with our supporters and community. In our area, hi-tech equipment other than farm equipment is hard to come by. We would like to change that, and we, as a company, are ready for the next step in our journey for recognition as a professional craftsmanship company. We would like to ask humbly for a donation to help us accomplish our goal. With these funds we would like to purchase a small/industrial CNC Machine to explore and expand our capabilities; but most importantly to learn from it and provide our community and local schools an opportunity to learn from it as well. We strongly believe that this could kickstart a hunger and need for hi-tech factories which will include machines like the one we are trying to obtain.

Not only have I been watching the price of gold, but I’ve also been a huge fan of the gold mining reality TV shows “Gold Rush” and “Bering Sea Gold”. I’m always imagining how awesome it would be to actually own some real, solid gold.I decided to design the highest quality Pure Gold coin to give people the opportunity to own a timeless luxury piece. Think about it, how often do you get some second-rate item that wears out or breaks? Maybe you get costume or gold plated jewelry. This Gold Coin is something you will treasure for the rest of your life.Let me explain what makes this the highest quality coin you can own.1 Troy Ounce-Precious metals are measured in troy ounces, so this coin is actually nearly 1.1 ounces.24 Karat Gold-Carats with a C is the measurement for the WEIGHT of DIAMONDS.Karats with a K is the measurement for the PURITY of GOLD. 24 Karat is the highest purity gold. This coin will be 99.99% Gold.Solid Gold Coin-The coin is solid gold, not gold plated.The surface won’t ever peel or get scratched off revealing filler metals.Plastic Protective Case and Classy Display Box-Your coin will arrive in a protective plastic and fine jewelry box.Limited Custom Design-This is your only chance to get one of the 1000 orders of this originally designed coin.Here is my rough art design:Here is an example coin to give an idea of how the finish will look:Sure the coin is expensive, but-Plastic Capsule and Velvet Display BoxYou deserve to treat yourself with this precious gift. Or imagine the great feeling you will have when you hand one of these velvet boxes to your loved one. This is a coin you’ll cherish forever and can even pass down from generation to generation. Your Pure Gold Coin is something you can hold, look at or wear every day knowing you have a special coin of great value.There are too many costs involved for me to handle by myself.I have created the initial artwork, but the mint will need to create final artwork.Molds have to be created for both sides of the coin.The cost of minting a single coin is prohibitive, if we meet the funding goal we will have a successful run.GOLD Price ChartGold has skyrocketed, but has had a pullback so it will likely go back up to new highs any time.DOW Stock ChartThe Stock Market is at an all-time high. When it next crashes you know people will buy gold.Can I buy more than one coin? Yes. Click on the reward you want and then type in the dollar amount for the number of coins you would like. When will I get my coins? All coins will be delivered by February 2015 (great for Valentines' Day).Whether you pledge any money to this project or not, I hope you will get involved and write any questions or comments you have regarding this gold coin or your interest in gold. I’d love to have everyone share their ideas on gold here.","I absolutely expect to deliver these coins well before Valentines' Day, but you never know what delays can occur.Final art- 1 weekMolds- 2 to 4 weeksStriking- 1 weekOnce we hit the minimum funding goal of $10,000 I will immediately start work on the final art and molds.I'll keep everyone updated through every step!"
https://www.kickstarter.com/projects/davebermudez91/orbit-the-animated-series?ref=discovery_category_newest,davebermudez91/orbit-the-animated-series,"Orbit has the potential to be an animated single-camera sitcom that is different from otherstyles represented in today’s entertainment.Orbitis about a teen named Dave Boulevardez who moves from his hometown of Dabari tothe small, inner city of Orbit with his family right before he begins his lifein high school. He makes friends with people with very different personalitiesand encounters rivals on his very first day in town. Throughout the series, hewill face all the drama that comes with family ties, being a tween, playingsports, and experiencing love.Daveisn’t a secret agent or superhero that leads a secret life at night. No, he’sfar from that. He’s just your average teenager who has to go through the samedrama his viewers had to suffer through growing up. Everyone loves him becausehe’s relatable. Dave and his group of friends go through traditional lifeevents, but they tend to go through it in extraordinary ways. His group offriends tend to go through adult-like situations similar to the characters in90’s television shows where eight-year-old kids, oddly enough, have a midnightcurfew or somehow can afford a $300 game console by themselves.Thisseries is made for an audience where people can understand the circumstancesregardless of their ages. The show will be brightly colored with adult humor;the show is going to represent the real life emotions of people and it will be expressedin a way that all viewers can understand. The main thing I want to emphasize isthat this show does not have a select theme.Thisshow is going to stay away from the presence of adults as much as possiblebecause it needs to be expressed that people of all ages should be able tofigure out the difference between right and wrong on their own. The audiencedeserves to know that not all of life’s difficult situations can be resolvedovernight and that patience is a virtue. Episodes will be 22 minutes but therewill be plenty of occurrences where more time will be needed.Orbithas been a series idea of creator, David Bermudez, for quite some time now.Orbit is going to be a show that represents incidents that took placethroughout his childhood. There are hardly any television programs out therefor families to sit and watch together, and David Bermudez wants to develop ashow for all audiences. Orbit will not be set to entertain people from just oneethnic background, which is why all his characters are of diverse backgroundsso that Orbit will be appealing to all. David Bermudez grew up in an area fullof diversity, and he wants Orbit to showcase his point of view.Eventhough this show will be made for children and tweens, the characters do notact dumb for the sake of a laugh. On Orbit, all of the comedy in our show willbe natural and from realistic life situations. All of the characters will behonest, and everything said will have a true meaning behind it. I would comparethis show to having a vibe similar to that of “Hey Arnold!,” “Doug” and “TheBoondocks” where humor just happens to come from realistic life situations.Theprotagonists in all three of those shows are all nice, humble kids that have theirown adventures and dreams in mind, but nearly every episode was derailed withthem trying to save their friends from uncanny situations. It felt like at theend of nearly every episode, they learned life lessons that would lead tohumorous endings. I want Orbit to have that kind of impact, the way all threeof those shows have become truly memorable. The vibes will be similar, but Daveis more vocal and his friends are the same way which leads to adventures!Atypical episode will place Dave at the center as he tries to resolve a problem,whether it is in his own life or in the life of his two closest friends, Buddyand Stan. There will be heartfelt moments where people can relate, even itsadult viewers, and they’ll think “Man, I remember going through that samething.”Episodeswill be serialized so each episode will relate to the others and referenceswill pass through and help the show carry on. In each episode, we find out alittle bit more about Dave’s past, especially the reasons behind why he was nothappy about moving away from his hometown of Dabari. People are going toidolize this group of friends and want all their friends to be like Dave’sfriends because they stick by each other through thick and thin. Even thoughthere will be turning points and twists, they will always be in it for eachother, and I feel like there is not a children’s series out there today thatsymbolizes this.Orbitis a fictional city located in the middle of the Bay Area near San Francisco,California. Orbit is known for having only seven schools in total: oneelementary school, one middle school, three high schools, and two colleges.Compared to larger cities like San Francisco, there are only 50,000 people thatreside there, only one mall, and only one method of public transportation,which is the local bus line that takes people throughout the entire city. Orbitis based off several cities around the Bay Area the creator, David Bermudez,has lived in throughout his life. None of the characteristics can be identifiedas being related to just one town.Basketball:Orbit City Warriors (Men), Orbit City Gladiators (Women), Football: Orbit CityTitans, Baseball: Orbit City Hornets, Hockey: Orbit City HedgehogsBaylandMall, Journey Peak, Juniper National Park, Chipotle Horse ArenaCastilloElementary, Garcia Elementary, Castillo Jr. High, Depot Middle School, CastilloHigh, Mayhem Prep, Lenny Jones Prep, Orbit State University, Swamp CommunityCollegeCastillo High - Castillo High isDave’s first school in the town of Orbit. There he joins forces with PsychoStan and Buddy Montana. Castillo High is a very short walking distance fromHillbridge Street. It has about 300 students and one of the worst athleticprograms in the entire country. Despite being terrible in the athleticdepartment, Castillo High has a huge rivalry with Lenny Jones Prep, which isthe home of the Goldstein Brothers, who were Dave’s main reason for attendingCastillo High over Mayhem Prep. Castillo High is full of characters and itson-going rivalry with fellow schools leads to more adventures for Dave and thecrew.Lenny Jones Prep - The most popularschool in the area. Lenny Jones Sr. and Lenny J claim that this school wasnamed after them intentionally but everyone knows the name is only acoincidence. Lenny Jones Sr. wants his sons to attend this school for a lot ofdifferent reasons. This school is known for everything from sports, to parties,to academics. This is every teenager’s dream come true! They actually seeMayhem Prep as their rival school until Dave and Psycho Stan do somethingcompletely unreasonable, leading to a series-long rivalry with Castillo High!Hillbridge Street - You haven’t been toOrbit if you haven’t been down Hillbridge Street. Everything that happens onHillbridge Street has a story behind it. Besides it being the residence of allthe main characters, Hillbridge is known for having the only arcade within a25-mile radius. Everyone hangs out there and it’s basically in the middle oftown so everything is within arm’s reach. Buddy Montana always has a story totell about the area as he’s lived in Orbit longer than anyone around. From crazy old ladies throwing water bottlesat kids, to the local circus clown stealing coupons from your mailbox, nothingis to be missed on Hillbridge!Bayland Mall - Probably the worstmall in the area, this is the local hangout spot for everybody especially allthe nearby high schools. Yes, there’s a place for both Castillo High and LennyJones Prep to hang out together! This is where Dave first meets Buddy Montanaand the Goldstein Brothers, so this place is very important and will bereferred to often. Psycho Stan often refers to this as his “home away fromhome,” as this is where he usually goes to flirt with the ladies and buysunglasses.Dave’s Journal - Dave carries ablack and white composition book that doesn’t have any significance to thestoryline until halfway through the first season. This scrapbook has picturesof old friends from his hometown of Dabari, song lyrics, and a few othermysterious things that will be revealed as the series continues on.Buddy Montana’s Bike - Buddy Montana’sbike is probably his favorite thing in the world. He often refers to it as hiswings, as when he hits the hills he feels like he’s flying. Buddy treats hisbike like a brand new car, and if you even try to ask him about it, he’ll snap,because he thinks everybody wants to steal it. Buddy’s bike leads to plenty ofissues within his group of friends as well as everyone else on HillbridgeStreet!Dave’s Knee Brace - There will beplenty of references to this knee brace that the viewers will see lying around.Dave’s knee brace will lead to serious issues as well as a couple of jokes.Overall, his knee brace will help explain what made Dave the person he istoday, as well as explain why he wasn’t quite ready to leave the city of Dabarifor the little town called Orbit.Dave - David WilfredBoulevardez is the protagonist of the show. Dave is the teenage boy from thepopular city of Dabari who moves with his family to the small town of Orbit. Heattends Castillo High with his new friends, Buddy and Stan. He really doesn’thave a hard time fitting in, unless you count his altercation with the town’spopular Goldstein Brothers on his first day in town. Dave really lovesbasketball and videogames, but due to his attempts to keep everyone in hisfamily happy, he’s forced to basically do much more than that on a regularbasis. Dave is very sarcastic, which tends to get him in a lot of trouble. Deepdown he’s very kind. He gives advice beyond his years. Dave is told by manythat he is “filled with potential but he’s just so lazy.” He has two oldersiblings but only one is seen on occasion (Lenny J). As the series progresses,we’ll find out much more about Dave’s past and why he was so hesitant to leavehis hometown of Dabari for the new world of Orbit.Buddy Montana - Buddy Montana isthe guy next door who dresses up and puts on the impression that he is somekind of vampire. He treats everyday like it’s his own personal Halloween! Herides down the street, often on his precious dirt bike that he feels everyoneis jealous of. Another on-going joke/rumor about him is that he sleeps in acoffin; No one he knows has ever been inside his house. Buddy and Daveinstantly connect, becoming close friends as they both have issues with thetown’s popular Goldstein Brothers. It also seems as if Buddy knows everybody inthe town of Orbit regardless of their age or “species.” Nobody knows BuddyMontana’s real name, which proves to be a huge question that runs throughoutthe entire series.Psycho Stan - Psycho Stan, whosereal name is Stanley Richardson, is one of the most amusing characters in theentire series. He is known as Psycho Stan for several different reasons. One ofthem may be because he believes his cell phone is a rock. He loves the ladies,and he always tends to fall for the ones all of his friends have issues with,leading to plenty of issues throughout the series. Psycho Stan is always beingbailed out by one of his friends because his decisions tend to always get himin trouble with someone, whether it is the Goldstein Brothers or someone whoalways happens to come back from his past for revenge. Psycho Stan’s antics areanother reason Dave can never get any work done. Stan’s little sister Cynthia,who is two years younger than him, has a crush on Dave but that is not revealeduntil much later in the series.Avery Goldstein - Avery Goldstein isthe younger brother of the Goldstein Brothers and is the cocky one. He has aquick temper with an ego the size of Mt. Rushmore. He’s a year older than Daveand he goes to the rival high school, Lenny Jones Prep, which is coincidentallynamed after Dave’s brother and father. According to Buddy Montana, Avery isknown more for his amazing growth spurt than his actual athletic abilities.Avery is not as tough as he thinks and we discover Avery is actually fond ofthings he makes fun of others for enjoying. After an altercation in thebeginning of the series, Dave and Avery have an on-going rivalry.Brock Goldstein - Brock is the olderGoldstein Brother. He finds himself “close to graduating” from Lenny Jones Prepwhich means he’ll be heading out to a top premier college and leaving the smalltown of Orbit. He is a ladies’ man. Everyone loves him because he’s able tokeep his cocky little brother, Avery, in check, well, at least most of thetime. Brock is known for being a star athlete since the “day he was born,” butDave often says that without his “seven feet of height” he wouldn’t be sospecial. That’s just an exaggeration because Dave is basically shorter thanmost of the main characters. Brock and Stan tend to get into plenty ofaltercations because they tend to fall in love with the same girls more oftenthan not; that will become an on-going routine.Lenny J - Lenny J, full nameis Leonardo Jones Boulevardez, Jr., is Dave’s older brother who moved with thefamily from Dabari to the small town of Orbit. He thought that he was too coolto go to school with his little brother, so instead of going to Castillo High,he’s finishing up his high school education at Mayhem Prep, a far school fromtheir home. He’s often seen carrying/drinking grape juice or soda depending onwhat time of day it may be. Lenny J is a quiet individual and he loves to beleft all to himself but as the series goes on Dave and his group of friendsunmask some of Lenny J’s hidden talents, such as how great of an artist he isas well as his amazing singing voice. Unfortunately, his dad does not see LennyJ the same way!Lenny Jones - Leonardo JonesBoulevardez, Sr. is the father of Dave and Lenny J. Lenny Jones is known forbeing grumpy when he doesn’t get his way. He’s a huge Bob Marley fan and hewill quote anyone and try to give the credit to Bob Marley. Lenny Jones wantsDave to become the huge football star that he was not able to be and oftentalks down about Lenny J’s goals because they’re not athletic enough for him.Instead of being called “Dad,” he’s often referred to as “Lenny” by hischildren, and it really does not bother him. His wife, Maureen, puts him inline, especially when it comes to how he treats the boys. His reasons formoving the family from Dabari to Orbit are exposed throughout the series.Mrs. Maureen - MaureenBoulevardez is the loving mother of Dave and Lenny J as well as the wife ofLenny Jones. Mrs. Maureen is a retired mother who out of boredom sometimeswishes she could still work. She loves decorating and is often caught watchinghome improvement shows. She is sincere, kind-hearted and tries to put her kidsbefore all else. When trying to teach anyone life lessons, especially herfamily, she mentions the work of screenwriter Bill Murphy, who is basicallyOrbit’s own Tyler Perry, as an example to get her point across. Maureen andLenny Jones really do have a love-hate marriage, but she often says thatthere’s really “more love than hate as they get older.”Barney Brown - Barney Brown liveson Hillbridge Street with Dave and his friends. He attends Lenny Jones Prep andis close friends with the Goldstein Brothers yet, he hardly ever goes to schoolbecause he hates how “he has to go to class.” Barney teaches self-defenseclasses to children at the local youth center, and he’s often telling PsychoStan to come down and visit because he wants to embarrass him. Barney alwaystends to have a random relative visiting for extended periods of time. He goesto Dave for advice on how to handle the resulting overdramatic situations. He’sanother character that distracts Dave throughout the series.Trey Daniels - Trey Daniels isone of the most recent graduates from Castillo High. Trey returns to his almamater in order to be the assistant coach for all of the male sports teams.During his four years there, he was the most popular boy in school. Coachesrespect him, teachers love him, girls adore him, and guys envy him. WheneverTrey gets shy, he tends to giggle non-stop. Somewhere between the time hegraduated and Dave’s arrival to the town of Orbit, Trey’s life has gonedownhill.Ian Billups - Every neighborhoodhas that one kid we can’t seem to get rid of but, he’s loved nonetheless. Ian Billupsis that kid. Attending Castillo Jr. High, Ian Billups is the kid in theneighborhood that loves to torture Dave and his friends. He calls them, “theolder brothers his parents weren’t ready for.” Personality and skills wise, heis basically a modern day hybrid of Dennis the Menace and Kevin McCallister,whose antics give the series that little spark we all love! He has a crush onCynthia but she’s too focused on her love for Dave!I am raising funds so that I may put the production of the promotional trailer to work right now. I've tried showcasing my idea to many different executives, plenty on network television, and they have all wanted me to make dramatic changes no longer making it out to be my vision.

No, he is far from that. Trey was a normal 14-year-old trying to survive high school until this one day he went swimming in Storm Cloud Lake. His best friend is BILLY RICHARDS, who has a crush on Trey’s older sister, LISA, whom he often refers to as his “future wife.” Trey’s rival is a teen at another local high school named KYLE DIXON or “K-DIX.” They are both athletes who frequently challenge each other to unnecessary competitions. Over time, Trey and Kyle’s challenges become much more dangerous with things starting to get out of hand. Billy insists that Trey and K-Dix end their silly rivalry before somebody gets hurt, which leads to K-Dix setting up the ultimate challenge. Knowing that Trey is afraid of water, K-Dix challenges Trey to a swim meet in STORM CLOUD LAKE, and whoever stays in the water longer receives permanent bragging rights.Trey accepts the challenge knowing that he may lose. K-Dix arranges the entire event in addition to inviting his closest friends to watch the match. Trey only brings Billy to the match, in order to avoid embarrassment in case he loses. Earlier in the day before the match, G3X, a local pharmaceutical company, illegally releases gallons of chemicals into the lake. Not knowing this happened, the race still takes place. Shortly into the race, Trey takes a quick lead with K-Dix falling behind. K-Dix faints in the water, which leads Trey to turn around to save him. Shortly after that, Trey faints. Billy goes into the lake to save Trey. Kyle’s friends do the same thing for him. Everyone gets out of the lake safely, but what they do not know is the chemicals released into the lake will eventually cause mutations among those that were exposed to its water. Later on in the series, this event will be known as “THE GREAT SPLASH.”The Great Splash caused Trey to obtain a special power, which enables him to create and control all forms of water, wind, fire, and electricity. Billy develops superior athletic abilities while being able to fly. The Great Splash also gave others in the area, including K-Dix, their own powers, leading to super villains appearing. Everyone mutated due to The Great Splash are known as “SPLASHMITES,” and their mutations cause fear across the entire city. Soon after, keeping their true identities concealed, Trey and Billy begin to take down all the villains in the area by becoming VALOR AND BRIGGS: AN INCREDIBLE DYNAMIC DUO.The film, made for a mature audience, will take place ten years after Valor & Briggs have received their super natural powers and are losing in an epic battle to G3X. The friendship will be tested and secrets will be revealed.It will be produced, and co-written, by Matt Kohler  (Star of the Captain Planet  Fan Made Trailer) and the filming location will be announced at a later date.To find out more information about a potential Valor and Briggs series, Click Here!",Production delays may be the only true factor as I currently reside in Northern California and I will have to travel to Southern California for days of production. Casting will take place once we achieve our goal and from there it should all fall into place real easily.

The reason why its called Kathy's Catering is because I wanted to give my business a real name so I named my business after my grandmother who loved the fact that I was fighting for my dream which is food.My catering business will have everything you need whether its weddings, birthday's other parties or just for everyday use. there will be buffets available, cakes, sandwiches and more. and because I will have a driver you can have everything safely delivered to your choice of venue or right to your front door. Your foods are in safe hands. I have my health and safety certificate as well as food hygiene and more so your food will be in the best hands and I only use the safest methods to create the dishes you want.","Because this will be an at home catering business there aren't any risks other than having no certification but I have food hygiene certificates, heath and safety and working with chemicals. all work surfaces and the environment your food will be in will constantly be clean and will not make your food or you suffer.",https://www.kickstarter.com/projects/melinda1693/project-downpour?ref=discovery_category_newest,melinda1693/project-downpour,"Project Downpour is based on an upcoming novel written by myself, detailing the journey of a young woman whose father and husband have went missing, she leaves Los Angeles and fly's back to her hometown in Scotland only to discover that there have been a string of unexplained murders, the young woman goes in search of her loved ones and comes across a small village that is home to an ancient Nazi cult that are creating a new generation of evil beings to rid the world of men.This film, if funded will be filmed until October and have a cast of around 100 people. The funds go directly towards costume, makeup, lunches, wages, locations, travel, that sort of thing, the only risk to this is that we fall behind on the deadline. The money will also be used for practical and special effects equipment. I am currently directing and producing another movie and all of our funds have went into that project but would love to have both films out before the end of this year.If funded the backers will receive credit for funding the movie and making it possible to get made as well as a free copy of the movie on bluray and a signed poster of the cast as well as have your name in the opening and closing credits.","The only risk to this movie being made is that we fall behind out schedule but we will be working hard to get the movie filmed, edited and put out by October so that it comes out for Halloween."

https://www.kickstarter.com/projects/gridcuisine/interactive-video-game-console-for-action-games?ref=discovery_category_newest,gridcuisine/interactive-video-game-console-for-action-games,"I am creating a prototype for a gaming system that not only lets you control the characters but also let's you BE THE CHARACTER!  That's right, you can be the character. Super Mario want's you!**Note; This for prototype development.What's great about this gaming system is that it is interactive. it takes at least 2 people to play. From dancing at the commands of another person to simply act out a video game fantasy to improving your martial arts skill to helping a football team practice under the control of a coach, this game has huge and various applications to the real world.The game's concept is very simple. There is a controllerand there is another person that acts out the controller's desires via sunglasses with an inner digital display.The controller sends commands to the glasses via a Bluetooth or WIFI connection.The commands for each action is displayed to the the other person via glasses; which would display the normal ""up up down"" video codec of a controller to a simple English phrase such as ""sweeping kick with right leg.""  The wearer of the glasses will receive the commands in simple English on the inner frame of his glasses although the controller will be using the normal video game codec for moving.  This is where the ingenuity comes in for creating games; A codec translator is unique for every game.  For example a move in ""streetfighter"" is different than a move in ""punch-out.""  So each game codec translation has to be design through a translation system that translates the codec for each game into simple commands.  Once created, this lets users act out their favorite games instead of vicariously living it out with a virtual character.  You'll now be acting it out with a real live person; Tom, Bob, David, whoever your friend is (Just make sure to give the right commands).  This person will act out the commands to the best of his ability against another person who may or may not be controlled by another person.  Imagine the use in sports!   11 players in most NFL video game teams are controlled by one person, You, the video game controller.  What the company envisions is a day where 11 real live players, will be controlled via by a ""coach"" or one who has the controller.  The team will all where glasses and perform commands in the same manner as the virtual characters.  The controller communicates with the player's glasses wirelessly, giving certain commands depending on who has the ball.   Ever wanted to scream and shout at your favorite team because he left a man open? Just pick the open man and have him throw by pressing A. The controller can have a digital display to make you aware of what man is being selected.Perhaps a day will come when football as we know it, will be played like this. This application applies to all sports! The basic hardware of the game consists of 3 devices;Sunglasses with an inner digital display that receive commands and displays them on the inner frame whether those commands be punch left hand, kick with right leg, throw to Gary, etc.The commands will be received wirelessly either through an antenna WIFI or bluetooth connection.The controller will have the ability to transmit the commands to the sunglasses either through a frequency transmitter or bluetooth connection.The controller has within it software that converts the codec of various games to simple commands to be displayed on the inner frame of the glasses.1. Intellectual Property:  Currently there is an application patent pending on this concept, although the patent hasn't yet been awarded by the PTO.    There is currently a claims and examination fee that is due and the PTO has given 2 months for the deadline.After those 2 months the patent will be abandoned.  The patent process is lengthy and there is funding needed to expedite the examination approval.  Establishing this as an intellectual property is the first step because we want to keep competition of such an idea down to a minimum so we can faithful award our backers and market the idea safely.**note: Keep in mind that if this idea is abandoned, chances of you seeing this idea on the market will be very slim as most companies will not invest in what they cannot patent. As the application would be published, this would exclude it from ever being patented as prior art exist and it may go on the shelf for decades). The time is now! Don't let this patent go abandoned!2. Technical developer's team:The team of software developers will comprise those already established in industry and college students who demonstrate an efficiency in programming and hardware development.  We are positioned in a city where such talent is only a footstep away however such talent would need to be compensated to offer their services in prototype creation.3. Prototype creation;  This involves creating a blue-print of the device through thorough and tough research.  It also involves trial and error; material to create such a device, parts and accessories.4. Mass Production:  Mass producing the product woud entail a negotiation with a manufacturer to create the games on a mass scale for distribution to the backers as well as future customers. ** Those who are already enrolled at certain levels will be automatically enrolled at the manufacturing level and will qualify for manufacturing rewards.5. Marketing:No product sells itself. There should be a budget for marketing to create a mass appeal to the game system. Once it reaches the stage for marketing those who have pledged at certain levels will be automatically enrolled for manufacturing rewards at that level.**This game was originally envisioned as a theme park attraction, where kids could play their favorite video games using real live characters who would be dressed like the video game characters at the theme park. This could also be an application of the idea, in addition to the uses stated above.","The risk associated is the lack of procurement of the intellectual property that is currently in the stages of the PTO. If IP is not obtained, this opens competition up which would significantly depreciate our market advantage, however this can be overcome by proceeding whether the patent issues or not. The vision of the project is superior to any other ""knock-offs"" as the fundamental design and purpose is with us.Another risk is in technical challenges that may arrive in it's creation. However in this city, there is a host of software companies and technical colleges where help can be proffered in creating a sustainable prototype. Such colleges as Georgia Tech, SPSU, Georgia State, all of which have technical talent that can be tapped for prototype creation along with a host of software companies",https://www.kickstarter.com/projects/gridcuisine/gridcuisinecom?ref=discovery_category_newest,gridcuisine/gridcuisinecom,"So far social market sites are connecting customers and producers in non traditional ways which are disrupting traditional business marketplaces. Examples of these are AirBnB, Uber, and Amazon. The business model connects regular people with others who operate as independent contractors. This allows regular people to become producers instead of those who are utilizing traditional brick and mortar methods to connect people. Anyone can become an Uber driver, if they meet the qualifications. Anyone can put their property up for rent and anyone can become a 3rd party seller, via Amazon, Ebay or Etsy. This is a proven business Modus Operandi that is successfully integrating with the internet and mobile apps disrupting traditional businesses. Gridcuisine.com is attempting to develop a web and app presence as well with this business model with food. What we will do is simply provide a marketplace where users can sell their own food from home. Imagine being able to order Lasagna at 3am or pick from your own ethnic foods at odd times when there are no restaurants available. Anyone, who passes the inspection of our team, can post their food on gridcuisine and receive a profit. Afterwards, users who purchase the items can leave reviews.Users can purchase food from their neighbors or from another local area and have it delivered via the current delivery apps (door dash, postmates, uber eats, etc). The site will operate 24 hours and provide a variety of choices for food. Users can specify hours food is available. Specific addresses can be hidden for safety although a general area will be shown. After ordering, users can rate the food purchased (privately and publicly). Site will be similar to Ebay except it will be for local food. Grid cuisine will perform it's own internal inspections and offer or mandate insurance for sellers. Funds from Kickstarter will be used to purchase tech support, app and website development, legal consultants and marketing. ","The greatest challenge in this venture will be in the development of the website and mobile application.  Afterwards it will be in the inspections, legal challenges, implementation of delivery mobile apps and establishing insurance for users who sell food.  As local laws change from area to area an understanding of the legal landscape is important in establishing a food for hire app."

One study of 5,400 projects, by McKinsey and Oxford University, showed that 17 per cent of projects were so catastrophically bad they had threatened the very existence of the company. As a result most software professionals have never seen a successful software development project, continuous delivery evangelist Dave Farley said, and have ""built careers on doing the wrong thing"". This is being exacerbated into the the cloud, where software designed on vertical scaling principals are being deployed, with little knowledge of how to successfully utilise the resources of the cloud and get the intended level of scale.Introduction: We've been working on enterprise grade cloud offerings for several years now, covering several different projects and industries, and what we've learnt is that there are no really good enterprise grade, scalable, cloud development frameworks an toolsets out there. In all instances we found no reliable frameworks... only toolkits, lots of forums all talking about how to re-invent the wheel over and over and lots of small sample projects that don't fit into enterprise grade solutions.Current situation: Over the last three years we've built a framework that solves the ""how do I do this without reinvent this wheel that's enterprise grade"" problem... for Azure at-least. It's highly modular and allows all sorts of different technology to be used, swapped in and out. Don't like SQL, swap in the MongoDB module. Want a robust message bus, swap in a service-bus package... don't like the one's we've got, swap ours out for your own choosing.Importantly our project is more than another framework with rules and principals to follow. It contains training and mentoring for CTOs, architects and developers to learn ""how to scale for the modern world"" and tooling to reduce hand written code by up to 80% (the plumbing code) and leaving only business logic. In fact you don't even have to write classes or methods, just raw C# business logic that gets compiled where it's supposed to be. It's seen use within an airline for 18 months or so now and proved to be a good platform. Where we want to take this: We've opted for the currently fashionable approach of open sourcing the platform to help build a community around us and decided to charge for support and consulting. The help we need: What we're in need of is the last big push to close off our outstanding bugs, get documentation written, good quality examples built, training material and courses put together and remove the last little bits of 'closed source' and licensed code removed. And finally giving our crappy website some love... it's suffering as we're been focused soo much on our clients in the past and now this project.","* Our crappy website being a distraction... don't waste your time looking at it... trust us... it's crappy.* Delays in removing and building workarounds for the 'closed source' code.* Delays in documenting the basic ""Getting Started"" work... without that it's hard to adopt.* Delivering crap samples and examples that need re-writing. Nothing worse than a tutorial that teach you 101 concepts of a feature and hot how you should do it right.* Delivery of the consultancy (aka a victim of our own success) where we get too many pledges that require consulting which could come at the expense of delivering that consulting or development of future features.",https://www.kickstarter.com/projects/chinchilla-software/cqrs-for-akknet?ref=discovery_category_newest,chinchilla-software/cqrs-for-akknet,"Most software professionals have never seen a successful software development project and havebuilt careers on doing the wrong thing.We'll that's a bit of a downer.We've got a solid, reliable platform that will work in your organization to make your projects successful again, reduce the costs of development (that isn't an exaggeration, but it might require you thinking a little differently)... and we integrate directly within Visual Studio (even the old versions like 2010).The help we needWhat we have left to build is our akka.netmodules.

They are less people than when they began. But what did actually happen in that forrest? Only the tape reveals!","The biggest problem is equipment, and this is where we need your help. We are all students and need funding to get this equipment.Another problem could be the police having problems with us filming on locations such as the old hospital, but this can be solved by getting the correct forms and approvals before filming.",https://www.kickstarter.com/projects/dkbeeradventure/beer-for-everyone?ref=discovery_category_newest,dkbeeradventure/beer-for-everyone,"Our idea is: We have the facilities for starting a microbrewery. We have the first hardware for making beer, but we need more, much more for a large scale production.We are a couple of men who thought about making beer. But not just one kind of beer. When it is christmas, we want to make a christmas beer, a beer for halloween, a beer for summer, winter, autumn and fall. When a rock band plays in town on the local festival we want to make a beer for that. We have already made arrangements for selling beer to the local football club and a local rock festival - so we have possibilities to succeed. We just need funding.We plan to make a ""package"", so that the bottle, wrapping, and all fits the theme of the beer fx. christmas.In the last few years we have seen a massive explosion in microbreweries. We were inspired and bought the first hardware to brew and bottle the beer, we also have storage option. But we need to go large scale!We believe in this project and hope you do as well!","If problems arise, we tackle them. We don't just give up. We WANT this to succeed. We are good at thinking outside the box and we have a vast phonebook of various people who can help with various problems. So it shouldn't be a problem."

But that's not all. There will also be minor things to take pictures of, such as a Mercedes Benz, a lava lamp, or even album cover of some kind.Each item will be worth a set of points, obviously the harder to get the picture the more points it will be worth. To begin with there will be 1000 things to get people interested, but as the game grows more items will be added to the list.Eg. Eiffel Tower worth 500 points, Lava lamp worth 5, Mercedes worth 100.This game will inspire people to travel as the desire to be at the top of this leader board will motivate them.Some people automatically live in areas where items worth a lot more are for example those who live in the same city as the Eiffel Tower will be able to gain the 500 points but they wont necessarily be able to get other items worth equal or more.The images will be sent into a database which will be judged by a group of admin to decide whether the pictures are accurate enough to gain points. This will eliminate cheating.The funding will go towards a professional app developer to help create this game as I am not quite able to do this myself, and also to employ people to help take the initial pictures needed for the players to compare them to. ",Overloaded servers - hiring multiple staff to keep the systems running smoothly.Reaching max points before a new update of images - release packages of 500 - 1000 images at a time every month. Incorrect/unidentifiable images sent in - specific rules/guidelines to taking a correct picture. Human judges also.,https://www.kickstarter.com/projects/1969747683/the-new-social-network?ref=discovery_category_newest,1969747683/the-new-social-network,"Project: To create an interactive, global, adventure style app that produces real life rewards and has no in app adverts.This app will offer people all over the world a chance to be active, social, and rewarded for doing so. It will be a way for users to get to know more of the planet they are on and the countries they reside in. The potential this app has continues to astound myself as well as friends/acquaintances that i have told. Primary Goal: To create a prototype app within 6 months. Without giving too much information away, i can say the funding for this app will go toward the prototype, advertising, merchandise, business fees, and potentially more updates for the app. I have already discussed with a development company what it is that needs to be created and will be working alongside them to ensure all goes smoothly. Once funded the prototype can be created within a month.Advertising & Merchandise will be created using logos, mascots and stickers (initially) The creation of a business, plus the designer/company that creates the merchandise etc as well as ongoing updates of the app, will require fees. ","Once created, there will be copy cat apps that will try and replicate the idea/concept. The aim will be to create an ""alpha"" product that will captivate the users making them less likely to use other apps. A risk will be that businesses or governments may not want to get on board with the idea, but thats ok as there are plenty of options. The main challenge i will face will be that i have not owned a business before, nor have i created an app. I am however, fully ready to put 100% of my efforts into creating this game with no flaws, no legal issues and also with no in app adverts as i know users find them utterly frustrating."

Thanks.",https://www.kickstarter.com/projects/wine/the-fisherman-0?ref=discovery_category_newest,wine/the-fisherman-0,"The GameThe Fisherman is an innovative game of fishing, a blend of action game, simulator of life and management game. Born from the passion for fishing and drawing inspiration from many TV series dedicated to this world, The Fisherman allows the player to take command of a vessel (initially a basic one) and go to the open sea. Once you have taken the equipment and enrolled the crew in the bar of the small harbor, you can begin living the life on board and in the harbor.It is possible to give orders to your crew and observe the life on board, before, during and after the release of the buoys in the high seas. The game begins in the base harbor, the water and the sound will bring your mind to a real harbor to give you that feeling of freedom that is the purpose of the game. You can observe the people on the pier, gulls, the wobble of the boat. Before you leave you need to hire the crew, a cost issue for an entrepreneur… You find the sailors in the bar of the pier. Choose who bring with you, pay them and take everything you need on your boat, then you are ready to leave.The life in the sea is not simple; your crew will be subjected to considerable stress during fishing, the release of the buoys and their recovery. For this reason it is good not to forget to order the crew to relax during the fisheries in order to avoid accidents at sea that can lead to the loss of a man, or worse, of the entire boat. The night might be the best time for fishing, the fisherman manages the day/night cycle. If you open the app at 8pm it will be already evening…Order to release the buoys with hooks in the sea, then put the crew at ease, waiting for the right moment to begin collecting and discover what you caught in the deep waters of the ocean… Observe your crew play on the boat, watch TV, use the pc, relax in the moments preceding the recovery of the baits… You cannot see well what they are doing? Zoom on the boat to better see what happens on board. After all, you are the owner of the boat!Once the baits have been collected, let's see what you got! Maybe a giant tuna or swordfish, be careful with sharks, as they do damage and remember that in the high seas, in the depths of the ocean, you never know what you can take on board…better bring a weapon with you.A man ends up in the sea? Are you in danger? Send an SOS and the coastguard will try to reach you in helicopter before the disaster happens. If the rescue fails… There is an excellent cemetery in the city, where you can go to find all the captains and crew that you have managed in fisheries.This and much more is The Fisherman, expected for iOS and Android.KEY FEATURES•	Handling of events with event cards during fishing and goodies cards every 24 hours•	Management of day and nighttime•	Onboard crew lives in complete autonomy, observe what happens and what they do•	Different types of vessel•	Three different locations for fishing, from your native town to the most remote ports and seas...•	The game is independent from the player, goes on on its own but do not ignore the crew!•	The game is released for free with possible in-app purchases (these do not limit the game)FishThe variety of fish is already considerable, with your help we can make it outstanding… We already have fish such as swordfish, tuna, different categories of sharks, fish of the ocean depths and real sea monsters! Every trip to the sea will carry a nice surprise...The event cardsWhen you go to sea you know… Everything can happen, especially accidents if the stress factor is high… During each trip an event card will tell you what happens and we must act accordingly. What could happen in a quiet night above the dark ocean depths?At the same time, every 24 hours a goodies card will make you a gift, a signalling rocket for the coastguard, a tv on board, a lifebuoy, a rifle… Hoping not to have to use it on board...Why finance the game?We strongly believe in this project, made by fishing and gaming enthusiasts. The Fisherman is not the classic game of fishing with the barrel that after 5 minutes has already tired, here you will see the life of a port, a crew that leaves and acts both under your command and autonomously, with the hope to return home and live with what is earned.You will see the appeal of your captain growing, change crews and boats, take huge and epic fish and then… Cry on his tombstone.With your help we want to accelerate the production of the game and enter many more elements to make the game experience even more unique and create a true masterpiece.

My name is Ted O'Brien, and I developed Phrase Master to teach English in China. Now I'm converting the game into an app that can be played on any device that connects to the internet.Players can challenge classmates to play a game, or they can find an opponent in another country. Registration is free and email-based. Anyone can try playing the game and gain access to all of the games by making a small in-app purchase.Players login to the Game Room to select which topics and levels that they want to play. After players click an X or an O button, they reserve their place in a game, and their name is displayed next to the button.Most players will view the Game Room on a small mobile device. They will only see one level of the game room at a time. Any player can start a game by clicking a blank button beside one with a name.Phrase Master has a simple format based on tic-tac-toe  and a multiple choice quiz. Players take turns choosing the questions. The player who selects a question can claim its square by choosing the correct word, but an incorrect choice gives the other player the chance to claim the square. The names of both players are displayed in the top squares. A border around one square shows whose turn it is.Both Players must match one of 5 words with the blanks in 3 phrases.When all of the squares have been answered, Phrase Master records the results and returns the players back to the game room. The number of matches, the total time and the score for each player are recorded.Phrase Master groups the scores of players who attend the same school. The app ranks both players and schools according to their average scores.Players can prepare to play Phrase Master with The Word Map. It contains a core vocabulary of 4,320 words. Words are grouped according to 24 topics and 4 levels. Each Phrase Master game is based on the same level words from three topics.Students can listen to the correct pronunciation of the words and their phrases. Three icons determine what external sites will be viewed when clicking on the phrases.Players can even chat in English or in their native language with others who are studying the same words. This adds a cooperative aspect to the game.Students can also view all the words in each topic, and they can search for words in English or their native language.Students who use smart phones to study the Word Map will see a simpler interface than computer users. They can view and listen to all of the words and phrases,  and explore them with search engines, but they can only view five words at a time. And they will only be able to see colored maps of three of the topics in a single view.The Word Map identifies all of the words that players correctly match in Phrase Master games. Seeing their progress in matching words with phrases will keep players motivated to finish learning all of the words.Most of the initial development of Phrase Master has been completed.  You can Visit PhraseMaster.net to view the prototype. Anyone can self-register with an email account. You can then log in and prepare for and play Phrase Master.I need help to finish Phrase Master. I will contract a professional programming agency, translators and other professionals to complete the development. I also need to revise many of the words and phrases. In order to raise money,I am offering a unique reward for each One hundred dollar donation. The ESL students at the college or high school of your choice will have unlimited free access to the first versions of the app. I will send School administrators and teachers a code for their students to enter when self-registering on our site. The code will automatically group them with their classmates. Teachers will have a special code that will give them access to detailed reports of their students.All donors of $10 or more will receive a coupon for a free Android or iOS version of the app when it is released. Regardless of your donation amount, include the name of a school that you graduated from. If the combined donations from graduates of your school equal $100 or more, your school will also be eligible for unlimited enrollments, so encourage fellow alumni to donate with you.Players from your school will see the game in your school's colors. The sample orange and white colors will be seen by University of Tennessee ESL students.Players from your school will also see a sponsor button in the Game Room, which can display your name and graduation year. Your donation provides a fun way for ESL students to improve their English and represent their school. -The best way to learn a second language according to the lexical approach is with phrases.  It's much easier to remember words if you study them in common phrases. Most of the phrases in the app have been identified by linguists using computers and millions of samples of real speech. BYU Corpus of American EnglishWe will use social network sites to market the app. Players will be able to login with sites like Facebook. The Phrase Master Facebook page will display a new video periodically of a hosted  version of the game. It will include photos and audio of the host and the players. The videos will be produced relatively inexpensively and uploaded to Youtube.We will use similar web sites in countries around the world to market the app in the same way. In China Ren Ren is comparable to Facebook and Yukou is comparable to Youtube.We will explore the possibilities for partnering with other companies through their developer programs. The Desktop version the Word Map currently links to both Google and Bing translations of phrases. If the principle of learning words in phrases is valid, then Phrase Master should complement many other internet tools and resources.I hope you will support this project. There are more than 1 billion people studying English around the world today, and game-based learning is growing in popularity. My promise to you is that I will make the best app that I can for ESL students and for their teachers and that you will always be proud of sponsoring your school  by pledging $100 on Kickstarter today. Thank you.","There should not be any legal issues. I have a copyright registration for the the Word Map, which forms the original content of the game. Anyone can create a tic tac toe game. There are many examples on the internet. I have written a Comprehensive Description and Functional Specifications for the app which I am using in a Request For Proposal document. I already have shown it to two programming agencies that have signed NDA agreements. Agencies primarily want to know your budget and to see your functional specifications. The Phrase Master app is relatively complex because it is designed as a real learning tool and not just a game. However, the technology is nothing new. The current app uses Ajax with a PHP / MySQL backend. I think the risks of technical problems are small, and so do the agencies that I've contacted.I plan to use feedback from students and teachers to ensure that the app is as  appealing as possible. There are a variety of options for determining how students progress through the 480 unique games that are required to match all 4.320 words in the Word Map to phrases. We will focus on the options that teachers and school administrators want.",https://www.kickstarter.com/projects/1776756002/someone-said-the-online-game-show?ref=discovery_category_newest,1776756002/someone-said-the-online-game-show,"Someone Said is the uber-like app for independent game show producers. Producers find locations and players who want to display a web page during a game. They can also choose the game host.The independent producers will share whatever prizes they can negotiate from sponsors and restaurants with the players they select according to game results. They must get the participants to register on the SomeoneSaid.tv website and all tested in a group Skype call. They must also get participants to sign a video release form.The game is based on quotes by interesting people. The quotes are first displayed with one word missing. Each player tries to complete the quotes by clicking on one of five word choices.Then they try to identify who said it by clicking on one of nine names.There's a time bonus and a three in a row bonus that determines each player's score.There are two versions of the game. One is for playing alone and the other is for the game show. Both versions of the game can be played on any web-enabled device, including smartphones. Clicking on the ""Daily Game"" buttonat the SomeoneSaid.TV website displays the individual game. It has new quotes every day, and players can record their scores.Videos of the most recent game shows are posted on the website. Up to six players can use Skype group video chat to appear on a show. Their video images appear to the left and to the right of the photos of the quote authors, which are are arranged in a tic-tac-toe grid.One player's name from each team appears in the blue and red score boxes for each of the questions. The player who gets the best score in completing a quote and identifying the author with the fastest time wins the author's square for their team, which is indicated by a blue or red border around the author's photo. When a team claims three squares in a row, a five point bonus is added to each player's score on that team. When the two players tie in attempting to claim a square, it gets a purple border and can be used by either team in a three-in-a-row bonus.Players can join the team from any location and are encouraged to have a visually interesting background. An unlimited number of players could also potentially join the game. An audio stream is not necessary for players to compete in the game. Players use a very simple low bandwidth connection. The scores and locations of the unseen players would be displayed at the end of the game.The quote authors in the game shows share the same profession and the video players will ideally have something in common with them. For example, they might all be musicians, actors, writers or entrepreneurs. The game begins with a slide show of the quote authors in which the host reads their names. The host will encourage comments about the quote authors and in future versions ask additional bonus point questions.The individual game also starts with a slideshow that includes a link to a search engine for each author. The nine authors in these games might not have anything in common, except that their search engine results include links to merchandise, such as books or movies.Clicking the ? question mark next to the photo opens a new window to a search results for the author. In this case it's the actress Deepika Padukone. She may not be well known in America, but Deepika is one of the most popular actresses in India and her search results give us options for buying her movies online. At the end of each game show, the scores of all of the players are ranked and displayed. The high scorer will receive a $500 cash prize and all the players on the winning team will receive a $50 coupon for buying merchandise online. 		The $500 cash prize will be sent with a payment processing service like PayPal. The merchandise credits for $50 will go towards an online media retailer like Microsoft Store, Google Play or Amazon. The goal is to demonstrate the potential appeal of the game in order to attract sponsors to fund the prizes and the operating costs of producing future shows. Getting viewers and subscribers to my Someone Said  YouTube Channel will be a key goal in putting together a pitch for show sponsors. The costs for producing the game show are much less than for shows that are produced in a studio. I am currently using Camtasia software to record and edit the video. Video Chat apps like Skype and WeChat are currently free to download and use.I have documented a working prototype of the game with a video recording. The next step is to produce six game shows in which the winning players receive real prizes.I will attract producers and players to appear on the game show by advertising on  Facebook. The Facebook ads will direct their users to my Global Game Show Facebook Page People who want to appear on the show as players can click the APPLY button on the SomeoneSaid.TV website. After reviewing their information and contacting them through Skype, I will choose the most interesting and appropriate players for each of the games. However, my ultimate goal is to get young professionals excited about doing that for their own shows.I would like to hire a professional programmer to convert the code I've written to a framework that would allow players to login with a Facebook or WeChat account. I currently use a free application to authenticate and log in players. I will also need to pay for some legal services, including fees for copyrighted images. There will also be expenses for reserving show locations and technical assistance.Independent producers can choose from a large collection of quote authors, or they can select their own.The quotes will introduce successful role models and inspirational voices to a global audience. Viewers will hear quotes that have been treasured for centuries. Other quotes will give insights into the thinking of some of the current leaders in a variety of professions. I believe Someone Said will combine the appeal of former shows like Hollywood Squares with the excitement of online multi-player games.Help me to push the game show envelope. $100+ Donation: I will use one quote of your choice in a show and link from your name to any website in the show notes. The quote must be verifiable online. $1,000+ Donation: I will produce that show at a restaurant or bar of your choice in the Los Angeles area. I'll display the website of your chosen location at the beginning of the show. Popular menu items will be presented at the end of the show","I believe I have demonstrated that the main technical challenges have been worked out. A professional programmer can produce a better app, but you can see the one I've developed is working. However, producing a show that many people find entertaining is a different kind of challenge. I believe a fair reward system for independent producers whose team gets the most likes for their videos is the key to booking appealing players and producing fun shows.Having teams from different countries or cities will also add to the appeal. West Coast vs. East Coast, China vs. Japan and Mexico vs. Spain are some of the possible match-ups. Having one member on each team who is a celebrity would also boost interest. They could play for their favorite charities."

Pretty much everywhere where music is played, MusicPoll can be easily set up and your costumers can choose songs from your music library and decide which of them will be played.MusicPoll can be used in two different ways. Firstly it can run completely on its own and automatically play the songs the costumers have voted for, or a dj can keep control over the music system and can lookup the vote outcomes. Here is how it all works.Probably you already have some music played at your location. MusicPoll will be installed at your location and loads songs from your music library into the system. You can decide which songs you want to have in the system and which ones you don't want to have in. After the songs are loaded into the system, costumers can go in your App, which is connected to your music system now, and vote for their favourite songs. The songs with the most votes will be played. In addition to the music functionality you can show ads in the app the costumers use. So you can promote your products, events and earn more money.",The technical side of our project is no problem. The biggest problem is selling our product to the world and male it famous.

https://www.kickstarter.com/projects/reyes-vera/lets-influencer?ref=discovery_category_newest,reyes-vera/lets-influencer,"When we started with Let's Influencer, we had one vision in mind, improve and evolve the collaborations in social media market. We want to open this market to every want to become an Influencer or be a better Influencer.We want to change the digital marketing market in the social media. Let's Influencer offers to the companies a global vision of Influencers and companies could find the best Influencer for his feed and his campaigns. Also, the Influencers could show his profile to more companies and do more collaborations with different brands.In like manner, we offer to actual managers and advertising agencies a platform to show their profiles and improve the relations with new brands. Additionally, they will be able to offer more collaboration for their Influencers.Also, this could sound incredible, but we got more than 100 Influencers validate and more than 800k followers with the scope of our Influencer since our go-to production, that's incredible! In the same way, we only were in production for 3 weeks until now.The present model of collaborations in this market is so limited, we want to change it! At this moment, if any person wants to begin or improve his career like an Influencer, they will need a manager or an advertising agency to contact with companies to start collabs between them. Another possibility is that the Influencer finds some company and they could collab, but this is more difficult to happen. It's similar to this:Let's Influencer will change this market, with us they won't collab only with the brands of the manager or the advertising agency. Let's Influencer offers to the Influencers, managers or advertising agency the possibility of access to more companies/brands and lead more campaigns. We have the offer, the brands are hunting!It's simple, Let's Influencer offer a portal to simplify, hurry up and ease the collaborations between brands and Influencers.Even, Let's Influencer will be a secure for the brand and influencers or managers. Our intention is to integrate a payment platform to ease the payments of the collaborations. The process is so easy, the company pays to Let's Influencer, when let's gets the money, the Influencer will be able to start the collab. When they finish, Let's influencer send the money of the collab to the Influencer. However, if the Influencer doesn't do the collab, the brand will get back his money. Something like this:The idea of Let's Influencer started in our legal department. We wanted to give the legal support to the Influencers of social media, the project sounds good and we went to production as soon as possible. The project started soo good, the Influencers started to trust in us but... we find a problem!The influencers should pay the fees to his government and they didn't want to pay... our idea didn't fit in the market... Also, we found some problems with the payments between Influencers and companies in his collaborations. (The companies didn't want to pay some ads)After that, we began to talk with the market to knew what they wanted. We think to offer the service of the management the profiles of our Influencers... but this wasn't scalable.In the same way, we project the present idea of Let's Influencer. We want to offer to the market a portal that works like a global manager, a portal that offers legal support and a portal that provide security in the payments.Another value! We want to reward our more influence profiles. In that way, we plan the Ranking Let's, with this ranking we add a score to every influencer. If they want to improve his score, they need to invite new people in Let's Influencer or they should do collabs with brandsWith these invitations or collabs, they will add new points in his score. The most influential people (the firsts of the ranking), they will get a reward like a trip, some experience, etc, we want to be more than a portal of Influencers.Our road map for Let's Influencer depend on the requirements of the market, we are in continuous evolvement! However, our big points to implements/apply are these:We need this budget to ampliate our scope in the development of the portal, start some campaigns of marketing to attract new people and to maintain the servers.We want to invest all the budget to improve the functionalities of Let's Influencer and offer the best product for the market. We only have one thing in our mind, we need to learn of the market and improve our product for them.They are the key to success, ever learning!For us, this project is a challenge for our professional career.We want to build a new model in this sector, our intention will be able to become a referent like Airbnb in the marketing sector.We don't search only create a successful company, we want to become a referent, a brand that people want to works with us and they feel comfortable to being a part of Let's Influencer.","Our biggest challenge is to introduce the portal to the brands. We want that the brands go to Let's Influencer to search the best influencer for his company.Now, the problem is that we don't have a considerable volume of influencers for all the companies, for that reason the companies don't see the value of Let's Influencer. On the way, we are hunting influencers in the portal, they want to become part of Let's Influencer, they see the potential value of that portal.It's only a matter of time that the companies see all the influencers of the portal and they will come here.

https://www.kickstarter.com/projects/2076963573/the-tiny-adventure?ref=discovery_category_newest,2076963573/the-tiny-adventure,"So, I've always thought a little outside the box, and have never, ever bought into the American Dream. You know, the one where you go to a college you can't afford, to (hopefully) land a job that you studied 4+ years for, to live in a nice house and impress those ""friends"" you don't really even like, and pay off the debt from that house, tuition, car, etc forever... That's just never appealed to me. So, I quit Paul Mitchell School in 2012, when I was halfway through, after a revolutionary white water rafting trip. That was the moment when I truly realized, ""Hey, I don't have to have millions of dollars and go shopping every weekend. I'll never be happy except for those few first moments upon purchasing cool stuff. What WILL make me happy, however is working at a job (outdoors preferably) that allows me to be myself, to be happy, around like-minded people.""So that was it. The day I began my road to happiness. Within a month of quitting school in Atlanta, I found a job on the Dalton Hwy in Alaska. The middle of NOWHERE. I applied, expecting to never get a call. Within 2 weeks I was on a plane. With no money, no one else, just me, and adventure. That was the happiest I've ever been.So, after coming back for my (now) husband, and having our beautiful daughter, Thea I'm ready to go back. And in going back, our lifestyle will be changing. We will be condensing from a large, 2 story loft-style building to a tiny house. Maybe 200 sq. ft. at the most. We're selling everything we have, building a house smaller than our living room, and traveling to Alaska. It won't be easy, but we're driven and ready to do this. We believe truly that this is our calling, and we are prepared to take the risks.Over the next several months, we will be documenting the entire process. To remember our experience, most vividly, to hopefully inspire others, or just open minds to alternate lifestyles. I only hope to inspire others to live their dream. Not the one society has laid out for you.","We have done (and are constantly doing) much research on the process of building the tiny house. We have very specific ideas of how much things are going to cost us, moving costs, etc. We hope there will be no setbacks, the only ones we suspect could happen, is needing more supplies than planned for. We have some money set back, and we do plan on searching craigslist and builders salvage for many supplies. At most, the project may take a month or so longer. But we will get it done!",https://www.kickstarter.com/projects/2076963573/milk-a-showcase-of-breastfeeding-around-the-nation?ref=discovery_category_newest,2076963573/milk-a-showcase-of-breastfeeding-around-the-nation,"My goal is to travel to major cities across America and photograph mothers nursing their children. I hope to have as much diversity as I can throughout the book, as well as quotes and stories from mothers throughout the nation, of their experiences/struggles/triumphs.The purpose of this book is to show that breastfeeding in any form, is beautiful, natural, and amazing. I hope to help empower women, be an influence to women who haven't decided how they plan to nourish their baby yet, I hope to be a shining light to those that are disapproving, to show that breastfeeding is God's intended way for us to nourish our children.This project will also show that nursing in public is NOT shameful. Nor indecent. I plan to photograph mothers in very public places, such as national monuments, popular areas, Capitals, etc.When my husband first took photos of me nursing our daughter, I instantly fell in love. As a mother and a photographer, I thought, ""What better way to preserve this special and intimate moment in a mother's life, than to photograph it?"". Breastfeeding being something very special to me, I wanted to do a shoot with several mothers and babies, to show the beauty of breastfeeding. To show that it's OKAY to nurse in public. It's OKAY to nurse your toddler. It's OKAY to tandem nurse.I received interest from several mothers throughout North Georgia, and scheduled the shoot in my hometown, at the beautiful Berry College. The photos were a HUGE success. I believe these photos show that breastfeeding is beautiful, not something to be hidden and disapproved of.I received so much praise and thanks for these photos, that I couldn't wait to do more. With World Breastfeeding Week coming up in August, there are dozens of mothers wanting to capture these special intimate moments with baby. So I thought, why reduce this to just my hometown? What if I travelled the U.S. and photographed as many nursing mothers as I could. Even further, why don't I publish a book, showcasing to the world what a beautiful thing this is.With each photo, with each book sold, that's another step closer to breastfeeding acceptance. To comfortability.It's another mother realizing that even though her family/friends don't understand it or support it, it only matters how SHE wants to nourish her baby.It's a mother knowing that she's not alone, there are tons of other mothers that also nurse their toddlers.It's an in-law realizing that just because she didn't do it, that it is a great bond between mother and child, and she should be supportive.Whatever your experience with breastfeeding, good or bad, I hope will be showcased in this book. There will be quotes/stories throughout the book from people like you. People that have experienced the same hardships, the same triumphs. Because you're not alone.With proceeds I raise beyond the $10k goal, I'll be able to travel to more locations, to photograph mothers that aren't able to travel to the locations set.","The only risk I foresee, is if I don't reach my goal of 10k. I've done my research of all travel costs, extra expenses, etc. I will be doing the shoots at no charge to any of the mothers, so I will not require additional money from anyone to make this project happen. Just the wonderful support from you all!"

I always see people bring their pets to events that have food trucks and there is never anything for them there. I want to change that!I want to serve amazing 'vegetarian' dog treats made fresh. (Vegetarian because I am a huge animal advocate plus I want them to also be human friendly that way you know they are getting quality ingredients)We will also have seasonal refreshments for the humans such as snow cones or coffee maybe even some banana soft serve!The truck may also be our vehicle for organizing pet adoptions, as well.

Despite not getting the funding we managed to raise enough fund to film our production Lucas and Albert. The film is now in post production. Filming took place in the Tendering area of North Essex in the UK. We had support from the district council and the local MP. But it was the help from the local community and business that really gave us a boost. We used local people to help and gave opportunities to several young people trying to start in the business. It was a great chance for them to work along side award winning director Darren S Cook, as well established professional like John Altman, Sid Livingstone and KimTaylforth. As well as local Essex actors Michael McKell and A.G.Longhurst. We need £10k funding for our next stage of promotion. This will allow us to enter the film in festivals World Wide, get the film certificated for early spring and summer, ready for a release in the late summer of 2019. We are talking to various venues, cinema and theatres over the UK. We also have Gala events in the pipe line and you could be a part of that. You can donate as little as £10. But for £50 you could have much more.",This is an independent film. We have not got a distribution deal as yet because we do not want to be tied down to a deal that does not benefit everyone. We can not promise that this film will make money or win major awards. But we have got it made and it will be completed.

User should know their limits on speed, terrain, and viability of their surroundings; therefore, electric skateboarding can cause injury or even death if negligent and/or not checking the safe operation of the electric skateboard prior to any use. Your board can lose brakes and power during your ride at any time due to low battery on the skateboard or remote. If this happens, its best to ride your board at speeds you are comfortable without power or brakes.Riding in the fastest speed modes are very powerful and the trigger is highly sensitive, be sure to very gentle with the trigger control to avoid being thrown off the board. Start by trying to move as slowly as possible within these speed modes when both using the brakes and acceleration.Do not ride the board if you are under the influence of drugs or alcohol.Do not ride the board in wet conditions. The board may slide from under your feet causing injury.ALWAYS respect pedestrians!!!!Always maintain your board, this is the owners responsibility.  Always check all screws/nuts throughout the skateboard are tight regularly.  Always clean your bearings for best roll and quietest/smoothest ride (including the bearing in the drive gear). Bearings get dirty and effect ride quality and may reduce battery performance and cause possible bearing failure.Avoid water -  Riding in wet conditions is very dangerous and may cause injury. The board is not water proof. The electronic and mechanical components are subject to  damaged due to water. Please note; damage as a result of moisture exposure is not considered a manufacturer defect and not covered by warranty.  Abuse - Do not jump on the board, ride off gutters or curbs, smash the board into hard objects, or drop the board on the ground for starting operation. Although the product has been made to handle rigorous riding, its still an electrical product and needs to be handled with care and respect.Riding on Hills -  Riding on hills can be very dangerous, what goes up must come down! So if you ride up an insanely steep hill and you intend to ride down this same hill, this is extremely dangerous and you must know how to control your speed without the use of the electric brakes if ever there was a malfunction or there was a situation where the brakes fail. You ride at your own risk.WARNING: RISK OF DEATH OR SERIOUS INJURY:Whenever you ride an electric skateboard, you risk death or serious injury from loss of control, collisions and falls. Always wear a helmet and personal protective equipment, such as but not limited to, elbow and knee pads. Like any sport, electric skateboarding involves risk of injury.

https://www.kickstarter.com/projects/2004436691/the-swinyard-numbers-print?ref=discovery_category_newest,2004436691/the-swinyard-numbers-print,"Hi, my name is Olly and I'm a graphic student. I have recently finished a two year graphic design course and after looking back at all my sketches and rough designs I realised my books are completely full of the same number doodles on every page.I have been doodling these 'numbers' for years now and never thought anything of it until when I decided to show people my work they were always more complementary on the five second doodles in the corner than my actual artwork! With this in mind I set out to make these doodles into a slick, clean and modern design that would look great hung up on any wall. I have designed three different sized prints so it can be perfectly placed into any sized space (A4, A3 and A2).I am going to print the A4 and A3 designs with a letterpressusing 300 gsm cotton paper to give it real texture and more impact. The letterpress will give the prints another dimension and will give a real quality feel to the print.Unfortunately the A2 print is too big for the letterpress machine to print so instead will be screen printed on 100% recycled 280 gsm paper. Screen printing will give a great quality to the print as the ink is laid on one print at a time by hand so each print will be slightly different.All the prints will belimited edition and will all be signed and numbered by me.A2 = 16.5 x 23.4 inchesA3 = 11.7 x 16.5 inches A4 = 11.7 x 8.3 inches(11.7 x 8.3 inches)Rough Examples:(11.7 x 16.5 inches)The A3 print will be letter pressed in the finest quality. The faded numbers will be letter pressed with no ink so will just show an indentation of the numbers. This effect looks great and gives a new dynamic to the print. To do this the print will be passed through the machine twice, once for the black ink and another for the 'no ink' indentation. This is why the print will be a little more than the others but the overall quality will be well worth it.Rough Examples:(16.5 x 23.4 inches)Both the White and Black A2 print will be screen pressed on organic, quality paper. These prints will be a great statement print and will fit comfortably in most room settings.Although the Black print on screen looks very bold, on paper the black is a lot less harsh and is more of a chalky, heather black. White ink on black paper is extremely effective and I have great confidence in how strikingly good it will look.  (A5 = 5.8 x 8.3 inches)Pick any number between 1 to 1000 and I will design a one of a kind Swinyard Number of it. It will be screen printed on A5 280 gsm paper and I will sign and number it 1/1. If you have a lucky number or a number that means something to you this would be a great and cool way to show it.Rough Examples:",If my project is successful then the main issue will be shipping the prints out to everyone and making sure they get to you exactly as they left without any damage to them. I plan to spend a little more and use the strongest postal tubes there are (3mm thick) to ensure that no damage will be inflicted onto the prints. If however something does happen to your print during shipping and you receive a damaged print I'll be sure to print a few extra just in case and I'll make it my priority to send you another one as soon as I can.,https://www.kickstarter.com/projects/2004436691/slick-luxury-custom-playing-cards?ref=discovery_category_newest,2004436691/slick-luxury-custom-playing-cards,"The SLICK deck is the first instalment in a series of luxury standard decks designed with one thing in mind.

Nixpod is the first unit of the series that we call Linux Unit of Computing. Our goal is to buildLinux powered Nixpod devices in various form factors and for specific applications. We embarked on this projectin response to growing needs of smaller, but powerful computing devices for fast growing needs of Internet of Things (IoT.)Nixpod, in it's maidenrelease is a versatile and a portable Linux PC that can be used not just as a productivity workstation, but also to serve other functionalities such as home networking, gaming, media and file sharing. Nixpod also serves as a Linux Server for developers to build and test their application locally.The device delivers a rich 4K display for viewing or building rich media applications. We built Nixpodin such a way that there simply isn't another ready and ""out of the box"" Linux PC that will readily plug-in and be operational upon startup!Nixpod is built with a powerful Single Board Computer (SBC) hardware with ARM Cortex A53 high efficiency 64 bitprocessor, 2GB RAM with 4K UHD video support along with an expansion board to accommodate an mSATA SSD drive for space and speed. Nixpod can be configured with your choice of supported LinuxOperating System.We have successfully prototyped a fully functional device (see prototype gallery above) and tested with the hardware, software and other networking parameters. We are currently using it as a in-house development server for our application development and a secondary linux desktop using Raspbian distribution of Linux. The device does everything that is supposed to do flawlessly.The Internet of Things is growing fast fueling the growth of Digital Smart Homes, and there is a greater demand for smaller and powerful devices to design and build applications as well as manage networking and other devices. Our aim is to build a series of Nixpod devices that will power these IoT gadgets and manage them on the network. Your contributionhelps us produce this device, followed by other devices and make themavailable for the users in a very cost effective way.All models are shipped with full list of accessories that includes cables, connectors and an expanded USB hub with SD card connectors just so you don’t have to run to the nearest store looking for a missing cable or connector! Our aim is to deliver a powerful and versatile linux computing device with everything that you will need to get started with your next Home Networking or Development project.Nixpods are built and tested right here in Toronto. Once we receive the funding we will immediately go ahead and get started with the case manufacturing and importing the materials for final assembly. We will also order the packaging for the product rollout. We plan to host a launch event in June 2018 and invite various groups of people including home users, college students specializing in IT and Computers, DIY enthusiasts and some businesses. Shortly after the launch we will start to ship the final product to all those that subscribed and paid for this product on Kickstarter.Your contributions in any amount will be greatly appreciated. And should you decide to pledge in exchange for one of our rewards, we will be happy to ship you the product promptly and provide you with a great customer service.We realize that not everyone is able to pledge support financially at reward levels. You can contribute as little as $1, and it will make a difference. And, if you are unable to make any financial contribution that's OK too. We would very much appreciate it if you will spread the word or tell your friends and family about this campaign by sharing this campaign link with them.","The risks and challenges associated with this project are no more than those with any startup project. Specifically, our major challenge is the quality and pricing of the components that we use. Fortunately, for us, we found suppliers from China, whose products have been very well received and reviewed in the United States and Canada. As regards the main hardware board we use the well known Raspberry Pi board that has been well received and tested. The other challenge is the protection of the case design from being stolen and duplicated. To mitigate this risk we decided to keep the case manufacturing locally within Canada under a legally binding NDA.

One day you lose your phone or move and change your phone number and forget to or unable to update your email account and voila! You are locked out! You will be directed through a ""secondary protocol"" - fill out the account recovery forms, prove to the world that it is really you. Meanwhile, what about your emails??The Mail Backup Unit is a standalone mail archiving device that does not need your intervention or supervision other than setting it up or if it needs your attention. The device may be accessed by other devices like a PC, laptop, mobile or tablet within your home network making the device a central source of archive for all your family's email as against carrying a backup on a single device like a laptop.We built the mail backup software application from ground up to keep it downright simple and user friendly. We built and configured the Mail Backup Unit to readily hook up into your home network and be operational within minutes without requiring any elaborate configuration from you.Just plug it, set it up and forget it!The Mail Backup Unit will automatically back up your emails at the designated time that you setup. The device is protected by a built-in firewall that prevents any unauthorized access. The Mail Backup Unit comes with 128GB of space, so there is plenty of space to back up your emails.We at Tecbasics strongly believe in the rights of the users to their privacy as well as the control and the security of their private data. Sadly in today's environment we, as technology users, have signed over those fundamental rights to tech companies, who in turn control our rights with their fine print buried in thick volume of terms and conditions of service. This has been echoed by many privacy advocates, as well as notably by United States senate during the public hearing of data breach of a tech company. Taking a close look at these terms of services will reveal that users are legally waiving their rights and explicitly or implicitly agree to be monitored and be bound by access controls and protocols laid out by these tech service providers. On a normal day this may not mean much as a normal user takes it for granted the access to these services and expects to just get it without realizing that the service provider is not legally obligated to grant access to user's own private data held on the tech company's servers citing befitting reasons. And without a backup, the user loses access to the data that is needed in that moment. Unlike in Europe where the users have a legally guaranteed access to their data, there are no privacy laws in North America providing such clear and unconditional legal guarantees to the user. It is largely left up to the service provide to craft their own policies making it a PRIVACY POLICY, not PRIVAY LAWS. And these policies can change to the whims of companies that are crafting them. In the end it becomes the responsibility of the user to ensure he or she has access to the data with alternate means, such as a private backup. At Tecbasics, it is one of our goals to create simple products and services that give back the users their fundamental rights, access and control of their private data and hold them in a place of safety, their home. The Mail Backup Unit is our first attempt aimed at this goal. This unit may not address the core of hotly debated privacy issues, but it allows the users to take steps to protect their data in the event they lose access to their cloud email account.The Mail Backup Unit supports the following top email providers:Gmail, Yahoo, Outlook, AOL, Zoho and Mail.com.The Mail Backup Unit securely connects to these providers using the industry standard IMAP over SSL protocol (IMPAS) to back up your emails safely and securely.Watch the video on top of this page to see how easy it is to setup and use your Mail Backup Unit.The device is housed in an well designed compact aluminum case to ensure the dissipation of heat, and it hooks up to your network via WiFi and occupies a tiny space on your shelf! The Mail Backup Unit is shipped with charger cable and a network cable and comes with standard 1 year parts and labor warranty.We have currently prototyped the unit with fully functional software and tested the connectivity and the actual mail backup with the email platforms. Once we acquire the required funding we intend to roll this into production.","The risks and challenges associated with this project are no more than those with any other startup project. Specifically, our major challenge is the safety of the user's data that is maintained on this device. Fortunately, this device is held in a private network behind the home networking router, thus making it inaccessible to the outside world unless the user decides to use a DDNS protocol to enable outside access. We have taken all the steps to implement a firewall on this device that protects any unauthorized access by anyone other than the designated administrator of this device."

https://www.kickstarter.com/projects/confidentnavigator/indoor-navigation-for-the-blind?ref=discovery_category_newest,confidentnavigator/indoor-navigation-for-the-blind,"We are raising funds to complete the development of an indoor audible guidance device that will attach to the cane of a blind or low vision individual that will allow the user to confidently navigate themselves through indoor spaces without the assistance of a person or a guide dog. We call this device Confident Navigator.Confident Navigator is a device that provides audible indoor navigation to the blind and low vision community which will revolutionize the way blind and low-vision people participate in their communities, enabling them to navigate freely and confidently without the assistance of a person, guide dog, or subscription assistive technology services. We do this by providing a device which the user attaches to their cane. The attachment communicates with navigation strips installed on the floor of the facility providing audible guidance to the desired resource. It also offers Bluetooth capability for wireless headphone connectivity and can communicate whether the area desired is occupied or not through its occupancy detection system.Garrett Roark, the inventor, is a part of this population as he lost his vision over 30 years ago. He sought to bring indoor navigation to the blind and visually impaired, at a level of accuracy that does not currently exist. Thus the Confident Navigator Solution was born. Garrett's sister Pam and brother-in-law John are also blind. They are all avid travelers and very independent. Our goal is to empower those with low or no vision to feel confident enough to go out and explore the world with equal accessibility.According to the National Institute of Health, 6.5 % (21 million) people in the US are blind or visually impaired and that number is projected to double in the next 20 years.Our patented system is easy to install, easy to use, and easy to expand. Confident Navigator has broad applications which will reach far beyond the restroom, enhancing access in government buildings, universities, businesses, and workplace settings. Once we are launched, two tax incentives are available to businesses to help cover the cost of making access improvements. The first is a tax credit that can be used for architectural adaptations, equipment acquisitions, and services. The second is a tax deduction that can be used for architectural or transportation adaptations.","We have high interest in implementation, however one of our challenges is getting businesses to adopt the solution before we have the entire device distributable.

Haberdasher invites its audience to spend a random Sunday with this off-balanced group of friends as they sift through the conflicting gossip concerning the whereabouts and well-being of Charlotte Ebbinger, an unpublished poet with a food fetish. Was her death a suicide? Was it a murder? Is she even dead? Directed by Hollie Klem, The Maderati explores what it really means to be an artist and, certainly more importantly, what it means to be ""a well rounded person."" Through their hilariously obnoxious antics, the show's characters offer a satirical look at what we really value. Is it fame, artistic merit, or honest human interaction? This take on Richard Greenberg’s, The Maderati promises to present characters you’ll love to hate.  In this hilarious portrait of the artists who make up New York City, these artists take on the challenge of holding themselves and their audience up to the glass. What they find is certainly loaded with comic value, sometimes hitting dangerously close to home!The Production Company:This production is sure to build upon the company’s reputation for developing highly entertaining, thought-provoking performance art. A theatre company with nine seasons under its belt. The company began when a small group of freshly graduated actors decided to take matters into their own hands and produce Remember Me, written by Adam Wier. With his words, as well as the artistic vision of Hollie Klem, Executive Artistic Director and the rest of the creative team, they founded Haberdasher Theatre Inc., a company that has produced dozens of shows, events, readings and workshops including Marlowe’s Doctor Faustus, Arnold Schulman’s Lost, Euripides’ The Cyclops, Lewis Carroll’s Alice in Wonderland, and Mac Wellman’s Dracula. The company has also adapted, directed, and performed children's stories by both Barefoot Books and Lewis Carol at venues such as FAO Schwartz, NYC and Books of Wonder, NYC. They also hold seasonal special topic workshops for theatre artists in New York, AND NOW WITH YOUR HELP, OHIO. Talk-backs and themed soirées highlight their commitment to fostering the exchange of dialogue between artist and audience.The move To Ohio:With all the above under the Haberdasher Theatre's belt, Klem decided to put the company's dream of expansion and her personal nine year dream of growing a branch in her native state into action. "" The Columbus arts scene is fantastic, and it's the people who make it so! I am so excited as I already have some very wonderful, Ohio based artists, performers and designers who want to team up with Haberdasher Theatre for this production. Ohio has been wonderful to me and the arts scene has welcomed me with open arms. Now it is time to pay this wonderful community back with some sharp, well executed theatre. Therefor, I am bringing a Haberdasher top favored script and my personal favorite comedy to kick us off. It is hilarious and I know for a fact people from all walks will love it and be doubled over in laughter."" ""My goal with this play is to have Haberdasher Theatre Ohio branch embrace the infectious spirits that Ohio is known for and play with the classic, eclectic, flavors of the New York arts scene to form a vividly witty show that will leave that audience smiling long after the curtain has gone down."" -Hollie Klem Check us out at www.haberdashertheatre.com","""I am tackling a HUGE task by growing a branch of Haberdasher Theatre here in Columbus Ohio and while I am aware of and am so thankful to have the moral support of the community in NY, it is still a fact that I must grow this branch from the ground up with limited resources. "" In the theatre, a lack of funding discourages risk-taking. For Haberdasher Theatre's most ambitious projects we turn to the community-funding model, through this we can ensure our artists and designers will have the time, energy, and resources necessary to let their imaginations run wild and produce a unique and unforgettable theater experience FOR YOU and the Columbus arts community. This project has two prominent challenges, networking and quality costs. Your funding allows us to clear those hurdles.NETWORKING COSTS: A top priority for Haberdasher is to LISTEN to our community's needs and delights, then produce solutions. Hearing the Columbus community voice and building a pivotal presence that caters to the NEEDS of the Ohio arts community by way of marketing and outreach. The resources and technology for this do not come cheap. Your donation will open the doors of communication so we can produce a product that will respect the vast capacity and validity of the imagination of YOU the viewer. QUALITY PRODUCT: A top priority for Haberdasher is to RESPECT QUALITY, from the art to the artists.  Everyone is always in search for quality products and your source of entertainment should be no different. The team I need for this project is of the best quality, award winning even. However these quality artists and designers did not become so strong by using shoddy material and disrespecting their craft by rushing their work. By backing this project you are also investing in the empowerment of people who work hard to offer Ohio, and those who visit, quality craftsmanship of a unique product.",https://www.kickstarter.com/projects/2135628743/savor?ref=discovery_category_newest,2135628743/savor,"Jed is a youthful and talented musician whose life tragically ends too soon.  After his death, his closest friends struggle with their own individual sense of loss and longing.  Jed’s absence in life allows many buried emotions to surface within the group, and soon the support system to which they each desire to cling to begins to crumble.  Through projected film elements, dance, and live music, the drama of Jed’s friends unfolds to the tunes of one of the last shows he played before his death.Savor is a story about life in the face of loss.  It’s an exploration of the process in which we mourn our loved ones...of the fantasies we create around them, the memories we relive with them, and the prospect of a continuing relationship after they pass.  This is a story about Jed and his family and friends as they communicate over the void of death.  What does it mean to die?...and in reflection, what does it mean to live?  How do we recreate our lives after one person’s story ends and how do carry their story on beyond their death?","Savor, in its fully realized form, is the most challenging project I have taken on as an artist.  To tell the story of a group of friends and their struggle through grief and loss, I found their to be no other way to encompass the largess of that emotional story without combining dance, film, and live music.  There is something incredibly tender, emotional, and vicious about dance that fits this project.  Film, to me, has always been a very personal way to convey a story through a relatively voyeuristic medium.  There is nothing like feeling your bones shake in a concert.  Live music is freeing and can easily make people scream with joy and break down in tears.  Of course, putting live performers in front of projection while a band is playing is no easy feat.I'm fortunate enough to have assembled a lovely team of people to aid me in the realization of this project.  That being said, we are challenged with 5 days of film shooting, an animation sequence, an album recording, and a show rife with technical requirements.  There isn't anything greater than putting together a project that is challenging, and I know my team and I are up for that challenge.Savor, for me, is a story about all of us; about our loss, our grief, and our healing.  It's important to me to share that story and to create a space where we can come together and share in this universal experience.  Despite the challenges and potential future set backs, I'm confident in this project and hope that you'll help to become a part of it.  Best,-Q"

A lot of the flavors are based on mixed drinks, or soda, or other drinks-- and occasionally breakfast and candy.I also draw, and right now what I really want to produce is a book of cupcake recipes that I've developed over the past few years, and the ones that I have listed in my little handy book of flavors.This is where you come in.Making cupcakes can get expensive-- finding taste testers isn't hard, but finding people who will help with the expenses of making those cupcakes is. As is finding someone who is interested in publishing this book-- which is why I'm electing to self publish for now.Anyway, a round of gourmet boozy cupcakes for all. :)","Challenges include failed flavors, not so moist cupcakes (not much of a problem so far), or mistakes in measurement (oops. Did that, but corrected.)It's a risk, but one that should be taken for drunk cupcakes. Seriously-- if you have extra alcohol around the house that you don't want to drink, and don't know what to do with, this would be perfect."

Izzy is a wild child and can run as fiery as her red hair in the wind. Tris is brown-haired, bookish and falls through the cracks like water, as his thoughtful and methodical manner belies his age. The only thing they appear to share is the love for their father: who traveled across the world when they were very young to save them from an uncertain fate after their mother (and his estranged fiance) died amidst mysterious circumstances. What they will discover together is another world where the word “magic” takes on another dimension.As they pass their 10th birthday and take the first steps into their teenage years, the rift between them grows wider as their true selves begin to emerge, creating a potential unbalance with repercussions beyond imagination. Meanwhile, the planet reels from tensions in every arena of life: political, societal and environmental. While the twins mature into their respective destinies, a mounting dread methodically transcends time and space to bring further chaos in an effort for total domination. Forces of nature can heal their divide… but will that reconciliation happen in time to save Earth?Set in western Massachusetts, the Five College area (Amherst, Hampshire, Mount Holyoke, Smith & UMass) and its culturally-diverse community serves as the backdrop. Experience in the Western world of media & PR intermingles with my side trip into Eastern medicine & philosophy - while bringing in a fascination with theoretical physics - to tell a tale that bridges this world with the mystic. The medium of fantasy & science fiction leads this journey between the physical world that we feel and the metaphysical one that we sense… the battle between who we are and who the world wants us to be.This Kickstarter project is for the first edition - which will focus primarily on Izzy - of a prospective trilogy. The second book will address Tris’ storyline. There is a possibility of expanding on this verse with further side/back stories in the future. As far as my Rewards program is concerned, I have included an option to tailor a short side story that will include the donor in the plot line. Pretty cool! Your assistance will go towards the immense time & effort to write & print this book. I’m hoping to have WILD AS THE WIND completed by Summer 2018.ABOUT THE AUTHOR: I’ve been writing my entire life, hammering away at a typewriter as soon as my mother put one in front of me. My first “big” book was “The Hobbit” and I was officially hooked. I always had a great imagination - art & music have always been a part of my life as well - and the realm of fantasy and science fiction just further opened up my mind to new worlds and experiences.After starting out my adult life as a chef - while also trying to be a rock & roll star - I went to college in my mid 20’s. It didn’t take long for me to realize what I was meant to do: write. I wrote about anything as I traveled around the eastern U.S. and Europe (while on exchange in England) during my studies at UMass. Journalism gave me a route to explore the world in a more rational manner while my own personal work blossomed as a result, too.After graduation, I went on an odyssey of sorts over the last two decades, working in sports media & PR on the college, semi-pro and pro levels. Interesting side work in Eastern medicine, philosophy, etc. occurred along the way and expanded my outlook on life. Unfortunately, the sports media world is a young person’s game these days. Combine that with my long battle with Chronic Lyme Disease and I’ve come to the conclusion that its time to re-shuffle my proverbial deck.So, at this transitional time, I’ve gone with my heart.

I gave it my best and had a blast doing so. I learned a lot, I met some great people and had a lot of support. But bigger, better and more gratifying than all of that - I felt a lot of love!So even though my dream of mounting an awesome Kickstarter funded exhibitions is over, the photographs I took are still an amazing part of hip-hop history and you can buy a prints at davidmcintyre.com.Join my mailing listor contact me for news and updates.Before The Notorious B.I.G. was dubbed the “King of New York” by The Source in 1995, and before he released his first album, Ready to Die, I photographed him on the streets of Brooklyn for Interview. This was one of the first in-depth features on Biggie ever published. But after delivering the prints to the magazine’s art department, I lost the negatives. This was long before digital, when pictures could be backed up. Without the negatives, none of these historic photographs would ever be printed or seen again.Until now. Twenty-one years later, miraculously, the negatives turned up in the most unexpected of places. I was ecstatic. It was like unearthing a time capsule filled with rare and valuable artifacts.The proceeds from this Kickstarter campaign will be used to mount a Notorious B.I.G. gallery show that will be open and free to the public. it will also finance a red carpet opening party. Contributors will be rewarded with T-shirts, prints and posters featuring pictures from the Interview shoot. And here’s the best part: Everyone will receive an invitation to the show. And for top ticket purchases, the invite will be to the VIP opening event where they can mingle with MCs, have a drink (or several; because Biggie would have wanted it that way) and see these amazing photographs in person.At the time of the Interview shoot, I was new to New York. In fact, this was one my first American photo gigs. It also happened to be my first glimpse of Brooklyn. That’s something to tell the grandkids: “The first time I went to Brooklyn, it was to meet The Notorious B.I.G.”It was the summer of 1994, a few months before the release of Biggie’s debut album, Ready to Die. I met the future rap star in a local recording studio. He was hanging with LL Cool Jay and Busta Rhymes. Upon entering the studio, LL approached me asking, ""Can I help?” I introduced myself and said I was meeting The Notorious B.I.G., not knowing whether to pronounce it “Big” or spell it out “B-I-G.” Amused at my confusion, LL pointed Biggie out. This was hardly necessary. The man stood out in a crowd.I'd already scouted the area around the studio and found several interesting Brooklyn locations. When Biggie asked me where I wanted to take the pictures, I was ready with some suggestions. We headed out together, completely alone. No handlers, bodyguards, crew, management or PR.How different things would be once the album dropped and started climbing the charts. Soon Biggie wouldn’t be able to walk the streets alone, in Brooklyn or any other city.The shoot was a minimalist affair. There was a makeup artist with me, but his services were declined. Biggie and I just cruised the streets of DUMBO alone. What an odd couple we made: a lanky Scotsman (often compared to a piece of spaghetti), with a camera strung around his neck; and Biggie (by name and nature), from the hardscrabble streets of Brooklyn, wearing a thick gold chain.That summer day in Brooklyn passed quickly. Just 15 shots, and it was goodbye Biggie.But the story doesn’t have to end there.My initial goal is to raise $28,000.00 to put on a show in a modest gallery that will feature 30” x 30” gelatin sliver photographic prints. Of this amount, $19,722.00 will be spent on printing, mounting, framing, a pop-up gallery, transportation, invitations, administration and postage, plus the expense for the opening night party. The remaining funds will be divided between the cost of producing the rewards and shipping them to donors.Tech StuffThe pictures were taken with a Mamiya 6X7 camera and Polaroid Pro/Res film, a pairing that meant I was shooting individual sheets of film. It’s a slow way of working compared to today’s rapid-fire, digital SLRs. The process requires patience and discipline. That goes for the subject as well as the photographer. Each picture must be carefully considered and composed. This analog technology may be tedious, but the payoff is huge: unsurpassed quality. This was hi-def before hi-def ever existed. Every last detail, from individual skin pores to the smallest graffiti scrawls, are captured in stunning clarity. This shoot was as basic as it gets. Photo verité all the way: hand-held, available light only. I prefer it that way: uncomplicated. There's no setting up, no fussing around, no waiting. The atmosphere is natural and intimate. The Polaroid sheet film comes in packs of ten and delivers a small black-and-white print and a negative, which can be used to print larger photographs later. It was a wonderful film stock, and I miss it dearly because it supplied the best of both worlds: an instant picture that can be checked for exposure and composition, plus a negative to make amazing blowup prints.From start to finish, Biggie was committed. I sensed that he wanted to get the perfect shot as much as I did. He had a reputation for being prepared and totally focused when he went to the studio to lay down tracks. This shoot was no different. I can't say we hit it off. I think he was shy, or maybe he found my Scottish accent disconcerting. It wouldn't be the first time people have humored me while having no idea what I was saying.  I tried to make small talk, inquiring about his daughter, who I though might have been the baby photographed on the new album cover. He said it wasn’t and joked that it was one of his baby pictures. Not true.  Rap trivia: The cover model was actually, Keithroy Yearwood, a baby model Sean Combs booked through a local casting agency.Having just moved to New York I didn't know of any good printers in the city. So I decided to print the Biggie pictures myself. I booked time at a rental lab, one of those dingy places in downtown Manhattan where darkroom time was sold by the hour. I edited my favorite shots and made several prints, which I later delivered to Interview. Then I moved on to the next job. When the magazine came out, I thought the picture looked fantastic. Although, I was bit disappointed that they'd cropped the image down from its original square format to a rectangular full-page. That’s nothing new in the editorial world. Photographers and art directors are always in a tug of war over page layouts and precious inches.  As Ready To Die climbed the charts, becoming a massive quadruple-platinum hit, I went searching for the negatives to make some prints for my portfolio. But I couldn't find them anywhere. I searched frantically. Then I searched some more, but to no avail. And the more I searched, the more vividly I remember each frame I’d taken. They became permanently etched in my memory, impossible to forget. Eventually, I gave up looking and came to terms with the fact that they had disappeared forever. Life goes on. In the mean time, Biggie reestablished the East coast sound and inspired another generation of rappers before being murdered just a few weeks before his second album, Life After Death, was released. It went “Diamond,” selling ten million copies and cementing Biggie's stature as the greatest rapper ever. Today, twenty years later, he’s still is considered by many music critics as the definitive rap artist. Over the years, I’d get calls from magazines asking if they could see and purchase reprint rights for the Biggie pictures. Not wanting to admit the negatives were lost, I’d just say, “Sorry, not interested.” Then they’d offer me crazy money. They thought I was just driving the price up. How much can a Biggie picture be worth? As it turns out, quite a lot. I still remember when my oldest son was 16. He had heard that I photographed Biggie, and was excited: ""You met Biggie Smalls?” For a moment he thought I was the coolest dad ever. Until he asked, ""Can I see the pictures?""At the time of the Interview shoot, my wife and I had an apartment in Chelsea. But after 20 years in the same apartment, we decide to move. And then, it happened. As I was clearing out closets and filling up cardboard boxes with a lifetime of memories, I found the Biggie negatives.Biggie is an inspiration to many rappers like 50 Cent and Jay-Z, who pay homage by appropriating his lyrics and using them in their own songs. He’s also an inspiration to millions of fans who admire his rags-to-riches story. To quote from Biggie’s first single Juicy: ""You know very well / Who you are / No ones gonna hold you down / Reach for the stars...""    But it's the opening monologue in the very same song that I most identify with. “To all the teachers that never believed I'd amount to much.” That's my story, too. Indeed, it’s every artist’s story: singers, songwriters, painters, writers, actors… It’s the story of anyone who’s ever dared to dream big, especially in the arts. All of us have had to overcome obstacles and fight for what we believe in. It’s a never-ending battle that I’m still fighting! How about you?CREDITS: Thanks to Rhys & Rondell for shooting the video.

A portion of the funds will also be used to produce the rewards and promote the show.After securing a gallery that can accommodate the number of backers and potential opening night attendees, the next hurdle is logistics. I have had preliminary conversations with gallery owners, event planners and PR companies who are ready to commit to the project once the numbers of backers reach a critical mass.I hope to have the opening within three months of the campaign being funded, but there are risks to consider. The greatest of which is the timing of the event and delivery of the rewards.

The Quartzfielduses energies already proven to effect Quartz crystals, it uses the specially cut Vogel crystal, to direct the energies of light, laser, pressure, and sound that are projected onto the crystal. Then your bodies natural energies comes into 'relationship' with the crystal's energy. Quartz crystals also emit negative Ions, soto boost the negative Ion output of the crystal,I added the North side of two strong magnets. I recorded over forty frequencies on my computer and played the sound waves in the form of square waves, sawtooth waves, sine waves, and triangle waves, for the crystal to transduce and transmit that vibrational energy. In addition to my original forty frequencies, I will send, as a bonus, more than thirty frequency tracks from a different frequency artist. I am excited to bring the energy of vibration into use, via message vibrator(vibrating atoms while introducing the energy of the crystal with your energetic impressions).

I have been a son, a brother, a student, an athlete, a lover, an architect, a husband , a father and programmer, and a consumer. My experiences have been layered with an intensely curiosity and an acute sensitivity. I have developed a filter from the experiences for better or worse, that colors my imagination, which has always been disparate and vivid. I construct my writing to provide intense narrative laced with information that intrigues.

I have previously designed and made one-off photobooks by hand and have a design background therefore there should be no issues with regards to the final publication.,https://www.kickstarter.com/projects/shootfilmuk/the-steve-project?ref=discovery_category_newest,shootfilmuk/the-steve-project,"The Steve Project is a collaboration of two photographers studying the importance of family photography and the traditional display methods within the family home. The work will be an indepth study of the psychological reasoning behind the notion to curate and exhibit family photography. Over two years our research and data collection will result in a series of  exhibitions and a photobook alongside an academic research paper aiming to inform and  educate students and artists on the significance and relevance of traditional family photography in a digital age.Myself Karl Child and my partner Claire Angel (the two artists involved) have recently graduated from university with upper second BA (hons) degrees in Photography. Our interests and projects are based around the ideas and concepts which deal with issues on photography within domestic life including identity, relationships and cognition. We have recently exhibited relevent projects at the University of Central Lancashire, The Old Truman Brewery exhibition space in London and at the Imitate Modern Gallery also in London where our work was auctioned to raise money for an alcohol and drug awareness charity. We also have individual Photobooks which explore the concepts previously mentioned. Clairehas a foundation degree in Art Therapy in which she focused her practice around the use of family photography as a therapeutic tool. Recent research has involved entering the homes of others under a professional house sitting agreement to understand and document home curation and display methods, this gives us an 'outsiders' perspective and allows observation on relationships of which we are not involved. I was recently commissioned to travel to Guangzhou to carry out a series of photography assignments working with local journalism students after completing a smaller project documenting chinese heritage in the north west of engalnd which involved observing and photographing their family life on a day to day basis. We have both recently written a thesis on relevent subjects including photography, memory and therapy.A little more about the project:Through a series of professionally organised house sitting assignments we plan to travel around England documenting the inevitable exhibitions curated by the family members and home owners. By doing this we will gain knowledge and understanding which will allow us to identify and analyse certain concepts such as patterns and trends, dynamics and power alignments within relationships, subconscious decisions made by all participants and the interactions between the physical prints and each family member including the curator and observer. During our time spent at each house we will be photographing every room which displays a single or a series of images. This process will allow us to further analyse each household and question the psychological reasoning behind curation. Having the photographic documentation will give us the opportunity to reflect on what we have been observing by removing them from their original context. This will raise questions such as design and placement of each photograph, size, age, narrative etc. Once we have gathered material from each house including Photographs of their display methods, notes and interview transcripts, we will compile the answers to these questions into a spreadsheet database which will inform our research paper and allow us to further analyse the use of photography in the family home. Our data will include areas such as the number of images displayed (in certain circumstances we will take into account the number of photographs displayed on digital photo frames in comparison to prints). We will also observe image sizes, positions and locations and the age of the image/age of sitter. For example a 'new photograph' of a new born baby would suggest that child is still young, however an old photograph of a new born baby would suggest that child is now older. This simple observation would then allow us to explore the remaining images on display to discover that subjects relationship with the curator. This will determine their positioning within the family unit also enabling us to analyse power alignments and dynamics. We will also create data surrounding the content of each displayed photograph for example key events including Birthdays, Graduations, Family Holidays and Professional Family Portrait Sessions. When editing a collection of printed family photographs, the curator is restricted to the amount of space within their ""gallery"". This makes the editing process much more specific. Given a digital photo frame, the curator is able to display an almost unlimited amount of images in place of one single print, only restricted by the capacity of their purchased memory card. This often results in a less focused curation. Having a series of images pass by every 15 seconds in the formation of a slideshow, may mean that their importance is overlooked. Although the use of digital display may not necessarily be as refined as traditional display methods, our research will allow us to analyse the interaction between both methods of display, with an overall aim to provide coherent and informed knowledge of the importance of the printed image within the family home.",There are certain risks involved in photographing strangers houses however these are avoided with a few simple precautions. All participants are informed about the project and then asked to give consent before we start. After each house sitting assignment is complete all names and locations will be kept confidential.

We hope you will look through our project and support our next steps.Gotta Lotta Gelata is a gelato dessert truck and catering business based in Wilmington, Delaware, serving the Greater Philadelphia area.It's everything gelato and MORE, from pops to cream puffs, cannoli, mousse, floats and tiramisu.We first started serving gelato pops, personalized with a variety of coatings, dips and toppings:Then expanded into other gelato-filled treats:We've only had our truck for two months and have already received awards and accolades from fans and chefs.Our success has been wonderful but we need to expand. A commercial kitchen will help us meet the demand and allow us to supply non-frozen desserts during the Winter months.Desserts like this:AND THIS:NEXT STEPS:The kitchen will need an oven, mixer, freezer and require electrical and plumbing upgrades.Our customers come to our truck even in the cold Philly weather! With your help we can serve you ALL kinds of desserts year round.For all who support us, we have some special rewards for you. From free desserts, to tickets to our reward party, Create-a-Signature-Flavor and even a pre-paid gelato party, we've gotta lotta of ways to make you smile. And meanwhile, keep looking for our truck and indulge in the best gelato have ever had.Rewards: We wanted to offer a reward to fans outside of our immediate area so we added this gift. The classic tin box contains 2 dozen of our swoonable, heavenly chocolate chip cookies. We've managed to make a chewy, yet delicately crisp cookie. Our secret will not be revealed! Just enjoy it.OUR STORYWe both had professional, corporate careers but felt something was lacking. It was the joy of work, creativity, passion, risk and rewards of making something special. We were ready to be entrepreneurs.We both lived in Europe at different times in our lives,and had fond memories of gelato, also known as Italian ice cream. There was a gelateria in every town in Italy! We didn't realize at the time how special and amazing this was.Years later we noticed the number of gelateria in the USA was growing . But, there was still room for growth. Our research revealed that Italy has 45,000 gelateria, Germany has 7,000 but the USA only 900, but the number is growing.Gelato is special. It's different from ice cream and once you have real, artisanal, fresh Old World gelato, you never forget it. It's softer, velvety luscious, yet light and dense at the same time. Gelato contains less fat but more flavor and is not as cold. No brain freeze!So what is a food scientist and MBA to do? Got to Gelato University!We did some research, wrote a business plan and decided we wanted a mobile dessert truck.Our Truck:After months of designing our truck, sourcing funds, researching equipment, we drove off in our truck on September 28. The following week, the logos went on. This was so exciting!Since we picked up our customized Gelato Truck on September 28, we have been warmly received by festival goers.HOW YOU CAN HELPFollow us on Social Media and spread the word! Every little bit helps. Help us get kitchen up and running so we can expand and create MORE unique desserts for you.FacebookInstagramTwitter","A commercial kitchen requires inspections and permits which can delay the opening.  We have addressed this by familiarizing ourselves with the local laws.

https://www.kickstarter.com/projects/minkisan/unity-for-content-creators-and-streamers?ref=discovery_category_newest,minkisan/unity-for-content-creators-and-streamers,"Unity will enable you to market your channel or stream from a single interface and give you tools to analyze your presence and increase your views and therefore your revenue. It will do this through a combination of analysis and marketing with an unprecedented tool set which will allow you, the content creator to get on with the task of creating the content. Unity will be a web based app which will give you the flexibility to log in from anywhere and track your growth, interact with your fan base, create overlays and so much more. Using Unity to analyze your videos will be as simple as clicking a button. You can compare individual videos, days, weeks or months at a time and see what you did that worked, what you did that didn’t and then tailor your content to suit. Why keep guessing what you should do next when Unity will take the guess work away, get you working smarter, marketing more and ultimately earning more. Unity for Analysis: Unity will analyze your activity. It will then compare your activity to your results and then make suggestions for future actions to maximize your growth. Working in this way Unity will complement the way you work and so will feel like a natural extension to your content creation instead of feeling like a chore. The result will be actual advice you can act upon to increase your audience. Unity for Growth: As well as suggesting actions Unity will actively market your channel or stream giving you time to create additional content, which Unity will also market for you, seamlessly, quietly, efficiently and above all, with as little input from you as possible. Unity for Efficiency: You will be able to input your details ONCE, Unity will get you signed up with a plethora of sites to engage your audience, market your channel and create an income. You will be able to input your stream or video details ONCE and Unity will ensure all of your available outlets are informed, updated and drawn in meaning you can increase the amount of time you engage with your audience.Unity for Coverage: Share your activity with an audience on Facebook, Twitter, Reddit, Pintrest, Instagram, Hitbox, Dailymotion, YouTube, Twitch, Blogger, Google+, Tumblr, Stumbleupon, Linkedin, LiveJournal and others automatically and with little to no input from you. Consistently promote your content, grow organically and keep your fans informed. Unity for You: Log into your account from anywhere, use the accompanying app on your phone and track your growth in real time using the most up to date information from all of your networks in one place, with one set of numbers and with one plan to grow. Finding the relevant information is easy with Unity.Unity for More: Getting noticed on YouTube, being discovered on Twitch and growing your channel is becoming harder. As Twitch gives preferential bandwidth and better rankings to larger channels and YouTube ranks a video based on views, growing a channel can be a long and arduous process. Using Unity to super charge your online presence you can create an army of fans who will flock to watch your content. It takes hours of work and many years of little to no rewards to establish yourself on one of these platforms. Unity aims to level the playing field by giving you access to every tool in your arsenal from a single, simple to use interface and by working with your already established routine to help supercharge your channel growth. For a streamer imaging being able to create an overlay, add widgets to display information on screen, promoting your stream and uploading details of it before you begin, then being able to stream to 2, 3, 4 or more different outlets at the same time. Engage with your audience using a unified chat and track viewers, subs, followers all in real time while you get on with the job of streaming. For a YouTuber imagine creating your video and uploading it once, get suggestions for your description, tags and headline. Have your video promoted to all available networks and maximize your views, Upload a cover image once, then with a single click, promote your video to an entire potential audience of millions. Unity will do all of this for anyone, no matter how big your audience is, no matter how many fans you already have, more is always better, your fans can always be more engaged and more entertained. Once funded Unity will quickly become a content creators best tool and you will wonder how people grew their channels without it. What follows is my initial design brief.             UnityA content creators’ best friendUnityA subscription based marketing, service and usability tool that will unify your online persona. A single application that will enable you to get on with the job of creating content.The core goals of the software are to provide a single interface that will enable a person to see a snapshot of their online presence, engage with their fan base and suggest beneficial actions to cut down the amount of time spent marketing themselves to enable them to make the content they would like to market.The first stage will be registration. A user will register to the service, they will be allocated a customer number.I think it would be a good place to just interject a few points about design so you can mentally walk through my ideas with a view to the feel of the software, however, nothing is fixed and I am open to any of your ideas regarding any aspect of the software.From a design point of view it should have a clean and simple look whilst being colourful. It should also be intuitive to anyone who needs to use the software.I like the cleanness of the metro interface, the simple design but I would like there to also be a flow to the software with wonderful transitions between screens and I would like the software to be as intuitive to use as possible with no menus. If there is an option to allow for different “skins” so users can customise the look to suit themselves then that would be perfect.After the user has access to the service they will complete a comprehensive form detailing as much information as necessary. They will add details of all of their social networking sites currently used, twitter, Facebook, Instagram, linked in, etc. and Unity will then have them register at the other sites filling out as much information for them as possible or better still auto register them from within the application on sites like Facebook, Twitter, Reddit, Pintrest, Instagram, Hitbox, Dailymotion, YouTube, Twitch, Blogger, Google+, Tumblr, Stumbleupon, Linkedin, LiveJournal and others.They will then move on to their content platforms. Using the same premise as above in that they can add their existing accounts but with the ability to register with at least the four services offered by YouTube, Twitch, Dailymotion and HitBox.The idea is they fill the information out in the app, the app then has all the information necessary to register them to as many content outlets and social media platforms as possible with them just having to click a simple agreement for each.Once this is done they will then be in the regular interface screen. From here they will be able to view combined analytics for their entire online presence with data taken from all outlets and presented in an easy to read snapshot of their daily and weekly impacts.They should then have the ability to drill down and look at what content they made that caused which reaction from their audience.A way to suggest actions that worked and those that didn’t work as well would also be available from this screen. For example, if they uploaded a video and tweeted CSGO Gameplay, and reached 20,000 people and there was a spike in views but they also did the same thing but tweeted CSGO Crazy Gameplay and reached 60,000 people and there was a larger spike in views then it should be suggested that the latter method was more successful and Unity should be smart enough to check heading lengths, number of keywords used etc. For example, when uploading the user could be asked one word to describe the video, this should be searched for using keywords and suggestions of great keywords to add to the description and the number of times to use each keyword should be presented.                    Using the softwareUnity for Recorded content:After creating a video a user can upload that video to unity servers which will then upload the video to the chosen outlets (YouTube, Twitch, Hitbox etc.) The video is then automatically deleted from the server or if possible it is uploaded as it is being uploaded (some kind of pass-through service?) if this is cost prohibitive or too time consuming then a queuing system so that the video is uploaded in turn to each of the selected sites, perhaps by way of a check box. Once the upload is started a user can add details of the video, title, tags, categories, monetization options and thumbnails to market the video correctly. Information for every site it is going to is taken and the relevant information is then passed to each site with the video, for example, if twitch doesn’t accept tags or thumbnails they are taken anyway because YouTube does accept them and they are sent to YouTube and not Twitch. The descriptions and tags should be checked against previous videos and then marked for success, suggestions for better keywords should be made.Once the videos are uploaded a message is sent to all of the social media outlets with details about the video relevant to each outlet, for example a tweet is sent to twitter but a link and thumbnail are sent to Facebook and Instagram. After 1 week a further social blast is sent to remind people about the video.Unity for Streaming content:Entering into the streaming tile will first give you the option to create an overlay for your stream. Customizable and with the option of adding widgets to show things like YouTube and twitch subscriptions and followers gained during streams, unified chat boxes and the ability to add your own backgrounds and art, a donation button should be added for those with accounts at Patreon and Gamewisp etc and the option to sign up for those without.They will then go to the streaming interface, they will see the stream key, the list of sites they could stream to and will check each place they would like to stream. After opening their streaming software (XSplit or OBS) they would add the url for the overlay and then add the stream key. They then begin streaming to the Unity server and again the stream is sent to their services or some sort of pass-through is used to send the stream out to the various networks. If possible the overlay and stream key would be added to obs or xpslit automatically as would the overlay. Whilst the stream is active they will be able to see the connection details for each service, how many people are watching on each service using the software and possibly an ios and android companion app linked to their account. Each stream should have a unified chat box from each service. Each stream should be sent using the outlets preferred bitrate if possible.After the stream details are sent to the users account via the analytics interface that shows the total amount of viewers, the amount of engagement (ie total comments and length of time each user watched for) and a rating should be applied. For example, the amount of viewers / the amount of comments * the length of the stream / the average amount of view time. This number is arbitrary as a rating but once applied to every stream a pattern of change can be seen and perhaps different ratings could have different colours or awards added to the users’ profile.At the end of each calendar month the users’ online presence is worked out in a similar fashion and a monthly rating is awarded in the form of a grade so progress can be tracked and content created can be adjusted accordingly.I am essentially trying to create a unified service to enable a user to focus on the job of creating content.","I have been in business for most of my adult life. I am 42 years old and have been a very successful publisher, manager and business owner. There are a lot of risks involved with any new start up but once funded the software will be developed and will be available.

Scaling up could be an issue with cost of additional services but this should be offset by new user subscriptions.Piracy is an issue that should be resolved by the applications primary services being web based however, there could be a need to have a client side app that could be abused.

Luthought if he go into the desert and make those evil spirits laugh they wouldlove him too. Immediately he left and ran into the desert. What Lu didn’trealize was he was madly in love with himself and that in itself was wicked. Thewicker a person is, the more vulnerable they are to the evil spirits. Lu wasgoing into the desert to entertain spirits that were more wicket then himTo Lu’s surprise the evil spirits received him with joy andthey immediately possessed him. The wicket in his heart grew worse and he setout to take over the world by stealing souls. He killed countless people, allwho didn’t believe in God. He chose them because he could not touch anyone whohad made a commitment to God already. EventuallyLucifer aka Lu was gunned down by police in the desert. Now his soul along withthose evil spirits goes from one body to another possessing and taking souls.

https://www.kickstarter.com/projects/112944064/behind-the-red-curtain?ref=discovery_category_newest,112944064/behind-the-red-curtain,"Today's horror movies tend to rely too heavily on blood and gore, on the visual more than the cerebral. I'd simply like to create something that taps into the endless horrors of the imagination, gently guiding you down a path of pain and fear.Below is a basic description of the opening scenes to the short film I wish to create. Blackness gives way only to the awareness of it, punctuated by the muffled sounds a woman struggling.  Then a dim light appears as if viewed with blurry eyes through a burlap bag.  An indiscernible figure momentarily blocks the light – there is a sense of motion as the viewer is taken down an intermittently lit hallway and into a room.  The hood is removed to reveal a scene of confusion and horror.  The room is dark but for one naked bulb hanging in the center.  There is a young woman across the room, blindfolded, gagged and bound to a wheelchair, sobbing.  Oddly out of place is the name tag on her chest which reads Laura.  Behind her is a white sheet hanging from a wire as if to form a curtain.  The view moves to the right just as a large masked man appears from behind and then walks around the sheet out of sight.  A worktable at the side of the room filled with various tools is left as the point of focus.The view shifts temporarily to the woman just wheeled in.  We see her struggling against her own bonds, identical to the woman in front of the curtain except for her lack of blindfold.  The name tag on her chest reads Jessica.  We pan back to the curtain just as the man walks from behind it.  He pauses and turns briefly to glance at Jessica with an evil in his eyes that mirrors the horror in her soul.  Before he turns away we glimpse the name tag on his chest that reads Vickie.  He moves to the table to peruse the many items available, finally selecting the garden shears and picking up a bucket from the floor before he goes back behind the curtain.  It is at this moment that we realize the sobbing we’ve heard is not just from the woman in front of the curtain, but similar sounds have been coming from behind it as well.  The sobbing quickly turns to muffled screams as we hear the sound of bone crunching and then something hitting the bottom of a bucket.I hope this provides you with a general sense of the direction I am going in. I don't wish to give ending away, as I have a few twists and turns to surprise you.I would of course be happy to answer any questions.","I have tried to address all of the obstacles I might face.  I still have to cast one actor, but do not expect significant difficulty.  I have a location tentatively lined up and I am considering a backup should there be conflicts with availability.  Finding someone to assist with the editing and sound is likely the largest hurdle that remains, and where a significant portion of the funding will go.",https://www.kickstarter.com/projects/112944064/samurai-mary-vs-ninja-jews-the-birthing-of-christ?ref=discovery_category_newest,112944064/samurai-mary-vs-ninja-jews-the-birthing-of-christ,"The following is a brief synopsis of the short animated film I wish to produce.

I would be happy to answer any questions you have regarding this project. Thank you for your support.Samurai Mary vs. Ninja Jews: The Birthing of ChristIt is a chilly December night in the little town of Bethlehem.  Hints of frankincense and myrrh in the air.  At the outskirts of town, in a tiny manager, Joseph stands over Mary as the joys of labor begin.  Joseph is smiling down upon Mary, whispering of his love for her and their child soon to be.  All is peaceful and right in the world.Without warning, a sword blasts from Joseph’s chest, a single drop of blood falling from the tip, mirrored by a tear shed by Joseph for the child he shall never see and the wife he shall never again hold.  The sword disappears from whence it came and Joseph’s lifeless body falls to the ground.Mary recovers from the shock just in time to dodge two throwing stars that barely miss her head, burying into the pillow.  She grabs them both with one hand and tosses them back at her assailants – two Jews falling to the floor, blood gushing from their foreheads.  She leaps from the bed, pulling a sword from beneath her pillow, thrusting it through the throat of the ninja that had just killed Joseph.More Jews appear from the shadows brandishing various weapons.  Mary fights them off with her sword in glorious battle – occasionally disarming a foe to use his own weapon against him or others, but her sword is most familiar to her hand.  She plunges it deep into heart of one Jew just as another slashes down at her with his own.  It barely misses her but falls down upon the back of her sword instead, breaking it into two.  She fights on for a moment using only her hands and feet, but there are too many Jews and she is being overwhelmed.Just when all appears lost, Mary let’s out a guttural scream, momentarily stunning all of the Jews around her.  Baby Jesus falls from her vagina to the floor.  Seizing upon their confusion, Mary lifts Jesus by the umbilical cord and begins to swing him about as a weapon of god – slamming his body into their foes, breaking bones, crushing skulls.  Deflecting the thrust of a sword with the cord, she decapitates one Jew by wrapping the cord around his neck and pulling tight.Mary seems to be winning the battle, but as she kills the last Jew in the manger, a hundred more are seen in the distance, coming at her from every direction.  With anger in her eyes, Mary lifts the umbilical cord to the heavens as if in prayer, then bites down hard upon it freeing baby Jesus from his tether.  Baby Jesus rises into the air above Mary.  He begins to spin as the light of god shines brighter and brighter from within, until just as the Jew mass is about to descend upon he and his mother, the light explodes, sending a circular wave of energy expanding outward, killing the entire Jew ninja army.  The light fades and Jesus descends into his mother’s waiting arms.The three wise men stand upon a hill overlooking the scene of carnage.  One says to his companions, “Well, so much for peace on earth.”(Ending credit…)…don’t miss the exciting sequel… Samurai Mary vs. Joseph and the Zombie Horde","The biggest risk will be with the animator I finally choose to work on this project.  I've received quotes from several good animators, but finding the perfect person will be a challenge.  I want to make sure it is someone who can share in my passion to see it to fruition."

",The risks with doing this movie are the fact that the entire budget is three hundred dollars. Even for Independent Films this is an incredibly low budget. But I have been taught by many different people to work with a budget of incredibly small amounts.

They had no idea what was coming for them. Quietly, she slipped out the little knife she had always carried on her person since that fateful day and focused more on the pattern of the fishes’ movement. That was the way if one did not want to go hungry for a very long time.“You don’t have to look so tensed,” a voice called further from the bank where Alicia now stood. “It’s a simple task.”“Is it?” Alicia asked, turning back to look at the person sitting on a rock. It was not really a person, it was a fairy, complete with wings and a glistening appearance.“Of course. You just have to walk up there and stick the knife in one of them.l fishes. Simple.”“Would you like to try?” Alicia asked, offering the knife.The fairy shrunk back. It had a yellow, glittering hair that fell over its back and was considered female in this realm bridging the humans and the supernaturals.“Why? The knife looks heavy and I can’t...”“You can’t carry it, coach? I thought as much. Now keep your mouth shut if you want dinner.”The demonstration was carried out to perfection. The fairy shut her mouth and watched Alicia walk back to the river bank. She moved slowly and cautiously so as not to disturb the fishes. Once again, she studied the pattern. And struck!“Yes!”She watched the fat fish struggle for the water and felt pity for it. It reminded her of the people that were still skulking her son. The fish’s powerlessness mirrored her own weakness; a weakness so obvious that she had to leave her son with Master Ken, as that was his only shot at survival. The only other option was to keep running with him till they were caught by the dark side and destroyed.She was about throwing the fish back into the river—fat load of good that would do—but the grumbling in her stomach advised her against it. She moved over the place where she had built a fire and proceeded to prepare the fish. As she did, she observed her companion. The fairy was blowing shiny, glittering, tiny balloons into the air. It appeared all so magical. Alicia’s eyes grew round as saucers. Maybe she was not as entirely powerless as she had thought. Maybe there was a way she could help her baby and end this miserable standoff between the Kohr and the other clan’s of the 12 generation families.“Whizel,” she called the fairy.“Some name, don’t you think?” the fairy asked.“There’s a question I’ve been mulling over.”“I hope it doesn’t deal with giving you wings.”“Well,something similar. You know it’s been mentioned one or two times that the fairies have magic.”“Oh no, there it comes.”“Some even say the powers of the 12 generation clans came through the fairies from the gods.”“Well, I have no magic.”“Fairies. Something is not adding up.”“i don’t know. I think you’re burning the fish.”Alicia turned her attention back to the fish she was roasting. There had to be help somewhere, she thought. She could not just be alone. She needed help to distract the people she knew was after her son. Maybe if she did it well, he would become the powerful ruler they were rooting him to be and be able to defend himself as well as others. Yet she could not help thinking that she would always live with worry no matter how strong her son became.“Not bad for a member of an unknown clan under the 12 generation families,” Whizel said, nibbling at the roast fish.Alicia wondered how it would feel like to be that small. She had met the fairy drenched, soaked in water and unable to fly. She was struggling against the tide of a flowing stream. Alicia saw movement in the water and knew that sometjing was coming for the little being. At first, she was stunned; she had been sheltered in her own house in their clan that she felt people only looked like her—big muscular legs with black hairs all over their bodies, covering every inch. She had only heard about stories of thes fairies. In most of them, magic was mentioned, almost always something about the restoration of fairy magic and other stories contradicting them and insisting the little fellows had no magic. She was rooted to the spot until the fairy saw her and screamed. That was the push she needed to take her out of water and make a run to as far away from the river bank as possible. There was a loud roar behind her, a sound somewhere between the grating of iron and the torturous screams of demons in hell. Being from one of the lesser clans, she could run. That was what they were trained to do from birth. The Jader clan had control of the magic of others; the Saben were warriors that required little training to defeat even the most fearsome creature in the forest; the Isles could change into any beast of their choice; the Kohr could harness all the powers of dark magic and use them in doing what they want. Alicia’s clan? Well, her clan could run and hide, along with the fairies, the centaurs and other ones that were not even known.When she was sure she was out of reach of whatever monster it was that fed on fairies at the river bank, she opened her palm to make sure she still had the fairy. Sure enough, there she was, knocked out. She must have waved her arms quickly and wildly as she ran while the little girl was being tossed about in her palm. She nudged her with her index finger, one of the 6 on her hand.“Hello, hello.”When the fairies eyse opens, the sparkling golden hues in her pupils were the brightest she had ever seen. The fairy had been her companion from then on.It suddenly occurred to her that she had never asked what Whizel was doing at the river. A fairy ought to know that getting wet meant not being able to fly for sometime. A fairy would be doing nothing very close to a river.“What were you doing at the river that day?” Alicia asked.The question had been sprung from midair and shocked Whizel. She looked confused for a while before her face settled into thoughtfulness as if she was battling with herself whether she could say the truth or not. She sighed deeply and looked Alicia straight in the eyes.“I was a sacrifice,” she said.“What?”“Where you found me, I had been thrown into by my kind.”“Your kind did this to you? Damn.”“You have to understand that we’re powerless against all the other tribes. We do what we can to survive. Including sacrificing one of our own every year. A tradition.”“When did this start? This tradition.”“Long before I was born.”“That is insane.”“You don’t know the half of it. The chief fairy said it’s for Kohr.”“Kohr? The evil sibling?”“Yes.”“Why are fairies worshipping Kohr? I thought you guys were a jolly and sweet lot.”“Yeah, well, not everything is as it seems.”Alicia bit into the last remaining part of the fish and remained silent.“I suppose the people of Kohr will be after you and me now,” Whizel said, matter-of-factly. “My people too. They would rip you apart if they had the power to.”Alicia was taken aback with the ferocity with which she said ‘rip you apart’, but she soon recovered from the shock and drew the cloak of indifference over her face once again. It did not matter; she was looking for these people already who were rumoured to be after her son, the people that killed her husband according to Master Ken, with help from some lowlife insiders. Maybe it was better they came to her instead, since she had no idea how to begin her search.She heard the buzzing of tiny wings before she felt Whizel alight on her shoulder.“You’re not alone, you know? And you don’t have to regret helping me. We will fight together.”Fight, she thought. That was funny. The only thing remotely like a super power was her ability to use her legs in running away. She had no skills whatsoever and would easily be picked apart by any member of the Kohr clan with half a training.“We have to leave here,” she said finally, her face scrunched up and moody with thoughts.She stood up and cleared the fire place, but not enough as to not leave a trace. She wanted them to come after her.“What are you doing? Cover up our tracks,” Whizel whined.“No, let them see it and come after us.”“Bold. Do we er...do we have a plan to fight these guys? One that does not involve running?”Alicia did not reply. Her face was set as she headed off along the river, Whizel perched on her shoulder. She knew the journey ahead of her was not an easy one. In truth, she did not think she would come out of it alive.Chapter 2Footsteps ruffled through the wild, headed towards the river Alicia had just left. The match was purposeful, deliberate, not cautious at all. With time, a person’s face peeked over the vegetation. He disentangled himself from the vegetable and walked towards the fireplace. His nose dilated as he sniffed the air. Then he bent down close to the fireplace and sniffed the ground.He had the sturdy build of the men of the Saben Clan and strong, long arms that could move at lightning speed in combat. His upper body was bare, revealing well toned muscles on his chest and stomach, slightly covered with hair. His legs were muscular and strained at the fabric he wore. This Sabenian seemed to be at the top with the way he looked. This clan was made up of fighters who were renowned for their speed and strength and the ability to track people and things. They had no magic whatsoever but could move very fast, maybe even before the first magical command could be given to restrain them. Their main choice weapons of attack was speed and stealth. They employed the stealth whenever they were up against supernatural creatures or people that could wield magic.“She were here,” he grumbled to no one.He was about taking the direction that they had taken when he stopped suddenly, raised his nose in the air and sniffed hard.“Fairies?” He looked a little lost. Then he grunted. “Isles!”Quickly, he stepped back and blade wemt whirring past. Frightening roars rent the silent vicinity as two black bears tumbled towards him. He ran after them without any hesitation and dodged a blow from the first bear. The blow from the second bear slightly grazed the side of his face. He turned immediately behind the bear, only to discover that the bear had turned also. This time, when the bear hit him, it connected with his face and sent sprawling down the vegetation. He sprang up immediately, dazed. The Isles were too fast and that could only mean one thing: they were not just fighting as themselves. They had help. He heard the bear running him and stood waiting. As the beast burst through the vegetation, he stretched his fingers and they grew into claws. The beast was met by a barrage of cuts, half blinded by the vegetation, half blinded by speed. Another cut to the throat made the beast let out a whimper before it landed thunderously on the floor of the forest.The Sabenian walked out of the cover and discovered that the second Isle man was gone. He went back to the first. He had gone round the whole circle and become small again. It was just a teenager. As he struggled for life, blood escaped through his mouth and slit throat.“Raven Claw, you...you...have no idea...wha..what’s coming,” the boy managed to say.“What’s coming?” he asked the boy, panic taking the tiniest of seconds to slip through his mind and into his voice.The boy looked limp now, pale as the moon. The Isles had small tiny arms with long ears and a white, pale body bereft of any hair. They were renowned for the beasts they were able to take their form and strength and never for what they actually looked like. With big eyes and little mouths, they could have looked cute if only the big nose and pointed, long ears had not spoiled their appearance.“What’s coming?” Raven Claw screamed, shaking the young boy’s lifeless body. He was already dead.Raven stood up, eyes wide, brows burrowed in thought. How did the boy know his name? How did they know to find him here? He hoped they had not gone ahead of him to get the woman he was after. It would piss him off and he would make sure they pay. He went close to the teenager and put his nose close to sniff. The body quickly shrank, a happening that continued speedily till there was nothing left of the body at all. It was like the body had never been there. He touched the ground and shrank back quickly, yelping in pain.“Fuck!”He held his hurt finger close to his eyes. It was like he had touched a boiling pot of hot magma. Clearly, the Isles here were not alone. Whoever it was that was behind them did not want to be found out. He stood up and watched the ground glow red, pure red.“What the fuck is happening?” he asked.He did not have time to think of the answer because the ground started breaking up, moving in a line towards him. Quickly, without thinking, he turned and started running. Among the clan’s that were gifted with special abilities, the Saben Clan could run the fastest. Raven put this to test, swallowing up the ground in frightening leaps and bounds. The ground breaking behind him sped, moving as if it wanted to catch up with him. Trees behind him fell into the new opening of boiling hot magma, getting destroyed in seconds. At the bank of the river, a splash, caused by a rock falling into the hot magma visible in the splitting of the earth, fell on the calf of Raven’s right leg. His scream conscided with the splash his body made as he dived into the river. The pain boiled through his leg even inside the water. He knew what it was. As the river pushed him downstream, he struggled to get out his knife, clung on a rock in the river and cut off the part of the skin at his calf burning him. Almost immediately, he felt relief. The pain from his own cut was nothing compared to the pain from the magma.“You know, for someone from one of our little clans, you really can be moody,” Whizel commented. She was flapping her little wings so fast that Alicia could not even see them.“What do you care?” Alicia grumbled.“Where is the joy? Where’s the happiness that we spread to stay alive?”“It does not matter, little one. Nothing matters.”“See, dark, moody and always brooding.”“No matter how much you sing, when they come for you, they’ll get you.”That shocked the little fairy into silence. In a classic show of irony, Whizel’s face squeezed into a brooding frown. She thought hard about Alicia’s heartfelt declaration.“They’re not here now, are they?” the fairy finally asked. It was not a heartfelt retort. In fact she asked like she was locked in an argument with herself.“They will be,” Alicia replied with a certainty that further unnerved the little fairy.“Always moody,” the fairy complained.“Maybe it is better to be moody than to be mindlessly happy, eh? Have you thought about that?”Alicia still felt the pangs of sorrow and the heaviness of heart she had at abandoning her son. She could still remember the look in his eyes when she knelt before him and said what she was told to say: some men are coking, they will protect you, and some other nonsense. Master Ken had promised her the safety of her son and she believed him. There was honesty in his eyes as he made that promise. Perhaps in his eyes were the only place honesty still remained. His hands and the blade that was sheathed had obviously overseen the murder of many people. She wished she had the power to fight them off and fight off the terror that they were so afraid of. In times like this, her mind went back to her husband. She wanted to blame him for everything; for being who he was, for abandoning them, for dying.Suddenly she stopped. Her instincts were picking up something and it was not nice at all. Her clan depended on their instinct for survival in these parts and they had the sharpest there ever was. She took a deep breath and watched the fairy in front of her. Whizel had started talking again, thinking her companion was beside her. She wanted to call out to her to stop, but she was torn between staying silent so she could hear the sound she thought she had heard or calling back the chattering, little fairy.“Whizel, come back!” she screamed, her mind made up.The fairy, herself also dependant on the powers of instinct to not go extinct flew up inside of backwards or forwards. She was just in time to miss a bird that had materialized from thin air snapping her up into its beaks. Thundering footsteps announced unwanted presence. They materialised from thin air, monstrous creatures that were last seen before the war with the supernaturals. A centaur with three heads—one of a tiger, another of a snake and yet another of a centaur; a hideous experiment by people with magic. Alicia was frozen by the roar that stunned her. It seemed her journey had just been cut short at the very beginning.Chapter 3As Raven followed the trail towards Alicia, he felt something he had not felt for the first time. The people of his clan were known as warriors, always boiling for a fight. Even though Raven Claw felt he was of a calmer temperament, he still felt the excitement that came with jumping into danger. They were the clan that protected the descendants of the Jaden clan; it was their sworn assignment. As the Jaden clan were peaceful people, the Saben clan was made of fighters and warriors to protect them. Warriors who never felt what Raven was feeling now. His heart beat fast against his chest and ribs and rang so loud in his ears that he wanted to scream and let the pent up tension escape him. The Sabenians fought people, supernaturals, whatever, but they always were wary of magic. Dark magic was also something every clan of the 12 generations had great fear for, except the wielders, the Kohr clan. He was very sure what he had witnessed back at the river side was dark magic and he was not ready for it. But that was not his only fear. His greatest fear was that the clans were in shambles, enmity, because of the envy a lot of them felt against the Jaden clan. If the Kohr magicians were to strike now, they would be able to take whatever and whoever they want. It was easy to turn a house divided against itself. Some of the other clan’s might have their envy conquer their fear of dark magic and pitch their tents with the Kohr tribe.“Disaster,” he mouthed, looking ahead. His ears were standing, listening for any sign of life.He stopped quickly and stepped back. A sword slashed across his face, narrowly missing him. He whispered a silent prayer for the Saben instinct that seemed to be the only thing still keeping him alive out here. All around him, humans appeared. He counted silently. There were ten of them and each was armed with a sword and a shield.“Earthlings,” he muttered like it was some filthy words. These lot were known to be lazy. It had already been established among the clans that the humans used only a little part of their brains and were basically weak opponents. So why would the Kohr send them? He thought.The fighters did not wait for him to get the answer to this before they lashed out at him. He slipped out of the way, smiling at the clang sound their swords made as they hit together. The humans had no chance against him unless...unless they were sent to slow him down.“Dammit!” he exclaimed and continued running towards Alicia, leaving the humans in his wake, humphing and cursing.He had to be disciplined in his quest to serve the Saben clan since he was not doing it for any selfish reason. The faster he ran, the more he realised that Alicia had gone further. If he had wasted time fighting those humans, he would have been set back a lot more. He doubled his pace.The Sun was hanging directing above his head when he heard the sound. It was the sound of a hunting pack herding their prey into a net of their making, roaring and screaming in turns. He took a leap straight into the sky, going almost 40 feet high.Alicia was panting now. She had been running for the past one hour or so it seemed and yet she had not been able to outrun the predators running after her. She was moving back slowly against what seemed to be a dead-end. A rocky outcropping shaped like a horse shoe. She had not realised there was no way at the end because of the trees blocking her views. Now, caved in from the mouth of the horse shoe, she watched the three hideous creatures approaching. The one that scared her most looked like the mixture of a smoke and a human. It could not seem to maintain a definite shape. Alicia wished she had followed her late husband to learn the way of the 12 generation clan’s instead of hiding away with their son. Maybe she would have known how to fight these creatures that so terrified her now. Maybe her son would not be treated like an invalid and a royalty at the same time. Maybe he would even be here, protecting her.She looked around and quickly grabbed a big stick lying nearby. She was not going out like a meek lamb, she decided. The creatures paused their advance. They looked like they were grinning, obviously excited at a fight of resistance from their potential victim.“If you come any closer, I will kill you all. By the gods, I will!”A stupid bluff, they kept coming closer anyway. Still she stood looking at them. She had backed all the way to the wall. If there was a way she could have entered the wall, she would have.As the three monsters lurched towards her, a shadow fell to the earth with a thunderous thud, stopping the monsters in their tracks. When the dust cleared, she saw a Sabenian kneeling between her and her predators. In an ironic turn of event, she thought she saw fear in all of the faces of the three-headed centaur. It was clear they had not been expecting company. He turned towards her, and she felt the intensity of his stare pinning her to the wall.“Stay behind me,” he said before he turned towards her assailants. “How do you want to die?” he asked, his voice even, a smile playing around his lips.Chapter 4The three attackers moved in unison, but as they were about to close in on Raven, the shadow stood back. The three-headed centaur moved in? He was fast but Raven was expecting him to be, having dealt with the two bears back at the river Bank. He quickly moved out of the way narrowly missing being clawed by nails at least 6 inches tall. As he moved, he unsheathed his sword and in the same breath, ran it through the first head it came in contact with. When the centaur paused, it discovered that the lion had no head and blood was spurting from the wound. The creature looked confused as if it had not expected something like that to happen. Raven was now in the middle of the three and was alert. The last monster appeared to be a creature torn between being a big rat and a man. Raven made for it, confident of dealing with it. But he discovered the creature was missing when he got to it. One moment it was there, the next, it was not.As Raven frantically looked about for the rat man, he let his guard down, giving room for the shadow to get close to him. There was a squealing sound before the shadow went into him and plunged out of him. His eyes became faint and he stumbled about for balance. The images before him were hazy; the rate of his heartbeat slowed down and he felt his heart freezing up. He knew what this was—the heart of ice; he had been warned about it, but he did not know the Kohr magicians had the power to gift it to one of their hideous creatures. He had been taught that it required a Kohr magician slipping his or her hand into one’s chest to leave him with such a condition. Once again, he had underestimated these creatures and he feared he would be paying with his life. He slumped to the ground, on his knees, still struggling to maintain control on the limbs in his body. He heard the roar of the centaur; it seemed the lion head had grown again. Everything was too blurry, he could not really be sure. He was glad he had the attention of the three monsters. He hoped Alicia would use the opportunity to run away. But even as he tried to fill himself with hope against the vision the plaques him every night, he realised how futile it was.“Stay back!”He heard it clearly. It was the mad Saitan he was trying to save. The Saitan clan was not known for foolhardiness. They were known to run when the need arose, and that was almost everytime. What was wrong with her! He thought. She was behind him now. He collapsed against her before he noticed she had some shining object in her hand. He could not see clearly, but none of the monsters were moving on her.“Stay back or by the gods I’ll blast you all to smittereens! Stay back!”Those were the last words he heard before the faintness washed over him and dragged him under.Raven Claw did not know how long he stayed under. He woke up and kept his eyes shut, another training that had become a part of him. He did not move a muscle, but instead strained for sounds about the place with his ears. Silence replied him before he heard the breathing of a woman. It was a familiar breathing and he recognised it immediately. Alicia. He listened more, stretching the capacity of his listening ability, searching out the area. There was no other person or creature there. He felt something heavy on his chest and opened his eyes. They were inside a cave and it was a bit dark but he could make out Alicia by the opening that she had painstakingly closed with a Boulder.his hand went to his chest and met a cold pendant. He stood up and held it in his hand. Memories of last night nudged at the fringes of his mind.“What are you doing?” he asked.Alicia started and turned towards him. Her eyes held surprise.“I wasn’t sure it was going to work,” she mumbled.“What?”“You’re alive,” she said, walking up to him.She started feeling his body as if she had expected some part of it to disappear the longer he lay unconscious.“What are you doing?”Her hands were running all over her body till they got his waist. He held them.“Sorry,” she breathed, blushing uncomfortably. “I didn’t...i wasn’t...You’re alive.”She turned away from him and walked back to look through the opening partly covered by the boulder. Raven wondered how she did it. Satan’s were not exactly known for their strength. Maybe there was something different, almost special about this one.“This is yours,” he said, holding out the pendant.She turned, stared at him for a while and quickly grabbed the pendant. Her gaze lingered on his face for a few, uncomfortable seconds.“What are you doing?” he asked again.“Nothing, ” She said, walking away, to the boulder again. She seemed restless and frightened.“You really are Alicia, mother to the heir of the Unity throne,” he observed.“How did you know? Who are you?” she asked heartedly. Suspicion transformed her beautiful face into something ugly.“You have a pendant of power. I recognised it. The last time it was seen was by a baby, that baby later became king.”“Who are you?” Alicia asked.“Raven of the house, Claw, from the Saben clan, sworn to serving the Jadens. I’ve been looking for you, Alicia.”“Did Ken send you?”“No. I came on my own. I’ve been seeing you in my dreams and well, a whole lot of other things. Terrible things. You and I have a chance to stop these things.”and here our video that shows the beginning of the game mind you it will be altered with more detail we also have some custom maps that are part of the game that you will see below let me know what you think of the story so far and I hope you enjoy even if the kickstarter does not reaches goal the game will still be released the kickstarter will just allow use to add more details to the game like Possible voice acting more maps and animated character sprites.Here are some screenshots of some of the developers I'm using to help make the game for the character sprites and character sprite animation and map developing they're all very talentedAnd in case you're all curious here are some manga pages from my volume the volume itself is only released in written form on Amazon Kindle but I am working on the manga part of the story as we're speaking right now hope you enjoy my little manga preview I'm very proud of it",The challenge would be to get the game properly promoted for all potentially interested in it and the risks are really none even if we don't reach our goal I can still have the game launched regardless the campaign is simply to add more detail to the game,https://www.kickstarter.com/projects/ambi-pass/sleeping-dragon-king-chronicles?ref=discovery_category_newest,ambi-pass/sleeping-dragon-king-chronicles,"Read the written part of the novel for free Untilthe end date of Wednesday, September 9, 2020, 12:00 AM PDT Sunday, September 13, 2020, 11:59 PM PDTLink to the written part of the novelhttps://www.amazon.com/dp/B089Y4QKPGAudiobook ChaptersA Sleeping Dragon King Chronicles– A Manga about Self-Discovery and TriumphTagline Ryuga never fit anywhere, and never felt very powerful. That's about to change.Pitch Struggles Encountered An orphan, Ryuga has grown up assuming that no matter what he does, the memories of all his past pains are going to come back to haunt him. He expects nothing but torment from the world, and his loneliness follows him everywhere he goes. Most horrifically, he begins dreaming about his mother, seeing visions in his mind of her untimely death. These visions are torture for the boy, and it seems that nothing will free him from them. All he wants to do is rest, to feel that he belongs somewhere, to understand his place in the world. Gifts Uncovered Ryuga , as he is about to find out, is no ordinary boy, though. In fact, he is extraordinary – a boy who can wield an immense power, controlling creatures far stronger than any other person. This is a unique gift, but at first, he doesn't understand it. For anyone who has ever recognized their own talents but struggled to figure out how to make the most of them, this manga will resonate in a real way, inspiring the reader to look ever deeper within himself or herself and to accept the responsibility that comes with our gifts and talents. Ryuga , fortunately, finds someone to guide him. The Self – Mastered Transported to a strange world, Ryuga studies under a sensei, who trains him to understand and control his own power. This too is a part of the manga that will connect with people on a deep level, encouraging them to seek out opportunities to learn. In Sleeping Dragon King Chronicles, Ryuga must overcome a wide range of difficulties before he can take full advantage of everything that his sensei has to offer him. Learning to communicate, to clean, and to look after himself, Ryuga is a lost child – but a lost child whose value is undeniable to the sensei and anyone else who understands what it signifies. This is a captivating story that will stick with you – and perhaps even motivate you to recognize and cherish everything that makes you unique.

https://www.kickstarter.com/projects/bartereaser/bartereaser-a-social-network-for-direct-trading-0?ref=discovery_category_newest,bartereaser/bartereaser-a-social-network-for-direct-trading-0,"BarterEaser will be a social network which makes it as simple and straightforward as possible to negotiate and trade skills and items directly with your neighbors, without the need for money!For starters, BarterEaser will be fully profile based, so as to allow users to build their reputation within their communities over time. There will be noanonymous transactions. Profiles will be composed of a few generic things such as an ""about you"" section and a picture, but the important part of each profile will be in the ""skills and inventory"" section that defines what one is offering and requesting from others. Users will have the ability create and list skills and items they have that they'd be willing to trade with others, alongside an optional and self-defined ""barterbuck"" value which they associate with that skill (so as to ease the approximation of equal value negotiation). So if, for example, you're a hair stylist, you might list haircuts for a value of 12 barterbucks, or if you're a chiropractor, chiropractic sessions for a value of 60barterbucks, or a gardener might list professional landscaping for a value of 17 barterbucks/hr. One option people might consider if they don't want to list specific skills, would be just to list “general labor” for 10 barterbucks/hr, as in: ""I'd be willing to help you with whatever project you need help with, for this approximate trade value."" A random example of how this might play out, could be someone spending 20 hours to help someone else build a shed, for which they receive a used laptop.I wish to emphasize that barterbucks will be arbitrarily defined and have no real value. Their purpose will be solely to provide a relative guideline with which to ease negotiation. It will not be possible to accumulate them as a digital item. Further, no real money will be officially traded on this platform.Having provided a few examples regarding the ""skills"" section, I will now provide some examples of how one might list items in the ""inventory"" section: I might list an old crossbow that I have at a 100 barterbuck value. I might individually list an entire collection of old video games, or used books in my profile. Many people might list food asan item to trade; maybe you make exquisite salsaor guacamole orhummus or jam; you can list all those as items that you're willing tobarter with people. If you know how to cook, it might be very easy to create food of a higher trade value than the value of the ingredients, and trade people meals for their personal services or items! This will provide a great opportunity for artists to trade their artwork as well. The potential opportunities here are only limited by individual skills and imagination!Additionally, we will incorporate a self-defined e-coin system, so asto allow users to provide promissory future value to one another. For example: Let's say there is a user whose two primary items are haircuts (15 barterbuck value) and strawberry cheesecakes (10 barterbuck value). We'll call her Jessica. Jessica might choose to define a ""JessCoin"" for her profile, which she can trade to other users, which she lists as having a value of 1/2 of a cheesecake, or 1/3rd of a haircut (5 barterbucks). This allows her to trade her value in the future rather than relying on immediate transactions. Let's say Jessica wants a refurbished bicycle, and a user ""John"" deals in refurbishing bicycles. John lists a decent refurbished bicycle at a barterbuck value of 100, and Jessica initiates a negotiation with John to trade for that bicycle. After a some discussion, John agrees to give her the bicycle for one immediatehaircut, 2 cheesecakes, and 15 ""JessCoins,"" which he will redeem over the course of the year for additional haircuts or cheesecake. Each time a coin is redeemed, there will be an opportunity torate the quality and honesty of the transaction. If Jessica doesn't uphold her promise of the value of the coins, John will be able to rate her as dishonest, and leave a review, which will let others know that she did not uphold her promised transaction. These coins will be socially policed, so make sure you only work with people you trust! We will ban users who attempt to lie and cheat, of course, but discernment will be encouraged, especially in the early stages of the site. As users gain higher ratings over time, however, their community reputation will speak for them, and their accountability and reliability will increase the value of their potential trades.Another example of potential coin usage may be for farmers who wish to trade for items outside of their harvest season. Say you own a blueberry farm, and you define a ""blueberryCoin"" which is tradable for 1/2 lb of blueberries during harvest season. This would allow you to trade for items and skills among blueberry enthusiasts (such as myself) outside of season, and then have that value redeemed later in the year.Moving on: beyond the listed ""skills and inventory"" sections, there will be a (probably invisible) ""wanted"" section, wherein users will list everything that they desire from others. Perhaps you simply want to trade for food, maybe you want a new guitar, maybe you need a monitor, maybe you're the aforementioned John, and you want to collect old bike frames and tires to help you refurbish bikes. The sky's the limit! You place whatever you want inthis desired items section, so the website will be able to more easily populate lists of local people who are offering things that you desire and/or requesting things that you offer, at which point, you can initiate a negotiation with them, speak with them through a built in chat function, and eventually send a finalized transaction request which lists what you've agreed to trade with each other. Then, you go and you meet up and trade, and subsequently rate each other (and leave an optional comment) based on your honesty, lending to your community reputation!Part of the beauty of this is that we will get 100% of what we trade for. No taxation or corporate profits holding us back! The reason bartering had to be replaced by money in the first place, was that society was too complex in comparison to our communication opportunities, for people to simply negotiate for everything that they needed. However, in the present time, with online communication, it is now fully possible for us to easily see what everybody in our local community has to offer and instantly negotiate with them! It is my goal to make this process as efficient and simple as possible, and give all people the opportunity to represent their own value in this way! People don't always have money, but we always have our own skills and time, and for some people it might be a lot easier to make trade deals with others in their community and work one job, than to, say, work multiple jobs to support their family.Imagine, if you will, that this was the most popular social network in the world, and that most of the time people went online, they went online with the intent to look into mutually beneficial transactions with their neighbors. Would that not be a wonderfully productive reason to socially network?It is my intent to get this functional ASAP so that I can hopefully help to mitigate the damage from the economic fallout from Covid-19 (and other global financial struggles), byhelping people to work together outside of the limitations of money to support themselves and one another. If I can get the last bit of funding here, I should be able to get it running very quickly! I have a team coding it, and they are mostly finished, but some of my original funding fell through, so I need a bit of community support in able to finish the job! I really hope that people will see the potential here and want to use the product enough to contribute to getting it off the ground! If only 1,200 people are willing to contribute $10, this project might very well change the way that our global economy functions for the rest of time!I would sincerely appreciate if you would share this and help me get people to think aboutit! And let me know if you have any questions! This is a project that I believe has the potential to help everyone in the world! From a rural farmer patching up another farmer's roof to borrow his tractor, to an inner city grandma trading babysitting for baked goods, anybody with the motivation should have the opportunity to more easily support their livelihood with this platform! Thank you for taking the time to read this, and I sincerely look forward to bringing it to fruition with your help!","One risk is that there may be too much demand, and I will have to quickly upgrade servers to support millions of users, but only time will tell!",https://www.kickstarter.com/projects/bartereaser/bartereaser-a-social-network-for-easy-trading?ref=discovery_category_newest,bartereaser/bartereaser-a-social-network-for-easy-trading,"BarterEaser is my dream for a social network which will make it as simple and straightforward as possible to negotiateand trade skills and items directly with your neighbors, without theneed for money!Simply put, BarterEaser will allow users to list skills and items which they are interested in trading with others, and then search around to find local people who have skills and goods they might be interested in directly exchanging. It's a rather simple idea, but I believe it has the potential to deeply empower people and connect communities, and there is currently nothing like it in the world!For starters, BarterEaser will be fully profile based, so as to allow users to build their reputation within their communities over time through a public rating system, similar to Ebay, when transactions are agreed to.

Further, no real money will be officially traded on this platform (though I do hope to eventually incorporate cryptocurrencies, but that will not be a part of the initial build).Having provided a few examples regarding the ""skills"" section, I willnow provide some examples of how one might list items in the""inventory"" section: I might list an old crossbow that I have at a 100 barterbuck value. I might individually list an entire collection of old video games, or used books in my profile. Many people might list food asan item to trade; maybe you make exquisite salsaor guacamoleorhummus or jam; you can list all those as items that you're willingtobarter with people. If you know how to cook, it might be very easy to create food of a higher trade value than the value of the ingredients, and trade people several home-cooked meals for their personal services or items! This will provide a great opportunity for artists to trade their artwork as well. The potential opportunities here are only limited by individual skills and imagination!Additionally, we will incorporate a self-defined e-coin system, so asto allow users to provide promissory future value to one another. For example: Let's say there is a user whose two primary items are haircuts (15 barterbuck value) and strawberry cheesecakes (10 barterbuck value). We'll call her Jessica. Jessica might choose to define a ""JessCoin"" for her profile, which she can trade to other users, which she lists as having a value of 1/2 of a cheesecake, or 1/3rd of a haircut (5 barterbucks). This allows her to trade her value in the future rather than relying on immediate transactions. Let's say Jessica wants a refurbished bicycle, and a user ""John"" deals in refurbishing bicycles. John lists a decent refurbished bicycle at a barterbuck value of 100, and Jessica initiates a negotiation with John to trade for that bicycle. After a some discussion, John agrees to give her the bicycle for one immediatehaircut, 2 cheesecakes, and 15 ""JessCoins,"" which he will redeem over the course of the year for additional haircuts or cheesecakes. Each time a coin is redeemed, there will be an opportunity torate the quality and honesty of thetransaction. If Jessica doesn't uphold her promise of the value of the coins, John will be able to rate her as dishonest, and leave a review, which will let others know that she did not uphold her promised transaction. These coins will be socially policed, so make sure you only work with people you trust! We will ban users who attempt to lie and cheat, of course, but discernment will be encouraged, especially in the early stages of the site. As users gain higher ratings over time, however, their community reputation will speak for them, and theiraccountability and reliability will increase the value of their potential trades.Another example of potential coin usage may be for farmers who wishto trade for items outside of their harvest season. Say you own a blueberry farm, and you define a ""blueberryCoin"" which is tradable for1/2 lb of blueberries during harvest season. This would allow you to trade for items and skills among blueberry enthusiasts (such as myself)outside of season, and then have that value redeemed later in the year.Moving on: beyond the listed ""skills and inventory"" sections, there will be a (probably invisible) ""wanted"" section, wherein users will list everything that they desire from others. Perhaps you simply want to trade for food, maybe you want a new guitar, maybe you need a monitor, maybe you're the aforementioned John, and you want to collect old bike frames and tires to help you refurbish bikes. The sky's the limit! You place whatever you want inthis desired items section, so the website will be able to more easily populate lists of local people who are offering things that you desire and/or requesting things that you offer, at which point, you can initiate a negotiation with them, speak with them through a built in chat function, and eventually send a finalized transaction request which lists what you've agreed to trade with each other. Then, you go and you meet up and trade, and subsequently rate each other (and leave an optional comment) based on your honesty, lending to your community reputation!Part of the beauty of this is that we will get 100% of what we trade for. No taxation or corporate profits holding us back! The reason bartering had to be replaced by money in the first place, was that society was too complex in comparison to our communication opportunities, for people to simply negotiate for everything that they needed. However, in the present time, with online communication, it is now fully possible for us to easily see what everybody in our local community has to offer and instantly negotiate with them! It is my goal to make this process as efficient and simple as possible, and give all people the opportunity to represent their own value in this way! People don't always have money, but we always have our own skills and time, and for some people it might be a lot easier to make trade deals with others in their community and work one job, than to, say, work multiple jobs to support their family.Imagine, if you will, that this was the most popular social network in the world, and that most of the time people went online, they went online with the intent to look into mutually beneficial transactions with their neighbors. Would that not be a wonderfully productive reason to socially network?It is my intent to get this functional ASAP so that I can hopefully help to mitigate the damage from the economic fallout from Covid-19 (and other global financial struggles), byhelping people to work together outside of the limitations of money to support themselves and one another. If I can get the last bit of funding here, I should be able to get it running very quickly! I have a team coding it, and they are mostly finished, but some of my original funding fell through, so I need a bit of community support in able to finish the job! I really hopethat people will see the potential here and want to use the product enough to contribute to getting it off the ground! If only 1,200 people arewilling to contribute $10, this project might very well change the way that our global economy functions for the rest of time!I would sincerely appreciate if you would share this and help me get people to think aboutit! And let me know if you have any questions! This is a project that I believe has the potential to help everyone in the world! From a rural farmer patching up another farmer's roof to borrow his tractor, to an inner city grandma trading babysitting for baked goods, anybody with the motivation should have the opportunity to more easily support their livelihood with this platform! Thank you for taking the time to read this, and I sincerely look forward to bringing this website tofruition with your help!","It is a very straightforward and simple design, so there is very little that I foresee as risky in this project."

This software will be made freely available on the web so that farmers, ranchers and other do-it-yourselfers will have a resource to turn to when designing site built trusses. Currently many such building projects do not have the engineering behind them and as a result site built trusses are often built with a ""wing"" it attitude. I am hoping that I can provide a resource to others so that the engineering of these types of trusses can be more accessible to the general public at little or no cost.Please take a look at the original truss calculator located here:http://design.medeek.com/calculator/calculator.plWith your support I will be able to continue further with the development of this software and expand and evolve it into something that has real utility. Thank-you for your consideration and support.Sincerely,Nathaniel P. Wilkerson, PE",The items that will be the biggest challenge and are in need of the most attention are:- General matrix solver that can handle any truss and load configuration.- Addition of wind and snow load cases.- PDF output of results including nailing templates and cut sheets.- Wood Gusset Plate design and engineering for site built trusses.Previous updates and features are here:http://design.medeek.com/calculator/changelog.html,https://www.kickstarter.com/projects/128644708/medeek-truss-plugin?ref=discovery_category_newest,128644708/medeek-truss-plugin,"The Medeek Truss Plugin is a SketchUp Plugin that provides a simple interface for creating accurate 3D truss geometry within SketchUp. This plugin utilizes the SketchUp Ruby API programming interface and is compatible with the latest SketchUp releases (SketchUp Make 2016 64-bit and SketchUp Pro 2016 64-bit) as well as previous versions (2013, 2014, 2015).Currently, the plugin allows the creation of the following common truss types (Metric and US/Imperial):Specialty Truss Types:Floor Joists/Trusses:Truss Sets:Rafter Roofs (Metric and US/Imperial):Engineering (US/Imperial):The Truss Plugin is integrated with the Medeek Truss Designer and can provide engineering data (loads, internal forces, reactions and deflections) for specific common truss types (ie. King Post, Queen Post, Fink, Howe and Double Fink). The plugin is also recently integrated with the Medeek Beam Calculator and can automatically load the design parameters from SketchUp in order to check bending, shear, bearing and deflection for typical North American glulam beam sizes. Engineering for other truss types as well as rafters, joists and sheathing is in the process of being added and will become available in future releases. For additional engineering tools and site criteria maps please visit our Resources page.The Medeek Truss Plugin is a proprietary softare developed for use with the SketchUp 3D modeling program. There are currently no limits to its use for both personal and commercial applications.The current version of the Medeek Truss Plugin is 1.2.7 (Jan. 26, 2016).View the Medeek Truss Plugin Changlog for more information on updates to this plugin.For a more in depth look at the development of the plugin and related discussions please visit the Medeek Forum.The following video tutorials are currently available on YouTube:This plugin is intended for architects, engineers, designers and homeowners who are using SketchUp as their primary 3D design tool.","The time and energy required to program all of the options and truss types is somewhat monumental however over the course of about 6-8 months a full fledged product will be the result.I have spent the equivalent of approx. 3-4 full weeks of programming thus far and have managed to make quite a dent, however I have only scratched the surface on what can be achieved with this plugin.I am a licensed professional engineer in the State of Washington and combining my engineering experience with my love of programming I feel that I have the right mix of skills to make this SketchUp plugin a serious design tool."

Uno de los motivos principales de crear este vídeo es porque tengo una gran necesidad  de expresar mis sentimientos a la humanidad,  no sé por qué o sí!!! Obviamente hay algo mundo que no funciona bien. Me siento muy triste cuando veo la pobreza en las calles  y en todo el mundo, yo pensando cómo podría ser el mejor modo de ayudar pueblan, pienso en cómo sería la mejor manera de ayudar a la gente, porque ahora puedo ayudar de una forma pequeña porque mis ingresos son pequeños pero me gustaría ayudar a la gente que realmente  lo necesita de un modo más grande, como por ejemplo los niños que mueren porque  no tienen nada para comer, y este tipo de problemas similares, aún recuerdo ese día de mi inmadurez cuando me di cuenta  realmente cómo funciona el mundo, recibí un fuerte impacto  y me acuerdo de estar en shock  durante un período largo de tiempo, esto no es una broma, lamentablemente. También quiero una mejor vida para mí y mi familia,  la vida que yo no he tenido, estoy trabajando muy duro estos últimos años, ya que madure un poco, sobre todo estos dos últimos y sobre todo, sobre todo, todo este año pasado. No quiero y no debo parar hasta conseguir este vídeo   he conocido a gente en el camino que me dicen que  van a ayudarme y realmente parece que  van a ayudar, pero no, ellos me defraudan, qué puedo hacer?? Solamente sufro un poquito y acepto la situación, entonces... lo que busco ahora es anunciarme profesionalmente para ser capaz de tener mejores sitios para el trabajar y mejor sueldo, incluso trabajar  para famosos o ser  famosa, en un futuro hacer videos musicales, películas… esto es de mis sueños y ayudar  lol Quiero usar mis sueños mientras duermo y el baile para crear, despertar conciencias y cosas inimaginables,  creatividad pura, conexión. Todos  somos responsables, bueno... Aquí voy!!! En mi primer vídeo quiero transmitir el misterio del universo desde mi experiencia, el poder del inconsciente, el despertar de la conciencia, el poder político y sociocultural, la historia, la gente legendaria, la humanidad, etc. … con la sensualidad, la seducción y el poder femenino en este caso, también las imágenes son relacionadas con la letra de la canción, he escogido una nueva mezcla de house music de mi motivación principal Beyonce el Knowles-golpe. Tengo que crear las imágenes porque no puedo copiar o usar las fotos que he tomado como el ejemplo, hay muchas imágenes que tienen que ser creadas como el fondo del vídeo todas las imágenes aparecen en mis sueños mientras duermo, y mi creatividad cuando estoy despierta, una mezcla de imágenes y efectos, 3D, paisajes futuristas, baile, rnb y la música de casa ... la duración de vídeo es  de cinco minutos esto es uno de los motivos por qué he aumentado el presupuesto, el fondo del video será más largo, más horas de grabación ... más horas todo. A esta añadir mis habilidades como un bailarina profesional y coreógrafa durante quince años, una coreografía de sexy style con tacones, la única y principal bailarina soy yo, algunos momentos multiplicada por tres, bailando y actuando con trajes diferentes, peinado, etc.. . Los robots representan a la humanidad, desde mi punto de vista se parece a esto, como el gobierno nos trata, como robots y tenemos corazones, estoy segura que hay algo más detrás de todo esto, sólo algunos  pocos están conscientes de esto. Quiero que todo el look del video parezca  futurista porque nosotros creamos el futuro y ahora la tecnología es cada vez más fuerte. El ojo que todo lo ve?  En especial el tercer ojo, dónde creo que todos mis sueños, información e intuiciones ahí se desarrollan, la mente? el tercer ojo? La glándula pineal? ¡Quién sabe! La única cosa que se es que para mí , mis sueños son reales y funcionan, siento que tengo una misión. La lava rosada que rodea la plataforma en uno de los escenarios y la otra plataforma blanca es dónde  partes de la coreografía es realizada, representa el fuego, la sensualidad, el  poder sexual!!! He dejado una pequeña demostración del ensayo, también las imágenes del  fondo, me gustaría mejorar los trajes hechos por mí, tres trajes para ser exactos, la razón principal de porque tiene plumas blancas alrededor del cuello el vestuario principal es porque las plumas blancas serán difundidas con mi cara hasta que se convierta  en la cabeza del águila imperial, esto  representa "" una crítica política "" ya que este águila se encuentra en el escudo nacional de los Estados Unidos de America,  también representa en este caso que la mujer es una reina una queen, este águila tiene mucho poder. Bueno ya podeis imaginar y darle un poco de forma a cómo sería mi video. Espere que os haya gustado!!!

The pace of life, time management and so on are the reasons why people prefer to visit restaurants outside the home or order food at home, which is much simpler and more efficient than cooking at home. Even during the period of economic crisis the population can not dare to refuse thisfamiliartype of food consumption.But the actual food market makes us follow common stereotypes such as growing tendency of the prices, a long waiting time, ’outside food is not healthy’, etc. That is why we decided to make something new. Which will help any body to be able to eat outside home, but cheap, experiencing a good and fast service, and break the stereotypes like ‘is unhealthy’ or ‘fast food can’t be high-quality’.The burger restauantsare very popular and have a huge success in the current Spanish market. Simple, fast and satisfying food service with cheap prices call the attention of many consumers. In Pushka the burger will no longer be just ""an American dish"", but delicious bread with good meat and a variety of fresh vegetables, side dishes and sauces.The second are the sushi bars. The segment of sushi bars, is one of the most growing in recent years, thanks to the huge demand for Asian food in general. Asian food does not bother and keeps the consumer, it is very comfortable to provide the most important delivery service and it is perfect for eaters of healthy and vegan food as in pushka there will be a lot of courses for everybody . As in Spain sushi is now a thing that is mostly eaten in luxury restaurants with high prices, we provide this desired product to anyone, making it tend to the fast food market, in spite of the economic status of anybody.And the third type is the pizzeria. Pizza is a dish with worldwide success and a huge market. Among all pizzerias in Spain there is no one that is an indisputable leader, which makes it clear that the pizza market is open for new players. AsThen we would have a problem: what type of establishment could be founded to be successful and be able to compete with companies already established in the Market? It must be borne in mind that each type of food attracts a different target audience, thus limiting itself to a specific number of people interested in just one type of food. With this limitation we cut many people who wish to visit the establishment in a group whose members have different food preferences. In addition, the dishes sometimes start to bother and the person wants to change a little, so he decides to change places where he preferred to eat before, chagethe familiar atmosphere to another just because of the food.:So, Iasked myself ""Why choose?"", ""Why limit ourselves?"" Which brings us to the innovative concept of fast food restaurant.It consists in founding a fast food restaurant with 3 different types of cuisines, but strongly linked, under the name of the company ""PUSHKA Group"".Choosing the 3 most famous types of fast food and grouping them into a single establishment is a perfect solution to meet the needs of consumers and compete with many existing companies, and make a perfect atmosphere where a lot of people of different food habits can meet up.Despite defining this target audiences for our restaurant, we are always welcome to everybody and our menu will be modifying according to the feedback will be getting.This is our elegant, stylish and carefully designed menu, since it influences the image of the establishment that is transmitted to the client. The menu is developed taking into account the acceptance by our clients, the ease and speed of preparation, the preferences of local tastes and the quality of ingredients.Themenu is attractive but, at the same time, manageable and easy to read. It consists of 5 basic sections, which allow to adapt to different types of public. The products that are marketed in the establishment are divided into:Drinks: mineral waters, soft drinks, beer, juice, coffee;Main dishes: burguers, sushi, pizzas like;and Starters: salads, wings, chips, cheese balls, etc.The most important thing is that the hamburger`s must be tasty, not too greasy but at the same time capable of making the burger sufficiently juicy. With the fulfillment of these norms, and its intelligent combination with fresh vegetables, crispy bacon and high quality cheese, any client will never be indifferent with our restaurant. We will also do what very few people do, we will produce our own bread, which forms the flavor of the burger and will be the best accompaniment to the meat. Our pricing policy will be very simple: why looking the prices? The same econimicprice for ALL the burgers. Do not think about the price! Just choose the one you like.As you can observe, we have elaborated a perfect way of telling people the ingredients that the dish is consisted of. It simple to read and designed so that the costumer does not spend much unnecessary time reading it.One of our useful features is that there is no more need in washing your hands. Neither now nor after enjoying our juicy burgers, soft pizza or crispy wings. We introduce something very useful and what a lot of people will love. Gloves. They are totally black, which goes well with the design of the establishment, totally without latex or dust, so without the possibility of causing any type of allergies. The gloves will be given to customers into a bag and accompanied by an informative piece of paper, which explainsthe compositionof the gloves so that any customer is not afraid of allergies.As we have already said, the sushi service is accelerating and has a very successful future. The main objective of this Japanese dish is to tend to maximum simplicity and be able to be consumed with just one bite. This fact makes its preparation such an easy work, using foods of better relation price&quality.These sushi, which we call ""hot"", is one thing that NO ONE offers now in the Spanish market, but we are sure that they will have a lot of demand since it is something innovative and can be consumed as a complete meal. The ingredients are simple and inexpensive, which makes the product even more reachable for a normal consumer, but keeping the high quality products.We also will provide sushi kits which will include Chopsticks, ginger, wasabi, soy sauce some napkins in order to simplify to maximum the serving for the consumer so that he/she does not waste time on unnecessary things and go directly to the consumption process.Pizza has always been successful in the food market. Why is it like this? It is very practical to eat it, is delicious, it does not need any unnecessary cutlery (and also you’ll get our gloves) and it fills up pretty quickly. Perfect to be fast food. Although initially invented in Italy, now it is an international dish enjoyed worldwide.We are going to invent new tastes, features,, avoiding copying others, as is it usual today, but using basic, famous and interchangeable ingredients, so that the consumers enjoy the most and there are no unnecessary waste.Our immediate objective is to create an innovative fast food restaurant that has no alternatives in the market, that is, foods for which both its preparation and consumption are characterized by simplicity and speed.The place will have an image such that the client feels attracted and goes inside. Enjoys the atmosphere. It is about the decoration, the cleanliness of the establishment, the comfort of the furniture, the joy of time spent, the time of the preparation of the dishes, the ownership of a place in which the client seeks a moment of rest in its daily routine. The way to serve the products to the clientele is very important, therefore all the dishes are served in beautiful round trays and with nitrile gloves so that the client does not have to bother to clean their hands in any moment. Everybody of our stuff will be following fixed scripts to provide the best service to our guests.Starting with the most important part of any restaurant, I want to introduce the innovative cuisine we have invented. It consists of dividing the cooking zone in 2 general parts: the open part and the back kitchen. The back kitchen is dedicated to preparing elements of dishes that are simply conservable and allow ""build"" the final dish in a minimum time. (items such as bread burgers, pizza ingredients, cutting vegetables, etc.). Then they go to the open part. This part is divided into three sections that make the preparation of the order very fast and efficient: the hamburger preparation section, the sushi section and the pizza section. Here, with the elements already prepared, the final process of preparation of the order is carried out in order to be delivered to the client.This transparent kitchen makes a simple preparation of food become a wonderful show of creation delicious dishes that any guest can watch. You can observe in a completely honest way the ingredients which compose your order, who prepares it and under what conditions, so that further client's confidence increases.Our main objective is to achieve the maximum functionality by caring about all the aesthetic details that convey the quality image we want for Pushka. It is crucial that all the materials that make up the establishment and are in direct contact with the product must be waterproof and non-toxic. We will be very scrupulous and rigorous with the cleaning and, in addition to a general cleaning every day, the staff will be obliged to take advantage of any free second to inspect and clean what is convenient.We present our idea of what the kitchen aspect will look like. Three sections of final preparation, separated from each other, but linked by the interior area and with one ""border"" of glass between chefs and the public. The burger chef, sushi itamaeand pizzaiolo will wear uniforms of similar appearance with the logotype of pushka but, at the same time, each one of them with its unique style linked to the culture of cuisine he prepares.Regarding the decoration, the appearance is very important for us. It is necessary to create a warm and cozy space with pleasant corners, so that the client feels comfortable. Pushka should look for a modern image that makes it attractive to the public, although with connotations that evoke tradition and quality food.We hope you like our project and believe in us. Let's do it!",We have conducted surveys in the streets of Madrid asking people if:1) they would like the existance of our establishment. - 96.7% have answered yes.2) they would be visiting our establishment permanently for lunch / dinner during the week - 84.6% have answered yes.3) they would go to our restaurant most of the times they decide to eat at a mall - 59.4% have answered yes.These independent surveys show that most consumers would like an establishment of this type to meet their needs.,https://www.kickstarter.com/projects/pushkagroup/1-minute-portarait-on-your-cup-coffee-house?ref=discovery_category_newest,pushkagroup/1-minute-portarait-on-your-cup-coffee-house,"P.s. We especially rented a coffee house for 1 day in order to show you our extraordinary cool idea, make this video possible and try out our business model. And as you can see, it works!Origin StoryHello! Our names are Elias & Kate, and we want to share with you our dream.We have loved coffee since we tasted it. Its smell, its tastes, the way it is prepared, even the way it looks. And we ABSOLUTELY ADORE art. Paintings, photography, music… We are obsessed with all these things and we always wanted to find a way we can put it together in a special place where people like us can enjoy coffee and art, as nothing like it existed in Madrid, and, even, the whole Spain. So we decided to create it ourselves.And Pushka Coffee history started.What is this magical place?For us would be very simple and not interesting creating a regular coffee house with just some Latte Art. And then our idea was born.Pushka Coffee will be the first coffee house in the world, where our clients’ portraits are drawn directly on the cups! Our guests while making the order of any of our delicious drinks get a “to go” cup with his/her portrait made by professional artists in just 1-2 minutes, while your order is being made.We are from a very small village in Ukraine, where we had already had some experience in running our own coffee house. And it was quite successful. But unfortunately, we had to leave our lovely place and our clients, as we had to sell it so we can build our dream «Pushka Coffee» for which we had to find more inspiration. In search of bigger opportunities for finding out more and more about our coffee and art passion, we decided to move to the capital of a lot of pieces of art, to Madrid in Spain.Now we perfectly know how to find the perfect baristas and coffee to make the people enjoy the most and always want to come back. We are feeling ourselves totally prepared and ready for opening the coffee house of our dream.We want to make a place where anyone can just chill, taste a delicious beverage, eat some desserts and snacks and simply feel happy by getting his own portrait in a perfect lovely atmosphere.We’re so excited about the rewards we’re offering for backing our project. We’ve already found several artists (which for sure are going to draw in our coffee house) to do exclusive portraits and pictures for you, our very dear readers. Here’s how it works:· Anything to send all around the world is completely FOR FREE· Choose the backer level and amount you’d like to donate (Gift Box, Mug, Biscuit, etc)· If we get funded, you’ll receive a survey at the end of the campaign.· In the survey you’ll be able to choose which design you’d like on what you have chosen.

It’s completely up to you!Take a closer look at the rewards you are able to choose made by us and our incredibly talented artists:The Adorable Place· Our artistsIn «Pushka Coffee» we have asked some art students to draw on our cups. It is the way we decided to give the opportunity for young professionals enjoy their work, make some money and be just happy for what they are doing JIn just 1-2 minutes they will draw your portrait on the cup, while your drink is being made.

Here everybody is welcome despite of your age, orientation, gender or culture. Our coffee house is made with comfortable and attractive design, shiny and relaxing colors, quiet music, stylish design and, the most important, very functional and modern kitchen where our qualified baristas can make the perfect coffee drinks.You also always wanted to find yourself a place like this, huh?· Our productsFor our coffee drinks we chose the best and high-quality products we have found according to our experience. Making it with love and experienced hands will improve it and make really unrepeatable, magical, and soft tasted coffee & tea drinks. Get ready to lick your fingers :PProblems we face· The Rent. As we are located in the biggest city of Spain, its capital, it is a perfect place where a lot of peoples from different lifestyles cross. But, unfortunately, the rental prices are very high, and we cannot afford saving money to be able to pay first months after starting the activity. In details, we have estimated that we need starting funds for the first 4 months.· The Building: to be able to provide a perfect place where anybody can come with no difficulties, we have found a perfect neighborhood to locate «Pushka coffee». The place is in a perfect location and has a perfect size and surface that we can afford. The only problem is that we need to repair the room, as before there was a clothes shop and there are a lot of things we have to build, such as: pipelines, illumination, electricity and some interior design changes.· The furniture. In order to provide the most comfortable environment in our coffee house we need to get high-quality tables, shelfs, chairs and armchairs, which are a bit more expensive that we have expected and unfortunately, we cannot afford the full amount.· The equipment: is not a secret that coffee making equipment is not cheap. We have saved some money for the most expensive, the espresso machine, but there are more necessary expenses: coffee grinder, fridge, the bar, toaster and the microwave.The SolutionIn order to launch our incredible project and provide an amazing place where the people can get delicious and totally authentic coffee and tea drinks we need some initial funds to start.We are currently designing the plans to build out a brand new space in the mentioned location, with all new furniture, new equipment, a nice bar, good lighting for artists, energy efficient, and just an all around perfect space for people to come, drink good coffee and enjoy an adorable environment.Upon successful funding, 100% of the funds will go towards building out of our location. We are building out the new place completely from zero, which means we’ll be able to perfectly create and customize our space to fit the needs of the business and the community.Our goal is set at the absolute minimum amount we need to get the «Pushka coffee» coffee house set up:· The Repairs (minimal coast to redecorate and be able to open and work)· The Rental in Salamanca District· The Equipment (Espresso Machine, Coffee Grinder, Small Fridge, Faucet)· The Furniture (minimal required according to Government’s norms):o Small tables x6;o Chairs x12;o Table tops x2 (for the bar)o Table tops x2 (for the bar);he bar);;o Shelves x10;o Light Fixtures x5.Overfunding will get us closer to seeing our vision of «Pushka Coffee» fully realized. This includes:· Better Espresso Machine and Coffee Grinder· High-quality furniture· Better Audio System and a TV screen· More creative and original redecorating of the locationWhen we are opened and functioning well and efficiently, we are looking forward to:· Our brand shop: we are excited to also divide our products and de able to sell some of it in our small brand shop where we can sell people our authentic and original products, some of which we are looking forward to send to you our dear backers.· Our barista and art school: we also want to create a barista & art school where anybody can learn how to mak a perfect espresso, latte or cappuccino and put into it some love. Also, in the same place we will teach people of any age to draw anything they want.· Open more coffee houses in the future to make happy as much people as possible!","One of the biggest challenges of this project is our timeline for completion. Once our desired location is ready for us to begin our buildout, we'll need to work quickly on construction so that our rental payments are the most minimal amount of money possible. We are doing everything we can to get a jump on things like floor plans, health department approval, etc. If our campaign is successfully funded, we can begin preparing some of these things immediately to ensure our opening as quickly as possible. Also, as the place is really good, we are scared that somebody can rent it before we can sign the rental contract.With everything said above, I hope you help us to bring our project to reality. Back now and share this project with your friends!Thank you,Elias Dosunmu& Kateryna Ovchinnikova."

You are not putting harsh chemicals onto your skin and these soaps leave you clean without any residue. They smell amazing. There are even options for men and people who would rather no fragrance at all.I'm raising funds to buy more products and equipment to be able to mass produce these items by hand to reach more costumers. The more products I have, the more soap I will be able to sell. I think my soap sells very well with what I have. The loyal costumers I do have buy up all of the loaves of soap I make. My loyal costumers are friends and family who support me wholeheartedly.During one weekend I think I would be able to produce 10 loaves of cold and 10 loaves of hot process soaps. I will accept pre-orders or upload prices directly onto my store envy shop. They go extremely quick just by word of mouth. Profits made from soap sales will go back into purchasing more products and equipment as well as establishing a credit line with wholesale companies.","One of the risks I think I am taking is not being able fulfill the orders as fast as I would want to. I would like a 3-5 day processing time just to make sure that the products they want or require are ready for shipment. I will probably need some more hands and assistance from friends or family, although I think I can pull it off. I am very optimistic. Another risk I may face are the customers may not see a need for my products.

They are not harsh on the skin. They moisturize without leaving a residue. They lather and clean skin very well. You can have the option of unscented for sensitive skin.

I’m setting up this kickstarter with the hope that you would help me fulfill my lifelong aspiration of being a cartoon animator. I don’t want to give too much of my cartoon ideas away because an idea can be a very valuable thing. However, to define it simply I want to make a truly unique, action-packed, captivating toon with the perfect blend of humor, friendship, twists, violence, drama, magic, gore, and horror. To put it into perspective I want to pay homage to the imaginative creativity of early dungeons and dragons by fixating a group of likeable and relatable heroes on one overall quest in the story. This quest will be elusively surrounded with subplots, puzzles, and the inevitable beasts and monsters that seek the thwart the protagonists’ righteous goals. Our heroes will be plagued with constant conflict that presents itself along the journey. This will not be a cartoon for children. This is going to be an American anime for teens and adults. There will be plenty of blood and terror. My monstrous creatures are guaranteed to shock and enthrall with unbridled originality. What I’m asking for is help so that I can make the pilot episode and pitch it to television networks and streaming services. I already have access to studio animation software, but here is what I need: A professional drawing tablet from Wacom which is $450, and $200 for drawing/art supplies and a microphone. I also want to make things interesting and fun for my loving donators. Every investor no matter how much you donate will be given producer credit and special thanks in the credits. But wait! There’s more. The top ten donators will be allowed to vote on the pilot episode monstrosity. Democracy will prevail. The highest donor will be promised 10% of merchandising profits. Think about the t-shirts, coffee cups, necklaces, hats, decals, posters, etc. of your favorite TV shows that you already own. Have you ever thought about how much revenue merchandise like that generates? If we can attain cult popularity and a strong fan base then the top investor could potentially earn exponentially more than he/she originally donated. I’m including a few sample drawings as to not give too much away. After I get the supplies it’s going to take me 90+ days to animate the pilot. I appreciate your patience, and I will keep my investors updated every step of the way. The reason that it’s going to take so long is that animation can be a grueling task. Ten minutes of animation is 14,400 separate frames, so please bear with me during the animation process. Seth Macfarlane was given 6 months and $50,000 from Fox to create the pilot for Family Guy. I believe that a dream coupled with determination can start at just $650.","The biggest challenge is going to be the time it takes to create the animation. A 10 minute cartoon has 14,400 frames.

https://www.kickstarter.com/projects/blackbirdmediagroup/blackbird-media-group-kickstarter-campaign-station?ref=discovery_category_newest,blackbirdmediagroup/blackbird-media-group-kickstarter-campaign-station,"Welcome to the Kickstarter campaign for northcentral Indiana’s independent internet radio company: Blackbird Media Group!In an age where local radio personalities are being replaced by corporate syndication due to budget cuts and online streaming services such as Pandora and Spotify, finding a good radio station (especially one that still plays decent music) can be hard to find. Additionally, local broadcasting as we know it is on the verge of becoming extinct—the country of Norway has switched over from FM radio in favor of internet radio, and with the rising trend of users with internet access everywhere, it’s likely that terrestrial stations will share the same fate before too long, whether it’d be on a personal computer or an app.So, why does it matter to us? Because we know the internet is the future of radio, but we also want to maintain that hometown DJ-listener relationship with our followers, even if listeners are tuning in from another state or, perhaps, country.  Our DJs will take your requests via email or social media; we will even go as far as advance scheduling them into a pre-programmed playlist.This isn’t the first time an internet radio station has been started in Logansport and Cass County, Indiana, but it is the first to heavily rely on social media. In fact, it has been 15 years since the last known internet station went off the air, and look at how much has changed since the early days of MySpace! However, the only way for Blackbird Media Group to take off is with your help.(Yes, we’re talking to you.) Naturally, we like to attract listeners, but we also like to have something for our DJs to make their time on the air fun and enjoyable, especially if it’s a genre of their specialty.And what is our specialty? First and foremost, pop and alternative, featuring your favorite artists from yesterday to today—the Beatles, the Rolling Stones, Michael Jackson, Madonna, Nirvana, Radiohead, Lady Gaga, Katy Perry, Ed Sheeran—and others that’ll take too long for us to mention! But since we are out of northcentral Indiana, we will also include a block of contemporary country and country crossovers such as Luke Bryan, Taylor Swift, and Kid Rock. Are you a fan of southern rock or Heartland rock? We love some Lynyrd Skynyrd, Tom Petty, and our home-state boy John Mellencamp. And, yes, we’ll even play some “Weird Al” Yankovic upon request!In other words, a variety that you just can’t go wrong!**Another bonus: if you are an up-and-coming artist on Kickstarter or Patreon who needs free promotion to get a label representative’s attention or a local native wishing to build up a fanbase outside the taverns, we will be glad to play your music on the air! We’re considering a future program slot dedicated just for you and your fellow future Hot 100 acts. (Hey, you never know which listener might have that one special record company contract you’ve been dying to sign!) When the opportunity presents itself, here’s what you’ll need to do: simply contact us with an MP3 copy of the track you want us to incorporate into our music library, and we’ll work something out to get you noticed.**To be honest, the basics we need to get started for a three-year run before we take the next step of becoming a full-fledged business:Should we maintain a sustainable following, we will advance to business status and open the opportunity for local businesses and organizations to advertise through us. At this present moment, however, we are more interested in picking up listeners through this new form of local radio broadcasting on a hobbyist level. Any revenue made outside your Kickstarter pledge will be determined by the number of listeners who help with through our Patreon accounts and affiliation. Your pledge will be mere financial cushioning in the event of little to no revenue is made at the end of the current month.We are limited in what we can provide in terms of giveaways due to severe tight finances, BUT we do have some unique rewards for those who wish to back us, including multiple entries for a chance to win 10 random albums on vinyl and a turntable as part of our Christmas gift to you and exclusive to our Kickstarter backers only. (NOTE: Vinyl albums will vary from new, used, and Record Store Day exclusive.)Thank you for supporting this project!

If we fail to reach our pledge goal, backers’ pledges during this period will be voided. You can pledge again for a second time between Thursday, June 1, and Friday, June 30, but if we fail to reach the goal then, both the campaign and contest will be postponed to a later date.As for the Vinyl XMAS Package contest, the winner will be announced and contacted on Wednesday, November 1, 2017, to ensure proper delivery period in case the winner should be a non-US resident.

In helping calm our fears, I have created an indoor interactive safety themed learning village and play center. LIL’ JAKE’S™ INDOOR SAFETY VILLAGE & PLAYGROUND LLC (Lil’ Jake’s™) is for moms and dads (like my wife and me) to feel safe about our children while our children feel safe and have a blast learning life-saving skills, getting exercise and developing social skills through hands-on experiences and Unstructured Free Play (UFP).Company: The founder Wayne Georgiana, a disabled Veteran, a 28-year firefighter/EMT, public safety educator and an entrepreneur intends to build a clean, safe and fun 2 in 1 indoor Children’s Edutainment Center (CEC’s) facility in Nashua, NH.28 years in the fire service as a firefighter/EMT.Currently teach school aged children basic fire safety Teach high school Seniors in Nashua, NH (where I reside) Emergency Medical Technicians (EMTs)). I taught at the NH Fire Academy and I have also worked in an Emergency Room for 6 years.Concept:Lil’ Jake’s™ is a clean, safe and fun interactive safety themed learninNashuaage and play center. Its mission is to promote life-saving knowledge and skills, fitness, social skills and FUN through experiential life safety education  (ELSE™) and ""unstructured free play"" (UFP).Story time..... (regarding the concept)One daymy 2 daughters (Caylee 7 (now 10) & Ryenne 6 (now 9)) came home from school and engaged me in conversation. I was puzzled and said to myself, ""self, this ought to be interesting!!!"" They said to me, ""Dad, the firefighters came to school today and told us if our house is on fire to stop, drop and roll"". I was FLOORED!!! Because that's not what we (public safety educators) tell children. We tell them , ""If your house is on fire ""fall & crawl""; if you are on fire ""STOP, DROP & ROLL"". At that very moment, shaking my head, I realized that we aren’t reachingchildren in a way that they understand and process what we are telling them.Kids and parents will get the opportunity to learn and experience how to properly escape from a window in a fire condition.Kids and parents will learn and experience why we need to ""fall & crawl"" when escaping the smokey conditions of a fire in our house.Community:We truly believe in being a community built business. Without supporting the Greater Nashua, NH community we do not believe we can be successful. We are collaborating with 5 local non-profit organizations in Nashua (Greater Nashua Boys &Girls Club, Big Brothers/Big Sisters, Nashua Childrens Home, Lil' Iguana's and Positive Street Art) doing incredible things!!! Nashua, NH we've (Lil’ Jake’s™) got your back!!!!!BOO YA!!!!! Kids all abilities and ages of (6 & older)..... well, anyone who considers themselves as I do.....a KID @ HEART. OH YEAH!!!!This structure serves our 2 - 4 year old as well as children, who by no choice of their own, are confined to a wheel chair.SCORE!!!!! Our crawlers are going to love this!!!! Although mom & dad may love it more as it offers a lot of motor skill and sensory development for our littlest ones.Features: Sand & Water Panel - develops fine motor skills and helps toddlers learn about cause and effect. It also promotes individual, parallel and social play. Climb & Slide Panel - focuses on gross motor skills using climbing, sliding and crawling to encourage repetition. Pretend Play Panel - focuses on imaginative and social play. Art Panel - develops communication, fine motor, and decision making skills. End Climber Panel - focuses on gross motor skills, and the steps layout encourages repetition. FirstPlay Toddler can play an important role in a young child's physical, mental and social development. These colorful and interchangeable panels let toddlers step, slide, peek, sketch and pretend. It's durable, easy to clean and perfect for indoors or outdoor. - See more at: http://playworld.com/products/design_7_0#sthash.HhQXhsup.dpufLil’ Jake’s™ was conceived in July of 2013. 2-1/2 years later we are ready for execution.PHASE 1, initiallyconsists of the play park (climbing structures), grab 'n go style cafe', an interactive road, birthday parties and family events such as learning CPR together or learning how to properly use a fire extinguisher, etc.PHASE 2, 6 - 12 months (after doors open)consists of seamlessly incorporating the village which consists of a firehouse, police station, a hospital and a New England style home where theELSE™ curriculum will take place using state-of-the-art technology. Well let's see...Well if the stars align and we are successful we expect to have our soft opening in July of 2016. Until then.....FOLLOW US & LIKE US onALRIGHT, ALRIGHT, ALRIGHT....If you do have any questions, please DO NOT hesitate to reach out to us through Kickstarter or our website www.liljakes.comI bet you we have the answers to your questions. We truly enjoy sharing information about Lil’ Jake’s™!! So REMEMBER this... the only dumb question is the one that's not asked!!We CAN'T wait to meet you when you decide to use your pledge package!!THANK YOU VERY, VERY, VERY MUCH!!!!!","Our BIGGEST unforeseeable challenge, as with any project is the construction. Lil’ Jake’s™ doesn't need much construction as the space that's been committed for this is in great move-in condition. I find that this is like the circus. It has many people involved and a lot of moving parts (no matter how small the circus may be) all at the same time, which leads to the possibility of something going wrong. Yet when something does go wrong it is not seen by the spectator and the show goes on. We are using our community to build Lil’ Jake’s™. Using local businesses helps as they have local resources at their finger tips. So, if one of the numerous moving parts should breakdown we have another that could seamlessly enter into the controlled chaos. But thanks to our Project Manager (PM) Joe we are are in GREAT hands!!Our second BIGGEST risk/challenge/concern is when  you've got your groove on working with investors and then BAM!!! the markets crash leaving the investor with less money then you have.... Now that my friends, becomes an issue. A very, very BIG one. So what we have done is submitted our business plan to 3 different business plan competitions totaling over $135,000.00 in addition to this wonderful and exciting Kickstarter campaign.  Two of the three climbing structures are American made! Due to the uniqueness of the 3rd climbing structure it is being built in Germany. It takes 12 weeks for delivery. We consider this a risk because it is coming by boat from another country. We have accounted for delays by pre-ordering. One never knows when mother nature is going to throw a curve ball while at sea.Another challenge we will face is having to do a second round of capital raising which is likely to be around $200,000.00, when we move to incorporate the safety-themed play village. An upside is that we will have been generating revenue so we should not have trouble raising the funds from a local financial lending institution.Again, THANK YOU so very much!!!",https://www.kickstarter.com/projects/liljakes/lil-jakes-where-safety-education-and-fun-times-mee?ref=discovery_category_newest,liljakes/lil-jakes-where-safety-education-and-fun-times-mee,"With unintentional injuries being the leading cause of death in children between the ages of 1 and 14 years, child obesity being an epidemic and the unpredictable New England weather (NH, MA, ME, & VT) (year round), parents have been hoping for a place to bring their kids that is for all abilities, where cleanliness is a priority, at the same time, they have fun, be SAFE and engage in Experiential Life Safety Education (ELSE™), as well as unstructured free play (UFP) and get exercise, while parents sit back (supervising through closed circuit television) with a delicious cup of coffee in hand.

We have everything in place, ready to launch.WHY FUND US??Because we love our community and our children so much, we want you to be more than just a stakeholder! We want you as a part of our family!Experiential learning and unstructured free play is evidence based research that has a direct effect on kid’s retention and social development, which, by the way is a very hot topic. Children today have less time and access to UFP than in the past. Especially in cities! Lots of new research shows how critical experiential learning and free-play is to children's development.Additionally, our facility develops fine motor skills and helps learn about cause and effect; Promotes individual, parallel and social play; focuses on gross motor skills using climbing, sliding and crawling to encourage repetition, imaginative and social play; Develops communication, fine motor, and decision making skills; Plays an important role in a young child's physical, mental and social development.

Freedom 58 Project (Freedom58project.com) designed multiple art exhibits that would give survivors an opportunity to tell the world of their gripping story of rescue, restoration and pathway to healing. Each of the 200 paintings, and growing every week, tells the story of a subject from Nepal, Cambodia, India, Uganda, and the Philippines and other countries about the horrific and violent oppression that is common place to the poor and vulnerable.These art exhibits are designed to create awareness, and mobilize communities to a specific set of calls to action. Artists from all over the country and parts of the world have donated up to one week to paint a survivor in all types of mediums and styles including portrait, landscape, contemporary.We are looking to complete the remaining framing, easels, shipping containers, collateral materials, posters, brochures for scheduled showings in Kansas City, Boulder, Denver, NW Arkansas and many other universities and communities. We also want to get the Faces of Freedom exhibit trademarked to protect the exhibit and give us freedom to share the beautiful stories of heroes, survivors, and the extraordinary. We want to expand the presence of our exhibit with the funding that you can provide for marketing collateral material and develop a stronger web presence.To obtain our goal we want to see these four areas flourish:1. Create awareness on a mass worldwide scale2. Develop an international airport exhibit3.

Each of the 200 paintings, and growing every week, tells the story of a subject from Nepal, Cambodia, India, Uganda, and the Philippines and other countries about the horrific and violent oppression that is common place to the poor and vulnerable. These art exhibits are designed to create awareness, and mobilize communities to a specific set of calls to action. Artists from all over the country and parts of the world have donated up to one week to paint a survivor in all types of mediums and styles including portrait, landscape, and contemporary. We are looking to complete the remaining framing, easels, shipping containers, collateral materials, posters, and brochures for scheduled showings in Kansas City, Boulder, Denver, NW Arkansas and many other universities and communities. We also want to get the Faces of Freedom exhibit trademarked to protect the exhibit and give us freedom to share the beautiful stories of heroes, survivors, and the extraordinary. Our goal is to expand the presence of our exhibit with the funding that you can provide for marketing collateral material and develop a stronger web presence. To obtain our goal we want to see these four areas flourish: 1. Create awareness on a mass worldwide scale 2. Develop an international airport exhibit 3. Substantially increase the capacity of our art partners who are doing the difficult work of rescue and restoration 4. Mobilize tens of thousands to a practical call to action. Go to www.freedom58project.com to see a sample of the paintings and a list of participating artists. ","Risks and challengesWe collaborate with many strategic partners across the country who have substantial infrastructure. We also have invitations for the exhibits from Attorney Generals, Hospitals, Churches, Universities but we need to complete the first three exhibits and develop the fourth. Will we develop an exhibit that stands alone just on the merits of the art? Will we have enough exceptional art to warrant an exhibit at Denver International Airport some day. We are very close already!"

DualBand uses 2 NFC tags stitched into the leather, to be able to tell your phone to do tasks. think of it as a small amount of code, that when you read the code in the band by placing it next to your phone, gets read and then tells it what to do. NFC (near field communication) uses induction from your phone to power a very low power radio in the tag to transfer the ID (think of the ID as a name for each tag) and the data of the NFC chip, that data then triggers your phone to do tasks, or in the case of a NFC door lock its used to keep a password.Style:         With 3 colorsto choose from and in 18mm 20mm 22mm  watch band sizes DualBand can match and fit almost any watchSimplicity:     No buttons, No screen, No lights, Just a nice looking watch band that wont distract from your timeless watch.Control:       You decide what DualBand does when it touches your smartphoneCompatibility:  You can use DualBand withAny Smartphone, tablet, or door lock that is NFC enabled. (Iphone 6 and up does support writing NFC but apple has sadly locked down the NFC chip to only use apple pay so you will loose most of the functionality, but with the iphone 7 apple has added the ability to both read and write useing NFC, so in future Ios updates it may be possible to use DualBand)Speed:         DualBand takes only 53ms (faster then you can blink) to do whatever youwant it to doDurable:       Dualband will last a long time due to its thick 2 layered fine grain calf leather, rugged stitching, stainless steel buckle and water resist coating.So if DualBand can do all that, and still look like a normal watch strap how is it so relatively cheap compared to other smart watch bands?We are producing Dualband more or less at cost and the retail price will be around $45 - $55, so take this time to get in on DualBand on the ground floor, while supporting our community.How to set up DualBand in 5 simple steps1. Enable NFC on your device. (NFC only uses power when reading and writing to the chip so it doesn't strain your phone's battery like bluetooth or wifi does)2. Download any NFC tasks app. (you can pick whatever app you prefer but we use the app ""NFC Tools"" to demonstrate)3. Add one or more tasks (such as adjust screen brightness, send a text or turn on your wifi)4. Write to one of DualBand's NFC chips (by touching the NFC antenna on your phone to either the front or back chip of the watch band in the middle of the square stitching)5. You're done! (Next time you touch DualBand to your phone your set task will activate, whetherit be opening a app sending a text making a phone call or adding a contact)NFC SpecsTag Type:       2x NTAG213 ISO 14443A(compatible with all NFC Phones and most NFC doors)Useable Memory: 288 bytes (this is plentyenoughstorage for over 20 tasks, passwords, orevena small picture)Read Distance:   1-3cm (this is more than enoughto be able to use through even the thickest of phone cases, altho phones with metal housings have a lower read distance)","As you may know kickstarter has a bad reputation for shipping items late or not at all, shipping on time is one of our top priorities. we are by no means professional manufactures, we are engineers so our minimum order quantity is 50 per color per size and we have no control over that, so we need least need 450 pre-orders, after we get at least 450 pre-orders, production should not be a problem as we have a very experienced manufacture, and production samples in our hand and on our wrists."

You must to understand that these entities need a benefit of artist promotion. When you have a big number of followers, they can turn them in their followers. When you have money, they can get a paid for their work ( all time registered to obtain their actual fans number and the time dedicated to produce a video or other things for your songs promotion ); I don't have followers, and I can't get them because the popular labels aren't interested in my music at all for a no-benefit reason to promote my songs, and small labels ask me for a payment to be promoted in their social networks.In short, I just want the money to promote my music and get followers interested in my productions.

There is much more , but I don’t wanna share all of our important steps so this project is successful and for you profitable , updates will be provided.- Final picture will be 4k (8,294,400 pixels), for every dollar you will spent on this project you will receive 1 pixel , you will own this pixel and your name will be printed into it, you can use this pixels as advertising or sell it, trade it or just keep it as a souvenir , you will not be able to delete it . Search engine on web page will be able to find your pixels by entering your name and will show you exact location of it and there will be more....-What is Project Karma 11? Major part of this project is to create a picture. It starts with you sharing yours emotions with the world. You can be happy, amused, angry, disgusted, loved, excited, sad, afraid, confused, depressed..... I chose basic emotions. Each color of the buttons demonstrates your feeling - red is for feeling of anger, blue for sadness and so on. After you click on the button that suits your emotions best, you will be taken on to the Karma page. While you are on this page, 1 color pixel will be draw into this page, you will be seeing the dot flashing in the same color (emotion) that you chose for a few seconds so you know exactly which pixel is yours ( Pixels are picked randomly ). When this page will be filled and all the pixels are connected a picture will appear ! There could be signs, faces, words, anything that our minds could create beyond our imagination...............Basically we will capture all the energy created with your emotions and will make it visible.There are lots of studies about our brains being connected, telepathy, premonition, noetic science ......It's just the part of us that we still don't fully understand but thanks to the internet and social networks like Facebook, Twitter, Google+, Instagram, Qzone, .......we are all connected; at least the way we can technically explain and understand and thanks to those technologies we might find out how to explain something we don't understand at all. We will let our individual emotions spread all over the world independently, no matter what race, age or gender you are , in any part of our world, to form something and if i'm right, our minds connected together could create something we never even imagined. We'll be converting emotions into the drawing.I believe that's the way Karma works - through our emotions, and of course individually with everybody, creating reflections of our decisions and applying sense of our lives-connecting or separating us. Personally, i don't believe there is some bad or good Karma, what i believe is the balance , and we can see that balance everywhere , we can feel it , sense it and it exist even with the tiniest one as molecule, everything is balanced - and that is the LIFE . But to keep them balanced something(power, energy or whatever) is needed ! and it is doing a great job. Because of this we still exist. There are millions of theories about how life works. Religions and scientists are trying to explain the beginning and meaning of life but to keep the life running needs something that is able to create and form real balance. And it works the way we can't explain, i would call it the Karma way. We might be able to sense that energy and if emotions are not just reactions but were made to balance the things , then we can catch that energy and make it visible.If there is some Karma for every one of us anywhere, there must be some kind of Karma for everything in this world. So let's see if there is something that could tell us about it. .........","There are not potential risks involved however we will meet with the  chalanges :- not enough people participating in this project - web software and technical bugs of this project Our plans to overcome these challenges are following :- we will cooperate with advertising companies as well as all the social media to promote this project and make more people participate , we will translate this project into multiply languages and will make it global - we will hire top developers and web graphic designers- we will hire lawyer for legal stuff",https://www.kickstarter.com/projects/projectkarma11/interactive-social-games?ref=discovery_category_newest,projectkarma11/interactive-social-games,Www.huntsatoshi.com,"We are planning to have full version of this games live early next year, we still have to build an app and write legal papers, so we have many things to work on with tight budget, but if we can collect funding we are positive our games and rewards will be ready by March 2020."

This software will only send data to an address you trust. You can also choose to do backup on computers in your home network.It is a real backup (not just a file copy) meaning you can recover from any point of time. E.g. find a file you deleted 1 year ago. Dropbox (free edition) only stores deleted files and version history 30 days back.All files are encrypted (128 bit AES)before leaving the computer so destination couldbe anywhere. Add multiple friends to gain redundantbackup.

I have 3 boys of my own and have over my years practiced several types of meditation and have taught my boys the importance of meditation in their life. I came across this program and thought ""how wonderful to teach children on a larger scale.""I remembered as a child, stories were always fascinating to me and helped to create a vision in my mind's eye to bring it all to life. Inamojo is a program that helps achieve just that! It teaches core values of respecting each others personal space, how to be a good listener, kindness and respect. The children journey through each chakra once a week with different characters; first listening to  a story about the character, next dancing along to each segment, creating their own mandala art of their experience and lastly through the meditation.To teach children on a larger scale to meditate will greatly benefit our younger generation as well as those of the future. So many children today struggle in school or at home, whether behaviorally, emotionally, or socially. My goal is for me to facilitate these classes not only in schools, yoga classes, camps, but also in a studio of my own so children such as homeschoolers can benefit also.I have requested for a total contribution for $25,000 to provide a stable foundation in a studio (rent). On average, rent in my hometown is about a $1,000/month. So thinking long-term to fulfill a lease, I am looking at the ""least"" $12,000 just in rent of a studio. There is a $300 starter kit I am looking to obtain as well as some shirts and yoga pants for dress code. There are other things necessary to have for classes such as yoga mats, yoga pillows, center pieces, materials such as crayons, paper, crystals and other props to keep the children entertained and focused within the classes. While purchasing these items may sound low-cost, I ensure you it is not entirely as I will be having class sizes of sometimes 25-30 children when conducting classes in a school setting. And with children, we all know we need to account for any replacement materials in case of accidental damages to items. I also have intentions of providing each child a crystal for each chakra at the end of class. So by the time they complete the 9 Week Series, they will have a complete set to continue their meditation practice to carry into their life long journey.I will also be contributing not only by teaching each child this course in meditation but also networking with families to find one or two children every 2 months to participate for free. These child(ren) will be someone who is of need, such as financial crisis, single parent home, behaviorally challenged, etc. Every contribution will make a BIG DIFFERENCE in the life of these children.For a $1 contribution, I will personally post a thank you on my personal website as each contribution makes a difference no matter how big or small. It all will be greatly appreciated!

You don't just build a robot, you learn the easy way how to make it talk and sing so you can program your own speeches and songs into the robots you build using the RoboGuts™ circuit board and any one of the eBooks.   With this kit you barely even need to read;	Using the simple easy to follow wiring diagrams you have your RoboGuts™ circuit board ready to control your robot in just a few minutes.  You don't need to know anything about electronics just follow the pictures and you will begin to understand the basics leaving more advanced learning for later. You can see how a simple R/C male to male cable immediately cleans-up wiring the PIR to the BS2 on the RoboGuts™ circuit board. Connecting the LED is easy using the bread board block on the left side of the RoboGuts™ circuit board.Copy/Pasting the program listings;  	Programming and the simple addition/subtraction math is mostly done.  All you do is test and tweak the movements to better fit the components you have.  Add another 5ms to a pause, or add another 10mm to a distance measure, or add another 10ms to a motor position.You don't need to know anything about mechanics;  	All the part designs are for 3D plastic printing.Everything should fit together well so all you do is assemble the parts and install the components so the robot looks like the picture.  This is why the robot designs for the book are kept very simple ... so you just build and not spend a lot of time trying to figure something out.  You might take a little time out to paint your robot parts to look more interesting.The kit is designed to be a build a robot in one day with no previous experience needed.OTOH, if you try out all the lessons, read the program listings to see how they work you will learn some basics about electronics, components and programming ... and then you'll be building more and more projects.  What tools do you need? A small phillips screwdriver, needle nose pliers, wire cutters and a knife at most ... unless you buy some prefab jumper wires, then you'll only need a small phillips screwdriver.  Worried about cost?  Don't worry! The whole project is aimed at making a robot for anybody almost any age and very affordable.Although buying the kit is only the start, you will need a programming platform ... that is a computer to load the MCU chip/module programming software and also a programming board for the chip/modules of you choice.  This is where you will spend more money, but this is a one time expense that you will use over and over as you build more and more projects.  For the Parallax BS2 this could be a Board of Education (BOE, buy a used BOE-Bot kit from somebody that gave up and you get lots of components for your projects at half the price.  For those that will use a PICAXE chip or module I suggest getting a PICAXE AXE091 Evaluation board ... this will let you program all sorts of different PICAXE chips which are much more affordable than a BOE while being even easier to use and more powerful.  Even the PICAXE AXE091 is cheaper to buy new than a used BOE.  All total, the cost of a PICAXE AXE091 and one of my kits is still at best less than half the cost of most robot kits you can find online or in your local hobby store ... better yet, my eBooks makes it much easy to build a robot ... and once you've played around building the few projects in the eBooks you can build hundreds of different types of robots.  For the Arduino aficionados; Yes, if you use an Arduino Uno to program and prototype you can then move the ATMEGA chip off the Arduino Uno and onto the RoboGuts™ circuit board to control your robot saving tons of time figuring out the wiring or how everything will fit.  Keeping the Arduino Uno for software development.  This campaign is to sell an initial 500 RoboGuts™ circuit boards and see if there is a demand for more.  We hope to pre-sell as many as possible, but at this time we can only promise to ship the first 500 in time for Christmas 2015.  If we sell more than 500 we will try to ship as many as we can for the 2015 Christmas season, but we cannot make a promise of more than the first 500.  A little about the end chapter projects;The function of these kits are not unique.  You can buy many robot kits online that will perform the same functions, but they don't have the RoboGuts™ circuit board or smaller 3D printer designs for the plastic robot parts to make the robots.  BillyBot is the primary RoboToons character originally designed just for single frame robot cartoons, but also was based on using mini-Servo motors.  BillyBot became a real life character when somebody asked how much the kit cost.  That's when this project got started on the path it is.  During the prototyping, the design was tweaked several times and there really is no one design because the BillyBot character does have various personalities and requires slightly different body changes to fit those different characters.  The miniFloppyBots too are all different characters with different faces, slightly different body changes too and after you paint the features on your bot there will never be two exactly the same FloppyBots because they are home hobby 3D printed & painted and not a mass production injection molded products.  BattleBots?Yes, there are even a few ideas for child safe BattleBots amongst the miniFloppyBots.  The primary projects help lead your imagination to how the little bots might battle either autonomously or via remote control (R/C) like in the big guys BattleBots you see on TV or at many robot competitions.Further Testing 4 miniFloppy BattleBot2https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IiFwWuQJtj4Initial Weapons Testing 4 miniFloppy BattleBotshttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m5GxSBWOIqoHeadSmasher ... miniBattleBot 2https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VgdulRV4f_UHere is a partially built-up RoboGuts™ for a miniFloppyBot named ScardyBotHardly any wiring mess because the RoboGuts™ circuit board makes wiring so easy and neat.You can also see that instead of a voltage regulator, I've chosen to use a 3-AA cell battery pack and just jumper the Vin to Vdd.More details on this and wiring up other sensors and peripherals are in the eBooks or will be posted on the website after the campaign succeeds.Suicidal FloppySumoBot v.

The RoboGuts™ circuit board is designed to make all the connections easier, faster and the wiring is much neater than other robot controller boards because the RoboGuts™ circuit board is using standard 3-pin headers and round female headers that connect the micro controller chip to the peripheral components.  Now you only have to make a few special cables that are easier to make and much neater than most hobby kits found elsewhere;Adding a 330Ω in series and crossing the Red +V with Black Gnd to connect to a IR Receiver.Two primary ways to power a RoboGuts™ project.RoboGuts™ circuit board fits such a tiny space yet easily allows for so many connections.You make your own Power IN cable and Power Switch cable for now.The RoboGuts™ circuit board is designed to allow for almost any micro controller chip or module (MCU or µController) 2-pins to 28-pins.  Even a user more comfortable with Arduino can work on the software development using their Arduino Uno board, then easily move the programmed ATMEGA chip over to the RoboGuts™ circuit board, add a few jumper wires to build up with connections to the sensors, motors and other peripherals and have an Arduino project.  The RoboGuts™ circuit board was designed because there just wasn't any other solution small enough with all the connectors needed to build the small RoboToons character robots and other smaller home hobby robot projects.The RoboGuts™ circuit board very small but full of important robot building connectors.The first ideas were just for the RoboToons character ""BillyBot"" using a PICAXE 28X2 module ... but then it was realized that the RoboGuts™ circuit board should be made more generic and let the RoboGuts™ circuit board host almost any chip or module especially since BS2 modules, Arduino chips, PIC chips, ARM chips and PICAXE chips are so common.The smallest robot here is more than 100mm/4"" squareThe first prototypes for the FloppyBots were much larger to accommodate the larger micro controller boards commonly sold in the online shops, but it took two or more days to print a FloppyBot kit and they just wasted too much space inside and too much plastic.  Once the idea for the RoboGuts™ circuit board was realized as the better solution, the design for most of the RoboToons characters as educational kits were immediately resized much smaller so that people could 3D print and build a robot project in one day.The BillyBots are ranging from pre- RoboGuts™ circuit board size being less than 115mm/5"" tall to the now slightly larger 170mm/7"" tall as you see on the far right with the speaker in its belly.Here come the miniFloppyBots ... shrinking the FloppyBots down to allow for just enough room for a RoboGuts™ circuit board, a battery and the few cables and peripheral wiring needed.  Making a few different faces because it's so much fun.With the wheels they can really get around!With legs they can dance like Elaine Benes!The view looking down into the miniFloppyBot you can see there's not much wasted space.The eBooks were the next step ... since the RoboGuts™ circuit board could host a myriad of MCUs (Micro Controller Chips or Modules) I started looking at other chips and modules.  The PICAXE 28X2 module seems the best because it has a programming port right on the module and uses a very similar and more powerful BASIC language than the PBASIC Parallax uses for their BASIC Stamps.	PICAXE 28X2 module solutions are very difficult to find for all the different common home hobby sensors, motors etc... used for home hobby robotics.  This is what spurred me into making a notebook of solutions for a quick reference guide and after a few sensors I realized there's probably millions of people around the world that would benefit from the simple ""recipes"" instead of all the engineering gobbledygook.  I was collecting program samples and massaging them into functional little program solutions that could easily be turned into subroutines for other larger projects ... thus the first ""PICAXE µController Solutions"" eBook. 	For beginner and intermediate Roboteers the eBooks and program listings are a good reference ... and as I started to make corrections to the first eBook I also changed all the wiring diagrams over to the RoboGuts™ circuit board which makes building home hobby robotics much easer and faster for everybody.Here are a few more demo videos made for the talking, singing 'n dancing RoboToons robots;BillyBot3 28X2 KickStarter Pitch-02https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7M99bhJ-rkFloppyBot1 20M2 KickStarter Pitch-03https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rmgoJl-9pKAFloppyBot2 28X2 KickStarter Pitch-04https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UWpwq3tErmMFloppyBot3 28X2 KickStarter Pitch-05https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QD9uKLnFh6QBobbyBot3-BS2 KickStarter Pitch-06 https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WsF3Ef_sBpUBillyBot4-18M2 KickStarter Pitch-07https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y0c0X2E9Z4gPrint me a Part - FloppyBot1 20M2https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rmgoJl-9pKA3 Bots Sing 'n Dance Fiascohttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jS4RhqO48uoTHE FINAL CHALLENGE;The challenge is for you to buy RoboGuts™ circuit boardsand build bots and take them to your local hospital and start sharing them with children to play with the bots and teach others how to build and program their own toys to talk, sing and play games.

The season is upon us, let's not waste time.Pick any of our rewards listed along the right side of this page and take part of our revolution to help ourselves and women from around the world.Every $ counts. And please tell your friends and colleagues to do the same, or order them the gift of plain colored leggings or a pair of Pant-a-shoes.You're sure to be their favorite mommy, aunty, sister or friend this year.Our plain colored leggings are made in the U.S.A.in our own facilities from the worlds best 80% Nylon / 20% Spandex 4-way stretch fabric.They stretch in all directions and guarantee a perfect fit to your curves. Even our seams are stretchy.How about matching your leggings to your shoes?Plus match shoes SEAMLESSLY with our Footsie Tights which we'll also make available in 80 colors.The footsie tights are leggings with feet, easily slip into your shoes for a seamless leg look, convenient especially in Fall and during cooler days, but also to be on point with your style.Ahhh, and now —finally — here is our prototype of the LeggingShoe™ designed & manufactured by us — V O I L À.Our measurements above represent what your actual measurements of your body is (rather than the actual garment measurements). Leggings and Pant-a-shoes will stretch beyond these numbers to fit your curves. In case your body requires extra or less inches, please consider ordering a custom made pair (view rewards on the right) or simply contact us at info@elasticwonder.com with your questions.As soon as you order your reward (and if we fund our goal), we will reach out to get your size (measurements if you have a custom order) and if applicable your color choice and production begins immediately. At the end of quality control we package your reward neatly and ship it to arrive during the month specified in the description. In case there are any delays, we will notify you via this platform with a new anticipated arrival date.","We are very confident that we are able to manage any unforeseen challenges, if they present themselves.

PantaShoes - in case you don't know - are a hybrid of pants and shoes combined - or in our case it's leggings and shoes. They have a body conscious fit and are inspired by fetish catsuits.I'm pretty sure there's other women searching for a pair of affordable quality PantaShoes right now. Just as I did for at least the past 6 months.Disappointed with the trashy versions which are too sheer, made with low quality fabric that does not stretch back (no recovery), does not stretch enough or stretches too little depending on your shoe and body size (you can't choose your body size!) and really uncomfortable shoes. I was facing the seemingly only option of spending $2850 on a pair at Balenciaga PantaShoes. But before I did, I decided to try and make a pair myself. You may say: ""That's a bit ambitious. What are your qualifications?"" It's a fair question, but because I own a leggings fashion label and know the do's and don't's of working with spandex fabric, all I had to do was change the pattern to include the cover of a stiletto shoe.Here's a look into how our project came to life. As I mentioned we started changing our leggings pattern to cover a shoe.Then, of course, I had to find a GREAT shoemaker who was willing & able to finish it.After a few months of trial and error, we got it done and we are ready to launch our LeggingShoe™ and share it with women from all over the world.We decided to let our Kickstarter backers (Uber-Fashionistas) help us pick the colors from an exclusive range of over 80 solid colors. That's eighty luscious shades of sleek gorgeousness!!They're opaque (non see through) too. Made from top quality 80% nylon, 20% spandex.Once we go to market, we will offer about ten popular colors. Which is not bad, but it's really worth it to get it on it early and order yours now, especially if you want your LeggingShoes™ in a specific color, at an amazing price and sooner rather than later.The prices and color choices we have right now are unique and Kickstarter specific, won't last. We will send you this list of the 80 colors and their corresponding order number/name to choose from once our goal is met.The LeggingShoes™ features a very soft sheen and an elastic waist band. The LeggingShoe™ is made in the U.S.A.Our Stiletto shoe has a 3.75"" ""ice pick"" heel and once it's covered with our spandex, it can be wiped with a soft clean cloth.Our LeggingShoes™ come in these Women's Shoe Sizes.Leggings Sizes are the following Women's Pant Sizes.As an example you would order your LeggingShoes™ in US bottom size 6, shoe size 7. Or you would order EU bottom size 36 with a shoe size 39, etc.Keep in mind that our spandex stretches 4 ways, so don't worry too much about the fit, as long as you pick your usual women's bottom size, they will stretch to fit.What if our LeggingShoes™ are a global hit (we think it is a possibility) and we get a whole lotta love? There are so many exiting things to do with that! Let's see, what do you think about these ideas? We welcome feedback so please email us at info@elasticwonder.com with any suggestions.","We are very confident that we are able to manage any unforeseen challenges, if they present themselves.

This includes my single friends and even my grown up children. The answer is, in my opinion, that they go on dates with people they barely know.What is wrong with dating people you barely know? Your first impression is often wrong because it is based purely on appearance and social behavior of your date. The risks are: 1) you may dismiss a person who is right for you.                             2)  you may fall in love with a person who is wrong for you.Every day I provide counselling for children from broken families. Once upon a time their biological parents were in love but somehow they turned out to be wrong for each other. Maybe they fell in love before they got to know each other fairly well. I hope that my website can help create families that will stick together through raising children and through other challenges of life.Self-Match.comwill offer a different approach to dating that I call survey-driven dating. The website will have a library of questions submitted by its users, questions based on people's personal experiences, that may red-flag choices or behaviors that one finds unacceptable in a partner. When two people choose to engage in a thoughtful exchange of custom built surveys composed of questions that are important to them they have a better chance at starting a meaningful conversation and getting to know each other pretty well before deciding if a face-to-face date should be their next step. I truly believe that this is a way to promote safer dating and give people a chance to help each other by sharing their experiences in the form of survey questions.To learn more about my idea please visit http://self-match.comYou can vote on some posted questions and even submit your own questions.Building a fully functional custom website requires quite a lot of money. Besides, as I was advised by an expert, I will need funds to sustain and promote my website for at least 12 months before it may become self-sustainable. This is why I need your help.","I think there will be two main challenges in putting this project to life: 1) finding a reliable website builder who can embrace the concept and deliver a perfect product and 2) achieving fast membership growth through marketing and advertising. If the project is funded, it should give me enough resources to tackle both challenges. If I add to that my hard-working ethics, my intelligence, creativity, and intuition, I believe this project will be a success:)",https://www.kickstarter.com/projects/selfmatch/self-matchcom-a-dating-site-like-no-other?ref=discovery_category_newest,selfmatch/self-matchcom-a-dating-site-like-no-other,"Self-Match.com is a compatibility application that will help people decide if they are right for each other in the early stages of their relationship.I believe that so many relationships fail because people heavily rely on their feelings, intuition, or ""chemistry"" when choosing a partner. They don't take time to explore compatibility before jumping into dating or even living together. The emotional attachments that form from personal and physical contacts prevent partners from being able to objectively assess if they are right for each other. I can't blame them because they don't have tools to get to know each other well quickly. For thousands of years, the only way to really get to know your partner was by witnessing their actions and choices through the years of living together.In the modern age of technology, people should be able to research their compatibility quickly to avoid bad dates and failed relationships. My goal is to give people tools to do it through Self-Match.com.The idea of the app is quite simple.1) A user browses through the library of questions available at Self-Match. The questions are multiple choice questions in different categories such as Career & Finance, Daily Routine, Personality/Values/Beliefs, etc. There are currently 11 question categories with about 130 questions total. New questions are created and added almost every day. My hope is that users will start submitting their own questions that after review can be added to the Question Bank.2) The user will choose questions that are important and relevant to him/her and they will be added to the survey.3) The user will answer these questions and will send this blank survey to their prospective partner's email address, Facebook account, etc.4) The prospective partner will take the same survey, and then both people are able to see their answers side by side and get a matching report.5) The partners can continue this process as many times as they want until they reach a decision about their compatibility.Developing a fully functional application that can exercise these features will require time and money. There are no existing survey plugins that allow users to choose their own questions and get matching results. This can be achieved only through a custom written code.I have hired a freelance developer who is writing codes for a simple prototype. However, to build a professional website that will have additional features and will be appealing to users, I need to invest inservices of aprofessional company.So, please support this project by backing it up.",I think there is only one challenge in putting this project to life and it is finding a reliable website designer and a good developer team who can embrace the concept and deliver a perfect product. I believe that with the funds I hope to raise this can be easily overcome.

https://www.kickstarter.com/projects/john-bomhoff/illusion-trails-hike-through-a-fantastic-world?ref=discovery_category_newest,john-bomhoff/illusion-trails-hike-through-a-fantastic-world,"With Illusion trails you can select your own path to Hike, Bike or Run through fantastic 3D Canyons, Mountains, Beaches and Fantasy worlds. The movement of your phone propels you down the trails. This exercise game was originally inspired by the Wii Walk It Out game. By touching the top or bottom of your phone's screen you can select the left or right trail as you walk in place. Turn your exercise into a gameby selectingMaze, Scavenger Huntand Geo-Caching Worlds.If you like, Illusion Trailscan displayyourdistance, time and calories burned.Each world is a distinctive 3D environment, much like a video game environment, with a series of paths that intersect in unusual and varied ways. Like any fitness app, Illusion Trails computes the speed of your steps from the movement of your phone. You can walk in place, on a treadmill or even bike. Those with walking challenges could even use Illusion Trails on a rowing machine or while lifting weights. Illusion Trails is not a game for couch potatos. It's an excercise program that keeps you motivated to discover what lies across the bridge.Your phone could be in a pocket, an armband or even carried inyour hand and you can still text andanswer calls.You can pause the hike at any time and come back to it later.In one configuration, Video from the phone is sent to a large screen TV or tablet. In a different configuration, the video is sent to 3D goggles and the hiker moves about a virtual 3D world. Both situations result in a system that is basically a hiking simulator. If the hiker/runner/biker stops moving the phone stops andthe path movement stops.  Start walking again and movement in the environment starts again. The video speed will match the walking, jogging or pedaling speed. No exercise equipment is necessary. The hiker could walk in place in front of the TV.  However, practically any piece of exercise equipment can be used as long as there is arm movement. Illusion Trails is a great way to make exercising much more interesting and goal-oriented. Unlike video games it isn’t directed towards a specific gender, age or fitness level. Even those with walking disabilities like wounded warriors can use Illusion Trails on rowing machines, lifting machines, etc. 10% of all funds collected will bedonated to help Americans and Vets with disabilities. Selecting the specific exercise in the program setup, ensures the calorie and distance computations are accurate. You can select to have the data, including duration, added to the display.  You can also choose to turn left, right or continue straight through a path intersection by simply touching specific areas of the phone on the arm or the buttons on the 3D headwear. The Island is not small. Depending upon how fast you are moving, you can spend up to 2 hours traveling around the Island without repeating a path. The production versions of the game will utilize current animation technology and be much more realistic. There will be dozens, and eventually hundreds, of other realistic and fantasy environments just as big as the Island. Each environment will contain a variety of interesting elements, suspension bridges, hidden paths, caves, paths behind waterfalls, etc. Fantasy environments will include paths in the canopy, down miles of tree limbs, across the bottom of the ocean, skinny mountain cliff paths, etc. Hikers can stop, save a position and continue at a later time, but they will not be able to “beam” to anywhere they want. Just like real life, Hikers will have to walk the walk and earn the right to see what waits on the other side of the mountain. The initial Island environment will be free. Additional environments can be purchased for a very low price or funded by advertising. Travel to and from the different environments will be through “gateways”.The initial Tropical Island world has been created to a specific size and square shape. It will an entrance/exit near the center of each of the 4 sides. By creating each world the same standard size and square shape, the Illusion Trails universe can continue to grow larger without impacting the processing and display of a single world, much like the levels of a game. Each world will have four physical gateways located near the center of each of the 4 sides of the world. The gateway architecture will match the environment, a thatched hut, a national park entrance, a toll booth, etc.  To enter a new world, the hiker will pay a small fee of $1(US) or less for lifetime access.  A simple payment option like paypal, google pay or apple pay will be used so that it is very quick and easy for the hiker. The exit of each world will be the same and will need to end on a solid color (black or White). So, instead of going into the earth, the hiker will go up into the sky on a circular stairway.  The circular stairway will lead up to a horizontal catwalk. As the hiker climbs the stairway, the world behind fades into the fog. At  the top of the stairway is a straight catwalk, it starts to glimmer and glow.  The hiker walks down it and the environment begins to fade and everything ends up white. In the solid white world the game is switched to the new scene and the hiker is positioned at the end of the catwalk of the new world. The hiker continues hiking and eventually the white fog begins to fade and the down-going circular stairway is revealed.  As the hiker goes down the stairs, the new world emerges out of the fog.  By the time the hiker reaches the new toll booth, the fog dissipates and the new world is waiting for the hiker to explore.Each world is a distinctive and pleasant 3D environment, much like a video game environment but without weapons and villains. The object of Illusion Trails is to challenge yourself. Push yourself, get fit and burn calories while enjoying the amazing landscape laid out in front of you. To help motive the hiker, each World is filled with features from the most wonderful and interesting places in the world.  There will also be worlds that come directly from the creative minds of the landscape artists.Each world will be unique but, there will be some common characteristics:1.	The worlds will be positive in nature. Warm lighting with occasional beautiful sunrises and sunsets. No sudden scares or mayhem.  These worlds might be added later.2.	There will be miles of safe trails. The main trails will be very organic in that they follow the features of an environment much like Nature Trails. These trails will usually be between 2-6ft wide and have names that will appear on maps.3.	There will be a smaller quantity of hidden trails. These trails will narrower and not indicated on any maps. These are the trails the hiker discovers on their own. They might be dead ends, pass through normal areas or they might be the only way for the hiker to get to the most remarkable feature of the environment. 4.	There will be animated animals. The animals will be off the trail, in the sky or in the water. They will never be frightening like snakes. They will graze, move, fly and swim like normal creatures.

Your phone or fitness watch follows your movement and path selections and displays your world on either 3D Goggles, a large screen TV or a tablet.Each world is a distinctive and pleasant 3D environment, much like a video game environment, with a series of paths that intersect in unusual and varied ways. Each environment has paths andthe movement of your phone or fitness watchpropels you down the path.Hikers can selectwhatever path they want but are confined to the paths so nosteering mechanism is necessary. Path movement speed is determined by thespeed the arm is moved back and forth.  The phone could be in a pocket, an arm holster or even carried in the hand.   In one configuration, Video from the phone is sent to a large screen monitor, TV or tablet.Most newerlarge screen TVs are being released with built-in Chromecast or Google Cast, so theIllusion Trails environment is sent directly to your TV. Older TVs made need to simply plug a Chromecast device intoan available HDMI port of the TV. The device is available online and in many stores including Target and Best Buy and cost between $25 and $35. In a different configuration, the video form the phone is sent to the VR goggles. Both situations result in a system that is basically a hiking simulator. If the hiker stops moving the phone (stops walking), thenthe path movement stops.When the hiker startswalking again, movement in the environment starts again. The video speed will match the walking, jogging or pedaling speed. No exercise equipment is necessary. The hiker could walk in place in front of the TV.  However, practically any piece of exercise equipment can be used as long as there is arm movement. Illusion Trails is a great way to make exercising much more interesting, motivationaland goal-oriented. Unlike video games it isn’t directed towards a specific gender, age or fitness level. Even those with walking disabilities, like wounded warriors, can use Illusion Trails on rowing  machines and evenlifting machines.Selecting the specific exercise in the program setup, ensures the calorie and distance computations are accurate. You can select to have the data, including duration, added to the bottom of the environment display.  You can also choose to turn left, right or continue straight through a path intersection by simply touching specific areas of the phone. The Island is not small. Depending upon how fast you are moving, you can spend up to 2 hours traveling around the Island without repeating a path. The production versions of the game will utilize current animation technology and be much more realistic than the current Island graphics. There will be dozens, and eventually hundreds, of other realistic and fantasy environments just as big as the Island. Each environment will contain a variety of interesting elements, suspension bridges, hidden paths, caves, paths behind waterfalls, etc.  Fantasy environments will include paths in the canopy, down miles of tree limbs, across the bottom of the ocean, skinny mountain cliff paths, etc. Hikers can stop, save a position and continue at a later time, but they will not be able to “beam” to anywhere they want. Just like real life, hikers will have to walk the walk and earn the right to see what waits on the other side of the mountain.  The initial app and Island environment will always be free to everyone. Additional environments can be purchased forthe very low price of $1 - $2.The initial Tropical Island world has been created to a specific size and shape. The user will always be dropped into the middle ofthe world.Togo toan adjacentworld, the hiker will have to make their way to one of the 4 entrance/exits. There is an entrance/exit near the center of each of the 4 sides of each world. The worlds fit together like tiles, ever expanding from the center tropical Island world. The Entrance/Exit gateway architecture will match the environment, a thatched hut, a national park entrance, a toll booth, etc.  To enter a new world, the hiker will pay a small fee of $1 to $2for lifetime access.  A simple payment option like paypal, google pay or apple pay will be used so that it is very quick and easy for the hiker. Each world is a distinctive and pleasant 3D environment, much like a video game environment but without weapons and villains. The object of Illusion Trails is to challenge yourself. Push yourself, get fit and burn calories while enjoying the amazing landscape laid out in front of you. To help motive the hiker, each World is filled with features from the most wonderful and interesting places in the world.  There will also be worlds that come directly from the creative minds of the landscape artists.Each world will be unique but, there will be some common characteristics:1.	The worlds will be positive in nature. Warm lighting with occasional beautiful sunrises and sunsets. No sudden scares or mayhem.If there is a demand, darker worldsmight be added later.2.	There will be miles of safe trails. The main trails will be very organic in that they follow the features of an environment much like Nature Trails. These trails will usually be between 3-6ft wide and have names that will appear on maps located in the app.3.	There will be a smaller quantity of hidden trails. These trails will be narrower and not indicated on any maps. These are the trails the hiker discovers on their own. They might be dead ends, pass through normal areas or they might be the only way for the hiker to get to the most remarkable feature of the environment. 4.	There will be animated animals. The animals will be off the trail, in the sky or in the water. They will never be frightening like snakes. They will graze, move, fly and swim like normal creatures. Their appearance and location will be semi-random just like real life. You are more likely to see the deer family down by the river, but they are not always there and seldom in the exact position you last saw them. 5.	There will be animated features.

https://www.kickstarter.com/projects/innovation101/deuce-badge-badass-detective?ref=discovery_category_newest,innovation101/deuce-badge-badass-detective,"Deuce Badge Badass Detective is a original mature animated television show created by Michael Z White about a 33 year old, ego driven, self centered detective with an over inflated sense of self worth. He is usually outwardly insulting and nonchalantly displays moronic behavior. He comes equipped with a handsome face, a square chin, angelic hair, a killer six pack, a sweet ride and an endless supply of cheesy one-liners. Deuce has an undying passion for upholding the law and an incorruptible code of honor. In addition to pissing off every one around him, his main priorities are himself, and serving up some badass justice, with his cohorts, in the streets of Hampton City.I created Deuce Badge about 5 years ago, with a vision of a character that everyone would fall in love with. Sure, the concept of a self centered ""anti hero-hero"" is nothing new, but there has never been a character quite like Detective Deuce Badge. His name is unique in it's own, considering how strikingly close it is to a douche bag. My goal is to turn this idea into a reality. I have pitched my idea and scripts to numerous agents and production companies, however, I have run into nothing but false positives. A friend of mine suggested that I produce my own work by simply hiring a group of professionals to assist me. He then introduced me to the world of KickStarter, and here I am. Since then, I have done research on professional animation services and web comic design and turns out, its a commonly sought out service. So, as it stands, I have a team of professional animation specialists ready to get to work. The budget has been projected to be about $150,000. $145,000 for the following list of services; Story board creation, story board to full animation, landscaping concepts to full rendering, web comic creation, unlimited editing and revisions, 100 DVD's and 250 paperback comics of all 6 episodes and a medium scale website dedicated to the show with 2 years of free hosting and website maintenance . $5000 will cover all voice acting services from a team of experienced professionals. So hop on board, KickStarter community. Lets bring this douche bag of a crime fighter to the big screen so he can piss the world off while keeping them safe.","I truly believe that I am at an advantage with my project because of what I have to bring to the table. My characters have already been created and I also have written a full season's worth of episodes. I have a team of professionals on stand-by, ready to dedicate about 3-5 months on creating my project to completion. I truly do not foresee any set backs or risks when it comes to the success of this project. Moreover, the animated film industry, the comedy genre, and the adult humor sub genre, all are as universally popular as they have ever been. It is only a matter of time before this becomes a hit and I want YOU to be able to say, "" I helped breath life into that show. """,https://www.kickstarter.com/projects/innovation101/deuce-badge-go-fund-yourself?ref=discovery_category_newest,innovation101/deuce-badge-go-fund-yourself,"Deuce Badge: Badass Detective is a 30 minute adult humored animated comedy series. Located in the fictional Hampton City, where crime is at an all time high, Detective Deuce Badge is it's only hope.This self proclaimed lady getting, heart breaking, ass kicking pretty boy has zero tolerance for evil and is determined to bring all lawbreakers tojustice. With the help of a supporting group off odd - but interesting - cohorts, Deuce will be sure to piss you off while protecting his city. Detective Deuce Badge is usually outwardly insulting, sometimes displaying moronic behavior with little to no regard for your feelings and or opinions.Just don't call him a douche bag!My name is Michael Zachariah White. Screenwriter and Creator of Deuce Badge: Badass Detective. I created Deuce Badge some years back with a dream of bringing him to life. Not knowing which avenues to take or what resources to utilize I found myself stuck in a deadend. For years, Deuce was nothing more than an idea...Until now!With your support I will finally be able to have my pilot script professionally animated with HD rendering and studio quality voice-overs from a team of talented voice actors. Your support will also fund my marketing campaign to TV producers and my entry into independent film festivals. I want to make this show a household hit and I want you to be apart of this journey.Elevator Scene Italian Musician, Alvin River","When it comes to fulfilling a promise, there are always potential risks to encounter. As an independent artist and amateur screenwriter, There's a huge chance I may not be taken as seriously by Agents and TV/Animation production companies. With that in mind, I became a registered writer with the WGA and have done extensive research on what it takes to be successful in this business. I feel that I have sufficient knowledge and a long list of legitimate resources to land this project into every independent film company in the industry. In conclusion, I believe the biggest obstacle I will face, is getting the world to fall in love with Deuce Badge: Badass Detective."

https://www.kickstarter.com/projects/reverseracism/air-space?ref=discovery_category_newest,reverseracism/air-space,"Recently in the news there has been a lot of hesitation on implementing UAS (Unmanned Aerial Systems) or drones that are changing how we live our lives. Every week on the news there are really great things going on; for instance how a civilian drone busted a company for dumping huge amounts of blood into a Texas' river.http://www.theblaze.com/stories/2012/01/24/civilians-drone-busts-plant-dumping-huge-stream-of-blood-into-texas-river/There are good uses to UAS other than journalism, for instance:1. Flora & Fauna  a) Tracking crops growth or fungus inspection  b) Tracking migration and population of deers2. Civil Engineering  a) Bridge inspections  b) Surveying3. First Responders  a) Damage assessment  b) Search and Rescue4. Real StateBut as there is good news there are also bad ones such as: the incident where an airplane almost hit a drone in mid air. http://www.cnet.com/news/plane-almost-hits-drone-in-mid-air-says-faaAlso in New York City there are issues with the authorities where drones can only be flown and landed on parks. http://news.yahoo.com/york-police-see-risks-drones-popularity-213453603.htmlThe intent on how they are use is what needs to be controlled not the drones themselves. Not every journalist has the good intentions as the hero mentioned above. For instance,there are going to be problems with paparazzi's who will use this technology to get pictures ofcelebrities private residences. And this is where the website comes into play. Most people don't know where to go in order to find out about drones or the laws and regulations that govern their use; or where they can be flown; my proposal is to launch an appand websitewith Google Maps and Zillow properties to allow people to opt for one or moreof the following:1. Fly over (Yes or No)2. Pictures (Yes or No)3. Video (Yes or No)4. Delivery (Yes or No)Furthermore, black out places that are already on the list such as:1. Five Mile radios from airports2. State and Federal Parks3. Heliports for HospitalsLastly, parks where flying drones is completely safe with time and dates.",The challenge we face is the ever changing regulations that the FAA (Federal Aviation Administration) imposes in an inexpedient manner. One way to overcome this challenge is to collaborate with them as soon as regulations change and give the FAA feedback from the community as a whole.,https://www.kickstarter.com/projects/reverseracism/reverse-racism?ref=discovery_category_newest,reverseracism/reverse-racism,"AboutThe reason why I started this fundraising campaign is because there is little empathy or understanding between different demographics. I am sure many of you will love to hear about the successful story of a film that address challenging topics. Some of the topics I will be addressing with this film are affirmative action, civil rights, reparations and welfare. Reverse Racism will be ready to be shown next year once we finish the filming in Berlin.Reverse Racism is a short film that brings together racism, discrimination, Mean Girls, A Nightmare on Elm Street, Roots and The Color Purple. The main focus will be to show racism from a different point of view, showing how the laws that we have, that make it a level playing feel for everyone, can affect the psyche of the people. This short film fits within millennial’s upbringing because millenials might have been exposed to toxic mindsets and not even realize it. This short film will certainly not be for the masses. It will be unique because I am bringing a lot of genres together for this project of passion. Ever since I started to write the script and work on the project, I've had a lot of support from my teachers and family members. I do believe that the excitement has to do with the story which is specially relevant to today's racism and xenophobic ideas that the United States is experiencing.As you can imagine, making this project come to life is ambitious. However, ever since I started working on it I have received the warmest support and honest feedback from everyone willing work with me on the project. I’m asking you to help me fund this film so that it can travel in the US and the world next year! Best,TonyIn a private school for the wealthy; arrives Emma, a new girl with a family background of political clout and extreme affluence. Ameera is a mixed girl who has experienced a lot by having traveled the world many times over. Both of the girls clash over their families upbringing, one is humble and has exceptional emotional intelligence and the other is spoiled in her upbringing. Discrimination, aggressions, emotions and mental states will be pushed to the absolute limits of social norms.ProducerTonyI am a film student who last year moved to Berlin, Germany. I have supported a plethora of school projects and small gigs for my classmates and friends. I am the man that loves to work (something I learned in my 16 years in the US Army) and is not afraid of long hours. My forte in this projects are bringing the right people together, writing and directing.EditorMartin, is a seasoned editor who has worked in the industry for nearly 12 years. He loves to coach, teach and mentor. He too is not afraid of working hard and he would love to make this film a reality. He has mentored us in the last 6 months in content creation.SoundChris is a music producer who has opened his studio and artists to produce the music for the film. Furthermore, he will oversee the creation of the music videos. Indie films could easily cost a couple million dollars to make. Fortunately, years of working as freelance video directors allowed us to hone our craft and learn how to make a lot with very little. We managed to refine our budget into the very minimum required to produce something as ambitious as this. We're not paying ourselves. Most likely everyone else involved will be working for far less than the industry standard, because we all fiercely believe in this project.This is a work of passion and every dollar you give will go directly on to the screen.Currently we're budgeting for a 15 minute long film. However, if we exceed our goal, we'll be able to assemble an even bigger team and deliver a longer and more visually rich and story with a lot of substance.Aug 2019 - Finalize Script, Storyboard and Budget Sep 2019- Marketing of Crowdfunding Oct 2019- Marketing Budget from Kickstarter Nov 2019- Casting + Scouting Dec 2019- Schedule all Equipment and Locations Jan 2020- Film + Music Feb 2020- Edit + Color Grade Mar 2020- Turn Final Project Apr 2020- Deliver all Funders their Products","The challenge that I face now is not being able to raise the  funds to get the permits and locations that the film needs. Which is a farm for the part of the story which takes place in the 1700's and a present day mansion. However, I am confident that people of my  generation and new organizers will be delighted to have this project  ready next year to counterattack the perceived notions. Furthermore, Reverse Racism is a very ambitious project. creating an indie film isn't  exactly easy. The good news is that we already have a very good base.  Many of my school projects were a great proof of concept to what we can accomplish with  literally no money. We have a great story already written, so that  eliminates a degree of worry right away. Over time we have accumulated a network of professionals such as  producers, editors, cinematographers & talent that we will  collaborate with for Reverse Racism. Also, throughout the last weeks  many passionate professionals have signed up - wanting to participate  and help us make Reverse Racism. Once we have crossed the hoop of  fundraising, we believe that it'll take us between 7 to 8 months to  finish the film. We will be documenting our progress and all the  project's milestones in the production diary so that our backers will  have full visibility to the progress being made."
