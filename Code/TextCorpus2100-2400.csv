We are a young couple from Hamburg, Germany.The main reason why we started this project in the first place was to find couples with similar interests.

By hand. It will be a challenge.The funding will go towards professional printing and watercolors costs, and the posters will be printed and painted as soon as the campaing is completed (so I hope it'll be sended on May 2017).I hope you like it! Have a nice day!","The biggest risk of this project may be the painting process. I'm not sure about the number of people that will help me with this, so I'm scared if I get 2000 - if it's that I guess it will take more time than expected.",https://www.kickstarter.com/projects/1619375534/seasonal-fruits-posters?ref=discovery_category_newest,1619375534/seasonal-fruits-posters,"Everyone has a favorite season and we have always thought that weather is something that define us emotionally a lot. Whatever it is what makes you feel good, autumn rain or summer sunshine, snow or blossom, there is a moment of the year when it comes true.This idea was the root of the project we have launched. Maybe we just give too much importance to weather but it really make difference in our mood if it is a rainy or a sunny day. So we have decided to make something that could remind us the feeling we get when our favorite season comes so we can get that feeling everyday.That is the reason why we have chosen the poster format, so you can hang it somewhere you can see it every morning and start the day with energy. We have decided to draw this cute little fruits because, in our opinion, the most graphic sign of that a season has come is when you go to the market and see the new season fruits.We have designed 4 different posters (a poster per season) with 4 little cute fruits on them.The original idea was to represent seasons by using colors and very schematic forms. But, during the process, we have decided add some seasonal fruits to each poster. While we were painting, we drew those cute faces (it was just a joke) on the fruits, and we really liked it, so here they are!The great thing of this project is that you can choose the season you like the most and get its poster, but if you don’t have a favorite season or you want the whole collection because you like the design you can get it for a really lower price.We really like the designs of the fruits so if we get some foundation goals we will produce pins and stickers with the fruits and you will get them for free with every poster you order.   We are a couple of Spanish graphic designers living in Madrid. We have run this project as the first one of a lot of ideas that we would like to make true, and we think that Kickstarter is the best way to do it.If founded, the posters will be produced in March and ready to be shipped in April. They will be rolled and packed in poster tubes, and send with tracking number so you will know where your package is whenever you want.","The only problems we can get would be with packing and shipping, because we have to negotiate the shipping prices and be really accurate with the size and weight of the packages. But we hope there will not be problems of any kind."
https://www.kickstarter.com/projects/1510592574/cancer-dog?ref=discovery_category_newest,1510592574/cancer-dog,"In order to address gender inequality in fiction, I wrote a play entitled Cancer Dogthat has an all-female cast of characters who discuss abuse, choice, and narcissism without relying on a male character as a catalyst for action. Amazing, right?BONUS: It's viciously funny and darker than a moonless night.Cancer Dogfeatures incredibly accessible themes (choice and narcisism), and an amazing line-up of talent both on and off stage.  Normally when I finish creating a play, I gather interest from actors that I know in the valley, find a venue, and produce the work on my own.  The shows go well, everyone gets paid, and in the end I parlay the press and reviews into productions in other parts of the country.This time I'm looking for help. With my resources being tied to my current endeavors with TSTMRKT, I'm unable to completely fund the project on my own. I want to avoid putting this on the shelf and hoping that someone else wants to take a chance on an absurdist play about a woman who wants to literally die for attention. WHAT'S THE MONEY FOR?I'm glad you asked. Unlike a lot of theater companies in this town, I actually pay my actors. I also pay for the venue, the set, the construction, and the advertisements. The total production costs, when the smoke finally clears, for a full run can easily reach 50k or more. This will be nowhere near that as this production will only run for three weekends (including an incredibly brief preview) and will take place at a small venue that will comfortably seat 90 people. We're not looking to be millionaires. I just want to tell this story properly, and take care of those helping me to create it. I've made the ""rewards"" for donating to the cause something with legitimate value. No ""thank you"" cards or ""thumbs up."" You'll actually get copies of the material, chauffeured car service, cocktail receptions, etc. I'll make it worth your while. Your participation will make this production as close to the vision I have as possible, which deserves a lot more than a ""thank you.""","There are many challenges in producing live theater, but I've crafted this play as to avoid any production headaches.  The entire thing happens on a single set, there are only three characters, and (despite the title) there are no animals involved.",https://www.kickstarter.com/projects/1510592574/tstmrkt-home-entertainment-system?ref=discovery_category_newest,1510592574/tstmrkt-home-entertainment-system,"The Home Entertainment SystemI wanted to create a collaborative art piece that could be enjoyed on multiple levels, incorporating my love of collage, the need to poke holes in preconceived notions, and utilizing the talents of the artists that I have worked with over the years. The resulting project is ""The Home Entertainment System."" H.E.S. is a limited edition vinyl record that touches all the nostalgic feels of radio theater, and the future with ""yet to be created"" content for an ever-expanding alternate universe of videos and performances that are linked to each copy. The idea is that the end user will purchase a copy which will include a digital key to unlock a portion of the TSTMRKT website filled with characters developed from the album. Music, film, and prose will further each story line started from the origin of the first needle drop on the album. This will only be released on vinyl and only 200 copies will be available.

We've already recorded most of the material and whether or not this secures funding, we are going forward with the project.  I'm not sure how most of these entitled, privileged punks acquire their funding, but we're pretty used to doing things on our own.  In fact, this is only the second time in 18 years we've ever opened up to the possibility of outsiders helping us to make what we want to happen actually happen.  We normally just fund everything ourselves and hope for the best. We've had 18 years of good fortune and we feel that the math lands in our favor on this project."

Passion. Faith.These three words echo the essence of Kansas City native, Justin Houpe’s, inspiration and artistic muse. With more than just a voice, but a vision for creating fresh and masterful music, Justin’s artistry boldly glorifies God without foregoing style or eclectic flavor. The second born son of a Bishop, Justin’s devout raising in the church undoubtedly played a considerable role in his initial captivation with music.Naturally drawing musical knack from both his father and mother, Justin discovered that his destiny being intertwined with singing, composition and all things harmonious would ultimately be inevitable.As a proud United States Army Veteran who served a tour in Iraq during Operation Iraqi Freedom, Justin’s passion for the power of music only flourished as he discovered just how significant melody could be for coping with the exertions of war. After completing 9 years of service with an honorable discharge, Justin returned home to the states and vowed to immerse himself into the professional development of his God-given musical talents.Influenced by the work of legendary greats such as Marvin Winans, Donnie Hathaway, D'Angelo, Anthony Hamilton, and Allen Stone just to name a few, Justin’s sound can best be described as soulful new age music that uplifts the soul while enriching the spirit.Preparing to release his debut EP late summer of 2016, Justin Houpe is an up and coming vocal sensation that music lovers, both Christian and mainstream will admire and artistically appreciate.What are my contributions be used for?First I want to say how grateful I am for every single dollar that you will be donating to my music!

So what if that includes sleeping in his car in between street races and beating back his loan shark.

Arson lexius is guilty, he already hates himself for bullying his childhood crush until he dropped out and now on their reunion he finds himself blackmailing Cory to stay with him.                All Arson wants is another chance but Cory needs a little more than an apology to forgive him. ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~                Lane Alkaev has for the last ten years been drinking himself into the grave, on the side of running the Russian mob, why? Because he inadvertently killed the boy he was arranged to marry. He never loved Bobby but he should have protected him better.

I'm Anthony/Popgoth and I'm a witch, tarot reader, digital artist, slight-astrologist, and a double scorpio. If you've followed me on my instagram or gotten one of my zines you'll know I love graphic design, and that I've been practicing tarot for almost ten years--actually by the time this kickstarter ends, it should officially be ten years??? What perfect timing! For a while now, I've been playing around with the idea of creating a tarot deck, but after talking to a few of my friends I've decided it's finally time!The Violet Visions Tarot is all about creating a deck for anyone who's been looking to find them in a tarot deck. It's a mixture of pop culture meets goth meets magick. I love the mixture of dark meets light, the duality, and I feel like generally (at least in my experience) it's always either one of the other, so I wanted to create a deck that was truly both. I also wanted to make sure that people of color were fairly presented as well as queer people, because, though there are some decks out there, there isn't enough.The cards will measure 2.75""Wx4.75""H, on300gsm professional quality card stock with blue core.The deck will have 22 Major Arcana cards and 56 Minor Arcana cards. The suits will consist of the traditional wands, cups, swords, and pentacles.The cards will come in a custom rigid box, a tuckbox to me isn't the most trustworthy place for a deck, and I want to make sure you have a safe space to hold your cards in case you don't want to go out and splurge on a tarot box.I am currently working on the companion book, which isn't a pamphlet, it's a full length tarot guidebook, which can be unlocked and added to the reward tiers depending on how far we surpass our goal.The funds raised by this campaign will be put toward printing, packaging, and shipping the initial print run. I'm aiming to get the first run of this deck out in march of 2018, as I am doing everything myself.The deck is fully completed, and now I'm just working my way through the majors in the book, as well as some tarot spells.Backer Requirements1.

One that has both influences from pop culture and goth culture, as well as the occasional dash of older esoteric imagery. I wanted to make a deck that featured people of all colors, genders(or lack thereof), and sexualities (as a queer person of color making sure that there's representation, especially within the tarot, which a lot of people just like me work with, is very important to me).

Once the money has been made I can send off the deck to be mass printed. By slating the ""launch date"" for the first run of shipping to march, it gives me enough time to personally oversee that all quality is to standard, once this is done, decks and backer prizes will be shipped out immediately; on a happier note, that means that if all is well early on the deck will be shipped out earlier and all backers will receive an updated time frame for shipping."

Probably cheesesteaks or the liberty bell. To someone who has lived here for all of their life, what represents Philly? Eagles.Phillies.Flyers.Sixers...and then probably cheesesteaks. There is no other city in the nation as die hard and passionate about their sports teams and their city. Here's the reason. Philadelphia is not a transient city, people who live here, grew up here, and they grew up here because their parents did as well. This is not LA or NYC where people come and go everyday, this is Philadelphia. You live here. The connection with the city is like no other, and in turn pride and passion follows. Naturally this passion and city pride is translated to competitive sports. These are the fans that praise hardworking athletes and boo ones that party all the time. Talk to a Philadelphian about any team, and you will have the most in depth conversation that you have ever had about sports, because you will be talking to someone who knows their team. Who lives for their team. This is someone who would die to see their team win a championship, and will erupt in tears when it happens in their lifetime (I witnessed this in 2008). That is what represents the city Philadelphia.I stood on the South St. bridge one night with my camera and peered across the Schuylkill river to see the gorgeous Philadelphia skyline. That night, I took multiple images of the skyline and stitched them together on my computer. With some tinkering on my computer, I developed digital art that I feel represents Philadelphians. The skyline to represent the city itself and the team's colors to represent the passion of those who live here. My goal is to bring my artwork to Philadelphians, but bring it to them in a medium that is a completed work. I forsee myself sitting at the Piazza (place to sell art) on Sunday's with my framed artwork for all to see, and hopefully make a few purchases. I am asking for a kickstart in order to frame a few of my renditions of the skyline, in order to sell my work. As you may notice, my prints that I offer are in odd sizes, which requires custom framing, and this in turn adds expenses that I do not have without your help and pledges. Your pledges will be utilized to print and frame my art at local shops in the city of Philadelphia and my goal is to have 5 framed and matted pieces for display. I will not be using online distributors, although they may be slightly cheaper. I feel that this is an important facet of the process of local art and wouldn't do it any other way. Your pledges will help support the passion of a local artist and the city itself. Thank you very much for your support in this process.Note: image quality has been decreased for online uploads and your prints will come from images of higher quality and resolution",,https://www.kickstarter.com/projects/731574241/pioneers-of-science-joseph-lister?ref=discovery_category_newest,731574241/pioneers-of-science-joseph-lister,"Joseph Lister is considered by the science and medicine community to be the father of modern surgery, mainly for his work with antisepsis. In his landmark paper, 'On the antiseptic principle in the practice of surgery' in 1867 he describes attempts at wound disinfection with the rudimentary compounds that they had during that time period. This paper was considered to lay down the foundation for the antiseptic technique and helped usher in the principles of instrument sterilization and in term, the development of modern surgical antiseptic techniques. These posters give homage to the great Joseph Lister, each in their own way. Each poster depicts Joseph with his grand sideburns and stern look, but also has the initial text of his 1867 paper scribed in the background. I figured that he needed a little bit of an update from the late 1800s and urbanized him a bit. Below him is text reading STERILIZE!, which he no doubt would have spray painted on every wall he could, if he had also been a graffiti artist as well.Available to you are each poster individually, or you can purchase them both. They come in the classic and urban designs, and you can choose whichever you like the best. Pending the success of this poster, I would like to embark on a poster series that encompasses many different pioneers of science that have fell out of the minds of everyday citizens, but were responsible for so much of the advancements that we have in the scientific and medical fields. People such as Marie Curie, Edward Jenner, and Alexander Fleming, just to name a few. I would like to create a poster series, and a fun poster series, to help us remember the advances that these great scientists made.Prints come in 18x24 matte stock print and will be signed and numbered.","Risks and challenges will be logistics of actual shipping the items, and garnering enough support for this project and ultimately the rest of the poster series."

I have almost all the tools I need to photograph, write and design the finished piece. I simply don't have the funds to get the work out to the right venues (i.e. bookstore and art galleries). Support for this important project would be greatly appreciated.","Though I can not foresee any challenges with completing my project, there are potential issues regarding ""cold feet"" of the participants in the project.

I am an art photographer living in the Hampton Roads area of Virginia. I am a graphic designer by profession and an art photographer by passion. I started experimenting with art photography more than 10 years ago and my fascination and concepts stem from my love of vivid colors, architecture, 80's pop culture and, most of all, the female form.As an art photographer with insomnia, though, Norfolk at Night spawned from night after night of walking the city streets and realizing that so many of the often-forgotten or hidden corners of the city would make great stages to juxtapose the female form. It is the kind of project that needs stealth and subtle uses of the spaces, often just a few feet away from passers-by and potentially prying eyes. But to pose the soft, curvy female form — sometimes the nude female form — in the cold, hard lines and lights of a cityscape yields some fascinating and eye-catching results. More than anything though, these night photographs of Norfolk are a love letter to a city I truly enjoyed living in and love to visit every chance I get. It is also very much a celebration of the beautiful, daring, amazing women who took this photojourney with me.The funds raised from this Kickstarter campaign will be used to print the first run of Norfolk at Night and make it available for purchase on Blurb and Kindle platforms, perhaps other formats as well. The finished art photography book is a 228-page collection of my nude- and non-nude concepts on the city streets of Norfolk after dark.","The fact that my project involves nudity in public places may pose a challenge to certain people viewing the book. But, ultimately I believe that will be overcome simply by the people seeing the project and realizing what the nudity represents artistically."

https://www.kickstarter.com/projects/chadlickey/affordable-point-of-sale-system?ref=discovery_category_newest,chadlickey/affordable-point-of-sale-system,"Opening a small business can be an overwhelming and expensive undertaking. One of the most crucialand expensive pieces is a quality Point Of Sale system. Whether retail, restaurant, or specialized services, the POS system can help to keep the details well managed and organized. It provides the tools to grow a successful business, ease of use and  maintenance for employees, and ultimately a quality experience for the customers. The downside, however, is that even at a “bare bones” capacity a quality POS can run upwards of tens of thousands of dollars.Born out of necessity for our own small business, this unique system is an intuitive, user friendly,  point of sale, accounting, inventory, and business reporting system available at an affordable price. With the ability to customize themes, upload logos, create and change custom buttons and tabs for quick and convenient access to items that are used most often, or even create custom discounts, loyalty programs, sales, and promotions it is as simple as dragging and dropping to customize your personal layout much like a smart phone is to your apps and contacts. It also sends accounting reports, inventory notifications, tracks and reports on customized sales trends, and provides personal logins with varying security levels of access (owner, management, sales, cashier, etc). Every transaction (including actions as simple as opening the cash drawer or checking inventory) is logged with what action was taken and by whom so there is never any confusion.  If we can get this off the ground and running, there is also the potential for online ordering, security/surveillance, social media maintenance, and so much more the possibilities are amazing.Our StoryI have always been fascinated with technology and have been in software for over 20 years (35 if you include the years spent growing up with my Commodore 64). The bulk of my experience (over 15 years) in C#.NET, I have also moved into Android and mobile technology. About 6 years ago my family and I decided to open a little toy shop in our small town. We spent pretty much all of our savings getting started with inventory, retail space, and the build out. Not being made of money, we tried to do as much ourselves as we could.After shopping around for a quality POS system at an affordable price with no luck, we decided that this to, would need to be hand built. Not knowing what we might need in the future, I began building the program dynamically so at any given point we could change what wasn't working to something more suitable. This POS was truly “user built”. We set up an old PC with a scan gun (which I programmed to make funny sounds when items were scanned. It always got a big giggle out of the kids checking out, haha!), and over time made many changes as we learned what our needs were.We even created a custom discount that for listeners of a local radio show that would advertise for us and a panic button that would contact authorities in case of an emergency. It wasn't pretty, but it was effective, and easy enough for our 8 year old to use. The business was happy, and I was happy to see my software making a difference in the real world!We had been successfully running the shop for about 3 years when my wife's mother was diagnosed with cancer. We decided to close up shop and move to be closer in order to care for her and our system got turned back into a PC for the family.Even after we no longer had a need for the POS system, I couldn't help but notice what technologies stores and shops were using. Always mentally making upgrades to the POS, a touch screen, mobile access, security logins (we never really needed them, it was all family run), and so much more. After a few of my friends ventured into small business ownership, we began talking about the issues they were having with accounting, inventory, security and the complicated, out of date systems that were available for outrageous prices.One friend, who owns a liquor store, has an outdated, gray screen, with unrelated codes that have to be memorized or kept in a notebook for look up at the counter, no inventory system, and no security. Another friend of ours running a food truck, was trying to use one of those smart phone services for credit payments. No, inventory, no accounting, no scanning, simply a payment system that kept track of credit card transactions and a cash box for cash transactions. She would have people cancel their orders when she went to run their cards for payment because customers didn't want their card numbers on her phone and had a difficult time keeping her cash straight. She had to buy a new system (for a fortune) to maintain a professional image and stop losing money. All this really got me thinking. If I could clean up our old POS, upgrade with new hardware, iron out the wrinkles, add custom features asked for by users and backers, and make it all self explanatory and intuitive, this could solve all of those problems, and there in no reason it couldn't be affordable.The finished system should be pleasant to look at, require very little training to use, be self explanatory, and follow your commands at the swipe of a finger. All I need is your help. TOGETHER we can make an AWESOME application!$3500 - Multiple Registers - be able to set up multiple registers that all run off of one 	inventory database.

This can be tricky without the proper equipment and the proper equipment can cost a fortune.This is a picture from our recent visit to Bingham Hill Cemetary near Fort Collins, Co.As a mobile software engineer I have been creating apps for years and watching the phones get smarter and smarter with every generation to the point that almost every piece of tech we might need for ghost hunting is available on most smart phones. After a little research I figured out how I could make an EMF detector with the compass sensor on my phone. Since an EMF detector is one of the main technologies needed I thought this would be a great starting point for a ghost hunting tool. I plan to pair the EMF detection with algorithms to help identify patterns in the readings from the phone. It will notify you if it detects odd patterns so you can take a picture and capture what the sensors are picking up. I might be able to make the picture taking automatic when it detects a pattern and have the phone take a burst of pictures to try and capture it. I think it would also be possible to create a network of phones all running the app that could communicate with each other and work together to try and capture a good picture or sound when something is detected. This is just the beginning. The end result would be a ghost hunter app that will use the inherent pieces of a smart phone ie. photo and video( for photographic evidence), high and low audio frequency (for evp evidence), and an emf meter, a temperature gauge, a light sensor, a proximity meter, motion detector, geo location, and a  barometer (to determine changing energy patterns) to create a complete tool, along with a network of users that can band together to share stories and findings to create a community of awareness.The sky is the limit on this. A smart phone can give us a lot of information about the environment around us. We just need to work together to figure out what is ""normal"" and what is paranormal.The first version will be Android with versions for other platforms available in the Stretch Bonus below.Stretch Bonus:$2500 - Automatic mode- be able to set the application to automatically take pictures when a certain 	sensor data algorithm is recognized.$3000 - Advanced Sensor Configuration - Create an interface so the user can adjust all of the settings of the available sensors on Ghost Hunter.$3500 - IOS Version - I will create an IOS app with nearly identical look, feel and functionality as the Android version. $4000 - Multiple Phones - Create a network of Ghost Hunter phones so you can see all of the environment data of multiple locations.$4500 - Windows Versions - I will create the app for Windows phones and OS with nearly identical look, feel and functionality as the Android version.",-figuring out the correct algorithm could be tricky.  It will take a lot of trial and error to get it so you don't get false positives and don't miss true positives no matter how subtle.-I haven't networked phones before.  I have networked computers and I don't think it will be much different.  I will have to research the best way to communicate between phones that will work for our needs.

This means that my products may not get out as soon as I'd like them to, but I'm willing to drop prices if I know I will not be able to complete a project by a promised deadline.",https://www.kickstarter.com/projects/475629214/woodworking-tools?ref=discovery_category_newest,475629214/woodworking-tools,"Woodworking is a passion of mine...actually, make that PASSION. It all started when I decided to make a beer pong table for my senior year of college. I was in a rush to get it done, but here's how it turned out:Pretty sweet right?? Soon after I made this table, I fell in love with wood working. I have made everything from long boards to tables. What I would really like to get into is intricate and very natural furniture. Here is a coffee table I'm currently making, minus the glass top.I plan to finish it with lacquer in order to give it a very shiny finish. I have many plans that I have yet to bring to reality. I want to build one-of-a-kind pieces that satisfy you, and anyone else that views them.So what do I plan to buy? Here are all the products I want to buy in order to take my woodworking to the next level:Planer- This would help me level out any wood that is scrap, or uneven. It will allow me to make perfect table tops, in little to no time. This will probably be the heaviest used machine of the bunch.Belt Sander- A belt sander is great for individual pieces of wood, and some bigger projects. I currently have a mouse, random orbital, and oscillating sander. All of which work well, but do not provide the versatility of a belt sander.Band Saw- A good band saw will allow me to rip boards of great length in half (or whatever the project calls for). Huge band saws are actually preferred for ripping timber apart, as compared to table saws. My operation will not be on that scale, but the accuracy, dependability, and versatility will still be there with a bench top band saw!DADO Blade Set- DADO Blades are unique because they allow blade width adjustment. These are used to make wide DADO grooves in wood. This is what it looks like:As you can imagine, this tool would be great for edging, grooving, and jointing wood.Router Table- A router table adds intricacy to any piece of wood. It is great for trim pieces, and allows the user to sculpt many different grooves into wood.Royal Kings Choice Carving Kit- This kit is very unique in the fact that it will allow me to carve out pretty much anything. I plan to use this kit to make bathroom vanity sinks, as well as grooved chair bottoms.Lathe- A lathe is great for carving wood in a stationary spot, at a high rate of speed. Most lathes are used to make bowls, and other intricately carved wooden projects.Kreg Jig- Finally I have listed a simple Kreg Jig set that would allow me to make perfect pocket holes every time! Sometimes I use pocket holes, and sometimes I use dowels. This jig would come in handy when it comes to hiding screws!Chainsaw Mill- This is a small attachment for a chainsaw that allows the user to mill logs down. This would be PERFECT for some of the ideas that I have. I plan to use to it rip off edges of logs and making live end furniture!Wood working is a passion of mine, and I would eventually like to turn it into a career. Taking on student loans, and other medical bills has only slowed down the process of me getting quality tools, I ask for a small donation, and to be prepared to be amazed.","There aren't many risks or challenges when it comes to woodworking. The challenges that I can foresee would be1. Not enough customers2. Not the right market3. Not enough manpower4. Delays on projectsI have the land for the wood I want, and a shop to build it in. If I must advertise and travel to sell goods, so be it!"

We've been growing and selling fresh hops to local craft breweries since 2015. The Central Virginia area, specifically the Shenandoah Valley, has a deep agrarianhistory. Thomas Jeffersoncultivated some of the first hops used in the production of beer in the United States, just miles from our hopyard.We started in 2015 with a single row of 60 hop plants. Based on their success we decided to expand an additional 600 plants last year in 2017. With the increase in our harvest volume we were able to support some new partnerships (craft breweries) and get real momentum behind our business. We hope with our 2018 expansion we'll be able to better support our current partners, and increase our harvest to develop new partnerships. We've been personally funding (""boot-strapping"") our business for the last 3 years, and our 2018 expansionplans exceed our ability to continue in this manner. With the funds provided by backers we intend to purchase the materials required to build the supporting trellis (i.e. wire, ground anchors, clips, turn buckles, posts), as well as the 1000+ plants.We have twomature partnerships with local craft breweries, andare in talkswith three othersregarding future collaborations. The hops planted this year will likely not mature enough to support beer production until next year's harvest (2019). That being said, this expansion will give us the ability to project harvest yields and solidify future support with local brewers. Our area is really moving towards locally sourced ingredients, in both food and craft beer. We've been working with other local hop farmers, attended the South Atlantic Hops Conference (https://www.facebook.com/events/334610643651422/), and joined the area hops coop (https://www.facebook.com/groups/OldDominionHops/), to ensure that we'reimplementingthe leading industry best practices and growing standards.We not only work topromote hops to local buyers, but also provide mentorship to new farmers. Leveraging knowledge from the area hop coop and specialists at conferences, coupled withourexperience growing hops over the last three years,we're able to plan for the utilization ofbacker funds in the most effective manner. These funds will allow us toseamlessly orchestrate our expansion, without making sacrifices due to the limitation of funding. We're really excited aboutour successes, and our plans for growth. We also have plans to host beer and craft festivals at our hopyard, the first being this fall just before harvest time (mid-late August), where we can showcase our hopyard and promote local craft breweries (and maybe develop future partners). This festival will serve as another means of income for the business and be of little cost (porta-potties, entertainment). We're also working to develop a series of logos to support our social media presence, but also for usein a small line of merchandise (t-shirts, hats, koozies, etc). We plan to offer this line through social media, as well as at local festivals to help promote our operation.","The major risks associated with growing hops on the East Coast, specifically Virginia, are combating fungus, pests, and drought. With the funds provided by backers, we'll have the ability to pre-order the substances, and install the fertiagation (irrigation system with the ability to add fertilizers in-line) systems required to mitigate these risks. Additionally, processing hops post-harvest is a challenge for farmers in our area. But last week our county approved the construction of a full-scale hops production facility, sponsored by Greenmont Hopworks (http://www.nbc29.com/clip/14037065/greenmont-hopworks-looking-to-build-hops-processing-facility), one of the farms we work most closely with. We also plan on using some of the funds provided by backers to construct an Oast (hop drying machine), to dry all of this years harvest in whole leaf form for long-term cold storage.",https://www.kickstarter.com/projects/489165451/running-cedar-hopyard-expansion?ref=discovery_category_newest,489165451/running-cedar-hopyard-expansion,"We're a small East Coast hopyard based in Central Virginia, growing hops for use in local craft beers. This year we consolidated our two small hopyards into a single 1.25 acre yard, where we'll be growing cascade, chinook, nugget, and crystal hop varieties. We plan on further expanding our yard to a total of 2 acres, but we need new equipment to construct the trellis system (i.e wire, poles, clips, irrigation line, and ground anchors). Unfortunatly, our small size and limited revenue makes it very difficult to gain access to the capital (i.e. loans) we need to accomplish this, so we need your help!We've recently sourced venders for our stickers, hats, patches, as well as a taylor. The image bleow is an example of the patches (the stickers look just like the patches) we've made, and how we've applied them to our trucker hats. These are the hats we'll be providing as rewards to donors. We intend to work with our partner breweries for retail shelf space, as well as host vender stands at local farmer's markets and festivals. In addition to our line of apperal, we will be selling our line of hop-based products (i.e aroma saches, infused soaps, and candles). We're also planning on producing and selling hop water, a carbonated water beverage, infused with our hops and lemon-lime juice.","This is a relatively low-risk project, but we need your help to gain access to the capital we need to get started! We've created prototypes for our patches, stickers, and hats (see posted image), and have the processes established to produce the apparel."

More than three thousandyears ago the indigenous people in what is now the State of Oaxaca began tocultivate plants to augment hunting, fishing and gathering. The most important of thesewas corn which formed the basis of their diet and, with the addition oftomatoes, beans, chile and squash, developed into a richly varied and deliciousregional gastronomy. Thus the gods andgoddess involved with water and corn were vital amongst the hagiarchy and thetribute to them was lively and colorful celebration of the music, dance andproducts of the people.When the Spanish arrived inOaxaca 1521 they converted all of the indigenous people and imposed thecatholic religion. One of the tacticswas to “convert” to Catholic ways the deeply rooted customs honoring pagan beliefs.The Spanish also introducednew products and techniques which result in changes to lifestyles andtraditional dress. Where before textileswere made from cotton, now you will see silk, wool, and glass bead in theclothing of the delegations to the Guelaguetza. It is impossible toadequately describe the heart-stirring beauty of this spectacle in its jewelsetting – the music, the color, thevivacity of the participant.",,https://www.kickstarter.com/projects/1914577955/guelaguetza-2014?ref=discovery_category_newest,1914577955/guelaguetza-2014,"Guelaguetza a Zapotec Language (Indigenous group/tribe South Mexico) signifying offering sharing or giving, Guelaguetza was the term used to describe the ceremony and celebration held each year to propitiate the gods in return for sufficient rain and a bountiful harvest.  The Guelaguetza event, is were folks from the eight (8) regions of Oaxaca (Cañada, Coast, Isthmus, Mixtec, Papaloapan, Southern Sierra, Sierra Norte, and the Central Valley) would come together and demonstrate what the state of Oaxaca has to offer, its cultural, tradition and ways of living.    La Guelaguetza has been celebrated in the state of  California for over 25 years. In Bakersfield the event has been celebrated for 8 years and hopping that this would stay as an annual event for the general community of Kern County. ","As an organization the biggest risk that we have every year is the cost of our annual event.  Every year the event gets bigger and it’s more the cost that we have to make up for.  Contributions plays a big roll to continue with our annual events.  Since our Guelaguetza is organized with the intention to have community members, children’s, organization groups and elders to participate our event.

Sadly, they couldn't BUT instead they could help turn my novel into manga or a video game! :DI know of course, it will be very expensive to do this so :( I don’t really mind if I do not reach my target (it is a lot) but whatever pledge I get, it will help me to self publish & order books for sales.If you’d like to check out my website or hit me up on Facebook, you’re more than welcome to.www.facebook.com/Pirawolfquartet",https://www.kickstarter.com/projects/jaynekennett/pirawolf-help-bring-it-to-life?ref=discovery_category_newest,jaynekennett/pirawolf-help-bring-it-to-life,,I am hoping to reach my goal which will help pay for the costs which will help bring my novels to life.

Brytnie's Beloved: Military focuses on military vets. From World War II to today's war in Afghanistan, these heroes faced battle and have their scars. These stories will be put into a photo book and calendar in order to share the stories, provide hope to others, and show something motivational.These funds will go towards props, locations, wardrobe, and even body paint to help create the photo of their dreams. Allow these military vets a chance to share their stories.","People's stories are always happily accepted. I'm hoping to show beauty in everyone, no matter their story. But, I don't know what all these stories will entail and many could be controversial. I will step up and face any controversy that comes up, giving my support to Brytnie's Beloved and the stories they share.",https://www.kickstarter.com/projects/1761415541/365-days-of-tsum-tsum?ref=discovery_category_newest,1761415541/365-days-of-tsum-tsum,"I love finding unique ways to teach people things. As a photographer, I got frustrated with photo subjects not showing up and projects falling apart. To combat this, I'm doing photos with Tsum Tsum stuffed animals as the subjects.There are 31 different themes (listed below). For the entire year of 2017, each day a new photo will be released. With each photo, a certificate of authenticity has been included that tells part of the story behind the photo.With themes ranging from fun and silly to serious, here are a few examples.These are just three of the photos being released in January. Along with a fun photo, they come with Certificate of Authenticity that teaches more about the photo and provides some little known facts.I love this project because it's just dedication and taking the time to do it. Some need unique props and there's a lot of time (about 3-4 hours) put into each photo, but it's something I have such a passion for. I've spent a month organizing the 31 themes and 365 days. I've provided some bonus photos throughout the year. For example, on the 13th of the month, a new photo about a superstition will be released. Throughout the year, there will be 13 (not 12) superstitions released. Mid-year I will release 2.So here's my 31 themes and what you could learn more about throughout 2017 in a fun, creative way.1 - Famous Historical Photos2 - Songs3 - Death Penalties4 - Zodiac Signs5 - Mental Illnesses6 - Urban Legends7 - Rare Diseases8 - Greek & Roman Gods & Goddesses9 - Celebrities & Shows10 - Death Practices11 - Original Fairy Tales12 - Serial Killers13 - Superstitions14 - Movies15 - Dumb Ways to Die16 - Super Powers17 - Addictions18 - Famous Paintings19 - Prison Escapes20 - Religions21 - Freak Show Performers22 - Inventions23 - Decades24 - Stereotypes25 - Dream & Nightmare Interpretations26 - Old Wive's Tales27 - Phobias28 - Countries29 - Torture Techniques30 - TV Shows31 - Seven Deadly SinsThank you so much for taking the time to check this out and help. It is all greatly appreciated!","The biggest challenge is going to be getting discouraged. I don't have to rely on others for this project, which has been a road block in prior projects. I've gotten a head start on this project and a support system for reminders not to give up. 365 days is a long time, but so far I'm loving the outcome and hope to teach some interesting things to people of all ages. That should give motivation if things ever seem slow.I also know that realistically posting one a day can be a challenge. Sickness happens, tragic events, life in general, or even just things like computer malfunctions. I'm hoping by staying ahead of the game I'm prepared for this. Should I miss a day, I will let everyone know what circumstances are and provide more than 1 photo the following day."

And we want that something to be personalized, and if it is educational, then this is just perfect!After creating an account on the website, there will be different options to organize what I call ""educational treasure hunts"", for one person or a group of people.There will be different costing options.For one person, not including gift provision (gift at the discretion of the organizer), the treasure hunt organisation will cost $20AU for a single day hunt, and $40AU for a several days hunt. Several parameters will be configurable, to help decide how long the treasure hunt should run, how many gifts will be offered, we can offer an option to provide the gifts for an extra cost as well, as well as an option to specify the theme of the treasure hunt: eg learning mathematics treasure hunt!Treasure hunts can also be created for several people - and they would have to work together to get the gift/gifts. For up to 5 people, the treasure hunt for a single day will cost $40AU, and for several days $60AU.For the scope of this project, only the ""mathematics learning"" theme will be offered, but we are aiming to increase the scope later on, to offer options to educate kids in many different domain, as well as older kids!","Not seeing much risk in term of possibility to complete the website. Technically, this is feasible and I've been building similar websites for quite some time now (you can learn more about my website in the about me section).

I am aiming to create something similar to help people learning mathematics, but not limited this time to French-speaking kids!I am aiming to build Maths'Fun, website on which parents, teachers and kids can register. Parents can create an account and add their children, so they can follow the progress of the children. Teachers can add students. Kids can decide to register as well and play for themselves.While following the progress, teachers and parents can see how often their children play and where they are having difficulties, or even challenge them by asking them to look at particular chapters and levels.Players have a number of credits they can use each day (what we want is for kids to come back to play every day, as to learn something efficiently, the secret is in practicing often a little bit every time). Every time they play the games and answer correctly, players accumulate points.The gamification part that attracts children is in the fast that once they have accumulated enough points, players can then exchange their points against gifts of their choice. A list of selected gifts (parents and teachers can review first and decide which ones their children can or cannot see) if made available to players to choose among.So... ready to learn mathematics? Support my project!TIMELINEI am aiming to have the interface for the players and parents to register in October.By November, the teacher and student interfaces will be done as well.","The biggest risk is more regarding the timeline to get as many games as I wish on the website. Lots of games will need to be adapted from my previous website (https://anglais-fun.com) to mathematics instead of English.I am ready for the challenge and really motivated to work on this project, and ready to learn more about web development if needed!Even if the timeline is tight, I am aiming to complete this project and have something up and running people will be able to use."

I grew up in California where I never saw much of it because we had clean up crews there. My friend Myron was riding in the car with me when we saw a raccoon that had been ran over and I felt so bad for it. Myron said he wanted to take a picture of it, I replied ""Why don't I photo bomb the poor lil guy"" I wasn't really going to lay down next to it, but Myron dared me to and I just don't ever turn down a dare. So there I was feeling terrible for this animal and taking a ""selfie"" with it. the picture came out so good we decided that we could make Calenders and post cards and sell them. My parents own a lot of property so I figured after taking a picture with these poor animals I could dispose of them humanly and properly so that they would stop getting ran over. So here I am, taking pictures with dead animals for the world to see and then giving them a proper burial. Crazy story I know... but HEY, I'm bored and crazy myself, so why not clean them up after I take some pictures with it. ","It is very dangerous to lay in the middle of a street or highway, just to get a picture and clean up its body. So I have two friends Myron and Kortney who look for cars for me and then help me dispose of the dead animals before I myself become road kill. Sometimes it rains and the pictures are more difficult to take so it also helps having my friends there with an umbrella.

Brody teleports back to his lab and makes this crazy looking potion. He teleports back to the mall and says to the criminal ""don't worry, i'm on your side, drink this"". The criminal drinks it and becomes a bag of Marijuana. Brody takes out the ""take your superpower"" bong and smokes it. Brody then ""erupts"" and takes the super-powers away from the criminal and now Brody has the big metal guns.",1. Storyline 2. Vocals 3. Animation 4. Production 5. Music 6. Editing 7. Q&A

Amidst a house move, family illness and money troubles, Rosie struggles to make sense of it all.'Rosie' is a short drama film which explores a young girl’s first steps into the difficult field of change. She loses family, her home and her sense of stability. The story explores young resilience and adaptability.And we need your help to make this film possible! We will be entering 'Rosie' in LifeTime's shorts competition, celebrating the work of women behind the camera. LifeTime have teamed up with A+E Networks' global initiative, Broad Focus, which aims to find, develop and mentor future talent in the entertainment industry, with a specific focus on women. With your help we will be able to make and enter 'Rosie' in LifeTime's shorts competition - and if our film wins it will be broadcast by LifeTime on daytime TV. Note from the Writer/Director - Jodie Woodall: 'Rosie' is a film that began as a challenge to meet a set of criteria for a university project, but has since evolved into so much more. The characters have gained a life of their own and have a story and narrative arc that broke beyond the initial writing challenge that was set.The story is, at its core, about just how perceptive children are and alive to the troubles of adults even when they may not fully understand. It deals with themes that are in many ways universal; memory, upheaval and stress on the family dynamic.Producer - Adele Britnell: I really loved Jodie's idea for the script, and I am extremely happy to be working on the project. The film has a number of challenges, however I am confident that we can tackle these. And I am looking forward to working with the cast and crew on our entry for the LiveTime Shorts competition. Director of Photography - Alex Beighton: 'Rosie' is told from a child's perspective and I'm very excited to experiment with different styles of film making in order to communicate this. Essentially, the audience will understand the world around them through a child's eyes","'Rosie' is an off-course project which students from the University of Westminster have volunteered to work on. We want to do the very best that we can, however if we don't meet the funding requirements this won't be possible. There are a number of challenges in the script, including working with a child actor, which we are confident that we can tackle. However, the more money we raise the easier these challenges will become.Thank you for taking the time to read through our kickstarter - we hope you can help us make 'Rosie'!",https://www.kickstarter.com/projects/1755147896/kiss-the-devil-short-film?ref=discovery_category_newest,1755147896/kiss-the-devil-short-film,"A young book cover illustrator, Sarah, begins her darkest project yet, Kiss The Devil. Finding difficulty in understanding the book and creating a design, she struggles to maintain the affection and support of her indifferent husband, Mark. Her obsession with the book increases and she slowly becomes aware of its allusions to a greater threat within her life. Her mind turns towards a state of anxiety, isolation, and madness, and emotions that were once suppressed now threaten to break out in dangerous ways.Kiss The Devil is a 20 minute psychological drama, which uses the medium of horror to explore Sarah's mindset. It is our final graduation film at the University of Westminster, and we are currently in the middle of pre-production; working on rehearsals, shot-lists, buying all the props and costumes we need, making sure we have all the camera & lighting equipment to shoot the film, and so on.A lot of exciting things are happening but to make this film possible we need as much help as we can get!We are really excited to be working with two wonderful actors, Siân and Andrew, in the roles of Sarah and Mark. Both actors attended the Oxford School of Drama and have appeared in a number of short films already. Rehearsals are currently underway in preparation for the shoot.Sarah is a complex character, a book cover illustrator whose mind wanders between fantasy and reality. She married Mark six years ago and had a happy relationship but being forced to move away from her family and friends because of his job resulted in her becoming more reliant on her husband. His current neglect of her confines her to a state of isolation and she reminisces on the love they once shared. However it is this dwelling that compromises her power to escape her deteriorating relationship. There is a power in Sarah, bubbling away; a power, though compromised by routine, that we see beginning to surface in order to escape the relationship in a dark and dangerous way.Mark boasts a successful job in air traffic control, though his head is as far into the clouds as the planes he helps fly. He occupies a complacent state of ignorance towards Sarah’s psychological plight. He sees her problems as more of an inconvenience to him rather than a burden to her, not out of hatred or spite, but rather thoughtlessness and arrogance. We have here a passive antagonist, the kind with a confidence in his morality; he is the hero of his own film.We have a team of 30 people working on Kiss The Devil - including a group of budding 2nd years who are joining the crew to help us out! Our team has worked on a large number of projects, both at University and on professional shoots and are dedicated to making Kiss The Devil the best film that it can be.""I'm really interested in Sarah's character, and am really excited to tell the story of her struggling with her relationship and her own inner turmoil. While the film is based in reality, we are using the horror genre as a medium to really get into the character's head. The film will show her mental instability with the use of dreams and visions, exaggerating Sarah's mental state and creating a sense of anxiety within her life. I love being involved at every stage of production, especially in a project that I am passionate about, from our current development of the script and search of locations and actors, to the shooting of the film, and to the editing and finishing touches to colour and sound. I really think this is going to be an amazing film, one that I'll be proud of having made, and one that I hope everyone will enjoy"" - Dylan, the Director.We will be contributing our own money to Kiss The Devil and we will also receive support from the Quintin Hogg Fund at the University of Westminster. However due to the size of the project we still require outside donations to make the film the very best it can be. A large proportion of our budget will be spent securing the right location for Kiss The Devil, which is a large, countryside house. The location is one of the most important aspects of the film, as the entirety of Kiss The Devil takes place inside one house. We have secured a location near London, which not only works for the style of the film and its story, but is also large enough to accommodate the crew and cast. We will be renting the location for nine consecutive days, which is of course going to be expensive, andthe money from our Kickstarter will help cover a part of this cost. We do believe that the style and size of the house will benefit the story of the film greatly.Now that we have secured the perfect location for the film, the Art Department team will need to dress the house and purchase specific props to meet the requirements of the script. It will also be necessary to source costumes for the characters and experiment with practical effects - such as sugar glass and blood. As a result, a high percentage of the budget will be reserved for the Art Department to make sure that the location, and the overall finish of the film, looks as authentic and professional as possible.Since we are shooting on an Arri Alexa, which our University has access to for free, our camera budget is lower than usual for a short film. However to fit with our vision for the film we plan on renting out various pieces of camera and lighting equipment.We will be using a camera jib to achieve some bird's-eye-view shots and a steadicam to create an anxious and unsettling dream sequence at the beginning of the film.We will also be renting out a good zoom lens so that the camera can slowly zoom in on Sarah to emphasise her focus and obsession and allow the audience to connect with her in her times of mental unrest.This camera equipment is expensive but we have been doing test shoots and photographic storyboards, so we know that we will be using the money to help add to the story and have it fit our vision.Our Kickstarter will be updated regularly with our process, keeping you in the loop with how pre-production and shooting are going. All of our backers will also receive a list of exclusive rewards - such as an annotated script from the director, a behind the scenes video of the film, a poster, a DVD/blu-ray, and more!You will also be able to find us on our Kiss The Devil - Short Film Facebook page and Twitter account. ","As our final project at the University of Westminster, we want to make our graduation film the very best it can be, however this doesn't come without its challenges. Over the last three years we have worked on a number of projects at University, which has developed our skills as filmmakers and has taught us valuable lessons in overcoming unforeseen issues.Throughout our pre-production process we have been having tutorials and discussions with industry professionals, including camera/lighting workshops with Kit Fraser (DoP of the BAFTA winning short film 'Under the Shadow') and a directing workshop with Oscar winning director Asif Kapadia (Amy, Senna).We promise our backers that Kiss The Devil will be an enjoyable and high-quality film, which will demonstrate the crew's hard work and passion for the project!Thank you for reading through our Kickstarter - we hope that you can help us make Kiss The Devil."

I will also use the money to build a small working proof of concept and I will share all the results (videos and photos) and evidence with the world over the internet. I would also like to start a gravity energy revolution and inspire anyone who sees my work to become involved.  My goal is to provide a solution to the problem; over 2 million metric tons of pollution are released into the air each day.Magnetic Siphon Gravity EngineBy: Nicholas David CalvanoAbstract: Magnetic Siphon Gravity Engine (MSGE)A machine which relates to fluid circulation in a closed system based on liquid density (specific gravity); an electric generator powered primarily by the force of gravity, and continuous motion due to earth’s gravity.  The purpose of this invention is to provide a novel, non-obvious and useful method of converting gravity energy into available electric current (an electric generator).  Gravity energy, specifically meaning: the force which acts upon matter (energy) causing it to be pulled down (centrally) due to mass and thereby the curve (constriction) of space-time. Consider: all mater is in a state of constant and perpetual motion; additionally a multiverse (quantum universes) may indicate exceptions to entropy.Background:In my work on the MALC ((Magnetically Attracted Liquid Circulator) invention) (which (converts magnetism into electricity)) I have learned many useful techniques that I will carry forward into my new invention Magnetic Siphon Gravity Engine also known as MSGE.  In my invention MALC, a series of permanent neodymium magnets, attracts and drives Ferrofluid to a lifted elevation and then to fall under the force of gravity and thereby rotate a turbine and induce electromagnetic field in a conductor. My new invention (MSGE) will use the force of gravity to drive mixed fluids based on their own specific gravity (density) relative to each other.  The term buoyancy means that a particle of lower density will float or rise up due to the force of gravity in a liquid of higher density.  For example a particle of iron will fall in a liquid such as air due to the force of earth’s gravity, because iron is denser than air.  If we look closely at this example we can find that the air below the iron moved up as the iron moved down.  My invention, Magnetic Siphon Gravity Engine, makes use of this principal which was recorded by Archimedes of Syracuse Sicily, in approximately 260 BC and is known as Archimedes Principal.  Over the past 2,200 years there have been countless inventions based on Archimedes work but to my knowledge none of them have successfully produced a perpetual motion machine.  My goal is to produce the world’s first perpetual motion machine which harnesses earth’s gravity to produce a continuous motion and fluid circulation and electric generator utilizing the forces of gravity and electromagnetism.        As for those who would say this machine violates the second law of thermodynamics, I say to you: gravity energy is in the system; and thereby can become useful work without breaking any of the laws of thermodynamics.  Gravity works to make order out of chaos; Maxwell’s demon is gravity.I see this invention as a gravity powered circuit, based on theories by Newton and Einstein.Summary:The main idea of this invention ((Magnetic Siphon Gravity Engine) MSGE) is to continuously circulate one or more liquids in a closed system and generate electric current from this motion.  This motion is due to the liquids differences in densities and gravity (buoyancy).  Some of the details have been left intentionally vague by example and not by limiting scope.  This invention mixes four (4) (or more) liquids of different densities in stages so that gravity will do useful work.  The main components include four liquids of different densities: liquid 1, Water, H2O, 1.0 g/cm3 ; liquid 2, Perfluorohexane, C6F14, 1.7 g/cm3 ; liquid 3, Ferrofluid, (oil based EFH3, gauss 660) 1.42 g/cm3 ; liquid 4, air, (O2, 0.001 g/cm3).  These liquids will be in volumetric flux and thereby are and must be immiscible with each other so that they will behave in the predetermined way continuously.  The water will start movement from a water reservoir and travel through three liquids in order: Ferrofluid, Perfluorohexane, air and then returns to the water reservoir.  The water reservoir is large and may focus the waters pressure onto the Ferrofluid semipermeable barrier.  MSGE regulates the density of liquid 3, Ferrofluid, using an electromagnet to create a semipermeable one way smart valve ((buoyancy valve) and/or (density pump based on specific gravity)) allowing only small water particles (of low density (liquid 1, H2O, 1.0 g/cm3)) to pass through (tunneling) in a generally upward direction (due to buoyancy, pressure head, and induced electromagnetic field density of Ferrofluid) (constricting the larger Perfluorohexane, C6F14 1.7 g/cm3, from moving downward).  This is achieved while maintaining the location of the Ferrofluid (iron does not fall under the force gravity) by attracting it with an electromagnetic field which may be similar to a torus (counteracting the force of gravity).  The electromagnetic attraction will be applied to a plurality of insulated conductive metal screens which are submerged in the Ferrofluid and regulate its density (viscosity).  Thereby the Ferrofluid section becomes porous controlled by variable voltage and precipitates percolation of H2O into the C6F14 while not allowing C6F14 to fall below (back flow) the Ferrofluid.  The Ferrofluid section may have space allowing for displaced Ferrofluid to be stored while water is passing through.  Only the Ferrofluid should have a gauss rating (magnetic responsiveness) greater than one (1), as to prevent the Electromagnet from attracting the other liquids.  The second liquid, Perfluorohexane (C6F14, 1.7 g/cm3) will serve as a lifting medium (based on buoyancy) for liquid 1, Water ((H2O, 1.0 g/cm3) (after it passes through the Ferrofluid)) and will sit on top of (above) the Ferrofluid.  The pressure of the Perfluorohexane may be minimized from directly pressing the Ferrofluid semipermeable barrier by means of a plurality of polarized carbon nanotubes shaped to allow the flux of H2O molecules to move freely (capillary action).  These carbon nanotubes are designed to function as a “molecular keyhole” approximately one nanometer in width; this keyhole is too small for a molecule of C6F14 to squeeze in or backflow (supporting the pressure of the C6F14).  The carbon nanotubes will be imbedded in hydrophobic surfaces which will separate the C6F14 intocompartments (chambers), of progressively reduced pressures (height); with the highest pressure compartment closest to Ferrofluid section.  Thereby gravity and the buoyant force will drive the H2O through the C6F14 compartments.  In this method the water reservoirs pressure (gravity) on the Ferrofluid section, is greater than, the pressure in any other sections or compartments and consequently is the driving force of the system.  This process may be aided by one or more Tesla Valve and/or parasitotic pumps to create a siphon (partial vacuum) within the C6F14 compartments.  The C6F14 compartments may have space allowing for displaced C6F14 to be stored while H2O is passing through.  After the H2O passes the lifting stage it will reach an elevated point where it will collect and spill over into a fourth section of liquid air (O2, 0.001 g/cm3).  A large volume of air will be used to allow for a dynamo stage (falling section of H2O) under the force of gravity; utilized to rotate a turbine and induce electromagnetic field in a conductor.",There are many risks involved in working to build a real free energy generator that can be validated by scientists from around the world.  Some people might think it is crazy to try to shake the worlds understanding of physics and thermodynamics.  I am not certain that I have or ever will invent a method of converting gravity energy into electricity; however I have found great happiness in leaning everything there is to know on the subject.
https://www.kickstarter.com/projects/1784219487/harmatia?ref=discovery_category_newest,1784219487/harmatia,"What would you be funding?A feature length horror film titled Harmatia.It is a slasher horror tragedy with meshing styles that tip it's hat to acclaimed horror directors such as Alfred Hitchcock, Bernard Rose, John Carpenter, and James Wan.The film is about a woman who was a teenage rape victim. She was impregnated by the rapist and regretfully had a late-term abortion. 30 years later, while trying to ""move on"" and live a normal life, she finds out the child is still alive and coming after her.Harmatia is a groundbreaking story that will add something fresh to the slasher horror genre; Humanity. While it is a violent film, it never glorifies murder, gore, or make light of it. All the characters in this film, including the killer, are portrayed in a way to where the audience can relate to them emotionally. You'll want to laugh, cry, cheer on, and be anxious with these characters. These are human beings, not objects to entertain us by seeing what unique and sick ways they can be killed off.Why should you fund it? 1) The movie is scary as hell! This has potential to be one of the scariest movies of all time. There have been cases during casting where the actors couldn't even finish the script because they were too disturbed and had nightmares. They had to withdraw from the project.2) You would be helping to support talent equality in film. We are inclusive of actors and crew members with disabilities. A large portion of this film depicts Deaf people in prominent roles. There is an unfortunate norm in the film industry: Hearing actors are usually always cast for Deaf roles in films in order to avoid the ""inconvenience"" of having to communicate on set with the Deaf actors. Many great and capable Deaf actors are ignored because of this and gives them an unfair disadvantage. Our film is casting authentically Deaf talent to play all of these roles. We have some exceptional and criminally underrated talent for this film.3) Support independent film!   ....I know that is cliche, but it's still true!","This film brings up very touchy issues such as rape and abortion. We make sure to stay within the realm of decency and never make light of these situations, nor do we blow it off as ""eh, whatever, it's a nice plot twist."" We understand how sensitive this subject is and should be approached with caution.Once the film is completed, the most daunting task will be getting the film out to the mainstream and big festivals...and making a profit in the process.We believe we can accomplish this through different means:1) We will have an instant built-in audience from the Deaf community and actors with disabilities. It is very uncommon for a feature film like this to showcase Deaf talent like this and portray Deaf characters in a way that isn't gimmicky or a ""sympathy"" story.2) We have ""next-level"" talent on all three phases of the production: A great script and casting (Pre-Production), talented performers in the cast/crew (Production), and a great editing and marketing team (Post-Production)3) A story of this caliber that is so original and innovative, yet scary as hell and compelling is bound to succeed.",https://www.kickstarter.com/projects/1784219487/blame-the-victim?ref=discovery_category_newest,1784219487/blame-the-victim,"Blame the Victim is a short drama about a very big and muscular man, Bishop, who is being psychically, emotionally, and verbally abused by his petite pregnant wife, Macy.Bishop is trapped in this relationship because he loves her, has been manipulated to believe that he won't be able to last without her, and they will be having a child together.Not only must Bishop survive his wife's abuse, but also survive societal standards that overlook and even mock his situation of female-on-male domestic abuse. ""Haha! He just needs to man up!"", people will say.Even worse, people may actually blame HIM for the domestic disturbances since the majority of the cases favor the female in the situation, even if she was the main perpetrator.The core purpose of this film is to shed light on the reality of female-on-male domestic abuse and how it is more common and serious than our society makes it out to be.We will be sending this to the major festivals like Sundance, Cannes, SXSW, etc. along with some activist outlets.We have our cast & crew already set. The script is complete. The only thing we are need of now is the budget to bring this idea to reality! You would be donating to a great cause and a great film that you can tell people you contributed to!","This film does not hold back on it's content. It will be very violent with a lot of vulgar language. This may cause controversy and may cause people to feel too uneasy about the project.

Personally for me as the key ideator and artist, the project holds tremendous emotional value which I wish to share with my team as well as my valued patrons.Before introducing my dream project, I'd like to briefly introduce myself, the team, and the journey that led to its production and way forward.""Havenfall"" is originally designed by a two-man team: myself - Navid F Rahman, an aspiring concept writer and graphic novel artist from Toronto, Ontario; and Fahim Md Mahfuzur Rahman, a gifted novelist with an affinity towards the fantasy genre.The idea for the graphic novel, originally titled ""Fade"", struck me a year after my daughter was born. By the time she'd turned 2, I thought of illustrating a story as a dedication to her. As usual, I decided to base my tale off-world, on a fictional remote planet. The story revolved around the journey of a father and his only daughter across savage, unforgiving environments to find a cure for a plague. Although the story itself bore no resemblance to any persons living or dead, the concept is of high emotional value for me because of the connection I feel towards my daughter. Thus I jumped into the artwork even before the world-building could be completed. The result was a complete Volume 1 with monochrome art and a slightly rushed storyline. It was towards the middle of the volume that we came up with a stronger title, ""Havenfall"".After Volume 1, titled ""Father"", was launched in January 2020, Fahim (my co-author) and I tried to gauge audiences' reactions to the overall project. While the feedback was generally positive, we received some constructive feedback through which we identified some potential improvement zones and decided to build upon it. Although it meant going back to the drawing board and re-writing the story from scratch, including the world-building, we decided the effort would pay off as long as we were able to give readers a more relaxed story, with more dynamism in terms of the art - now in full color mode.Starting in May 2020, the project has been revamped in full swing, this time in color and with a more concrete storyline and world-building, including some appealing illustrations of the world building - notes, characters, infrastructure, etc. The core idea remains: the bond between father and daughter as they embark on an epic journey.Kickstarter provides us with a tremendous opportunity to build on this dream project and share our journey and experience with the world. Outlined below are our roadmap and expectations surrounding ""Havenfall"":Launch: We will be launching 5-page issues of ""Havenfall"" starting July 1 on a bi-weekly basis, starting with the Prologue followed by Volume 1, Chapter 1. Collectively, all the issues represent a unified storyline. This trend will continue throughout the lifetime of the 5-volume visual novel. In case there’s an expected delay in any of the issues, patrons will be informed beforehand and the issues will resume the following week.Backing: With the backing received from our valued patrons, we aim to take ""Havenfall"" to the publishers for test-printing a batch of copies and gauging buyer behavior afterwards. Based on the feedback, we will decide on the way forward for publication. The funds received will also allow us to create a wide array of royalty artifacts for our patrons.Royalty: As the most important part of the project (besides the visual novel art and storytelling), our patrons will receive periodic updates in the form of notes, draft artworks (characters, infrastructure etc.), posters, timelapse videos showing the work in progress, and occasional video-chats with the artist/author. They will also receive occasional glimpses into the monochrome version of Volume 1, which was originally test-launched on the Graphite Comics portal.Snaps: We've shared a few peeks into the graphic novel based on the progress made so far, including the monochrome version.The way forward for ""Havenfall"" is challenging yet highly inspiring. With an adventure coursing through the terrains of an alien planet, we as the artist and the author will continue to share the tidbits of our journey as we roll towards successful completion of the full 5-volume novel in 2025. We thank you in advance for your highly valued contributions in making ""Havenfall"" a huge success.","The graphic novel project is primarily built for audiences aged between 15 and 45. The key challenges to the production timeline are the artist's balance between family, full-time employment and full-time studies, which is why we're currently limiting the launch of the issues to 5 pages every 2 weeks. According to our project timeline, this would result in successful launch of 5 complete chapters per year. This means the complete Volume 1 will be available by end-2021 and Vol 2 by mid-2023. 2029 or earlier will see the completion of the 5-volume novel, in addition to the Epilogue.

Personally for me as the key ideator and artist, the project holds tremendous emotional value which I wish to share with my team as well as my valued patrons.Before introducing my dream project, I'd like to briefly introduce myself, the team, and the journey that led to its production and way forward.""Havenfall"" is originally designed by a two-man team: myself - Navid F Rahman, an aspiring concept writer and graphic novel artist from Toronto, Ontario; and Fahim Md Mahfuzur Rahman, a gifted novelist with an affinity towards the fantasy genre.The idea for the graphic novel, originally titled ""Fade"", struck me a year after my daughter was born. By the time she'd turned 2, I thought of illustrating a story as a dedication to her. As usual, I decided to base my tale off-world, on a fictional remote planet. The story revolved around the journey of a father and his only daughter across savage, unforgiving environments to find a cure for a plague. Although the story itself bore no resemblance to any persons living or dead, the concept is of high emotional value for me because of the connection I feel towards my daughter. Thus I jumped into the artwork even before the world-building could be completed. The result was a complete Volume 1 with monochrome art and a slightly rushed storyline. It was towards the middle of the volume that we came up with a stronger title, ""Havenfall"".After Volume 1, titled ""Father"", was launched in January 2020, Fahim (my co-author) and I tried to gauge audiences' reactions to the overall project. While the feedback was generally positive, we received some constructive feedback through which we identified some potential improvement zones and decided to build upon it. Although it meant going back to the drawing board and re-writing the story from scratch, including the world-building, we decided the effort would pay off as long as we were able to give readers a more relaxed story, with more dynamism in terms of the art - now in full color mode.Starting in May 2020, the project has been revamped in full swing, this time in color and with a more concrete storyline and world-building, including some appealing illustrations of the world building - notes, characters, infrastructure, etc. The core idea remains: the bond between father and daughter as they embark on an epic journey.Kickstarter provides us with a tremendous opportunity to build on this dream project and share our journey and experience with the world.

We do a lot of work in the scale modeling industry to create premium 3D-printable content for hobbyists. We want to bring an accurate model kit of the G550 / C-37 to scale modelers across the globe.We've done this type of project in the past, having created some of the popular model kits onclick2detail.comincluding theRAF SentinelandT-1A Jayhawkkits. (The images below follow our workflow on a similar, recently completed project, the T-1A Jayhawk / JASDF T-400 scale model kit).First, our expert 3D artist will model the G550 / C-37 in CAD paying close attention to accurately representing the subject and adding as much detail as possible. The design phase takes approximately 6 weeks.Next, we'll scale the model to offer the kit in several different scales. We separate the parts to optimize the kits for efficient 3D printing and high quality surface finish. The process of separating the model and setting up the prints takes about 2 days.Finally we'll 3D print the models on our ultra-high resolution 3D printer using UV-cured resin and deliver the kits to our backers. Main parts will be made from a white or translucent resin, clear parts will be printed separately using a transparent resin. Printing time varies based on scale of the parts. The actual printing time is measured in hours and post-processing the parts to remove support material takes the most time, often requiring several days depending on the intricacy of each piece. These kits will fit right in to our normal production, processing, packing, & shipping queue for December.We need your help with the upfront investment necessary to create the CAD models. This is a great way to own a unique display model manufactured on cutting-edge 3D printing equipment.Meet Our TeamGijs Budel: CAD DesignerGijs designed the earlier T-1A Jayhawk kit and will be the designer for the G550 / C-37. His attention to detail is impeccable and he has both the artistic eye and the technical skill to accurately reproduce every nuance of the subject aircraft.Thomas Steckbeck: Senior Project ManagerThomas, with a background in mechanical engineering and electric waffle irons, is an expert at (among other things) print setup, structural optimization, and the nuances of manufacturing with our variety of 3D printers.Mike Krouse: Marketing & AdvertisingMike is the guy to ask for t-shirts and mugs & stuff. He also coordinates our marketing and advertising. When he's not playing baseball he's reinventing, and extending our brands. Mike is, apparently, from New Jersey. Chris Rodak: Owner, 3Delivered, Inc. & click2detail.comChris provides moral support and technical knowledge about the subject aircraft. He also keeps the team stocked with caffeinated beverages & pizza.Also check us out on Facebook!Check out some of our other work:There are several variants of the Gulfstream 550 aircraft. If a stretch goal is reached the specified variant will be produced in addition to the base model. Backers will have a choice of which variant they would like to receive.If we reach $6000 in funding we'll modify the CAD model to create the Israeli Air Force's Shavit AEW Variant.If we reach $8000 in funding we'll modify the CAD model to create the proposed RQ-37 UAV Variant.If we reach $10000 in funding we'll modify the CAD model to create the Israeli Air Force's Eitam AEW Variant. ","There is not much risk associated with this project since we have experience in creating these types of products. We own and operate our own high resolution 3D printers in-house and will be able to begin production as soon as the model is complete.The biggest challenge with this type of project is in the CAD design work taking longer than anticipated.  Additionally, there are risks associated with rework if the resulting parts don't print as expected and changes have to be made after the first model is printed. In this case, measurements will be taken of the first draft that will allow the model to be corrected. Our process ensures a highly accurate and detailed model will be produced.",https://www.kickstarter.com/projects/crodak/3d-print-my-skull?ref=discovery_category_newest,crodak/3d-print-my-skull,"Help us 3D print a real human skull extracted from a detailed CT scan! The most realistic skull available (besides the real thing!).First we start with raw DICOM files obtained from a Computed Tomography (CT) scan. A CT scan uses X-rays to take detailed 'slices' of the target area that can then be complied to create a 3D volume or model. CT scans also provide more detail for bone than an MRI scan can obtain.Using InVesalius 3.0 software the individual slices are imported and displayed from three angles (Transverse, Sagittal, and Coronal). We are then able to target specific parts of the body based on radiodensity and the Hounsfield (HU) scale. CT scanners are calibrated so that water has a value of 0 HU. Therefore, cancellous bone has an approximate value of +700 HU while dense bone can range greater than 3000 HU. By narrowing our target density between these two values, we are able to isolate the 'material' we want to create a 3D volume of.Once the material is isolated (shown in green above), the software compiles each layer and forms a 3D volume.Now that the 3D volume is created it can be exported as a stereolithography, or STL, file. This is the file type needed for the 3D printer. However, the exported file is not printable. Extraneous data such as extra bone fragments need to be manually removed.In order to farther isolate and repair the skull, both netfabb Studioand Meshlabis used. Portions below the chin are cut and removed in addition to the rest of the spine. Extraneous veins that were extracted along with the bone must be manually removed and the underlying skull repaired to patch the holes created. Cleaning the entire file and insuring it is printable is a very time intensive process.Once the file is ready to print, it can be added to a print tray and sent to one of our high resolution printers.The printer now builds up the skull layer by layer until the entire thing is completed. A full sized skull will take approximately 50 hours to print and use 2000 grams of material and 3000 grams of support!The process shown above used a CT scan freely available on the internet for medical studies. This was excellent as a proof of concept, however CT scans are typically done because something is wrong with the patient. For this project we need a 'clean' CT scan of an average, healthy person to get the best possible result. We have been in contact with a local hospital research center to obtain a CT scan with the appropriate releases so we can print the extracted skull.Materials are the biggest cost of this project. As previously mentioned a full sized skull will use 2000 grams of material and 3000 grams of support. This easily tops $1000 worth of printing resin. With your pledges we will be able to purchase the required amount of material to complete the printing project.Thomas Steckbeck: Senior Project ManagerThomas, with a background in mechanical engineering and electric waffle irons, is an expert at (among other things) print setup, structural optimization, and the nuances of manufacturing with our variety of 3D printers.Mike Krouse: Marketing & AdvertisingMike is the guy to ask for t-shirts and mugs & stuff.

We have already been in contact with a local research institute to obtain a CT scan. Additionally, we operate a high resolution 3D printer in-house and have produced complex geometries and printing projects before.The biggest challenge is cleaning up the STL file once it has been extracted from the CT scan. There are a lot extra 'artifacts' that come out with the skull that need to be manually removed. In particular, the inside of the skull needs to be cleared out so we are left with just the skull. We have experience with this type of model cleaning before, but not to this extent. We are confident the model can be successfully cleaned and made watertight so it can be 3D printed.Currently we have another project ""3D Printed G550 / C-37 Scale Model Kit"" running. If funded, that project relies heavily on our designer Gijs Budel's skills to create a very detailed and time consuming model. However, the G550 project will not interfere with this 3D printed skull. Thomas Steckbeck will be responsible for cleaning up the model obtained from the CT scan. This is the only project he is responsible for, allowing him to focus entirely on creating the most detailed human skull ever printed. Each project will be printed on different machines so that they do not interfere with each other while printing rewards. By putting an individual in charge of keeping one project on time and progressing, we are confident in our ability to simultaneously complete multiple projects successfully."

He receives the funds at the expense of a ‘deal’ and Lomak is cured by his father but also gains incredible strength and endurance as a side effect of the treatment.His father is then murdered brutally by the crime lord for un-fulfilling his part of their deal…Anti-criminal watchdogs ( A.C.T.E group) who are in pursuit of this crime lord stumble across the young yet powerful Lomak as they search - and decide to dedicate years of planning to an undercover operation which has the boy - Lomak, undergo vigorous training in order to become the solider of retribution and their ultimate component  in bringing down the mad crime lord, Javias Prime…..Lomak and Father, Isaac.Lomak develops into an incredible soldier.OUR FUNDING GOALS / STRETCH GOALS10 voice actors – on a 1hour script = £5000 (THANKS TO VOICE ARCHIVE )(10 volunteering animators)5 paid part-time animators for 8months of 12month production = £10,000Hardware/ Rental cost = £5,000Music soundtrack production = £5000£5,000 FOR PLEDGESTOTAL= £30,000If our budget can increase, then we can have more animators! So all of your pledges are welcomed, valued and appreciated!!!GOOD question - We haveincorporatedMOTION CAPTURE into our production!We can do this largely because we have incorporated Motion Capture into our production! 2D based motion capture is rarely used in 2D productions - Motion Capture is usually used of a CGI  or live-action productions, but the Kazem Team have used it successfully for Lomak’s Retribution, and the development of the film has become extremely time efficient as a result. For example: initial, raw sketches becomes obsolete during action or fight scenes, as we now re-enact those scenes using trace element  to speed up the process! See below:The CharactersLomak Bangura Soldier of retribution…Lomak was suffering from a terminal illness before being cured by his father, and as a result of that same cure he gains incredible strength, agility and speed. He is then adopted and trained by the tactical enforcers of ACTE.Isaac BanguraCunning scientistIsaac is a scientist and Lomak’s father.

Upon being notified of Isaac’s double crossing he is sent to kidnap and torture the scientist. Redd is part of ASIGARS defence and protection team.Gradius Kane Aggressive Instigator…Gradius Kane is the ‘fist’ for Javias – and leads ASIGARS outgoing aggressive activities such as robbery, murder, arson or investigation. After Javias is made aware of A.C.T.E’s conspiring schemes against the ASIGAR group , Gradius is ordered to violently put an end to the group’s efforts and plans…Bastion UkasBastion Ukas works for ASIGA and is Javias’s private scientist. Bastion is instructed to try and re-create the serum Isaac used to cure his son Lomak.Shen KingJustice enforcer…Shen King is the commanding officer for the A.C.T.E group. Whilst being in hot pursuit of Javias and the ASIGAR group, Shen discovers Lomak and decides to create an action plan in order to try and exploit the boy’s ability.Shoni KessmanThe decipher Shoni Kessman is a criminal intelligence expert and psychologist for the A.C.T.E group. After making contact with Lomak, Shoni makes a strong attempt to nurture him after the death of his father  and pays close attention to Lomak’s behavior and development.Rector HardmanRetctor Hardman is an Artillery specilaist for A.C.T.E  designs and manufacturers weaponry. He is part of the groups defensive team and works closley with Shen on bringing down the ASIGAR group.Malcolm FordMalcolm Ford is a human anatomy specialist and combat trainer for A.C.T.E. After being introduced to Lomak by Shen, he develops an intensive training programme for Lomak to follow in order to maximise Lomaks full potential.Kallum StoneLoyal soldierA super-agent of the A.C.T.E : Kallum is one of Lomak’s training combatants.

The boy confides in the monster and their adventure begins!The movie will revolve around how the monster takes the boy through different stages of the dream.e.g one part of the dream will be about a maze another part will be around collecting mysterious objects – fast pace bridge breaking, building crumbling action will occur the boy will cry and the monster will provide comfort etcIn the movie, Toby and his Monster will be pursued by aggressive mists of darkness which are in fact abstract forms of Toby's Cancer - together they must escape and reach the 'haven' - A light entity which will purge Toby of his deadly disease!As the movie expands and evolves so will the boy, on occasions he may get special powers.Furthermore the nature of the monster is a funny, wise, caring and protective.This project has strong ethics in terms ofstory-line– it will help raise child cancer awareness and even hasthe potential to raise funding for child cancer charities and attract international funding from such charities.The movie will be approx 25-30 minutes in length depending on the level of funding wereceive.The movie even has the potential to win awards due to the underlying ethics and moving story-line.Unique design:We will be incorporating two styles of animation in this film - 2D and 3D.To highlight the reality of the disease we hope to bring the visuals to a 3 dimensional plane once the boy awakens from his dream - this will help separate the fantasy from reality; Fantasy being illustrated in 2D and reality being illustrated in 3D.If we manage to raise $5000 we will be able to utilize much higher quality CGI and improve rigging animation as it will allow us to squeeze 2two 3D artists into the project!Since the age of five like many others, all I’ve done is draw.

https://www.kickstarter.com/projects/1768861794/the-long-night?ref=discovery_category_newest,1768861794/the-long-night,"I wanted to make a short film that would at first lull audiences in with a sense of safety, and then slowly pull the curtain back to terrify audiences and ultimately leave them shocked and disturbed by the ending, which I believe to be quite chilling, and that will all be achieved witout using any words. It's all in the visuals. I want this thing to be directed with grace, and simplicity. It's a quiet horror film, and only becomes bloody in it's last moments. It's a pure example of a tension builder.Horror is my bread and butter. It's a genre I respect as much as anyone would respect their favorite genres. I specifically use homages to classic babysitter in peril films like, ""Halloween"" and ""When A Stranger Calls (the original)."" I want people to be afraid to walk home afterwards. I want them to be terrified to go home to their empty houses. I want them to think twice about answering their phone. The Long Nightwill achieve this, and that's a promise I can keep. ","Any filmmaker will have setbacks and what I intend to do, is learn from mistakes, to absorb them and move past them. I specifically wrote this project to dig right in to the problems that most films have. I chose it because as an amateur filmmaker this would a challenge and it's one I want to face head on. I'm working with kids, a large set, outdoor shoots, both night and day, a slightly special effects laden finale, and lots of car shooting. I made the challenge specifically so that I would have to embrace it. I want to earn my stripes.",https://www.kickstarter.com/projects/1768861794/the-long-night-2014?ref=discovery_category_newest,1768861794/the-long-night-2014,"I wanted to make a short film that would at first lull audiences in with a sense of safety, and then slowly pull the curtain back to terrify audiences and ultimately leave them shocked and disturbed by the ending, which I believe to be quite chilling, and that will all be achieved without using any words. It's all in the visuals. This film isto be directed with grace, and simplicity. It's a quiet horror film, and only becomes bloody in its last moments. It's a pure example of a tension builder. I prefer scares that don't hammer you over the head. Horror is my bread and butter. It's a genre I respect as much as anyone would respect their favorite genres. I specifically use homages to classic babysitter in peril films like, ""Halloween"" and ""When A Stranger Calls"" (the original). Peoplewill be afraid to walk home afterwards. I want them to be terrified to go home to their empty houses. I want them to think twice about answering their phone. The film has already been cast, and we've done several table reads and will be starting with continual rehearsals, blocking, choreography, and effects tests right up until the start of shooting on August 9th. Put simply, the things that I'm seeking by starting this Kickstarter are things that myself and my crew need to make this much more than a low budget short film. Costume rental,better lights, better sound equipment, top of the line effects kits for some of the more visceral scenes(we're going practical). To deliver a quality product, Iknow these things are paramount. I want this to be cinematical. The Long Night will achieve this, and that's a promise I can keep. Here's the IMDb for the film: http://www.imdb.com/title/tt3884862/Here's the link to the Facebook page, with steadily gaining followers: https://www.facebook.com/#!/longnightmovie?ref_type=bookmark","Setbacks are almost a certainty, but with precision, focus and lots of rehearsals, we assure that hiccups and hurdles won't be happening. I've set up a very rigid pre-production, production, and post-production schedule and plan to adhere to this 100% of the way. Even in pre-production, we've encountered hurdles, losing a couple of actors, and re-writing things on the fly to keep on line to make a great film. I plan on screening this theatrically after it is complete, and then taking it to festival play to ensure that everyone will see what their money went to."

We initially created our thermochromic resin to solve a medical problem but quickly realized it has much wider potential than we first envisioned. Now, with your help, we aim to develop new functional resins for 3D printing that can be used by designers, creators, engineers, and 3D printing enthusiasts. This new resin can change color according to temperature and therefore has many potential applications in areas such as food safety, saving energy, and monitoring temperature. But we are more than a resin manufacturer—we can also 3D print a variety of artful objects. Currently, we are developing a smartphone app than can display the resin's temperature.The resin is designed to interact with the surrounding environment. We have made three primary products so far:Resin 1 Coldsensor: Resin 2 Bodysensor: Resin 3 Hotsensor:3D printing technology offers a new way to customize our products for potential customers. SLA printers can print out objects with high resolution.Printing results can be from your imagination:The funds raised will be used in the following ways:By the end of the project, you will be able to receive samples of the functional resin. We look forward to hearing from you about how our resin can be adopted in your designs.Please take a look at two kinds of rewards we can offer:Reward A: one set of three easy-to-use color analysis blocks, each are about the size of a quarter.Our smartphone application can be used to take pictures of the color block, analyze the color and output the temperature reading.Reward B: One liter of thermochromic resin will be delivered in a beautifully designed bottle. The type of resin may be selected from one of the three options listed above. The container will be designed by a bottle company. Our company logo, type of resin, and precautions will be labeled on the bottle.We are a team of enthusiastic people who aim to provide affordable and creative functional resins to suit your specific needs.Thank you for your invaluable support and believing in us!We really appreciate your support in exploring the potential application of this new type of resin with us and sharing our project with your family and friends! If you have any questions, please kindly check out the FAQ section, and if unfortunately there is not an answer to your question or if you would like to provide any feedback, you are most welcome to post a comment or contact us. We look forward to hearing from you!","The current challenge will be to move ThermoChrome from small to mass production. Therefore, we are actively communicating with our manufacturers to ensure quality control can be reproducible in every single batch of resin that we produce. Another challenge is that we currently know our resin is compatible with one specific type of SLA printer, in which it has promising results for stable and accurate printing. However, we need to ensure the resin is compatible with more 3D printers, but that will be outside the scope of this current project.Our team will post on our Kickstarter page every Friday noon about progress, challenges, and potential delays.",https://www.kickstarter.com/projects/2041445054/aircure-system-for-sla-printing?ref=discovery_category_newest,2041445054/aircure-system-for-sla-printing,"We, Thermochrome, are a group of enthusiastic engineers who try to improve the user experience for SLA/DLP printing. The main problem for SLA/DLP printing is the lack of a standardized and easy-to-use washing and curing system. Those that are on the market are not affordable for most SLA/DLP users. Here, we present our latest prototype: Aircure, an all-in-one system.The product from the SLA printer goes through an innovative agitated IPA washing process:The air bubbles, which is generated from our portable air pump, will go into the smallest cavities of the print and clean up the resin residues.After the wash, IPA is traditionally a hassle to be dealt with. It's unsafe for kids and a hazardous chemical, bad for health when exposed for an extended period of timeon the skin or inhaled, which causes symptoms such as dizziness and low blood pressure. We have a unique IPA drainage mechanism so that the users do not need to be exposed to the IPA directly.Then the product remains in the container and enjoys the UV exposure to increase its material strength. There is a UV protective layer around the container so the effect of UV light can be mitigated for the users' health.1. Print detail/residue testThe conventional method is to manually wash the product inside the IPA tank and then use sunlight/nail UV light chamber for curing process. Our system shows superior wash and cure effect in the case of prints involving very small cavities.2. Stiffness testThe comparisons have been made between different UV light sources, the nail UV chamber used in conventional method and the LED UV light used in our system. The stiffness of the 3D-printed material cured by our system is better than the one cured by the conventional method.Use of fundsThe reward will be one Aircure all-in-one system which provides wash and curing functions.","One of the major challenges is that the current volume of our AirCure system is only for a small/medium sized product. We are trying to develop a bigger version while not sacrificing the portability of the system.Another challenge will be to move AirCure from small to mass production. Therefore, we are here to ensure that good quality can be reproduced in every AirCure made."

It's our desire to help develop minimum standards and the technology to enforce the quality of life of TH occupants. Safety is a major concern that is often overlooked in Tiny House construction and education is key to solve some of the biggest problems. We want people to have the freedom that comes with owning a TH, but we want to help overcome some of the compromises that prevent home owners from being accepted in the larger communities. Some common inefficiencies are the lack of indoor plumbing in many TH. One of our goals is to design an effective indoor plumbing system that will allow users to have the convenience of a typ. urban house, even in the most rural environment. Other areas that need more attention in typ. TH designs are the lack of fire safety equipment, lack of bathroom ventilation, and the lack of kitchen ventilation. We want to take the TH to the next level by exploring how to incorporate these systems into the TH without increasing the impact on the environment. Please help us make the TH safer and more efficient by funding our campaign.We want to use our lifetime of building and design experience to establish minimum standards for design and construction.Help people design a TH to fit their needs.Provide people with a nail by nail guide to building their home safely and affordable.How the funding will be used.Material to build a model THEquipment to fully document the processWhat we will have in the end.Once the model TH is completed it will be made available to anyone that wants to experience TH living. As we travel across the US we will rent out the TH at different locations. Eventually we will set up the home at a yet to be determined location (with a view) so people will be able to fully embrace the TH experience.The Bottom LineThe more funds we are able to raise, the more of an impact we will be able to have in order to provide people with the information that they need to build a TH.The estimated cost for our model TH is $30,000. We want to explore various materials and living styles to compare the impact that TH living has on urban, rural communities. Plus, we want to study the environmental impact of a TH.The $10,000 requested will ensure that we can get the ground work going to complete our model home, but additional funds will help to spread the word with visits to home and garden shows, blogs, books, vblogs, or dvd's.All of the proceeds will go to supporting the construction and documentation of our model TH.Please help us to help others.

Let's have some fun together.","The risks are I kill myself in the process, but I have been building things my entire adult life and I've developed the engineering skills to design and build this trebuchet. I'm going to build a trebuchet. But I'd rather not do it alone. The size and exact design will be determined by the funds I can raise. An exact Edward the First trebuchet in full scale will cost upwards of $20,000 USD. If only the minimum  $2,000 is raised then I'll build a smaller weighted trebuchet capable of launching about 50 lbs."

There are sites, insurance, props, costume, etc. etc. All of which are then put at your fingertips to have a glorious time. This kick-starter puts you in the position to support a friendly group and take part, if you wish, in a world of intrigue and high adventure.We are currently running two different systems:Forest Argent – A selection of worlds, which have come into conjunction through a nebulous area called “The Forest Argent”.

I hope that you'll find something a bit different here, a bit more wild and untamed than your usual workshops or murder mysteries, somewhere to safely let out the child without fear of reprisal or looking silly. We run regular day events in the South of England, most notably Devon and Hampshire.What's the point of this project?It is time to do something to celebrate the new changes in my life and this new endeavour, as such I think its time to get right back to basics.I am a larper, that is a hobby that has had a huge effect on my life, I have met many friends, and even my wife. So, when it came to deciding what to do about an event to launch this new beginning there was only one thing to do: hire a castle, and restart a campaign.  Many years ago, when I was a young whipper-snapper I started to run 12th century murder mysteries, but with a twist.Though this project will allow you to get on board at every level, it is largely pegged towards creating something special September 2017.The hiring of the utterly beautiful St. Briavel's Castle and putting on a mystery with the a difference, drawing you into the action and intrigue while giving you the comfort of a proper bed and meals, with a banquet of the Saturday night.Thank you all for your time, and I hope we see you down the road.www.wyvernstales.co.uk","We hope that we have considered every obstacle, in 20 years I have had some experience, but there is always an issue when hiring venues etc. However, there are resources in place from personal finance and the organisation itself to plug those gaps in advance."

Feel free to contact me and I encourage everyone to ask questions and learn more about this project.Please send any private inquires to: galaxygirlscomic@outlook.comGalaxy Girls is about 4 young women enlisted in the Angels of Andalea, a space support organization. On a trip to a distant planet, they get sucked into a wormhole and warped to another galaxy. They are at various levels of experience and life, creating a unique blend of personalities and conflicts. Their adventures teach them key lessons about life and themselves; and everyone should see a little bit of themselves in the characters and their interactions. While Galaxy Girls is a fantasy/science fiction type of graphic novel naturally geared towards young adult female readers, older readers and male readers will still find this story extremely enjoyable.There is something to be found for everyone in this story.Rank 1 Fleet CommanderSun is the leader of the space fleet. She's strong-willed and self motivated, but also aggressive and stubborn. This is her first mission as a Commander, but she has a long way to go to truly understand what leadership means. She struggles to trust her comrades, as they struggle to understand her need to frequently prove herself.Rank 7 Combat SpecialistNova is the oldest and most experienced member of the fleet. She's very intelligent and witty, but also sarcastic and cynical. She's at the highest rank of Combat Specialist; being adept in combat, and in better shape than she appears. She often means well, but has a harsh way of showing it. She struggles to accept Sun's leadership and prefers to do things her way, often being reckless in the process.Rank 5 Utility SpecialistMoon is a veteran of the Angels and knowledgeable about a lot things, but also somewhat lazy and forgetful. She tends to go with the flow, rather than following the rules. She struggles to gain her comrades trust because she can be careless, but learns to be a better cadet by being around the rest of the fleet.Rank 1 Utility SpecialistSky is the youngest member of the fleet, just finishing the Space Academy with high marks. She's quirky and empathetic, quickly becoming the little sister of the group. Sky will often be the lens of the reader, because she's experiencing everything for the first time like new readers. Her learning curve to the Angels is steep, but she's always ready to rise to a challenge.Galaxy Girls is a thrilling space adventure for lovers of the science fiction and fantasy genres. In this introductory volume, Sun is a new Fleet Commander for the Spaceangel Coalition of Andalea and going on her first mission in a leadership role. Sun is fearless and brave; but still rough around the edges. She is accompanied by three other comrades: Moon, Nova and Sky. Moon is a veteran with bad habits, but also a lot of hidden talents. Nova is the oldest and most experienced of the group, usually being reliable, but also set in her ways. Sky recently graduated from the Space Academy, going on her first mission with the Angels.When some reckless behavior goes awry, the group is thrust into a wormhole and warped to a new and unknown galaxy. A large planet sitting in the distance is their first step towards any hope of getting home.Discover what awaits our heroines in this first volume of the Galaxy Girls series.My name is Avery Young, pen named A.S.

I have not published any works previously, but have assisted a countless number of other writers with ideas and story development; some of which later went on to publish their works. I am also a former English instructor, establishing a firm understanding of the mechanics for a great story as I have successfully taught the mechanics of story writing and analysis to students of all ages.I grew up reading a lot of fantasy and sci-fi novels, but also had a love for comics in the Sunday paper. I grew to love comics and graphic novels and always had a fascination with the medium. I got older and got more into writing, and found away to create the concept you're seeing now.

This summer we hope to begin production on our first feature film, //CYBERPUNKZZ//, and we need your support if we are going to bring this strange vaporwave vision to life!With this Kickstarter campaign we are asking you to support the production of our movie so that we can shoot it in June 2016! Find out about the film's story, our production plan, the reward tiers, and our  unique self-distribution plan below!Cyberpunk gangs race against time to find the last supply of a superdrug that lets the user physically enter the internet. Chaos, action, and body horror ensue.In a dystopian future, the old establishment have moved their consciousness entirely online, leaving the youth to fend for themselves in the hellish real world. For those that stayed IRL, the only way to survive the massive food and resource shortages was to band into street gangs, with each group in control of their own turf. These gangs only have one guaranteed means of survival: a new drug called “the juice,” a substance poured directly into the brain that permits the user to temporarily access online superhighways, allowing them to more easily find and trade necessary supplies.READ THE DETAILED SYNOPSIS HERE!Our film follows a gang called The Cyberpunkzz, who find themselves brought into enemy territory by a major “juice” shortage. After finding a treasure map to what they believe to be the last stockpile of “juice,” the punkzz end up the targets of not only the insane “juice”-addicted Modzz, but also a sinister cult which aims to take the whole world back offline.While running from the city's largest gang, The Modzz, one of the punkzz, Iso, is shot full of a computer virus which causes his brain to start leaking out of his head. The only known cure is a full brain “juice” bath, so the punkzz have to quickly follow the clues in their treasure map and discover the mysterious source of “the juice” if they are going to cure the virus in time.With the help of his fellow punkzz Minxxx, Jaxx, and Bikegirl, Iso must race against the city's rival gangs and an evil force known as The Limbless King to get to the world's last major supply of “juice” before its too late. But as the punkzz soon discover, if they fail to get to “the juice” first there will be a lot more at stake than just Iso's noggin'. It's a crazy story that takes familiar action, scifi, and horror tropes and combines them into an immersive new world based heavily in cyberpunk and vaporwave aesthetic. We are incredibly excited about the story and characters in this film and can't wait to bring it all to life!And to make sure that you are just as excited about this screenplay as we are, you can read the first 80 pages yourself here!When we reach our goal we will shoot //CYBERPUNKZZ// in June 2016 and will have the film primed for release by the summer of 2017!So far we have focused on assembling a great team and making our script the best it can be. Once we have the funding for our film we will immediately begin the pre-production process by casting our actors, designing costumes, and moulding the practical effects. In May 2016 we will move our team to Medicine Hat, Alberta, where we will build our sets and confirm locations. We will then shoot the film over 14 days in June 2016.We have determined that our minimum budget to shoot the film is $36 500, however to make this film exactly the way we have it in our heads we want to hit $67 220.00. (Remember that we're Canadian, so that is just $48 500 USD, £33 465, or ‎€43 126.)In line with our mission statement for Hentai Cop Films, we will be using exclusively practical effects in //CYBERPUNKZZ//. We want this movie to have a certain feeling that we would not be able to achieve with CGI, so even though its a film that heavily relies on Internet iconography we plan to use animation and traditional practical effects to achieve our transcendent vision of Internet altered states.Check out this uncut make-up effects footage fromComputer Hearts!We will primarily shoot the film on the RED DRAGON, which is the same camera we used for Dionne Copland's Inferno. Although this is a beautiful camera that will give us a lot of freedom to make a gorgeous neon atmosphere, we plan to also shoot on VHS camcorders and the Pixelvision 2000 to align with our vaporwave-cyberpunk aesthetic.We also have some absolutely amazing musicians lined up to either grant us access to their music libraries or record original tracks for the film, including:Everyone that donates to the campaign will immediately receive the following:And then we have these awesome rewards...Please ask us if you need clarification about any rewards!Note: Every reward above $10 includes a digital copy of //CYBERPUNKZZ// that will be released the same day as the festival premiere.All shipped reward packages will include one of four Punkzz buttons!If you want to see this crazy movie come to life, then we need your help!We have nothing but the utmost respect for our audience, and that is why we have set a distribution plan that puts your interests at the forefront. With //CYBERPUNKZZ// we are going to sidestep the conventions of indie film distribution by maintaining full control of how our movie gets from us to you. Our number one priority is to make a movie that we hope you'll love, not to sell it to a distributor and then leave you guys in the lurch if they want to have more control over the delivery of the film than we promised to you guys.For //CYBERPUNKZZ// our plan once we finish the film is to hit one major film festival for the premier, and on the very same day we will send the film digitally to our backers! We then plan to tour the film from city to city ourselves, partnering with local cinemas to bring a unique and engaging live experience to audiences across North America and then (hopefully) the rest of world. While we tour the film we will put together the physical rewards and send them out to our backers by October 2017.For us that is the dream of crowdfunding and why we feel that our delivery plan is the best for keeping a strong relationship between us filmmakers and our audience.

When we made Computer Hearts we completely underestimated the amount of funding we needed to make the movie we wanted to make, so we found alternative sources to fund the completion of the film. With S.I.D.S., we used Indiegogo's flexible funding feature and still delivered the film despite not reaching our goal.With our previous campaigns, we were sure to be entirely transparent with any delays and what was causing them, and we have learned from any of the mistakes we made from that delivery process to ensure that we set realistic and achievable goals for the production and delivery of //CYBERPUNKZZ//.If this film reaches or surpasses its funding goal there is no doubt that it will be delivered on time and will far exceed backer's expectations. Honestly, the only thing that could stop this film from landing in your inbox next summer is if we all die (but we won't, obviously).",https://www.kickstarter.com/projects/hentaicop/cold-wind-blowing-a-new-twist-on-cabin-in-the-woods-horror?ref=discovery_category_newest,hentaicop/cold-wind-blowing-a-new-twist-on-cabin-in-the-woods-horror,"We are the filmmaking couple Dionne Copland and Turner Stewart, and in the past we've brought you the short films Inferno, //HAXX DEADROOM//, and Computer Hearts. In December 2017 we shot our FIRST FEATURE FILM, COLD WIND BLOWING, and we need your support for our completed horror feature!Starring our frequent collaborators Angela Way, Dallas Cameron Petersen, Nalani Wakita (Altered Carbon), Alexander Lowe (Welcome to Marwen), and M.J. Kehler (Incredible Violence), as well as some awesome new faces including Griffin Cork (Abracadavers) and a cameo by horror legend Larry Fessenden (Habit, Wendigo), Cold Wind Blowing is an exciting new film that we are thrilled to share with you!Cold Wind Blowing is about a group of friends who decide to spend their Christmas vacation together at a great uncle's old cabin in the woods. The weekend does not go well.Avoiding major spoilers, all you need to know is that it is a character-driven horror story that examines a group of friends forced into a truly uncompromising and traumatic situation. The response from those who have seen the film is that Cold Wind Blowing is ""next-level,"" immersive, scary, and deeply emotional. Telling this story has been a passionate ride for us and we are very proud of what we've accomplished in this film.Also, we once again collaborated with practical effects master Michelle Grady, so interpret that as you will (noting that she did the make-up FX for our films //Haxx Deadroom//, S.I.D.S, and Computer Hearts).Anyone who has followed our past films knows that we challenge ourselves to tell exciting original stories and that each of our earlier films is different than the last, always striving to push the medium of cinematic storytelling forward. As our first feature film, Cold Wind Blowing is not only our most ambitious project yet, but explores narrative territory that we've never touched on before. In short, Cold Wind Blowing is a heavy, emotional, and grisly character-focused horror story unlike anything before!Cold Wind Blowing is the first feature length film made in this region of Southwestern Saskatchewan, shot between the Cypress Hills Interprovincial Park and the townships of Eastend and Shaunavon. We were gifted with the most generous support from these communities during our production and in the months before and after, including donated filming locations and the most wonderful hospitality. This is a location very rarely explored on film, a geography and culture that is almost foreign even within Canadian cinema, and we can't wait to bring some of the small town charm we experienced to the screen (along with the haunting atmosphere of the 'Prairie Gothic' locale).Our thematic considerations with the film were to not only examine the personal experience of trauma, but in choosing this location we wanted to interrogate elements of Canada's historical traumas which our country can never truly deal with; the kinds of horrors which could survive an “ice age,” untouched thanks to the high elevation of the Cypress Hills. There were only ten of us cast and crew that went up into those hills to make this film, and each of us experienced the haunting and unknowable energy that lurks in those woods. From hearing (and recording) the sounds of inhuman laughter in the woods to feeling the physical touch of unseen forces, the experience of filming this horror film was a truly terrifying ordeal for our cast and crew. It is our real fear that is reflected on the screen.Below you can see the first moment of recorded supernatural phenomena, as *something* invites itself into our main shooting location.You can hear director Dionne Copland tell a comprehensive story about the supernatural activity we experienced here.We shot the film in Ultra-High Definition 6K RAW on the RED Epic with home-made lenses and other gear (inspired by our shoestring budget and remote shooting location, we built our own dollies, stabilizers, and DIY lighting solutions). Cold Wind Blowing was an absolute labour of love which would not have been possible without the passion and ingenuity of our dedicated cast and crew, who lived with us in the cold Saskatchewan winter as we shot the film over ten very long days. We are so grateful to our small team, as despite our micro-budget limitations we had a beautiful atmosphere on-set and brought a shared dream to life.You can find more stills and behind-the-scenes photos on our Instagram!Our team at CyberCraft Video strives to self-finance as much of the filmmaking process as possible, and despite being a micro-budget production, on Cold Wind Blowing we paid everyone for their work on the film! However, we are in need of your generous support in order to wrap up Cold Wind Blowing by paying the outstanding fees for our composer and for music licensing. Our longtime collaborator Graham Trudeau has once again composed our score, and Cold Wind Blowing includes songs by Canadian musicians Ravine Angel, Blue J, Connor HD & The FLACs, and more!Cold Wind Blowing was in post-production for over eighteen months because we payed for everything to do with the film ourselves, pay check to pay check. I can only work so many hours and exhausted every potential avenue for finishing funds, and now that the film is finished the next step of submitting to film festivals requires a generous influx of immediate funds. That's why we're back to crowdfund again, because we think we've made a great movie and we really want YOU to see it!In addition to the above expenses, any extra funds raised through this campaign will be used to fulfill perk delivery.Crowdfunding is important to us because it not only gives us the freedom to create unique and challenging cinematic art, but allows us to engage directly with our audience and give you the opportunity to be a part of the filmmaking process. We sincerely could not make our movies without your generous support, and we value your contribution to our film so much that we are giving all of our backers Digital Download codes to our past Vimeo-On-Demand titles!As always we are offering a ton of fully loaded perks as part of this campaign. Anyone who has backed our previous campaigns knows that we load our home video releases with all sorts of goodies, and since this is our biggest movie we have ambitions to make this the best one yet!CWB Home Video Specifications:Perks:And every shipped perk will include bonus postcards and buttons from various CyberCraft Video productions!Cold Wind Blowing is complete, so you don't need to worry about our team getting you a finished film! The only challenge we anticipate is that we do not know the exact delivery date for the film, as the film will begin its Festival tour in the Fall.We are incredibly excited about this film and we can't wait to share it with you!You can find more information about us at our website CyberCraftVideo.com!The CastThe CrewThank you!Love,Turner and Dionne","Our only challenge is predicting when the film will be sent to backers. We are hoping for it to be before the Spring of 2020, but pending a deal with a distributor or the state of our film festival run, it could be later into 2020."

It replaces the standard ""SeaSwitch"" box with a smart, Arduino based, controller that uses a standard gaming interface for smooth and comfortable control. It's compact, hack-able and perfect for a wide range of motorized projects.- o - o - o - o - o - o -The Perchino™ design team is made up of four hyper-nerdy College students (Kendrick, Kevin, AJ and Derrick) who have about 30 years of competitive robotics experience between them. They are led by a veteran project manager (Mr. Phil), who has spent at least that many years designing embedded computer systemsfor underwater ROVs (Remotely Operated Vehicles) and other robotic systems.When Phil first encountered the SeaPerch ROV 6 years ago, he wanted to use it with Middle-Schoolers, but hand-wiring all the switches was too difficult for young kids. So he designed simple PCB to use in the control box, and donated that design to the SeaPerch community. This SeaSwitchcontrol box greatly simplified the construction, and improved the reliability, of the overall system. The SeaSwitch is now standard on all SeaPerch's.The SeaSwitch controller is fine for beginners, but the ON/OFF style of motor control is very cumbersome if you want to move beyond the basic SeaPerch, and enhance it for tele-operation. You also need smoother control if you want to add sensors or manipulators. Now it's time to kick it up a notch with an all new control box called the Perchino™ (Perch-ee-no).ThePerchino™ combines three enabling technologies: An Arduino CPU, a PS2controller interface, and four state-of-the-art motor-driver chips. These components come together to form anergonomic, highly agile, ROV controller with wireless capabilities, and hack-able control algorithms.Note: There's no need to add an Arduino, it's already in there. Just unplug the SeaSwitch control box, plug in the Perchino™ and add your favorite PS2 controller.We've been working hard, and have developed several successful prototypes. We love our current hardware, but we still have a few enhancements in the works. The team is also experimenting with differentsoftware builds and creating an open-source Arduino library to make it easy for beginners to develop customcontrols and automated functions.As a final incentive, don't forget that the Perchino™ can also double as a generic quad-motor controller. Feel free to use it on any motor powered project, like a remote controlled tank or an interactive art project. There are fixed NRE (Non Recurring Engineering) costs associated with the Perchino™ circuit board and enclosure, so we have set our Kickstarter goal to enable us to order sufficient quantities to get some really good prices for everyone. We have set our goal at an initial order of 250 units, and if we exceed this, we will be able to add some cool stretch goals.We've created some low-cost, and early-bird rewards that will let you make your mark on the Perchino™ Community while you have some fun with the Perchino™ team.We're also providing a pledge reward that will enable you to have our team create a custom flight/control mode to suit your specific project needs. These new control modes will be included with the standard Perchinocode for everyone to use. The new modes will be named by the backers who fund them.Remember that we are all about the hobbyist robotics/maker community with an emphasis on STEM education, so just as with the original SeaSwitch, our goal is to build the Perchino™ into a new piece of enabling technology to help inspire kids into Science and Technology careers.Just to recap, here's why thePerchino™is worth the extra dollars over a standard SeaSwitch.Here is a video of Kevin demonstrating the basic Perchino™ operation with a wireless PS2 controller.For more information, check out the preliminary design brief at the BitsForBots.comwebsite.","Since the Perchino™ circuit design is just undergoing final refinement, and the code is already good enough to ship, the most likely challenge will be ensuring the supply chain for the printed circuit board production.These days, many manufacturers wait for chips to be fully sold out before scheduling further production.  This can cause unexpectedly high lead-time out of the blue.  If a critical part becomes unavailable, it will certainly delay production and then shipment.  However, all of the current components are in active production, so any outages should not require a redesign... simply a delay.",https://www.kickstarter.com/projects/491811151/one-small-step-for-meme?ref=discovery_category_newest,491811151/one-small-step-for-meme,"One small step for meme.I'm a ""robot guy"", and I’ve always wanted to send a robot to the moon, but I didn't think it was ever going to happen. But now I have the chance to be one of the first people to create something that will actually take that 240,000 mile voyage to our only natural satellite, on a civilian mission. But my contribution won't be a physical robot, it will be gallery of images and videos that show my passion for creating robots over the last 30 years.But I don't want to do this alone. I want to ""Share the Ride"" with everyone in the community who ever had a passion to create something worthy of sending to the moon.Naturally, your creations don't have to have anything to do with robots... they should represent your own personal passion, and can be in any digital form: (a meme, vine, image, document, song, movie, e-book etc). Since this will also be a public gallery, you must own your media, and it must be suitable for all age groups.If this sounds like a pipe-dream, it’s not. It’s real ! This project is based on hard Science, Technology and Engineering being developed by a host of innovative groups who are fully committed to making it happen.We will be a very small part of a much bigger mission which also includes several Google Lunar X Prize competitors.  My plan is to include our combine gallery on a micro-SD card and have it included as “Moon Mail” on the first Astrobotic service to the moon.There will be a host of mainstream scientific and leading-edge technologies on board, so we’ll be a tiny hitch-hiker along for the ride of a lifetime.I think this is an extremely cool way to showcase our talents while also expressing an interest in space science and technology, so I want to make it accessible to literally everyone. Yes, even you!The pledges start at a measly $1 for enough space to send your favorite moon-meme. For just $3 you can send a 6 second Luna-Vine. The more you pledge, the more space you get to contribute, and the cost per M Byte goes down.To showcase the galleries, we will have an online unveiling of the full payload on the same day it departs for the moon.Because of the current Lunar X Prize milestones, the Moon-Mission needs to be completed by December of 2017, so that's the projected delivery date for this Kickstarter.So join the growing lunar community, and get a piece of “you” on this historic mission to the moon. We'll get to see the galleries get loaded on the Griffin Lander. And after launch, we'll get mission status updates on spacecraft deployment from the launch vehicle, lunar orbit insertion, descent to the surface, and the Moon landing.","The Launch is scheduled to occur at a date and time frame that Astrobotic determines in its sole discretion. There is always the possibility of flight postponement or cancellation.The MoonMail™ Mission is a highly risky endeavor and there is the possible risk of loss or damage to the payload during shipment, launch preparation, launch, and delivery to the lunar surface."

From Dr. Doolittle to Star Trek IV with whales to SeaQuest DSV with the talking dolphin Darwin, it has always remained a great mystery if other creatures can communicate more than superficial concepts. While any sort of putative animal translation capability is far off, we can analyze their communications and interpret their structure through the guide of information theory.My name is Reginald Smith and I have just published a scientific paper on this topic in the journal Entropy. Entitled, “Complexity in Animal Communication: Estimating the Size of N-Gram Structures,” (that is a mouth full) it analyzes the calls of bottlenose dolphins, humpback whales, and several bird species to try to find the hidden structure and complexity behind what deceptively appears as a sequence of random noises. By successfully being accepted to a peer reviewed journal on this topic, I hope to decisively push forward efforts in this area to elucidate a deeper understanding of animal communication. So the research is done, why the Kickstarter campaign? In short, I conducted this research and wrote the paper on my own budget as an amateur scientist. Don’t worry, I had guidance from several professional  scientists on this paper and other aspects of computational linguistics and the research was rigorous enough to pass three rounds of three peer reviewers. Among the conclusions:1. Certain animal species, dolphins and humpback whales in particular, have a sizable number of 2 or 3 call-length combinations in their communications. The fact that these exist, and are much lower than random chance would suggest, indicate there is likely complex structure in their communications.2. We can estimate the number of these combinations, for example humpback whales seem to have 18 2-call sequences from a base of 6 calls (random chance would indicate 36) while dolphins have at least 5 structures of both 2 whistles and 3 whistles, off of a base of 27 whistles. A more constrained ""vocabulary"" size but nonetheless radically different from what random chance predicts (27^2=729 or 27^3=19,683).I want my paper to be open access, meaning anyone can download it without a pay wall. To do this, I need to raise an open access fee of about $1350 (1200 Swiss Francs to be exact).

Currently solutions: currently there are two ways to defence from this type of attack: One effective backup system , or a good antimalware with euristics functions that allow  to recognize existing ransomware and prevent the new variants.Based on Barkly's website, only 41% of victims by ransomware that have a backup system, was enabled to restore 100% of data without data loss. Some variants of ransomware can encrypt also backup data if the backup device is attached to the server or computer at the moment of infection. In others case the delta time between the last backup and data encryption is too hight to restore without data loss.Today there are new antimalware products that work very well against  most diffused ransomware, and pretty good also with new ransomware unknown . These software are based on euristic functions, and check if a running process was doing something of strange based on model behavior's of the current ransomware existing today.But ransomware change and encrese every day... what will happen if a new ransomware will use a differente behavior? Are you sure to be fully protected with your antimalware?Our solution:Our solution don't want replace the others solutions, but want be a complementary tool, that can cover the gap that leave others solutions. As you can see in ours video, we immunized ours important files with our tool, and after malware infection this file are at safe.  Our goals and how we use founds: We need these founds to transform ours technology that at this moment is just a little more than of a proof-of-concept in a full software to sell at the customers, and invest in research to improve ours technologies for the future releases.","There are differents ransomware, and some of them can encrypt all your hard disk instead of single files (for example Petya works in this way). In this case you can't access to every file included immunized ones.But this is a great challenge to try to resolve for future release.",https://www.kickstarter.com/projects/edwardantiransomware/edward-ransomware-immunizer?ref=discovery_category_newest,edwardantiransomware/edward-ransomware-immunizer,"Do know what is a ransomware?

The majority of the animation and visual content will be created by a single Animator, Stephen W. Brandt, who will also serve as the primary writer (see ""Primary Talent"" and visit his website at http://www.stephenwbrandt.com). Presented as a series of monologues, ""how to"" quasi-instructional segments, comedy sketches, lists, and exploratory graphics, the themes of consumerism, digital culture, ecology, and spirituality will be explored. This film will by no means be intended to serve as an actual guide for anyone's life, will probably contain no practical advice, and will be intended for entertainment purposes only. Some segments have already been completed, such as How to Acquire a Lasagna Dish and How to Survive a Robot Uprising, presented here. It is estimated that it will take a year and a half to complete this project.The Animator/Filmmaker Stephen W. Brandt has already been awarded an $8,000 artist fellowship from the Virginia Museum of Fine Arts to be used for this project. Thus far much of this grant money has already been spent on computer equipment (Mac) and software (Adobe) and for the production of two of the existing segments: how to acquire a lasagna dish and how to survive a robot uprising.Of the $45,000 total amount requested to complete this project, $5,000 will be reserved for tax purposes. The remaining amounts will be divided into three portions. At least $14,000 will go towards pre- and post-production costs, such as for audio recording and engineering, voice-over talents, and music production. Another $14,000 will go towards production, the animation itself. The remaining $12,000 will go for distribution of the film, such as film festival entry fees, website, pubic relations outlets, and legal fees. These amounts are subject to adjustment.Other Needs to Be Met:To complete the ultimate guide to life, donations other than of monetary form would be appreciated. Professionals willing to donate their writing, animating, acting, and audio engineering talents would be most appreciated and are encouraged to contact the filmmaker with a resume and/or url links to samples of their work at swb@stephenwbrandt.com.

One art-form that has always interested me is the poster, often overlooked and under appreciated as a form of self expression.My first major poster project was creating a series of 3 billboards for the Virginia Tobacco Settlement Foundation, spin-offs of the animated television ad i produced for them:Later i did several promotional posters for the Richmond dance company Dim Sum Dance, using both low-end and high-end printing processes:Probably my most well-known poster is the one I created for the James River Film Festival the year the Brothers Quay were guest presenters. This was my first and so far only time working with metallic ink, a duo-tone of metallic gold ink and black ink - this process is very challenging being that when one digitally creates the imagery it's guesswork as to how the inks are going to interplay. The metallic properties of the ink do not directly translate on a digital screen, which is why you are seeing here a dull gold color - only when you see the actual poster can you fully appreciate this process.  The tones and textures shift and glimmer as you change your viewpoint of the poster. The Brothers Quay thought very highly of this poster! If you would like to see this golden metallic duo-tone poster ""in the flesh,"" it is on display at The Video Fan in Richmond.I've decided I would really like to work with this metallic duo-tone process again, and on a much larger scale.  most of the posters i have created were 16 inches by 22 inches; I'm hoping to work again with gold ink, and for the first time work with silver and bronze inks on posters sized 22 by 28 inches, the maximum size that most standard printing presses can accomidate.  This will be a limited edition of 250 prints for each of the three posters.For this series of three I'd like to make them Richmond-themed, based on three visually distinct areas. For the first poster I will use silver and black inks to represent Hollywood Cemetery, being that silver traditionally lends itself to nostalgia. Photographs of sculptures and other features of this expansive and historic cemetery will be digitally combined into an organic cluster, seemingly floating above the iconic pyramid. My goal is to use the silver ink to well represent and enhance the textures of the stone and other materials.For the second poster I will use gold and black inks to represent the historic Fan District, an area representing Richmond's  architectural golden age. Photographs of the Fan's most noteworthy residential buildings will be arranged into a geometrically multifaceted cluster, perhaps reminiscent of M.C. Escher, perhaps resembling a lady's fan.  Below will be a single building, depicted as flat and straightforward.  Again, the goal is to use the metallic ink to emphasize the many textures.For the third poster, metallic bronze and black inks, I am undecided - try to think of it as a enticing mystery. I am primarily considering Downtown (State Capital), Shockhoe Bottom or the James River - but also am thinking of perhaps Broad Street or Carytown.I hope you consider backing this project, as rewards I am offering the posters themselves, all signed and in differing quantities depending upon amount of support. Thanks for reading and please take a look at the rest of the information presented here in my Kickstarter campaign!Here are more examples of my poster art, enjoy!","Perhaps the main challenge of this project is of technique - the nature of working with metallic inks when printing is that the artist must make educated guesses as to how the final printed piece will appear, being that the metallic properties do not 'translate' visually on a computer monitor."

They are intended as a body buck or ""blank"" for action figure customizers, modelers or even artists to use as pose models.The design of these figures began many years ago in a galaxy, well very near here in fact.Some custom figures done on the Alpha base body...To see many more custom figures done on the Alpha Blanx body, visit the Galleries here... The Blanx figures are in 1:18th scale and are 3 3/4"" tall. Except the ones who aren't. The comparative height of each figure is shown in inches and heads tall below, the height of each individual figure isalso indicated.

Heroic proportions for a dwarf being something else entirely.They are highly articulated for a figure of this scale: ball joint at the top and bottom of the neck, ball jointed shoulders and elbows, swivel wrists, ball jointed waist and hips, one ball joint and one hinge joint in each knee, and hinged ankles. These joints are designed and sculpted for a very wide range of motion, allowing for infinite posing. If you have that kind of time.The page needed some color, so here is this...Body construction is based on the O-ring type body style, allowing for ease of disassembly, and reassembly. They are manufactured unpainted, cast in neutral gray and flesh-tone, with a very slight texture on the surface to allow good paint and glue adhesion by the customizer.The series is to include...Beta -male- 3 3/4 inches. A lean and very defined musculature. Some suggested uses, thinner or younger superheroes, realistic types, anime characters, elves, agile types.Gamma -female- 3 1/2 inches. Petite but strong and well built. Removable hair. Uses could include youthful or dainty female superheroes, elfish types, fairies, realistic females, damsels in distress.Delta -male- 3 3/4 inches.

I’m Colin, a French student and I’m passionate about cooking, gastronomy and food. I mostly all love the French, Italian and Asian food and my dream is to open a restaurant in Bohol, a little and touristic island in Philippines. More than a conventional restaurant, I would like to explore the common points with the French and Asian food, and to mix them in a good and new way. To work with local and equitable foods and products as much as possible, to make this restaurant like the food I would love to cook, a place where native Filipinos and foreigners are exchanging and meeting, where cultures are mixed, and where we can discover the other.The local food is mainly composed of fishes and rice, with some meat like pork and chicken. It is totally possible to work with the little Filipino fishers to help them to fight against the inequalities and having a more comfortable life to avoid the concurrence from the European, American and Chinese big Companies. The idea is clearly not to change the world by the food and consumption, but at least, to do my possible to help the ones I can. And for this, I need your help. You can make my dreams becoming true. Of course, we will make our self the bread the French bread, propose a decent wine card, and all the typical French dishes adapted with the basically Filipino food, such as the fishes “gratins”, the French fries or pies with local vegetables…After some trips on Asia, I saw how much the French restaurants were expensive and clearly not for the local populations. It’s my wish to make mine welcoming the local populations as much as possible. I’m searching to create a convivial place between people. About Bohol, this is a little island, with more than 1,100,000 habitants. There isn’t concurrence for any French restaurant. Every year there are thousands and thousands tourists who are coming to visit it. And even if I will maintain the prices as low as I can, the project is viable and coherent. I already have contact in Bohol who will help me to be integrated better in the population and with who I can work. I also love to write during my free times, and I wish to write a cooking book with all the new recipes I will experiment and give all of them to the kickstarters who will support me to have some minds and thought about them to all the ones who will like to try them without to come to the Philippines! And of course… It won’t avoid all the others who likes to come to be surprised by some new meals only for the kickstarters ;) Bonjour à tous !Je m’appelle Colin, je suis un étudiant (français) pour le moment et je suis passionné par la cuisine, la gastronomie et la cuisine. J’aime avant tout la cuisine française, Italienne et Asiatique et mon rêve est d’ouvrir un restaurant à Bohol, une petite île touristique dans les Philippines. Plus qu’un restaurant conventionnel, je voudrais explorer et exploiter les points communs entre la nourriture française et Philippine, de les mélanger ensemble autant que possible dans de nouvelles recettes, ainsi que de travailler avec une nourriture locale et équitable. De même, j’aimerais faire cet endroit à l’image de mes plats, un endroit où les natifs et les étrangers échanges et se rencontrent, où les cultures sont mélangées et où l’on peut découvrir l’autre. La nourriture locale de Bohol est principalement composée de poisson et de riz, avec quelques fois de la viande de porc et de poulet. C’est tout à fait possible (et dans mes projets) de travailler avec les petits pêcheurs philippins et de les aider à se battre contre les inégalités et avoir une vie plus confortable pour éviter la concurrences des grandes compagnies européennes, américaines et chinoises. L’idée n’est pas de changer le monde avec la nourriture et leur consommation, mais, au moins, de faire mon possible pour aider ceux que je peux tout en réalisant mon rêve. Et pour cela, j’ai besoin de votre aide. Vous pouvez le faire devenir réel. Bien sûr, nous ferons nous même le pain et les produits frais comme il se doit, nous proposerons une carte des vins décente et tous les plats français typiques adaptés avec la nourriture habituelle philippine, tels que les gratins de poissons, les « french fries » et les tartes adaptées aux différents légumes. Après quelques voyages en Asie du Sud-Est, j’ai vu à quel point les restaurants français étaient rares et et chers, clairement pas pour les populations locales. Et c’est mon souhait d’ouvrir le mien pour accueillir les populations locales autant que possible.A propos de Bohol, c’est une petite île, avec plus de 1 100 000 habitants. Il n’y a pas de concurrence pour des restaurants français. Chaque année, il y a plusieurs milliers de touristes qui viennent pour la visiter. Et même si je souhaite maintenir les prix aussi bas que possible, c’est un projet viable et cohérent. J’ai déjà des contacts à Bohol qui vont m’aider à m’intégrer à la population et avec lesquels je peux travailler. J’aime aussi écrire pendant mes temps libres, et je souhaite écrire un livre avec toutes les nouvelles recettes que je vais expérimenter et le donner à tous les kickstarters qui m’aideront à monter ce projet pour avoir quelques retours et pensées à propos de ces nouvelles recettes sans qu’ils aient besoin de se déplacer jusqu’aux philippines ! Et bien sûr… Cela n’empêchera pas ceux qui veulent venir d’être surpris par les quelques plats que je préparerai rien que pour eux !","Les risques principaux sont liés à la politique philippines et notamment de l'obtention de visas. C'est pour cela que j'ai besoin d'une somme supérieure à 50 00 euros pour pouvoir obtenir un visa investisseur et pouvoir monter mon projet.

This work has for goal to gather all our old looking shots which could have been taken 50 years ago. The difference? A phone sometimes in the hand, some shirts and cloths. Out of the cities, time seems to be stopped.This work will is divided in two different steps, the first one is the production of a photobook, gathering all these pictures and narrating their stories, the way people are living, the feeling they express... And the second step, is the exposition of this work to let Filipinos have access and see this work and project. Sharing our experiences by their side.Even if Philippines are mainly composed with thousands islands, obviously, some pictures are about seafearers or fishermen, but they aren't composing all our work. Some have been taken in farms, where no road leads, just some carabao ways nowadays converted for motocycles.Why Philppines? Philippines has been chosen because this is a country with a lot of contrasts between the populations. From a side, there are the filipinos working abroad or for a foreigner company, earning well and having all the comfort they wish. And from the other side, millions filipinos having no other choice than being resourceful to find their place and be adapted to the modern world.

That's why actually, we are trying the crowfunding.Why do we need money and how we will use it?We actually need funds to finish our work in some singular places, we are wishing to offer you some unique shoots, far from the usual and visited places. A little part of the founds will be dedicated to this. The biggest part will be dedicated to product our book, find and rent good places to make exposition and finally, to print our work on coton canevas. We wish to make the exposition entirely free for people and make it open to as many people as we can!So? Will you be part of our journey?It's all up for you, but we will be really grateful to anyone who will support us and help us to reach our dreams! Our journey will become yours and we will be happy to let you join us through our pictures!Welcome to our world.... out of the time!","The main difficulties we can face, will be about the exposition, finding a good place, attracting people to visit it and get the authorizations. But being in Philippines incce few months already, we get some contacts willing to help us and make ad for our work. We aren't alone to make this project real !All your recompenses are made and imagined by us.

This Kickstarter's goal is to complete the first Chapter of the WebComic.What's Going On Here? I haven't self-published my fantasy-magic-action webcomic Nightmare Academy on Webtoons yet, but I created this story in 2009, and after deciding to purely focus on my Cosplay Battle story, I put it on the back burner until 2017. What changed between 2009 and 2017? Many things; firstly, I found an artist whose art style spoke to me. Secondly, when I was speaking with some of my closest writing friends, about if they've ever put stories on hold they regretted, and I told them about this story. They heard about it and enjoyed it, especially when I told them I love Halloween themed characters and concepts, This project is designed to get more pages of my WebComic out into the world, to connect with people who love telling stories, having stories told to them or are curious about starting their own stories.Problem is, I don't have the kind of funds necessary to start up another major writing project to self publish. That means that many readers (especially those who have been with me and this story since the very beginning) are forced to wait as I come up with the money to bring them this content. It's no easy (or cheap) process to draw the pages and color them. Readers ask me every week when it will be available again, and thanks to Kickstarter, I now have an answer: Now.The goal, listed over in the top right corner, represents the amount of money we need to keep a steady flow of production and quality of the pages. If we reach that goal, then I’ll be able to continuously bring the readers, some of whom long time supporters of the series, all the content I wish to share with them. If we don’t reach that goal within 30 days, though, no one will be charged anything; you only pay if the project is successful.The Story In the darkest corners of the night, beyond the veil of nightmares and shadow lies a world beyond the world of Humans. Within this world, our greatest fears are manifest and are free to roam living lives of their own. Once a year on a special day, October 31st, they are allowed to travel to the world of Humans to walk among them. On this day where even humans can pretend to be monsters, these creatures beyond the veil spend their 24 hours walking amongst humanity feasting on their fear and terror.But when the moon finally descends and the sun rises once more, dragging these creatures back into their native realm, what occurs the other 364 days?This is a story of how Denizens of the Supernatural live day to day. Many of them have average lives much like our own, but there are a select few who are the best and brightest Creatures within their own races. They are the lucky few with enormous potential of spiritual power. And they have a special task; to uphold the laws of the nightmare realm. And the most important of those laws is to never cross into the world of humans during any other time of year. These individuals train at an Academy run by none other than Death himself. These individuals who graduate become his reapers and reapers are tasked with ensuring the order and stability, ensuring that both the human world and the nightmare realm flow without disturbance.CharactersYuja Harri Yuja Is the Series Main Protagonist. Yuja is a fun-loving and energetic boy. He is very theatrical and loves to entertain people, traits he seems to inherited from his father. He idolized and loved his father very much and wishes to become like him one day. After his father disappeared, Yuya was left heartbroken and traumatized by the event. Yuja acts like a fool merely to beat people for insulting him about his father disappearing. Yuja tends to display a more serious demeanor whenever a situation calls for it. Due to his initial buffoonery, his friends and other people are often baffled by Yuja's behavior and believes he doesn't take things seriously. Yuja has proven to be quite clever and skilled in his theatrical tricks and in combat. Yuja has sometimes struggles with self-confidence. As such, when he finds himself cornered, or something happens that breaks his confidence, he tends to hold his arm across his face so nobody can see his eyes. At times like these, he relies on support from his friends or his mother to regain his confidence. When Yuja performs or battles, he announces ""Ladies and gentlemen!"". He is capable of summoning objects you'd find at a circus; throwing knives, balancing balls, juggling balls, curtains, etc. However, his true power lies within him, something that was purposely hidden from him by his family.Mirabel Magia Mirabel Is the Series Main Supporting Character. She has a very relaxed, upbeat, and cheerful personality, and tends to display a lack of lady-like manners. Mirabel is a very emotional, strong-willed and emphatic person who puts all her heart and effort into the things she does. Kindhearted and empathetic, Mirabel is the type of person who consistently tries her best to aid and support the people around her. She is very sensitive to the pain of others and has been known to cry frequently on behalf of people who won't cry for themselves. As one who values family (immediate and extended) above most other things, Mirabel is a bit of a worrier and concerns herself with the welfare of people she cares about. It is likely this care that makes her so popular with the other students of Eclaeniths. She belongs to a clan who specializes in taming beasts. She has a preference towards cuter animals, often seen petting them or pointing them out to Yuja Harri.Ana Phenex Ana Is the Series Main Supporting Character. Ana comes from a long line of Phenex who served under Death as one of his elite Reapers. In recent Centuries, her Mother and Older Sister have served and now it is Ana's turn. At first, she initially joined because of family duties, but once she meets Yuja and Mirabel, she sees that she should to be a reaper for her own reasons. Ana is a kind and determined woman with a strong sense of nobility and justice. She is no naive idealist. Ana smiles a lot with almost everyone and remains positive. She is shown to be caring and loving to her comrades, and most especially to her older sister. She'll do what she can do so that she'll make her sister happy by cooking her some of her favorite foods. Because of her family's lineage of the Phoenix, her crimson and sparkling hair attracts everyone's gaze. She wears her nobility on her sleeve but isn't uptight or arrogant about it. She views everyone as her equal, nobility and commoners alike.What's In It For Me? That is an excellent question. Well, take a look to the right and see the different rewards that are available for different pledge amounts. You'll notice that most of them include gaining access to the WebComic. But that's only part of the story. If the drive is successful, everyone who pledges $25 or more will get the special privilege of being added into the Story as a Cameo Character!What If You Beat Your Goal? That's the incredible part, if that does happen, the show doesn't stop there. The more that is pledged, we can take those extra pledges and work towards completing much more chapters of the WebComic AND even start printing physical copies of Nightmare Academy!Whatever happens, though, I want to thank all the fans who have been waiting patiently for me to come up with a plan to get these pages into your hands (well, more like mobile or computer screens. $30k gets you the pages right into your hands). With luck (and enough support), we'll get the whole Nightmare Academy Chapter published so that we can continue onto a new chapter.What If I Have No Idea How Kickstarter Works? If you're not familiar with Kickstarter or how it will work, here's a brief overview. For the next 30 days, you'll be able to make pledges to help support this project, ranging from $1 to whatever you can afford. For your pledge, you can select one of the reward packages—listed to the right—of equal or lesser value to your pledge. You can always pledge more than the minimum to get a reward if you want (and for some packages, you'll need to do so if it must be shipped internationally). Your credit card or other account will not actually be charged at the time you make your pledge, and you can change your mind right up to the final deadline.If the final deadline comes and we've reached our goal, then everyone gets charged the amount they pledged at once. But if for some reason we don't meet our goal, then the whole thing is called off. No one gets charged, no fees are applied, everyone just keeps their money. So there's no risk of putting up money and then Chapter One gets delayed longer. However, that also means no rewards for you, which is a terrible shame since the rewards are so awesome *jabbing your sides with my elbow*Sample Manga PagesStretch GoalsThe primary production costs of this Kickstarter will go toward finishing the First Chapter of the WebComic, which is why additional stretch goals will be mostly focused on completing the first Volume digitally and being able to print physical copies.

I am harpist, singer, keyboardist, composer, Tracy DeMarco. I began The Glass Hour project in 2004 to showcase a new music I envisioned mixing the music of the Folk Harp with elements of rock, orchestration, and rich ethereal vocals. In my first recording released in 2005 I joined with progressive rock drummer/guitaritst Ed Nudd and guitarist Matthew Schneider to create the album ""Amaranthine"" - a great success, and loved by those have listened to the songs. This first venture is a primarily acoustic recording, atmospheric, with a very relaxed, dreamlike quality - though the current planned release has expanded on the storytelling/soundtrack quality of the music, adding more layers of orchestration, harp, vocals, guitar, and bringing a faery tale - something very magical - to life. Titled ""Ever After,"" it is a very emotional journey that finds a deep connection and parallel with the story of our lives and the workings of the natural world. I'm very happy to have guitarist and keyboardistBrian Bradbury join me on this latest journey for select tracks, and adding a rock influence to the story.With your support - funding will go towards, the mastering and CD production of this new release - to happen as I've envisioned it. I've always felt that the the visual and auditory go hand and hand, and so have created a full booklet of personal, lovely artwork and lyrics that I'd like to package with the CD so that it might be a keepsake for many years to come. I also plan to create an all instrumental master that may be marketed for film, documentary, and other media.The album begins with the story of a faery that lost her companion to some tragic end, and through the album, the mood and seasons change as would the experience of anyone going through a period of grief, loss or other personal difficulty. In the end, we should all remember the best parts of our lives and the gifts of experience and emotion we have shared with loved ones and good friends who have come and gone along the way. The great tale, The Little Prince, has always been an inspiration to me - and I find in this a theme of finding and remembering the things that truly matter in life. There is always hope for renewal. And love will lead us.I perform and work as a solo harpist and keyboardist, improvisational harpist and with groups and others in the Chicago area - and work towards a solo harp album as well with other collaborators, both local and overseas. Please visit my various weblinks to see the range of projects and people I am and have been involved with. Thanks so much!There is something precious in the journey of growth in ourselves and in the lessons that nature has to teach us in patience, diligence and acceptance.

I'm very happy to have guitarist and keyboardistBrian Bradburyjoin me on this latest journey for select tracks, adding rock elements to the project.With your support - funding will go towards, the CD production of this new release - to happen as I've envisioned it. I've always felt that the the visual and auditory go hand and hand, and so have created a full booklet of personal, lovely artwork and lyrics that I'd like to package with the CD so that it might be a keepsake for many years to come. I also plan to create an all instrumental master that may be marketed for film, documentary, and other media.I perform and work as a solo harpist and keyboardist, improvisational harpist and with groups in the Chicago area - and collaborate with other artists both local and overseas. Please visit my various weblinks to see the range of projects and people I am and have been involved with. Thanks so much!There is something precious in the journey of growth in ourselves and in the lessons that nature has to teach us in patience, diligence and acceptance. From the song ""Summer""...""ever growing, never knowing, how we'll turn out to be -never the way that we see -oh our song....a garden...""",

https://www.kickstarter.com/projects/572900727/native-spirit-creations?ref=discovery_category_newest,572900727/native-spirit-creations,"I'm wanting to start my own Native American Art business. I have been making native art and selling it since I was 12 years old. I'm about a quarter Cherokee and I've been taught many things, I wish to share it with the masses and even teach others how in my free time. I make Dream catchers, medicine bags, different types of bead work, necklaces, bracelets and paint some. It may not pay any bills and it may not be 100% traditional but I like to help people anyway I can. I make stuff with leather, feathers, beads, stones with other natural materials and any other materials I can find and use not originally made for its purpose. I often find things for free that I can use like metal hoops or disregarded jewelry or costume items. I've always thought I would make an imprint on the world and my name be recognized in some way. This surely would help me achieve my goals and dreams. I've always seen this happening in some way but I've fell short on funding or just not enough encouragement from others sometimes. I love to do what I do and I plan to keep making art for the rest of my life because its more fun than work to me. If only more people realized the changes I'm making all around me and the positive effect all my art has the more people would want to participate and grow with me and with the others around. I have a lot to offer and I know I wont come up short on anything I put my mind to. Handmade American crafts and arts seems to be thinning down and the more I make stuff the more small businesses get my business when I'm buying materials so it helps a lot all around. I do once in a while buy things out of country due to lower costs but I still am able to put out great art with great quality and the money I receive I want to put right back into my towns economy most the time if I can. Everyone wins when I do the work!","My full intention is to help heal the world by my art and help people heal their own mind, body and spirit as naturally as we can. I would really like some assistance on maintaining a website and computer and things needed to really help my business grow. I have some coding skills and know how to make free sites. I have been learning site building techniques and writing code since I was 12 years old as well. I'm decent at graphic design too, so I will be able to make it appealing to others to come visit.  I always hit my deadlines on any jobs early or on time and ship the best available product made. I'd like to make highly customizable tables for products including color, size, materials, beads, stones etc. on drop down menus so it will feel more personal and special for the buyer. I do have friends that could help but their time is more valuable than mine on some things I lack. I'm always super excited for a new custom item someone requests me to make and it makes me feel great when I finish in the right amount of time and always feels like its worth my time and energy. If I had more people backing me and promoting what I do I would go so far and wide. I've only been able to do self promoting. I do enjoy how I've been doing it although I would like to try something new this is where I'm asking you for help in the pursuit of this grand Idea I've always been able to see and always felt right about. I'll be able to help build and finish the website within a month and have all things needed to do so.",https://www.kickstarter.com/projects/572900727/legendary-enlightening-belts?ref=discovery_category_newest,572900727/legendary-enlightening-belts,"My mom makes swelling reducing, pain reducing and weight reducing agate belts. She really wishes she can get a professional website for that and more of her art as time goes by. She's been doing really great with this idea. All the feedback I hear is amazing! I really wish more people knew about this wonderful product she has available. People really like the style she makes them in and how easy it is to wear and lose inches. Time after time I'm seeing people lose weight or swelling goes down or pain almost instantly disappears. People often tell other people and the word of mouth is stunning. ","The website and computer maintenance is a huge key in this project. We know who to talk to so we can get help then we can give some ideas and build a site for her. We are just a little behind on people helping out and backing us.  I know if she finally had a good site she would do so amazing and people say it to her all the time. She does have her own business but it really isn't focused on the art which is alright and it gets her bills paid but I always wanted more for my mom . Her dream has always been to make art at home and sell to the masses in a different way beyond merchant sites. I also have this dream too and I can see it clearly and its gonna happen. Every time she has a deadline shes quick to get it done in an orderly fashion and make the right choices. I want to help her out as much as I want to help the world. When she is making these belts and getting them out to the people, its having a huge effect making people more happy with themselves with the less weight, less pain and less swelling. Overall everything she is doing is making a huge impact on this world and I can see it clear as day. She's been helping people for years from Peace Corps to being a counselor. Now she's helping people all naturally with her own artwork.  I've always looked up to her and I wish more people did she is an amazingly smart and independent woman! I will be able to design and help make the website within a month and I will not fail."

By you just reading this, it means a lot to us.

If fundingand time allows, we would like to expandsupportfor iPad and iPad Mini and Android OS; think of possibly stretchgoals?!

But let me introduce myself...My name is Jason Marchalonis; I am the founder and leader developer for Grove Media Studios. Prior to the founding of Grove Media Studios, I was a freelance web consultant in NJ who represented clients from diverse industries, education and government. I served as Media Director for the International Council for Innovation in Higher Education from 2008 to 2011 and focused on facilitating mobile education for emerging countries. But, that is enough about me!As of June, our first iOS Game hasbeen released titled Bankrupt the Bank!... It is an addictive iOS game based on thimblerig aka the islandgamblingshell game. It is supported on all iOS devices. Inlcuded below are a few screenshot and it can be viewed at (https://itunes.apple.com/us/app/bankrupt-the-bank!/id516785828?mt=8).There are two main concepts behind the idea of this project; they arenostalgiaand addicting game play. There are hundreds of thousands of games currently on the App Store and we knew that to capture the market, we would really have put thought and time into creating the prefect game.The idea is simple, do you remember those handheld games that were popular from the 60s up until around the mid 90s that would use air to propel balls, basketballs or rings through water and caught? It is ok if you don't, we do and miss those games very much so. In fact, today, it is extremely hard to get your hands on one of these and that there was the problem. The solution was simple, we decided topainstakinglyrecreate the game so that it can find its way back into the hearts of all of those who once played and loved it as much as we do; this goes double for preserving the experience for our future children and grandchildren.First we had to come upwitha way to simulated the effect of water and gravity. With theusageofaccelerometers, we have been able to recreate the affects of the originalhandheld game and make it even better at the same time. You will be able to play utilizing both theaccelerometersand just applied gravity.Next, we had to maximize the screen area andoptimizeit for both the 3.5 and 4in Retina screens. To tackle this, we created alayering system, we can produce a breathtakingand simplistic stage that not only adds transparencyformaximizedscreen area, but also allows for an less obtrusivecontroller experience. Can you imagine what this could look like on an iPad? Hint...Next, we wanted to implement some socialfeatures, but we value your privacy and didn't want to getinvolvedwithFacebookor Twitter. So we kept it short and sweet and are going to implementedleader boardsand achievements using Apple's Game Center service. Most iPhone users who have downloaded at least one game already use their service.Next and finally, we have been throwing around the idea of making different themes and game modes, but we did not want to create a app that relied on in-apppurchasesforvariousreasons. For us, it is all about the userexperienceand in-apppurchasesdid not fit into that model. So, once we are done building Water Games, we will push out updates with new themes and branch out into new a series ofWater Games apps. For many of you who back us, these will be included in the ""Five for one"" and ""One for all""pledges and the updates are of course free to current app owners!Creating this game from the concept state until where it is today has been a very time consuming process and we have noticed that we do not have all the funds it is going to take to get this to the market.We are currently developing on older MacBook Pros which can barely handle running the Xcode and the software needed to design our graphics and multimedia effectively. So, we would like to purchase a new MacBook or iMac to speed up development processing and get this game into your hands much faster. As a small startup, this will go a long way for us as we head into the future.Additionally, we would like to purchase testdevelopmentdevices so that we can ensure that our game works on each device properly. Currently, we can only testing againstthe built in iOS simulator which doesn't not do an justice foraccelerometersand real hardware.We must to pay Apple all applicablefees associated with the iOS Developer Program Membership and any other softwarelicenses.Lastly, we need to explore thepossibilityof getting a trademark or copyright on our work; both of which are expensive and long processes.Our minimum budget allows us to complete the game. However, the greater the amount we are able to raise, the more developers we can have working on this project; whichultimatelymeans, better graphics and a much faster release date. We also would love to get this game to utilize the larger screen sizes of the iPad and iPad mini!Another veryimportantthing to remember is that, Kickstarter will not charge your credit card unless we are able to raise the minimum amount of money required. Any donations will be canceled if we do not reach our goal. We hope that is not the case and we get this game in your hands! We are really excited about this and we hope your are also.Our promise to you is a 100% completed game and nothing less! We also pledge to you that there will be complete transparently and you will know exactly what we know, when we know! Communication is golden and we would expect nothing less of ourselves.","As expected with any project, there are risks and challenges in delivering the Water Games. First of all, we’re still working on finalizing the game and its coding. That means some issues may still arise or exist, however unlikely that may be. Most of the “big” issues have been tackled already as we have a beta version together, but there is still much to do when it comes to finishing the product.Currently, there is a remotely small chance we could run into delays with our outdated development systems, but with the successful funding of this project, that will no longer exist and we will be able to get this project into your hands every quicker than we currently expect. If time allows, we would love to add support for the iPad and iPad mini.Lastly, we have a great team of developers ready to work on the game and we are very excited at the talent they posses. Furthermore, we have assessed our goal meticulously and repeatedly to ensure a successful campaign. However, that doesn’t guarantee there will be no surprises.",https://www.kickstarter.com/projects/jmarchalonis/aqua-arcade-an-addicting-indie-ios-game-free-demo?ref=discovery_category_newest,jmarchalonis/aqua-arcade-an-addicting-indie-ios-game-free-demo,"*Scroll down to see more videos and get access to the FREE! version.Prelude?Hey Kickstarter, thank you for checking out our project.

Can you imagine what this could look like on an iPad? Hint... Next, we wanted to implement some social features, but we value your privacy and didn't want to get involved with Facebook or Twitter. So we kept it short and sweet and are going to implemented leader boards and achievements using Apple's GameCenter service. Most iPhone users who have downloaded at least one game already use their service.Next and finally, we have been throwing around the idea of making different themes and game modes, but we did not want to create a app that relied on in-apppurchases for various reasons. For us, it is all about the user experience and in-app purchases did not fit into that model. So, once we are done building Aqua Arcade, we will push out updates with new themes and branch out into new a series of Aqua Arcade apps. For many of you who back us, these will be included in the our pledges and the updates are of course are free to current app owners! Aqua Arcade:Beta vs. Limited Free VersionRather than releasing an early beta version and having to collect sensitive information from our backers, we have decided that it would be in the best interested of everyone to have access to a free one level demo of Aqua Arcade called Aqua Arcade Free! which is live on the Appstore and available for all iOS devices. Direct link to the free version is as follows...https://itunes.apple.com/us/app/aqua-arcade-free!/id687974255?mt=8Aqua Arcade Free!: Preview Video!So, why Kickstarter?Creating this game from the concept state until where it is today has been a very time consuming process and we have noticed that we do not have all the funds it is going to take to get this to the market.We are currently developing on older MacBook Pros which can barely handle running the Xcode and the software needed to design our graphics and multimedia effectively. So, we would like to purchase a new MacBook or iMac to speed up development processing and get this game into your hands much faster. As a small startup, this will go a long way for us as we head into the future.Additionally, we would like to purchase test development devices so that we can ensure that our game works on each device properly. Currently, we can only testing against the built in iOS simulator which doesn't not do an justice for accelerometers and real hardware.We must to pay Apple all applicable fees associated and any other software licenses.Lastly, we need to explore the possibility of getting a trademark or copyright on our work; both of which are expensive and long processes.Our minimum budget allows us to complete the game. However, the greater the amount we are able to raise, the more developers we can have working on this project; which ultimately means, better graphics and a much faster release date. We also would love to get this game to utilize the larger screen sizes of the iPad and iPad mini!Another very important thing to remember is that, Kickstarter will not charge your credit card unless we are able to raise the minimum amount of money required. Any donations will be canceled if we do not reach our goal. We hope that is not the case and we get this game in your hands! We are really excited about this and we hope your are also.Aqua Arcade: Previews! Aqua Arcade: Preview Video!Aqua Arcade Sports Edition!: Preview Video!Add-On PledgesFrom being involved in the Kickstarter community, we know from experience that people love having the ability to add on extra rewards by increasing their pledges.

In addition,Grove Media Studios will be donating an additional 5% of future sales to various charities throughout the following year.","Let’s be honest, making a game is a huge undertaking. And making a GOOD game is even more challenging. We still have a lot of work ahead of us, but we are extremely dedicated – nights and weekends included! We are on the path to something wonderful and want to share this game with you and the world. Currently, there is a remotely small chance we could run into delays with our outdated development systems, but with the successful funding of this project, that will no longer exist and we will be able to get this project into your hands every quicker than we currently expect. If time allows, we would love to add support for the iPad and iPad mini.Lastly, we have a great team of developers ready to work on the game and we are very excited at the talent they posses. Furthermore, we have assessed our goal meticulously and repeatedly to ensure a successful campaign. However, that doesn’t guarantee there will be no surprises."

Well, it happens to me all the time.Small dogs have less energy than us and even though they try to keep up with us, they may get tired.Then you lift your dog but after a while, your hands kinda hurt (in my case it hurts a lot because I have severe Rheumatoid Arthritis).All these years I've been looking for something to carry Minnie so I can take her with me shopping or if I want to walk a little further. It was very frustrating because some of the things that I found were not ideal for me or my dog and others were so bulky I didn't know where to put it while she was walking.That's why I decided to design KangooHug, I bought a Brother sewing machine and put those creative juices to work :)The concept is simple: A crossbody bag to put your dog inside. When the dog's not using it, you can either fold it and put it in a pocket or just keep it on your neck because it doubles as a scarf! No more clutter-------------My goalI would like to secure the materials to produce this at a larger scale and make it available for all pet lovers like me who could always use something to make their life easier.All the manufacturing work for this project will be done in the United States.So this project is designed and manufactured with Love in America:)---------------Thank you for checking out my project and I hope you like it as much as I do and want to back it.Please share this project - Sharing is caring :)","Securing the right amount of fabric for this project is crucial and I'll know as we go because depends on the number of backers.

https://www.kickstarter.com/projects/faircraft/wine-wench?ref=discovery_category_newest,faircraft/wine-wench,"Like many of you, I like to enjoy an evening out drinking with friends. Or better yet, entertaining those friends in my home. Being the nice guy I am, I was always bringing peoples' drinks to them from the bar or the kitchen. I soon realized that carrying only two drinks at a time with a lot of thirsty people around just wasn't going to do it.I was tired of making to many trips up and down the stairs, in and out the doors, and from the bar to the table. I tried trays to carry drinks, but that just ended up with broken glass and especially didn't work well after i had a few myself.I decided I needed something easier to use, convenient, and super lightweight. I quickly made something on my scroll saw so I could carry two wine glasses (or margarita glasses) in each hand. After using it a few times and talking about what to call it Wine Wench became a reality. After a few weekends,Wine Wench became a necessity at home and on trips to wineries.Wine Wench fits in your pocket or purse with ease, and is ready when you are.With Wine Wench, you can free up your other hand for something more even when there's only two glasses to carry.You can use Wine Wench with or without the base and with any stemware of your choice. All glasses fit nicely and are more secure doing transport than a tray.Special Occasions call for Special Tools. We made Stubby Wench just for those occasions. Perfect for your back pocket during parties and the perfect addition to any plate.","Our team is very familiar with the materials and processes that are used to make Wine Wench. We don't foresee any major challenges with manufacturing and delivery. However, we are perfectionists, so if we start getting good ideas to make wench wench better, we are going to be hot on making those design changes. We have very high confidence in our suppliers, as most of them are local and we can pay them a QC visit if needed. Overall, Wine Wench production and delivery should go without issue.",https://www.kickstarter.com/projects/faircraft/outdoor-wine-table?ref=discovery_category_newest,faircraft/outdoor-wine-table,"Enjoying a bottle of wine and a plate of pairings is a joy of life that should not be bound to the indoors. Now you can enjoy that bottle of wine wherever you desire.We started off making our wine tables piece by piece, just to test the viability of the product. The initial reaction was great! We were even featured on BuzzFeed and The Today Show!With an Outdoor Wine Table, enjoy wine...Now we need to increase the quality of our materials and scale the production to bring this to market. We are excited to get the appropriate tooling and the highest quality materials to make the wine table a mass market reality. Thanks!","We are very confident in our ability to produce these tables. Our only challenge will be learning to do our current processes at a much larger scale, and handling large quantities of materials. Overall, this is a very low risk project once its funded."

The West Coast offers a variety of exotic wild life, ocean backdrops and lighting conditions unlike anything available in the Great Lakes. Who will be the stars of the show? Playful crabs, majestic sharks and corals, ethereal jellyfish and other vistas unique to the American West Coast. I will be using the photographs taken on this expedition for the basis of a coffee table book I am hoping to release late 2017.The purpose of this funding is to purchase accommodations on a charter dive boat, rented oxygen tanks, lens and other expenses related to the expedition.","Diving involves a level of inherent risk, however I do not foresee encountering any situations that would be beyond my diving ability (I have C-Card certification, deep water certifications, nitrox, drysuit certification and eight years of diving experience.

Ever since I was 10 I wanted to record my own album. Having chosen a life of working and practicality instead of pursuing my dreams, I decided a couple months ago and nearing 50, it is now time. I have recently downloaded music production recording equipment and purchased microphones and since I have some amateur experience in mixing music, I have started practicing with some free youtube clips I have come across.In order to get my music on spotify, i-tunes, pandora, and any other saleable way, I uncovered that I will need to purchase the rights to the music which can be quite costly. I'm finding all kinds of amazing beats and music that I have written lyrics to and want to write lyrics for as well as record my vocals to.My stage name is Milano Breeze and the first production I want to call dreamer. I've already got 5 songs ready to put on the production and have released them as non profit for people to listen to but getting the backing will allow me to revise the music the way I want it to be so that I can re-record it and be able to benefit with monetization. In order to do that, I want to raise money in order to afford the beats.My goal is to put a compilation of 15-16 songs together that are inspired by my life. I am a gay man with many LGBT friends and as there aren't a lot of openly gay/lesbian artists, I want to make a difference in my community as well as bridge that gap that sometimes separates the LGBT community from the straight community.I appreciate all the help an support I can get.","Currently the only risks and challenges would be time.  The fact that working full time and this project will happen during my off time and with family commitments, the project may take longer. This project is something important to me and will be priority so I don't foresee not being able to keep my commitments.",https://www.kickstarter.com/projects/milanobreeze/milano-breeze-dreamer?ref=discovery_category_newest,milanobreeze/milano-breeze-dreamer,"I attempted getting funds with Kickstarter and believe I may have made some mistakes as I wasn't able to make my campaign happen. This time I'm determined to achieve the funds and make these dreams come true.Ever since I was 5, maybe younger, I wanted to be an entertainer. I was listening to albums on my parents record player for as long as I can remember. I was inspired by artists like Barry Manilow and Elvis Presley. I would subject my parents to little shows in the living room from the moment that I could sing and dance.I continued my childhood making sure I was part of the choirs and in High School I auditioned for choir and was placed in the Chorale which was the highest honor, not to mention that only Juniors and Seniors were allowed, but they made an exception for a sophomore that loved to sing.Throughout High School I wrote and recorded over 100 christian pop songs with my little keyboard. They were my life experiences up to that point. After graduating, instead of taking the chance of being the struggling artist and making my way to Nashville or California, I decided to join the work force.I still wrote music and lyrics but I was also coming into my own. I began accepting the fact that I was gay and it was conflicting a great deal with my christian life. I was getting my vocal outlet from karaoke and continuing to record my songs.This brings us to 2019. I decided that almost being 50 I was not going to die without attempting to pursue my true dreams. I would feel as if it were a wasted life if I didn't at least try. (I'm not planning on dying anytime soon :) I've been inspired in beat creators that sell their music in hopes of finding some lyricists and vocalists to utilize their music.Long story short, I have come to Kickstarter to try and get the funds to purchase the music that I love by these artists, then go into my studio and record the music to make my first official compilation of music. The funds will help purchase the music along with copyright my lyrics.The songs recorded will be an eclectic mix of pop music that tells my stories. It will cover the last 30 years of my life if not all of them. I've got more than half of the compilation written and just need the assistance financially to turn it to fruition. I am also using my own money, so I'm not requesting help without contributing my finances to this project also. The compilation that I will be titling ""Dreamer"" will happen, it will just take longer without your help.My stories not only inspire the LGBT community even though these are the days of my life, but I write about things that affect everyone. It's music and lyrics that will move everyone.Thank you in advance for helping support this project and just some fun facts about me:I have kept singing in the gay community. Over the last 10 years I have performed in venues all over Wisconsin, throughout Michigan and even in Missouri. I have competed in male pageantry and at 44 in 2015, I became Mr. Gay Wisconsin USofA. I'm not strictly a dreamer, because I find dreamers don't work to make their dreams come true...I'm a dreamer determined to see my CD happen, and after, a United States Tour, but 1 dream at a time.","As this is my second attempt at achieving the financial goals from Kickstarter, I'm well aware that it may not happen again, but I will be promoting this to everyone, and this time I've got my number 1 supporter behind me rooting me on. If I don't achieve the funds, the project will still happen, it will just take a lot longer to achieve."

To produce the artwork, coding and production necessary to finish this set of greeCards (see strech goals), it will require as many as 5 skilled designers with multiple specialties working full time, 3 skilled programmers (or more) for 4 - 5  months. This greeCards will require expertise in the following areas: concept artist, 2D designeres for the printed cards, 3D designers for the augmented reality and design of each 3D element, animation artist, sound creation and edition, music creation and edition, integration of the APIs for video and message adding, interative programmer, SQL dataBase programmer.We have printed the cards in a printer but in order to make enough for you to have one as well, we need to place a substantial minimum order for the first production of greecards in the big printers.

https://www.kickstarter.com/projects/301157385/glitch-3?ref=discovery_category_newest,301157385/glitch-3,"After wrapping up production of my first short film, Rift Walker, I knew immediately that I had to make another. So a few weeks later, I began working on the script for Glitch. I was done in no time, so the next step was to begin casting.Well, the production for Glitchhas a much broader scale in mind than I'm accustomed to working with, and I ultimately had to come to the conclusion that, unlike Rift Walker, producing this film with absolutely no budget is impossible.The actors in Glitchare donating their time in order to help me bring my vision to life, and since they are not being paid, at the very least, I should be able to provide meals at the shoots, and pay for their parking (since parking anywhere in Downtown Atlanta, most likely you will have to pay a fee), things that, as of now, I am incapable of doing.Along with this, I am in need of other equipment that I do not own. Things such as a generator to power the lights for night shoots, other types of lighting rigs, and a stedicam rig. I hope to be able to go the economic route, and buy the parts for these various items, so that I can DIY it and build my own equipment, that I can also keep to use for future projects.","Initially, when going into production for this project, I found myself way in over my head. My first film was fairly easy to make, because the cast consisted of 3 main roles, the actors for which all had the same class schedules as myself and my cameraman. This time around however, I am looking at about 7 main roles, and 5 extra/speaking roles, all of whom are on their own schedules. On top of this, there are various locations (most of which are on the campus of my school) to be filmed.However, I refuse to let these challenges get the better of me. My desire to see this film made and released; for people to enjoy my work, drives me to keep pushing forward until one way or another, the project is completed.",https://www.kickstarter.com/projects/301157385/glitch-5?ref=discovery_category_newest,301157385/glitch-5,"We attempted to film GLITCHa total of 3 other times prior to completing it on our 4th attempt in the summer of 2017. In its initial concept, GLITCH was a short film of the same title that was just going to be uploaded to YouTube with no particular end goal in mind. But, after the 3 failed attempts -- all of which we were well into production for -- we decided to accept the challenge of adapting the film to feature format and going the film festival run route.Principal photography for GLITCHtook place between January and July of 2017 in Atlanta and the surrounding metropolitan area. Our production team includes current/former Georgia State University film students as well as professional actors based out of Atlanta.GLITCH is currently in consideration for the Atlanta Film Festival, Austin Film Festival,Nashville Film Festival, SCAD Savannah Film Festival, and Jim Thorpe Independent Film Festival. We are also planning to submit to the Atlanta Underground Film Festivaland New Orleans Film Festival by the end March.Now that the film has been completely shot and edited, we're looking towards the future of the project. With YOUR help, we can raise the funds necessary to distribute GLITCH to an online streaming service once it is done with its festival run in the Fall of 2018. Netflix is our ultimate goal, but in the event that GLITCH is not chosen for the platform, we will distribute to both iTunes and Amazon.","Our goal for distribution is ultimately Netflix, but because Netflix has to approve and content submitted to them, there is a chance that they will not choose to stream Glitch. In this case we will distribute to iTunes and Amazon which, as they are video-on-demand services, do not have to expressly approve the film for it to be available on their servicesThe best part is, since the film is already done, there is no risk of an incomplete project."

Fundamental browsing concepts like linear browsing was introduced in NotJustBrowsing web browser. In April 2015 ""NotJustBrowsing Desktop"" was published in a view to provide desktop and browsing functionality in one place in a similar way. Now, NotJustBrowsing for Android is designed and is close to completion having a similar design as browser in ""NotJustBrowsing Desktop"". The idea is to produce one desktop/browser look and feel for all platforms (e.g., Windows, Android, iOS) and this version of NotJustBrowsing for Android is the effort in that direction.Funds will free me from other responsibilities to complete NotJustBrowsing for Android and they will help me to produce NotJustBrowsing for iOS.Some of the funds, I would like to divert towards marketing of this product, towards buying a MacBook. The more funds I will get the more quickly I will implement and produce this unique experience for users.I will always keep this thing in my mind that I got funding for my projects from general public. You may express your wishes in NotJustBrowsing Forum.If I get 1000 backers of my project by 4th July 2015, I will post them basic beta version by 9th July 2015.","There is hardly any risk in this project because project is nearly (95%) complete.

First of all, thank you for your interest in our project! 'One for the ages' is an animated short that I have been developing over the past three years. The movie is approximately 6-8 mins long. The animation is already in progress and we are very keen on completing it soon. We need your help to finance this epic adventure and bring the magical world of books into life. We believe in this story and really want to bring this to you. The Story'One for the ages' tells the story of two books whose only purpose in life is to be read. When they find out they are being replaced by technology, they must embark on a journey. Genre 'One for the ages' is an animated short comedy. We are creating a world where books come into their own.

Avinash was born in India and has been living in the United States for the past 8 years. He is driven by an intense desire to create. 'One for the ages' is his first adventure in film making. AnimatorRahul is a free-lance animator. He works from India. He has been involved in many animation shorts before. Here is a link to his profile:http://www.behance.net/leanimaComposerWe have been working with musicians to find the right fit. We will update here as soon as we have finalized the composer. What will the money be used for? We have evaluated the minimum cost to be $5000. This is mostly to pay the animator, the music composer and the costs to cover the rewards. Anything over $5000 will be used to do more with the movie such as promotion etc. We are working on a tight budget. ","Once the funding is available, the only foreseeable risk is that the finish date might slip. Mainly due to the fact that the people working on this are spread across geographically. We estimate 4 months of work once we have the complete finance. We have been working very hard over the last few months.

https://www.kickstarter.com/projects/1599735591/brians-debut-electronica-album?ref=discovery_category_newest,1599735591/brians-debut-electronica-album,"I come from an interesting musical background. My grandfather was a multi-instrumentalist who played banjo, piano, organ, flute, piccolo, and clarinet. For a time, he played with the Paul Whiteman Orchestra and the Dorsey Brothers. He was close friends with Ferde Grofé, whom he often joined on fly-fishing trips up the Black River in Michigan.Grandpa McNett also built radios. The love of electronics runs in the family. Dad was a radioman in the Navy.Me? I took to both at an early age. My early influences come from the 1960's, but really take off with the Berlin School musicians of the 1970's, like Tangerine Dream and Klaus Shulze, plus Krautrock legends like Hans-Joachim Roedelius (with a fair bit of Fripp and Eno mixed in for good measure).Don't look to me for dance music. I love it, it's just not what I perform or write. What I do is properly classified as ""Space Music"". Old School Ambient Electronica on Steroids.My pride and joy. No MIDI, no patch memory, no presets. Every sound you hear from this little bundle of electronic heaven is sculpted by turning the knobs and throwing the switches. This is hands-on music, and every note that comes off this machine is one I played with my own two hands.Here's what the Minimoog can sound like when I play it:http://soundcloud.com/brian-mcnett/minmoog-soloOf course, that's just one setting, and doesn't give the full range or versatility of the instrument.Second ONLY to the MiniMoog. This is an eight-voice analog polyphonic synth under digital control. It's an excellent compliment to the MiniMoog. I use it for lush strings and pads. It's also my go-to MIDI keyboard. Dave Smith is the father of MIDI, so the implementation here is done right. I love this thing!http://soundcloud.com/brian-mcnett/prophet-08-padThe Slim Phatty is an incredible little synth. It has the most awesome arpeggiator ever! What's an arpeggiator, you ask? An arpeggiator allows you to step through a series of notes based on any chord you play on the keyboard. It can sound something like this:http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/File:Arpeggiator.oggThe audio interfaces are the M-Audio Profire 2626 (26 input channels and 26 outputs. More than I need, for sure, but incredible for that) and the MOTU 8pre (which I have patched into the ADAT inputs of the Profire bringing out eight of the digital inputs of the former (allowing me to use 16 of the 26 audio ins (more possible sound sources than I need. Yay!)). Off to the left is my Livid Instruments Ohm64 controller, and at the bottom of the rack, three Moog Music Moogerfooger effects pedals (Ring Modulator, Low-Pass Filter, and the MIDI MuRF). Also pictured: My right knee. Oops! Here's the Slim Phatty in action:http://soundcloud.com/brian-mcnett/slim-phatty-arpeggiosThis thing is a BEAST, and easily the most expensive synth I own. The cabinets are custom, and alas, the upper one is unfinished. It needs work, as there's a power distribution issue in the upper cabinet. However, all the sound-making parts are in the LOWER cabinet. IF my Kickstarter project exceeds its goal, I'll get the upper cabinet power issue resolved and the sequencer will feature prominently on the album. If not, I'll still be using the modular, but the sequencing will be in MIDI, rather than the old-school style I'd prefer.Oh, and the sheet music? This: http://snd.sc/McrqbyThe modular takes a great deal of time and effort to patch so that it produces sound, so I haven't got a sound sample of it alone. I'll be fixing that in short order. In fact, the modular calls for a full-blown youtube experience. You'll see that here shortly as well.Recording the music is easy. Producing an album from it, harder. There are things like, actually ripping CDs, and the album artwork which have to be considered. For digital downloads there are certain fixed costs. And then there are incidentals -- things you can't predict ahead of time that you'll need to do. $6000 goes a long way to covering those expenses, and I certainly couldn't do that out of pocket.If I go over my goal, then things like having the album professionally mastered become possible. There's also the possibility of a re-mix CD. Then there's this:Yes, I own a second Slim Phatty. It remains in its box for reasons unknown to anyone but me (and I'm not talking). IF I exceed my goal by $1000, this puppy comed out of the box, and I use it on the album. If not, it stays in the box. Basically, I'm holding this Phatty hostage. <evilgrin> Here's the thing -- The Slim Phatty is designed to be chained together polyphonically (up to eight of them). While I'm not proposing to fund gear acquisition syndrome with my Kickstarter, I have existing gear, which I wont use unless the budget allows.There are also additional possibilities which I'll add on as the project advances.",,https://www.kickstarter.com/projects/1599735591/space-opera-libretti?ref=discovery_category_newest,1599735591/space-opera-libretti,"Dystopias are boring. They've become formulaic. The world has ended. Survivors eke out a grim and dark existence. Everything goes wrong. People die. More people die. Then it gets grim and dark (as if it wasn't before). We've decided there's enough grim and dark in the real world without creating more of it as entertainment. And looking out on the publishing landscape we see a distinct shortage of anthologies of light, happy, FUN SF/F. In fact, we can count the number of such anthologies without resorting to two digits in binary. That's right, there's just ONE. It's a very good anthology, but it's carrying a heavy load. We sense a great imbalance in the multiverse, therefore. An open niche which needs filling. However, there's a problem. You see, the alternative to these grim, dark, dystopian nightmare worlds has long been considered to be Space Opera. Heroic Tales of Manly Men Being Manly while Womanly Women are Womanly and Small Furry Aliens Are the Objects of Humor and Derision. This is a cause which of late has been championed by the horrible sorts of people who only see SF/F through a lens of fake nostalgia for a bygone age. What the actual flickeringlight of reason! SF/F isn't NOSTALGIA!So we need an antidote to the antidote to grim and dark tales of grimness and darkness. And besides, the model for space opera is wrong. It's drawn from ""horse opera."" Tales of the old west, and there we are with all that nostalgia again. Our new model for space opera is... well... OPERA! And every opera needs a libretto. (def:the text used in, or intended for, an extended musical work such as an opera, operetta, masque, oratorio, cantata or musical.)However, (what's with all these exceptions!) there's another problem. You see, there's nothing at all new under the sun. Take, for instance, villains. The typical space opera villain has long been the Alien Space Nazi. They're Coming to Earth to Exterminate Us All (but first they'll confine us to death camps and get as much poor-quality labor out of us as they can before we die).Fictional Nazis don't scare us.There are REAL Nazis out there, folks. We usually punch six of them before breakfast.Another hoary old standby of the space opera (often combined with the above), is the Eldritch Lovecraftian Horror From Beyond All Reality. Folks, this thing is so tired there are now Cthulhu PLUSHIES. Your neighbor'skid is wearing a ""Yog-Sottoth is my Co-Pilot"" t-shirt and no one bats an eyelash. If actual Fungi From Yuggoth were to land on Earth, the Queen of England would likely just invite them down for tea.To summarize, we need a more inclusive space opera. Fewer Nazis. No Cthulhu. Better representation for women, especially women of color. Better representation for the whole QUILTBAG-P+/-, Disabled persons. #ownvoices. Sure, we like stories with white guys who fight off evil... In space. Hey, who doesn't like space? You're living in it, you know. But there are other stories. We'd like to read them. We'd like to PUBLISH them for others to read.This is where you come in. You like to read stories too. In fact, as a reader of books, you're already plunking down a good portion of your income on new fiction. So why not, for a few dollars more (Per qualche dollaro in più is a Sergio Leone ""Spaghetti Western"", cue the music, maestro), support a book from start to finish? Help us pay our writers. Help us pay our cover artist. Get cool rewards along the way, and a copy of the book when it comes out. Help us PUBLISH the very book you want to read!Space Opera Libretti will be published in paperback and ebook, featuring 15 to 20 original stories, and maybe a reprint or two.We believe in paying authors as much as possible. After paying for the cover art and [any other small expenses], our authors will be paid an even split of what we earn.Our stretch goals include upping the pay to our writers significantly. Adding value with a limited edition chapbook of flash fiction. A cool thing we haven't decided upon yet but which will be really REALLY cool. MORE ART! A soundtrack! EVEN MORE ART! Another really cool thing which we haven't even thought up yet, but will be even cooler than the other really cool thing we haven't decided upon.Jennifer Lee Rossman is a disabled science fiction geek and assistant editor of Love & Bubbles.

She blogs at jenniferleerossman.blogspot.com and tweets @JenLRossman.Brian McNettAfter 20 years working in network security and anti-spam in a role he describes as “straight out of a William Gibson ‘Sprawl’ novel complete with large Japanese mega-corporation and teams with samurai slogans (Katte kabuto no o wo shimeyo),” Brian McNett is returning to the writing career he abandoned in the 1990s. Suffering an extreme form of an otherwise common sleep disorder, this asexual cyberspace warfare veteran requires a source of electric power, a wireless network and SD card, sleeps ten hours a night and four during the day. Somehow this still fails to qualify as “disabled.” Go figure. His prior writings as a journalist have long been only available on unindexed microfiche, but are now searchable (all three of them). All of the above is written without either hyperbole or sarcasm.He blogs at http://bmcnett.comand tweets @b_mcnett.What would a Kickstarter campaign be without rewards? So we have them.Every supporter will get the ebook! Why would you support us if you weren't?See our Rewards section for our other cool rewards.We can't do it without you. We wouldn't want to do it without you. Without readers there'd be no point in publishing an anthology of fun, light, positive, inclusive space opera.So how 'bout it readers of fiction?

We have months of hard work ahead of us. Selecting the submissions, editing them, dealing with the authors with dignity and respect. Making certain they receive proper payment. As self-publishers, we're on the hook for all facets of book design as well. I'll be frank with you, we have a hard slog ahead of us, but we're confident we can do it.Jennifer has successfully co-edited Love & Bubbles, a queer romance anthology, and has experience in the areas of editing and publishing, as an author, as a first reader for a magazine, and as an editor.Brian has experience as a freelance journalist, proofreader, blogger, and editor.

A man of my parish, Corporal Archie Plant (25yrs) was one of those soldiers so I am making this memorial to him and the other 60,000 killed or injured on that terrible dayThe memorial will consist of 19,240 hand made ceramic tablets (glazed white and each baring the name of a fallen soldier in red letters). They will be 1cm x 1cm x 8cm which is the approximate size of a Lee Enfield cartridge and these will be laid out to form the word LEST.. (Lest we forget).Surrounding this word will be 1,350 hand made, ceramic blue lilies, in memory of the French who died alongside us that day, making a red, white and blue installation of approximately 3m x 5m. This will be unique and a first in naming all those killed in a single memorialEach ‘letter’ will be 3m high and comprised of nearly 5,000 names and I believe any who see it will be moved by the sere number of men who lost their lives on that single dayFrom July 2016 the memorial will be exhibited in Sheffield, Nottingham, Derby, Loughborough, Leicester and Stoke, where it will be seen by many 1000's of people with the possibility of going to other venues as wellOnce exhibited, and after being seen by the public, if the tablets and lilies are sold in presentation boxes for only £2.50 and £5 respectively, this will raise over £50,000, enough to repay rewards and give a large gift to local and relevant good causes, if sell for £5 and £10 this could raise over £100,000. Ibelieve this figure is achievable as I sell ceramic flowers now for £10 each which are not linked to such a unique memorialI have already been on BBC Radio outlining his project and have received interest from a local TV channel who say they will come out when work is underway and ‘they have something to film’ for their news programme.If you have read this far I hope you have been interested by the project and will pledge something.The project needs materials, tools and many, many man hours now, and over the next 9 months, to complete before any 'memorial' money can be generated. It is, sadly, hard, if not impossible, for me to complete this work as I am a single artist (and apprentice) unless some external, initial funding can be raisedAs an additional good thing my apprentice will gain a NVQ for their work on this project and will get some good ceramic and glazing skills which will help them continue in their careerFinal point: If you wish to draw up a legal contract I am happy to sign to prove this is a genuine project","Time is the main concern as the completion date is 9 months away and the sooner the work can be started the easier everything will be.I do, however, believe my apprentice and I can complete the work but I also have 3 artist friends who have agreed to help if needed in the future.Materials are only clay and as such readily available and will cause no hold ups and the work load is achievable in a 5 day week so weekends could be used if delays do occurAs for selling of the work, with the success of the Tower Poppies this installation's sale will easily raise funds as the selling price will be much less than those poppies and with a limited number available i can see a demand for them which will easily gaurantee the funds needed",https://www.kickstarter.com/projects/691755108/somme-1916-2016?ref=discovery_category_newest,691755108/somme-1916-2016,"Please note that no pledged money is accepted unless the full amount is reached and your £1, in to the project now, becomes £40, at the end of the project, benefitting Help for Heroes and local good causesA last point:It was suggested to me by 2 people that if my friends and family are not pledging money why should they - as seen by only a few pledged amounts.Can I say that kickstarter takes a fee of at least 5% and my friends and family are simply giving me some money for the my project and do not wish to 'waste' 5% in fees when they see me most days.------My name is Stephen and I think we should remember our past but help our present and this project will do bothI am creatign tehis memorialat my home studio in Derby to raise funds for charities such as Help for Heroes and local homeless shelters and to remember a tragic day in WW1The memorial will be a first in naming all the 19,240 British Commonwealth Soldiers who died on that terrible day at The Somme, 100yrs ago, 1st July 1916I, and my helpers, will make 19,240 white, ceramic tablets, each bearing the name, in red, of a fallen British Commonwealth soldier along with 1,350 blue, ceramic lilies, in memory of the French who died alongside us.The memorial will be exhibited for 20 weeks (July-November 2016) in Derby, Nottingham, Stoke, Sheffield, Loughborough, Leicester, Leek, Ashbourne, Ashby, Chesterfield, Melbourne, Matlock Bath and ArnoldThe project is also going to 6 local schools so pupils can make lilies and also learn a little about WW1 and, obviously, this projectAt the exhibition's end the pieces will be sold off individually and raise funds for charities and local good causes. Even if each piece only sells for £4 this will raise £80,000We have commissioned a PERFECT song, as though written 100yrs ago, and sung by a very talented man that will go, on CD, in to the project's book.  link below along with (new revised) wordsI, we have to make over 200 pieces a day and we realised to help do this I needed a 'table clay roller' which costs £700 but now, since this project started, I have found out my 25year old kiln will need replacing at a trade in price about about £2100.Materials and labour are mostly taken care off as these can be paid for on a weekly basisThe roller I MUST have and knew it needed getting at the start to achieve consistant thickness and roll enough clay per day to create the 200 plus pieces neededThe kiln was a unexpected pain in the process but is is slow to heat up and having to fire pieces at least 2 times a week (2 day process each firing) it is highly likely to break down before all pieces are complete as it already blows the 63amp fuze 2 times out of 3 firingsWe have sourced discounted equipment, materials, transportation and other supplies in readiness to begin.Sadly, however, I do not have the funds to buy these two much needed pieces of equipment at this time so hope to find support here in KickStarterI am happy to sign a legal contract for larger amounts if you wish to draw one uphttps://www.soundcloud.com/andy-brewster/from-passchendaeles-fields-mp3From Albert's FieldsA chance finding of notes all wrapped up with a shellThe same bombs that blow all these Germans to HellBrought me a new hope and the heart to fight onWith the promise of love in a music hall songShe sends news of home and says ‘Keep your head down’She tells of her life and her family and townAnd I promise truly that after this warI will leave my green county for that far Northern shoreAnd we hear the Larks singing above the guns roarLike Canary Girls singing on the factory floorSo sing my Canary Girl sing one for meFor I’ll never return now from Albert's dread fieldsTo my hard working girl from the TeesTo my hard working girl……………..For a German machine gun has mown us all downLike a Scythe it cut through all the lads from our townWhere my brothers-in-arms standing proud should beLies a sight that forevermore, no man should seeSo as I lay dying I am writing these linesIn the hope that one day, my true love they will findAnd she’ll read them, and remember me, in her cold Northern townTo tell her how, I held her close, as I lay myself downAnd we hear the Larks singing above the guns roarLike Canary Girls singing on the factory floorSo sing my Canary Girl sing one for meFor I’ll never return now from these faraway FieldsTo my hard working girl from the TeesTo my hard working girl……………..With the letters she wrote to me, held to my heartIn the mud and the blood I must this world departAnd it’s her that I fought for, not this foreign landIf I’d have made it to England – I’d have asked for her handNow the Red Flanders Poppies they grow all aroundThe crosses that mark where we lie undergroundThey’re as red as the lips, I imagined to beOf the girl from the Tees that wrote letters to meAnd we hear the Larks singing no longer guns roarLike Canary Girls singing on the factory floorsSo sing my Canary Girl sing once more for meFor I’ll never return now from where we all fellTo my hard working girl from the TeesTo my hard working girl from the TeesTo my hard working girl from the TeesTo my hard working girl……………..I would say such wonderful things to youYou would say such wonderful things to meIf you were the only Girl in the worldAnd I was the only Boy",There is little risk that the memorial will not be completed if I can start in January 2016 as I have 3 friends willing to help if need beWith the roller and a new kiln (which will be used twice a week for 5 months)  the 200 pieces needed to be completed a day can be metThe lilies will be the same style as my flowers which have sold for £15 each so if asking £10 per lily they should easily recoup all costs of KickStarter and leave substantial funds for charity

These financial problems come because Susan, Jacks girlfriend, is about to give birth.

They will all be unique, and for different types of work. Some fields will have more, some less.But as this will take up a huge amount of time, I want to earn something on it as well, so I can pay bills etc. So figured 250 NOK each logo, wich sums up to 25 000 NOK for all 100 logos, is really cheap.

It's actually quite incredible!Singing strengthens the immune system! Yeah, that's right, people who sing are healthier than people who do not sing! How crazy is that?Not only that, but when you sing your body releases endorphins that give you energy and makes you feel happy! But wait, there's more that singing does for people...did you know that it stimulates circulation, tones the abdominal and intercostal muscles as well the diaphragm?When we sing we are required to breathe more deeply than many typical exercises, which is good for the lungs. It's also natural...infants sing to themselves too!

Unfortunately, in the modern publishing world we need to invest a lot of money in evaluations, criticisms, newspaper articles and book fairs. Above all, we need to turn to literary agencies, because they are intermediaries between the author and the publishing houses. The service of literary agencies is expensive. It doesn't matter, because I strongly believe in my work and I hope to become an established writer of novels one day.My project consists in the collection of three different stories that have a common point. This common point is the existence of the common hero. The common hero is the everyday person who, through his own history, makes a bold choice for a good that is dear to him. Even at the risk of own life.Here I report the plot of my work:A hero is not a fearless warrior, a martyr, or a conqueror of popular consensus; a hero is simply a person. A hero is the chosen one of himself, who makes a choice for a good that is dear to him.Naturally, a bold choice.I, the Narrating Voice, will sing the deeds of three heroes who have accomplished theirschoice. Paolo, a military man devoted to the uniform and faithful to his country, who hasrenounced his military status to pursue his good.The second hero is Chiara, a charming girl with an extraordinary intelligence that, through reason, will lead you on a fantastic journey amongscientific notions and twists.Finally there is Matteo, a brilliant lawyer who will have to remedy aunpardonable error.

And in this letter, I hope to convince you to make a donation to help record my debut CD with my jazz combo made up of Randy Napoleon on Guitar, Jeff Pedraz on Bass, and Steven Boegehold on Drums. All of the musicians have lived and performed in Michigan. Chances are, you have heard one of us if you have been to a corporate party where live jazz was being played. Or even flipped through the radio stations in Detroit.I grew up in a very small house in Clawson, Michigan, with my parents, brother, and sister. Growing up was tough, I carry myself differently because of the way I was brought up. I worked hard to achieve my goals. I don’t let things get in the way of what needs to be done. During High School, I worked hard to balance school, music, work, while still keeping a healthy social life. During this time, my parents went through a complicated divorce. My father ended up moving to the other side of the country and not talking to me, or anyone in the family for eight months. I did not know if he was dead or alive for a very long period of time. My home life was unstable as a result. I had to switch my priorities around to help support my mother and the house. Work became number one in my life. Then music, and then school. I was helping my mother pay bills, helping not only with money, but also emotionally helping her. I was no longer the baby of the family.Throughout High School I was traveling throughout America with my own Jazz Combo performing with the likes of; Christian McBride, Vincent Chandler, Rodney Whitaker, Sean Dobbins, Marcus Belgrave, James Carter, and on one occasion Wynton Marsalis. I was also performing with bands in other genres of music the likes of Jessica Hernandez and The Deltas, The Barefoot Girls, and Ska-Real. At the same time in my life I was taking Auditions throughout the country at universities like Michigan State University, Western Michigan University, Berklee College of Music, University of Michigan, and The New School For Jazz and Contemporary Music. I was accepted into the music schools with very generous scholarships offered to me. Even The New School for Jazz and Contemporary Music offered me a very generous scholarship.The hardest decision was choosing to attend college or to stay home and take care of my still struggling family. I chose to stay and take care of my family. In time, my family would grow again to care for themselves, causing me to make another choice, try to go to college again, or keep living as a professional musician. I chose the latter and enlisted in the United States Marine Corps as a bandsmen. I am currently serving in New Orleans, Louisiana. I am writing you today because I need your help. I am asking for a monetary donation. I am not asking for a specific amount, every dollar will count and help greatly. For an album about my home, my family, I wouldn't look any where else for help. I want to show the world how Detroit is a family. Releasing my debut CD is a very delicate process. I have written 10 original compositions, created my own album artwork, and designed my own booklet for this album. Financial challenges that come along with recording an album include, purchasing studio time at the infamous Solid Sound Recording Studios (Ann Arbor, Michigan), paying the musicians for their time and dedication to this album. I must hire a company to make 1,000 copies of my CD, print the artwork, have the music copy written to prevent stealing of my music. In theory, I could release this album the day after it is recorded, but if I were to do that through iTunes, Amazon, CD Baby or any of the other online companies without help from a record company, the album would be a dead sale within 6 months. But in order for me to break even (with a profit of about $6.00 per CD) I would need to sell around 3,500 copies. If released by a record company, would not be problem. But I cannot do this alone!In order for an album to be ""released"" it must be sponsored by a company, or person. That is why you have received this letter today. Please be my sponsor. I personally invested over $17,000 towards this project. After this CD is all set to go, I will have put over $21,000 into this project. (Studio time, Mixing and Mastering, Musicians, Travel, Copies of the CD's, Studio Engineers, Producer, Pamphlets, Flyers, Etc.) My goal from this letter is to make the final $3,000 to finish the process and release this CD.I honestly appreciate you taking time to read my letter and your consideration for donation. If you do choose to donate, please refer to the form attached so you can see what to expect in return. Please do not hesitate to contact me at any of the below forms of contact with any questions or concerns.

I need your help to receive the proper funds to send it to every single record company I possibly can.This project is a once in a lifetime oppourtunity to release this record.All the risks that come with recording a debut cd are financial.

From birth through about age 8 a ""learning window"" is open that allows kids to learn a language naturally and easily. The younger the learner, the more likely he is to acquire the language with an authentic accent and to retain vocabulary over time. For over 8 years, I have been teaching Spanish to children, and during all that time I have been looking for a great website that children could use to learn Spanish or to reinforce what they learn in School, and so far, I haven't been able to find something like it. For that reason I started this project 2 years ago. I decided to create a fun website for children to learn Spanish. With my experience and with the help of other Spanish teachers we started to plan and create the lessons. We also worked on putting together the way we wanted the site to look like. Since my budget was limited I hired a freelancer from India, who charged me half of what I had quoted here. That has been perhaps the worst experience I have had in my life. All my money was stolen. Despite the lack of money, I wanted to continue with my project. This time, of course, hiring a local company or at least someone outside the country that you know. And to do so, I had to get a loan, but I got an approval for less of what I needed it. The project is almost finished but I run out of funds and I don't want to lose the opportunity of finishing a project that will bring great benefit to children, and that is the reason I am reaching out to you. Thank you in advance for taking the time to read my story and hope my project interests you so you can help me to make this dream come true.

FLA offers Spanish classes in daycares and elementary schools in Atlanta. I really love doing what I do, I am passionate about education and I believe that every child should learn a second language. Since I started my business, parents asked me about tools that they could use to reinforce at home. I researched and researched trying to find a child friendly website, and never found anything ""good enough"". All what I found was websites with tons of advertisements, no child-safe, with external links, poor curriculum, many other with boring images, etc....or expensive software; for that reason I came up with the idea to create a site, a subscription based website, child safe, full of fun where children and or adults :) can learn or reinforce Spanish! This is the link to the website www.123spanishforme.com When you subscribe you will have access to 40 lessons each one with a game to practice what you have just learned, also music videos and read along books. After putting a lot of EFFORT, TIME (more than 2 years), MONEY, higher than the budget I had set, mainly because I hired a company overseas that stole all my money, yes they did, and the website is almost ready to launch, I run out of funds, and that is the reason why I am asking you to support my project. I am so nervous, anxious, excited and positive that it will do well! but I need your help, I need your support!And when it comes to children I really care. My dream is to support education to bring great programs to communities nationwide. And when this projects do well I am going to support children that do not have access to education.Let's all be part of giving children the chance to learn a second language and other cultures!","I already took a risk when I hired a company in India and I lost all what I payed, but I learned my lesson and now I have contracted a great company that is delivering the best results."

Well I always wanted to build my own car. It`s fun, educational but mainly fun! I really want to explain to people how they can build there own car. I will explain in a book (PDF format) how you can build your very own dream car.For dummies? Yes, for dummies. There are lots of videos on youtube and series on tv about cars. But they never show every detail of the process I think that has to change. My book will eventually excist of two parts: A summary of what parts you need to build your own car and a part where I explain every detail how to build a car: what everypart does, how it works, how to design the car etc.Why is this even on kickstarter?I wish everyone could build their own dream car.When will the book come out? I hope I will have the book finished at the end of the year, but the book gets update everytime I work on it so everyone can see the process.Why should I give you any of my money? Because I really need it, every penny counts! Engine`s, gearboxes, metals etc. are not the cheapest products you know....I have no clue how much this project is going to cost so the goal isn`t really set definitely, but I know one thing for sure: I`m going to build one!For questions send me an email:racingfordreams@emailme.nu","There are a few risks: The project may have a little delay because I`m in my last year of highschool. Can`t build it due to heavy engineering skills needed: but you can learn from mistakes ;) but thats the whole idea of this project: to learn, and yes to have fun at building my dream car.BE WARNED:I can`t guarantee to any ""backers"" the project will be a succes, but I will do my best to make sure the book will be written!",https://www.kickstarter.com/projects/846662604/diy-cnc-machine?ref=discovery_category_newest,846662604/diy-cnc-machine,"*Click at the updates tab for more information about my idea*My idea:I want to make my own CNC-machine for cheap. A CNC-Machine is a very powerfull tool to make things fast. I want to create an e-book explaining every single detail of how I made the CNC-machine. The CNC-Machine i will be creating will cost anywhere from 500 to 2000 euro`s, due to trail and learn. The DIY CNC machine in the book will cost the backers around 250 euro`s. I will try to keep the cost of the machine as low as possible for me and you to build.The CNC-Machine:I wanted to create a 3 Axis CNC-Machine which means it can go left,right,up,down,back and forth (X,Y,Z AXIS) just like a 3D printer. Instead of the 3d printer a dremel will be in the place. I want the CNC-machine not only to be able to cut in wood but also to make holes in aluminium.3 stepper motors are connected to a stepper driver. A arduino will control the stepper driver. G-code will tell the stepper driver wich way they need to go.I really hope this project will be a succes, for me and you to learn everything about a cnc machine. Remember! this project can only be a succes if I have enough backers, so please help!","The only risk is that a CNC-machine will be too hard to build thats why I need the money to see what the best parts are for my CNC- machine.I can`t guarantee the CNC-Machine will be a succes but I will explain everything in the e-book I have learned in the process. Neither can I guarantee the CNC will work properly so the wooden/aluminium parts cannot be created for the pledgers, they will however receive the full book, montly updates and an excuse letter for not succeeding of making the custom CNC parts."

A little bit of back story is I tried many many times becoming an actor with no one wanting to pick me up on a project so I volunteered where I could on set where ever I could eventually being tired of not getting payed and putting in the work with minimal credit I started my own company (Studio30 Films LLC) where through the work I have done I made connections with good people that volunteered to help on this amazing short but I feel it is only right to do everything I can to help them get paid as well as having craft servous on this set. At this time we are in pre production until September 12th where we start casting ","Risks of this project is that of course with any film, if it isnt casted right it will go nowhere and i think thats a risks anyone in filmmaking knows and possibly experienced and the challenges is being able to compensate for the crew and cast with travel expenses, time, and food. In order to overcome this I will be paying much of it out of pocket though the crew does understand the micro budget I have I would like to provide to them as much as possible"

A challenge that remains is to have the software produced and finding a distributor.David  Sep 22 2015 Robin,Looking at your flow chart everything looks fine and it makes sense. The only thing I do see is when an IP Packet comes in and gets to the “Connection Cache lookup” and breaks off to “failed lookup” and then goes through the check list, while this only takes a millisecond, it could allow for DOS. If a person logged in and had a PC send constant IP Packets, it could slow down the system and something go wrong. I look at it like this, when someone off site remotes in, they VPN and then once verified that way it then takes them to a second login screen where they then login. I’m assuming that you already have it this way or the AI system will account for it but that is what I noticed in the flow chart. Other than that it looks real good.David Robin Richards Sep 22 2015 David, you are correct in your initial analysis but you are correct the AI system has its own proprietary routine do deal with this occurrence. I have attempted a simulated DOS against a stand alone running the firewall and the AI kept the DOS from occurring"

This fundamentalist church had been the topic of a 1966 documentary entitled “With Signs Following.” For the makers of the film it was an opportunity to capture a dying form of religion practiced exclusively in the deep rural South.For the congregation, it was simply another example of negative media sensationalizing the God-fearing, heavenly-bound believers. Their second exposure to the national media was no less humiliating. In 1993 Sonny Cleveland, Jr., son of the Reverend, was convicted of murdering his wife using a combination of strychnine and poisonous snakes. The media pounced on the story, and for a brief but infuriating moment the church was once again the subject of national ridicule. Now, a film crew of five from the internet series “Paranormal Activity Science Techs are coming to Arseno, TN located on Copper Mountain to study and document The Holiness Church. For the crew it is an opportunity to glimpse back to a time of snake-handling and speaking in tongues, a seemingly ancient and archaic form of Christianity that seemed wholly out of place in the modern tele-evangelical world. To the Cleveland Clan, God has most definitely not been reduced to some invisible friend and life coach. Theirs' is a wrathful god, and Rev.

We've already shot 6 scenes   in Murphy NC. Post production will  include final editing, any necessary re-shoots, and any sound production needs. How You Can Help: Producing a feature-length film is not as daunting as it once was, thanks to advances in film technology. We’ve also been extraordinarily lucky in rounding up a small crew of talented professionals who believe in the project and are willing to contribute their time. These include makeup artists, grips, audio techs, script supervisors, and wardrobe and prop professionals. Still, at it’s best, film production is not cheap, and financial help is badly needed. A minimum budget of $2,000 must be met to pay for prop rentals (including revival tent), location costs, on-location security, catering services, production design, makeup, props and costumes… the list is endless.

At the time a great deal of my photographic art was being produced during group shoots because I was having trouble finding the time to put my own shoots together. This resulted in my images being visually uninteresting and dreary, even after I started producing my own shoots again.After a lot of thought I decided that to break this cycle I needed to challenge myself artistically. Before I could challenge myself though I needed to be honest about where I was. I invested a decent amount of time pouring over my work from recent shoots and comparing it to my older work. This enabled me to set a baseline of where I was and help me plot a course to where I wanted to be. I created a short guide for me to follow for this project based on my assessment of my own work at the time.These were the guidelines I used to create this project:Personal - The subject matter needs to be something that plays to my interests.Juxtaposition - The idea of combining contrasting subjects has always fascinated me.Challenging - The subject matter needed to be something I had not photographed before.Ongoing - The project needed to be something that could be shot indefinitely.With the guidelines chosen I moved onto creating the actual project content. I tossed a few different ideas around but I ultimately decided on what has become the Blood Series. My main reason for choosing the Blood Series over my other ideas was because all my other ideas heavily involved other creatives and I wanted to make this a more personal project. Blood was chosen because of my personal love of horror movies and darker themes. I integrated both the juxtaposition & challenge guidelines by combining the blood with fine art nude photography. This gave me a contrast between the shock and horror of blood and the beautiful magnificence of the human figure. I challenged myself with nude art photography because it was something that I had not done previously and was somewhat scary for me. By keeping the concept rather simple I have been able to shoot this series on my own (and later with my wife’s assistance) which has let me keep it going over the years. The Blood Series helped me break free of my rut shortly after I started it. I have enjoyed the series and kept it going over the years because of my enjoyment. I have decided to keep the series nude for 2 reasons. First the contrast of bare skin and large amounts of blood is greatly diminished with the addition of clothing. Second the blood (in this case Special Effects or Hollywood blood) does not react the same to cloth as it does to the human skin. Ultimately the Blood Series has come to do what I needed it for and more.",The images are all shot and edited. I have found a printer for the books. I am currently in the process of designing the book layout and should have that completed by the time the Kickstarter ends. I will then be submitting the book for printing which can take 4-6 weeks.

I am relaunching the campaign but in a streamlined and limited capacity. This will allow me to significantly lower the costs of producing the book and other rewards, which in turn lowers the amount of funds I need to raise. This will also make the book more limited.

Once the 50 copied are sold out I will not produce this book again.If there is enough demand I may produce a small magazine edition but only after all 50 copies have been claimed.

The community of Bayfield needs a brewery. Adventure Club Brewing is up to the task. Hi, my name is Matthew. I was presented with an opportunity to open a small brewery and taproom in Northern Wisconsin on the shores of Lake Superior. The concept will be simple: celebrate the art of making beer and the pleasure of tasting it. The brewery will be in a brand new building on a beautiful piece of land just South of Bayfield on the highway that runs along the lake shore. My Aunt and Uncle own the land and the building which will primarily be a retail shop for adventure apparel and gear as well as mountain bike sales, rental, and repair. Below is a picture of the land and building that is still under construction, but nearly complete. The brewery will be a small two barrel system that will only serve the taproom and perhaps very limited local distribution if the opportunity arises. The simplicity and small scale of this will keep the brewing component very manageable. What I'm really interested in is creating an environment of adventure, activity, and fun. In today's world of craft beer, delicious quality brew is not hard to find. To stand out, a brewery needs to create an experience to back the beer and offer something memorable. This is my goal.The total cost to open Adventure Club Brewing will be somewhere in the ball park of $100K. Relative to most new breweries, this is not a lot. I've discussed bank loans to cover most of the cost of equipment and an economic development loan to help with the build-out. I am giving this project my life. I will do everything I can to make the adventure a reality. The one thing I can't do is start with too much debt. Your contribution will be used as a down payment on equipment to secure an adequate bank loan. In addition to branded merchandise that you will receive as a reward for your contribution, additional merchandise will be purchased with funds raised here. This will help your contribution grow. I will do all that is in my power to honor and multiply your generous gift.By contributing to this project, you will be helping to build not just a brewery, but a destination and a brand. This will be something special. ","I believe the biggest challenge that we will see will come from the very seasonal nature of the Bayfield area.  The town itself is very small to the point that there is not a single stop light.  During the tourist summer season though, it becomes a bustling community of art and adventure.  In my financial models four months out of the year will likely not be profitable.  It is fairly common for businesses to close down for the off-season.  I will plan to stay open, but with limited hours of operation.  My financial models and projections do show that the other eight months will more than cover the slow ones.  Opening a brewery requires governmental licensing and regulation.  This does take time and it is common for breweries to open later than they may have originally planned.  I'm giving myself nine months to get all the regulatory components in line before opening May first of 2019.  Securing funding is a major part of the federal filing process.  With your help I'll be able to get that ball rolling.  Please contact me if you have any questions or concerns that I have not addressed here.",https://www.kickstarter.com/projects/931037683/molten-galactic-now-including-electricity?ref=discovery_category_newest,931037683/molten-galactic-now-including-electricity,"But first let me provide a little history of my brand Molten Galactic. This all started in 2015 when a friend in the restaurant industry requested that I make some super snazzy pour-over stands for an up-scale restaurant that he was opening down town. Actually this all started long before that, but 2015 is when it all came together. Long story short, I bought a welding torch, some nice lumber, and a bunch of brass and made a couple of prototypes. Unfortunately the restaurant decided that labor intensive fancy single Erving coffee makers were not practical and didn't fit within their budget. No problem. I've since sold them on Etsy across America. There is even at least one in Africa. Molten Galactic also does some art sculpture welding. The concept has always been fire, metal, and wood. It is growing now to include electricity!Creating things is what makes me feel alive. Maybe the same applies to you and that's why you've come to Kickstarter, to be involved in the creation of things. I'd like to think we're kindred spirits.Maybe you saw a past project of mine regarding opening a brewery, maybe you didn't. The Kickstarter project didn't work out, but there are other ways to raise money. I'm very happy to say that the brewery project is moving forward! Which brings us to right now...There is no such thing as a one-size-fits-all brewery control panel; at least there shouldn't be. In today's craft beer world, artistic expression comes from how only a few different ingredients are combined. Those few ingredients haven't changed much in hundreds of years and neither has the basic process of brewing beer. What has changed is the scope and scale of both breweries and brewers. The goal of this new project will be to work with small-scale breweries and home brewers to custom design and fabricate control panels tailored to their own personal preferences. Automation is great for consistency and staying clean, but art is made by hands and often requires a good wash down when it's done. This is my philosophy as a brewer. I'll be building three separate controllers to operate and test in my own brewery in northern Wisconsin: a main control panel, a fermentation temperature control panel, and a small CIP/keg washing controller. Months of research and design has gone into this project and I am ready to build. I've come come up with and invested half of what I expect this project to cost by completion. I need a little help with the rest. ","One obvious risk when dealing with high voltage is electrocution and death.  Rest assured I've been educated in electronics and have a healthy respect for the power of electricity.  I formerly worked as an electronic technician in two different music shops dealing mostly with guitars and amplifiers.  Another challenge I've come up against has been sourcing the right components at the best price.  The more people I talk to and the further this project goes, the more I learn and discover.  I'm confident that by the time my prototypes are build, I will have found efficient sources."

I immediately recognized the thrill on my back I had felt back in 2003 when I began to compose the music of the first musical in history on the Odyssey of Homer. The same paralyzing terror! But it was only a moment. I spoke once with my brother who was enthusiastic. As soon as we returned from Rome we began to write and compose the song ""Aurorae"" which is contained in the video below.The song recounts, in a vivid and moving way, the last days of the ancient Vesuvian city before the eruption. The point of view of the story is that of an ""eyewitness"", Pliny the Younger, who, in a famous letter to the Roman historian Tacitus, told how his uncle Pliny the Elder became ""actor"" protagonist of a shipment of search and rescue in the area around Vesuvius when anxiety of the scientist was replaced by the hero's spirit. The last sentence of the song expresses a hope for the destroyed city, ""...Pompeii will rise again"". The video was made using the frescoes present archaeological site of Pompeii:Then we continued the drafting of the work plan of the work:So we wrote, in whole, the story in broad outline. We became immediately aware that the story was really compelling and we were greatly fascinated by the fact that, once again, as for our Odyssey, no one had ever tried to write a whole musical about the last days of Pompeii.POMPEII FIRE & SOUL - INITIAL PHASEThanks to your donations we will be able to complete the writing of the lyrics and the composition of the music of all 18 songs from the musical. In addition we will be able to make the casting for the necessary actors and singers and make recordings of the songs in the recording studio.This phase is the first step towards the completion of the project (which will be the subject of a new fundraising campaign on Kickstarter) which provides for the staging of ""Pompeii FIre & Soul"" inside the archaeological site of Pompeii (we are asking the necessary permits) and for which we will use impressive virtual sets as was done in our other works (see www.griecobrothers.com)WHY TO PLEDGE FOR OUR PROJECT?Because, in a certain way, is like becoming part of history! Because your name will be forever linked to the name of the first musical in history on the last days of Pompeii!","It is conceivable that, as any kind of purely creative enterprise of writing and composition, there may be a drop of inspiration, sometimes (fortunately very rare, but it can happen!) and this could result in a delay in the project implementation.

https://www.kickstarter.com/projects/278606755/descent-to-the-graphic?ref=discovery_category_newest,278606755/descent-to-the-graphic,"Presenting a consistent body of work is a foundational requirement in gaining artistic representation. While it is unlikely that you can provide direct assistance in helping find that representation, by supporting this project you can help me create 6-8 additional pieces that will turn my current Descent to the Graphic series into that larger body of work--and also provide me with an initial platform on which to fund ongoing expenses.This will be a shared activity, with me matching the funding you provide. Where will the money go? First, to archival framing. Unlike most other two dimensional media, galleries and collectors require that works on paper be framed, and that those frames have a protective surface. Self respect requires me to provide archival framing, which means acid-free mats and backings and uv protection. So quality custom run from $200 upward. Your help will be providing the frames and some of the printing. I do all my own printing, in the top notch digital labs at Photographic Center Northwest in Seattle (make sure you stop by when you are in Seattle to see their facilities and there finely curated exhibitions).One more major expense comes after the work is produced. I have already been accepted into the Bellevue Art Museum ArtFair (booth O-5) at the end of August. This is a highly competitive event, one that draws 300,000 people. So I will need backstock--and a quality event wall system. That system will cost $2,700 for a 10 x 15 display. It is a big outlay, and it, along with the additional printing costs,  will constitute the bulk of my own investment.Thank you for considering helping me with this project.","I am an experienced photographer, with great facilities in which to produce the prints, and with a very fine framing vendor--and I already have produced more than have the works I need. I have identified the materials and other necessary resources. That is reason to be confident in accomplishing the artistic, technical, and organizational aspects of the project. But I am in my mid sixties and life happens. So I think the risks are those that come with daily life: sickness and injury. But those would be likely to delay rather than derail the project.",https://www.kickstarter.com/projects/278606755/tick-tock-1?ref=discovery_category_newest,278606755/tick-tock-1,"Note: Kickstarter's automatic cropping of images makes it impossible for me to accurately show the photographic component of my project here. Please visit the the In the Works post on my Web site to view the image. The image you are currently seeing above is a section of Following Ice, another of my global warming diptychs.Tick Tock is a four dimensional installation that combines photography, sculpture, and movement over time. It is intended to provoke concerns about climate change, the pace of geologic time, and the implications of an observable pace of this change. I will present its two part image (both halves of which were shot on federal land: The Medicine Bow National Forest and Yellowstone National Park) as a loop resting on a pinnacled stand so that the loop is slightly off level and at eye level or slightly above. A motor will rotate the loop at a pace slow enough to be noticed only on extended observation. A slow clicking sound will accompany the rotation, suggesting to the observer that something is happening that may be require our time and our attention.This project is important to me for more than just the ecological reasons and cannot be completed without financial support. I have long wanted to add a spatial or temporal dimension, or both as in this project, to my 2D work in order to enhance opportunities for viewers to build personal connections with it. Equally important, the experience seeing this project through will widen my vision for projects to take on in the future. But as an unrepresented artist many of my conceptions for this require a financial risk that I cannot take on without external funding. Your sponsorship, along with anticipated collaboration with a respected scuptor, would sufficiently lessen this project’s financial risk. As an elder artist, somewhere between early career and emerging at age 69, there is urgency in completing this in the coming year. Marketing will be driven by my hope that the work is viewed by a larger, broader audience than usual—and will do so on an ongoing basis. Ideal buyers would be organizations, municipal, commercial, or nongovernmental, especially those with an interest in climate change. To that end I will reach out to architectural and design firms, buying consultants, and the organizations themselves—and of course to galleries. Timeline (in months): 1-2: Substrate testing and test printing 2-5: Develop and finalize design 5-7: Production 5-12: Marketing","I have been considering this project for over a year and consider it fully achievable. The timeline, which I've provided in my proposal here, has generous leeway built in. But an extended illness could potentially delay the project. Fortunately I am well and active--for my age, at least. Another source of delay could come from the repeat a situation I encountered earlier this year when I had three shows, including a total of 42 pieces, open within a five week period. But the calendar for 2020 is generally closing so I do not expect multiple concurrent shows next year. It is also possible that I might receive one or more of the the artist residencies for which I am currently under consideration. But for several of these I have included work on this project in my residency plan. But I have not done so in one that would run for most of the summer. Should I be selected for that one it might delay the second half of the timeline by 10 weeks."

https://www.kickstarter.com/projects/367930385/lost-parallax-the-movie?ref=discovery_category_newest,367930385/lost-parallax-the-movie,"This is the story of a 10-year-old boy who is taken on a fantastical journey into a realm where his choices and actions, quite literally, determine the fate of his entire world.  Upon discovering a powerful crystal near a crashed spaceship, young Taylor attempts to return the item to the vessel, but is instead trapped inside and taken into outer space.  Following a terrifying jump into another dimension, he arrives at an ominous mothership unlike any he could possibly imagine.  Quietly exploring the twisting corridors, Taylor bumps into his alternate self…from another dimension…and must determine if his new companion, named Tee, is a friend or foe.  As stories of their capture and purpose on the ship become convoluted, the two boys come face-to-face with the evil villain.  Determined to collect the crystals to make an unstoppable weapon, the terrifying alien turns the two boys against each other using its sadistic whit and convincing misinformation to confuse them.  Pushing the boys farther apart and weakening their combined power, the villain completes his weapon and aims it toward the boys’ home planets.  Taylor, now isolated from his twin, must learn to trust his instincts to defeat the evil force and save their two worlds.  Failure would mean the ends of every-thing and every-one they’ve ever known…and likely trigger the destruction of countless other worlds that would soon be targeted.It’s a sci-fi twist on a coming-of-age story that will be enjoyed by a wide range of audiences.  The uniqueness of this story is creatively matched only by the artistic medium in which it’s produced.Stopmotion animation is a filmmaking medium that has been growing in mainstream popularity since the release of Tim Burton’s The Nightmare Before Christmas.  Pioneered by Ray Harryhausen in groundbreaking films such as Jason & The Argonauts and the original Clash of The Titans, stopmotion utilizes real objects…in real environments…and has been the medium of choice for many popular films such as Coraline, Chicken Run, and Corpse Bride…just to name a few.The tactile and physical qualities of this medium will help build an even stronger emotional connection between our young characters and their audience.  Consequently, harnessing those qualities comes at the price of drastically lengthened production time. Whereas live-action films will typically produce one-second of film every second the camera is rolling, a stopmotion camera may only produce that one-second after a full day of shooting; often times even longer.  Carefully moving objects, modifying facial features, adjusting props, and tweaking lighting setups are just a few of the possible actions that occur between every single snap of the camera’s shutter.  More elements in a scene mean exponentially more actions must be performed before the frame is captured. The payoff for all the hard work comes as all the people involved in the process sit back and watch their respective skills bring-to-life a fantasy world like no other. Stopmotion animation is an artistic medium that requires many different creative and technical disciplines all working in perfect conjunction.  In the two years that ""Lost Parallax"" has been in development, many of the core disciplines have been identified and incorporated into the workflow of the project.  Professionals from each discipline have already come onboard and are anxious to start pre-production.  They include specialists in the fields of Character Development, Sculpture, Painting, Lighting Design, Photography, and Engineering.  They bring 167 combined-years of experience to this project.  Together, they will be supporting my abilities in Architecture, Animation, Storytelling, Cinematography, Producing, and Directing.  Throughout the entire production process, the combined skills of our entire crew will ensure all the creative and technical elements flow seamlessly together and produce a film that audiences with love to enjoy over and over again.The production demands of stopmotion are substantially different than those of live-action or computer-generated films.  The most prevalent difference is the amount of time needed to complete the process. Typically, a stopmotion feature film requires 4-6 years and 100-200 workers to complete.  However, we’re only estimating ""Lost Parallax"" to require 4 years and 8-10 workers to complete.  This is a very ambitious goal for our first feature film, but we feel the characteristics of the story help support such a goal.  The fewer locations to build in miniature, along with the smaller cast of main- and supporting-characters, will drastically reduce production time and encourage us to focus more on the quality of production and the characters’ performances. The smaller crew size will help streamline the communication process and allow critical decisions to be made faster without the need for large meetings and schedule coordination. And unlike the larger studios that duplicate sets, props, characters, and support crew to allow for simultaneous shooting, we will only be supporting one master set of everything.  This will drastically reduce the manpower and resources needed throughout the production.Once completed, the finished film will be submitted to Film Festivals where it will experience its first premiere in front of an audience of animation critics and studio executives. Upon positive response to the film, those executives will approach us to sign a contract for our film’s sale.  From that point on, the purchasing studio will manage the advertising, duplication, and distribution to the various theatre, broadcast, DVD, and on-demand markets.As with any stopmotion film, ""Lost Parallax"" has an extensive list of resources needed for its completion.  These resources can be categorized under four groups: Facilities, Equipment, Materials, and Personnel.Facilities:One of the advantages of ""Lost Parallax"" being a smaller-scale production is that it won’t require the seemingly endless amount of space that full-scale productions demand.  However, a moderately sized studio will be necessary to support the various components of production.  Efforts must also be made to isolate the manufacturing areas from the active sets…since airborne dust settling on characters and props can render entire scenes useless. When more production lights are used to illuminate sets, utility bills will increase dramatically as the lights, and the air-conditioning systems that cool the lights, stay on longer and longer.  And since this facility is a functioning construction site most of the time, although only building miniature sets, it is important to have sufficient insurance and safeguards in-place to protect the workers during production.Equipment:Although some of the core equipment has already been purchased or manufactured, there is still a great deal that must be acquired to support the production.  The camera lenses are among the most critical, and also the most expensive.  Higher-capacity computer equipment is needed to manage the massive still, movie, and audio files that will be produced and edited.  Additionally, rigging equipment such as stands, braces, and cables will be necessary to support not only the lights and camera systems, but also characters and props as they move through the scenes.Materials:The variety of materials will vary drastically depending on the complexity of the characters’ design, method of dialog or facial manipulation, and the desired look of locations being constructed.  Although the largest portions of materials will consist of clay and wood, various types of plastic, cloth, and metals will be used extensively in the creation of the different locations. Experimentation will be necessary to determine the methods used to incorporate atmospheric and special effects, such as fog or fire, into certain scenes…since real fog, fire, water, or wind isn’t typically used in the stopmotion medium.Payroll:Based on the amount of work being done, the budget allocates proportional payroll for the core crew throughout the production process.  Funds are also allocated for the hiring of two additional workers per month, as well as the contracting of vocal and instrumental professionals during the musical scoring stage.  ""Lost Parallax"" is estimated to cost $284,000 over the 4-year production cycle.  This represents the minimum funding needed to complete the film. Your pledged support will enable the production of ""Lost Parallax"" to become a reality.* ALL pledge levels include a Newsletter Subscription (including updates & production info via email).* ALL pledge levels above $25 include an Official ""Lost Parallax"" T-Shirt. All shirts will be shipped THIS YEAR...even if you pledge at a higher level that has a later delivery date.* The $500 and up pledge levels include actual On-Screen Credits. The higher your pledge level, the more prestigiously placed your name will appear in the film.* The Gold and Platinum pledge levels will give you TITLE CREDITS as either Co-Producer or Co-Executive Producer...and place YOUR name in the opening title sequence. It doesn't get any more prestigious than this!* If you'd prefer to support this project in another way, or would rather make a pledge via non-internet methods, then please contact us to make arrangements. Additional funding beyond our Kickstarter goal will be used to help Educate the Public about the stopmotion process.  Utilizing a larger facility and being open to the public, the studio would become a 'working gallery' where we would be able to host monthly gallery openings, distribute information packets, and exhibit content from the film as it’s being produced.  The more additional funding we receive, the more we can effectively educate the public.  This ties into our long-term goal of being able to educate on a much larger scale and sharing the amazing world of stopmotion with future generations.We’d like to say Thank You for supporting not only the ""Lost Parallax"" project, but supporting the continued growth of creative mediums, such as stopmotion animation, and the development of creativity throughout the world we live in. We'reglad to be considered one of your choices for funding, and we look forward to presenting to you…""Lost Parallax"".","As with any project, there are unforeseen technical and logistical challenges that may arise. Our goal is to try to anticipate these challenges as much as possible, and address them in a creative and efficient manner. The biggest challenge to stopmotion animation is staying on schedule and meeting the various deadlines/checkpoints during the process. Once funding is secured, this project WILL be completed…period. If those unforeseen problems arise, they will simply delay the final delivery of the film, but NOT stop it. One way or another, this film WILL be completed...and your support will help accomplish this goal. The film’s website, Facebook and Youtube pages will be periodically updated to include progress reports, production photos, and various videos. Certain pledge levels will even allow secure access to un-edited and edited footage from the film. We will provide both creative and technical explanations of the production process, commentaries from the production team, and try to develop an ongoing dialog with interested members of the general public.

https://www.kickstarter.com/projects/twoplease/two-please?ref=discovery_category_newest,twoplease/two-please,"In September 2013, me and an amazing cast and crew of 42, spent a sweaty, bloody weekend filming... a little something different. ONE PLEASE, a 6 minute horror short starring the legendary Michael Berryman, literally blew up in our faces. I'm serious - like a ""blow your eyeballs out"" explosion.Within the space of 4 months it had became an official selection of multiple festivals in the US, Canada, and the United Kingdom. (See below) And we're still just at the beginning of what is proving to be anincredible festival run.So the question I've been asked since it first appeared in January of 2014 -- ""When is the next One Please""?? Well, it's here and I am pleased to say that Michael Berrymanis attached to the sequel TWO PLEASE as well - seriously, can we have something like this and NOT have Michael Berryman? No, we can't. Since ONE PLEASE is currently in the festival circuit we have to keep the final short film under wraps for now - BUT... we did let you see the oddly creepy official trailer. AND one of the rewards we're offering (hint) does give you limited time access to see One Please!!The total budget of ONE PLEASE was completely worth it! Sooooooo completely worth it. (The total budget, etc. can be found onthe film's IMDB listing.) BUT the goal is to make the ""PLEASE SERIES""just that - a ""series"". Multiple odd, beautifully photographed short films - with an unsettlingsplash of gore. Sure, we might could squeeze out another one with myself and the producers trying to self-fund it - as we did the first one - but so many people have jumped onto this creepy little band wagon we thought we'd reach out to the fans and see if we might be able to do even more than what we could do alone. If we realize our current goal... and partially fund Two Please... well you're going to see Three Please that much quicker! ESPECIALLY if we raise more than our goal on this project!!The incredibly talented people of ONE PLEASE contributed their time for little or nothing because they believed in the project - for that, I am forever in their debt...the budget needs to be expanded this time - forONE BIG reason:So that our ""awesomest"" crew can get more than a firm hand-shake, a thank you, and an ice cold beer after filming. Everyone of the cast and crew was amazing - without every single one of them ONE PLEASE would not have been as successful as it was - I want to give them more. I want them to know that they were/are appreciated.This project is still going to be self-funded to a large degree because me - and the producers - believe in it ""THIS"" much (picture me holding my arms really, really wide apart). The quicker we hit our goal - and hopefully go beyond our goal - the quicker we can make the next uber-creepy short!So everyone has stretch goals, right? ""what would happen if"" goals.I've thought about that a million times over - because I know that support for a project can vary - and here are your answer(s)...Q. We reach our goal of funding part of TWO PLEASE - $18,000?A. We shoot TWO PLEASE in August (ish) and it's ready to unleash on the world around the start of the film festival season in January.Q. Say you raise $25,000?A. You just funded a chunk of THREE PLEASE as well - production (based on talent/crew schedules) would probably start by the first of 2015.Q. Say you raise $40,000?A. That's crazy. That's impossible. But... you'd just made certain that THREE PLEASE greets the first dawn of 2015 with open arms. (Barring any HUGE obstacles such as an uncontrollable leprosy outbreak, zombie apocalypse or an unexpected resurgence of tertiary syphilis. )Q. Say you raise $100,000?A. Now that's just weird. But, let's just say it happened - you pretty much just slapped me in the face and said ""I bet you can't make this creepy little short, with no dialogue and beautiful cinematopgraphy, into a full-on series"". Well, sorry,...I just don't believe you. There are2 more scripts completed and they include inspired uses of the following random items: children's safety scissors, fluffy bunnies, a rusty nail, that skin under your chin, a garden, a tractor, glass shards, more moms, more dads, earlobes, and a hammer.Q. Say you raise $250,000?A. That's pretty much like growing a fourth arm - fun to think about, fun at children's parties, great for multi-tasking...but highly unlikely. But I'll humor you because I like you a lot and you're thinking about making that $5 pledge - I'd make a ""PLEASE"" feature film. You're laughing. I know you're laughing. I'm not laughing - my face is like a chiseled stone - cold, expressionless, shiny. I'm dead serious that I think a full length film could be made in the same vein - no dialogue and utterly disturbing content. In your honor, I would probably produce it under the label ""Fourth Arm Films"". I refer you to March 4, 1922 for reassurance about this type of project.Kickstarter isn't about ""people giving you money"". Kickstarter is about people being part of something together. It's about ""bits and pieces"" coming together to make a ""whole"". It's about partnering. So we are prepared to give some awesomeness to you for partnering! Awesomness to you all at multiple different levels. You got $5, $10, or $20? Awesome, awesome, and awesomer.I overheard a viewer at this year's Tribeca festival - during a quiet part ofour film - turn to the person beside her and say, ""This is possibly the weirdest little thing I've ever seen."" I was even more inspired after I heard that.Let's make something even weirder...Jesse Burks (Writer/Director)OFFICIAL 2014 SCREENINGS of ONE PLEASE (Thus far)REVIEWS forONE PLEASE","There are a million things that can go wrong/askew - before, during, and after filming - but, in most cases, each of these can be dealt with. Here's a quick little list for honesty's sake:1. The project could be delayed because of: talent's schedules, location changes, weather, illness, etc. These can ALL be dealt with. If we do have to bump the schedule our kickstarter supporters and facebook fans will be the first to know. Delays don't mean cancelled - just delayed. Remember we have funds invested too - so our goal is to get it done no matter the obstacle(s).2. It could NOT be as good as the original ONE PLEASE. I think that's always a risk you run when making a second, a third, or a 100th film. People will always compare it to the first. I'm incredibly proud of what the cast and crew of ONE PLEASE produced - it's amazing. But rest assured, TWO PLEASE has not been rushed - the script has been worked, kneaded, massaged -  yes, beaten - until it's as close to perfect as possible. 3. Yes, your rewards could be delayed. Rain, sleet, brimstone may come down, but rest assured we will do our best to get them to you. The estimated delivery is just that ""estimated"" - we understand this isn't just you giving us something - it's us giving you something in return. But making a film is stressful and if I have to choose between mailing your glossy still shot or dvd on Monday versus Friday - honestly, it may wind up being Friday. Don't worry - it will get there:)Of course these are just a few things - I'm sure a 1000 other things could come up - but we've already had the opportunity to make the first film - I feel confident we can work through a second one....hopefully, more:)",https://www.kickstarter.com/projects/twoplease/odd-happenings-in-a-tiny-tent?ref=discovery_category_newest,twoplease/odd-happenings-in-a-tiny-tent,"Odd Happenings In A Tiny Tent is my 3rd film with horror legend Michael Berryman!! (ONE PLEASE, CURED) You may not recognize Michael's name, at first, but almost everyone will recognize his unique look - and previous films: The Hills Have Eyes, One Flew Over The Cuckoo's Nest, and The Devil's Rejects...just to name a very few.I've learned a lot from my previous short films. I'd say the most important is the immense talents of the cast and crew around me. As a writer and director, I have been only one small part of the success of the first two films. Without them (the cast and crew), there is no way these 2 short films would have over 4 million views on CryptTv's facebook and youtube pages - I owe them everything !ONE PLEASE - View on CryptTvCURED - View on CryptTvOf course my films have leaned - heavily - to the absurd and gory side. This new film, again with Michael Berryman, includes mimes, a baby, Cornish hens...and a custom guillotine. Here's what I've completed, so far, in preparation for ODD HAPPENINGS IN A TINY TENT...1.Purchased, assembled, tested ""the guillotine"" - miniature, but VERY functional - was crafted by master woodworker dreadwilliam.com. I've named her ""Lorna"" and here are a few pics.Also from the good Dread William...a custom, hand-crafted puzzle box for the film.2. Secured Michael Berryman as our central figure in this story.3. Secured the amazing crew that have worked with me on my other films. Gabe Mayhan: Cinematographer, Kathryn Tucker/Joshua Miller/Miles Miller: Producers, Les Galusha: Editing/fx, Dwight Chalmers: Sound design, Mitchell Crisp: Production Design, Kristy Pruitt: Make-up/hair, Amos Cochran: Music.4.Enlisted the talents of Abi Postin multiple, creative ways. Abi has taken my stick figure storyboard and turned it into something beautiful...AND she has sourced and created ""the scroll"" for our film.5. Secured locations and locked shoot dates.6. AMAZING artwork by Russ Galusha - who also created all 3 of the original posters for ONE PLEASE.Films, even short ones, can be expensive. This project is straightforward. It's simple. In order to offset a small portion of the expenses - primarily travel for our talent - rewards are being offered that I already have in my little hands.I learned from my other kickstarter campaigns.So my goals with this campaign are simple.","Q.The project doesn't get completed?A.I've completed 3 other short films - with the help of an invaluable crew - that have been successful. By helping fund a portion of this project, you are making it more likely that I am able to move to the next project !Q. Will I get my stuff?A. I learned so much from my previous kickstarter campaigns - things I did well...things I did not. ALL of the posters have already been printed and picked up. There will be NO waiting for supporters.Poster tubes have already been ordered in bulk and delivered to my home.I already have adhesive labels for shipping the tubes. There will be NO waiting for supporters.The storyboard is completed and awaiting digital download to campaign supporters... again, NO waiting.The film is shooting 7/28-30th (2017) and the November date for online access to supporters gives us AMPLE time to make it through post-production."

I recently moved back to my hometown of Lakeland, Florida from the big city of New York. In New York I attended culinary school at the International Culinary Center. I have always had a passion for food, ever since a young child. Growing up, I was always in the kitchen at my granny's house, Shirley. She was an amazing cook and woman. She always told me to follow my dreams and never give up. She once told me that she would sell her house if I needed the money for school. She was that selfless of a person. When I was just 15 years old I lost my granny to cancer. Since then I have tried to figure out the perfect way to pay homage to her. So I named my company after her, after all, she was my inspiration. Some of my recipes are from her, and some are all my own. I want to take this business to the next level and I can't do it alone. Right now I'm working from home and that just isn't cutting it. Food trucks can be quite expensive, there's the truck itself, food, equipment, paper goods, business licenses, and more. Please help make my dreams reality.","The only obstacle I face is funding because although I do not have a specific date for my grand opening yet, I would like to have the food truck up and on the road by October",https://www.kickstarter.com/projects/1719569822/shirley-delish?ref=discovery_category_newest,1719569822/shirley-delish,"Helloeveryone, my name is Thomas Burnett. I am 26 years old and I currently live inLakeland, FL. Growing up it was always my dream to become a culinarymastermind. To create delicious things that would have people begging for more.My granny was my inspiration, as far back as I can remember I would pull up astool next to her as she cooked, even if just to stir. She pasted down so manygreat things to me, but the greatest morsel of wisdom was to always believe inmyself. When she pasted away, I wanted a way to pay her back for all she haddone for me, so when I was thinking of names for my business, it seemed onlynatural to name it after her. That is how I came up with the name ShirleyDelish! I want to start this business not only for myself but in memory of her.So whenever someone utters the name Shirley Delish!, they are participating ina tribute to, in my opinion, one of the most selfless human beings that everwalked this Earth. I will work my little culinary buns off to ensure that I succeedand that I live up to her name. I will start my business small and just like anavalanche, grow bigger over time. I want to start at local farmers markets, getthe name out there and expand naturally as a progression. I realize it won’thappen overnight but with the support of friends and loved ones, I can makeShirley Delish! a household name!","I believe keeping momentum is the biggest risk I will have, but I am a very creative person, so I will always have fresh ideas. Although with any business, public opinion and customer satisfaction comes first! I will always be thinking of what the customers want."

Also, they will aid in helping me purchase some nicer equipment as I'm currently only using a basic MacBook and some mixing speakers a friend lent to me. Specifically, the funds will be used to print actual interactive CD/DVDs, mix/master the songs and print labels in addition to uploading them to my YouTube.

Another challenge will be to find enough gigs to help sell these new interactive CDs that I am ready to produce because as of now I have a few lined up in the upcoming months but am hoping to get more, partially via increased exposure on my YouTube and hopefully Kickstarter.  Traveling means including gas and transportation is a partial setback also as I want to hopefully travel to NY and California to play a few gigs where I know the jazz scene is kickin.

Right now, my channel only brings in so much along with my Bandcamp and it's not enough to sustain the complete production/mastering/composing of a full album that will be released and distributed. The money will also be used to put together an initial batch of 100-1000 CDs which will be sold at shows and online. Below are links to a couple of my tracks, enjoy :)'Gloom''Spacetime''24'","Production delays are always a challenge, including the potential for damaged speakers, computer setbacks such as lagging due to everything predominantly being mastered on a Macbook.  These will  be tackled with the extra funds that can also help me repair one of my studio monitors that is starting to fail me.  Another challenge is finding a quiet place to record for around 3-4 weeks which is where the funds will come in really handy.  My current complex has thin walls that prevent me from recording at certain times that I often excel in, such as late night...  These will all be tackled if I am able to rent out a stand alone studio with lots of privacy that I have in mind."

Last September we bought 200 little trees that have almost doubled in size already. To help make our Farm more profitable we need to get smaller trees but they need a safe place to live till they are old enough to go out side with the big trees..With this kick-starter campaign I am not just looking for money, I'm hoping it gets fully funded to help give me an idea of what products I should be focusing on.

What I'm looking to get from kickstarter is enough money to apply to larger more expensive craft shows that will help me sell more items.

With the intent to sell them but I do get attached to them.For the most part I sell my work at local craft shows. Last year my wife and I did 10 shows, but this year we want to do at least twice that many and at the same time we are looking for really good quality shows that will help us grow our small business.Reward Number 6This is a one of a kind piece, if you need more pictures let me know.

Check it out and get some insight on the album and Kon Karne in general.Listen here.My name is Lucas, and I'm an electronic musician based out of the Hampton Roads area of Virginia. I've been making music as Kon Karne for the last couple years, and have had the opportunity to play all around the east coast (Boston, Philly, Richmond, and Baltimore, to name a few cities!) with some great artists (such as The Protomen). I'm really excited to announce that I'll be starting work on my first full-length album. It's called ""Karpe Noktem"" and I feel secure in saying  it's the best thing I've been able to be a part of as a musician in a very long time.I've made plenty of music in the past, but I've never had such a focused vision of what I want to accomplish. This is also the first time I've heavily involved others in the creative process of my music.You can find all of the music I've released previoulsy as Kon Karne on Soundcloud.""Karpe Noktem"" is an album about a lot of things: night, darkness, questions, frivolity, and acceptance. It features dense synths, drum beats, and tape recordings to achieve a sound somewhat reminiscent of a John Carpenter or Cliff Martinez score, but with a pseudo-pop structure. I've been working on it for the last 6 months mostly on my own. I feel now is the time to take it to the next step by involving more artists, and supporters like you! Currently I have Mikey Levinson (of The Megas) signed on to do some vocal tracks, and digdugDIY is taking on the visual art direction for the release. Depending on the success of this Kickstarter campaign I hope to bring on more people to do things like music videos, merchandise, booking a tour, and more. I plan to release it digitally as well as on CD and cassette.Along with CD, digital, and tape versions of the album I want to offer a look into my personal thought process while the album was being made. I felt the best way to accomplish this would be to make a short book of some of my journal entries pertaining to my music. The book will be professionally printed, and will contain  written entries, doodles, charts, ideas, lyrics, and more that went into the creation of the music. This is the best way I could think of to add something extra personal to the album. I know my handwriting is atrocious therefore the book will contain images of my entries alongside typed transcripts.So what will the money be going to? The main financial roadblocks to get over at this point are:- Mixing- Mastering- Minor studio upgrades- An image scanner (to scan journal entries)- Digital distribution- Reward fulfillment (printing CD's, tapes, books, t-shirts, etc.)- Paying those involved in the project (not including myself!)Making a profit is the farthest thing from my mind at this point. Every dime that is pledged will, in some way, be used for this release, or things related to it (tour, videos, etc.).I plan to have the album ready for release by the end of this Summer. A good bit of the music is written, and a lot of the pieces are in place. Once the demand, and money is there we should be well on our way.","There are a lot of challenges that can be associated with releasing an album.  Difficulties with production (both of the music itself, and the CD's/tapes/etc.) will undoubtedly come up.  Not only am I confident that I can overcome these challenges, but I am beyond confident in the abilities of those involved in the project with me.  Both Mikey, and digdugDIY are shining examples of professionalism.Mikey is already an accomplished recording artist whose experience will be invaluable throughout the process.  He's best known for working with The Megas, and played a pivotal role in the recording of their album ""Get Equipped"".This isn't exactly the first rodeo for the folks at digdugDIY, either.  They've worked on projects with a lot of artists including IV the Polymath and Clean Freq to create unique visual art and handmade cassettes to accompany their releases."

I am determined to make this a success.,https://www.kickstarter.com/projects/mikemeldon/temporary-book-club?ref=discovery_category_newest,mikemeldon/temporary-book-club,"Temporary Book Club started years ago (circa 2016) as a way to discuss book with friends and although it has changed, that is still what it is essentially. I love to discuss books, but with hectic lives and schedules, book clubs never really worked for me. So I decided to get a friend or two at most to read a book that we agreed upon and record our conversations as a podcast. I knew that I, as many others, enjoyed listening to discussions about interesting books and topics. I knew our conversations were fun and interesting, so I thought I'd make them available to the book-loving public through a podcast. This was a lot of fun, but our discussions were long and I was not much of an editor or producer. These difficulties along with the 'not up to par' product led to the project being scrapped.Jump ahead to 2020 quartantine days. I was in a reading slump and needed a 'push'. I decided that with all these 'remote' gatherings online that I would try the Temporary Book Club again since people were at home and we could use this newer popular format. Before I knew it, I was booked with friends and books until May of 2021, with an average of one book discussion every other week. My 8 year old daughter would like to take on the 'kid take' section and start to run her own discussions with friends also to add more content. So, why funding? This costs a lot more than I realized to get going and to produce a professional product. I used a lot of 'free trial' months or weeks in different programs that allow for editing marketing material or video editing. I also need lighting, and a laptop that is not owned by my job (I'm a teacher). I would also like to spend money on marketing and marketing materials. Not to mention, I purchase the books that we use for each episode. So, I added together what I needed to get this going and then cut it and cut it again to pretty much the bare-minimum that will allow me to get this to move foreward in a manner that makes it not only fun, but also feasible while running a large family and household. This support will allow the Temporary Book Club to continue for the long term and also allow me to create a better product that will bring in a larger audience. I already get great feedback. My friends are coming back to their books and reading...and our conversations are making people think. We need more human interaction and more thoughtful discussion on issues and less memes.

I hope you enjoy watching the Temporary Book Club.Books discussions coming up this Summer/Fall:America: The Farewell Tour by Chris Hedges, Song Of Soloman by Toni Morrison, Talking to Strangers by Malcolm Gladwell, The Fire Next Time by James Baldwin, Candide by Voltaire, The Death of Expertise by Nichols, Frankenstein by Mary Shelly, White Fragility by Robin Diangelo, The Sea by Banville","The only risk here is that if we are not successful with the fund drive, I may not be able to make the quality videos that draw people in and make them want to come back.

Dealing with physical illness as well as emotional and psychological issues, the only thing I was able to truly do was to write poetry in a little journal I kept on my nightstand.

This time, however, I am creating an audio book of these poems, with background music supplied by a dear friend.

Baxter gives her own dramatic interpretation of each poem, while soundscapes created exclusively for each work by Walki's Monster play in the background.However, each track takes both time and money to record, to tweak and master and finally, to burn onto compact disc. In turn, each compact disc costs time and money, as Baxter uses LightScribe discs and then packages them in movie-quality DVD cases.The basic elements are already in place: Baxter's poetry and the music of Walki's Monster. Your funds help pay for the studio time, the raw materials such as the CDs, cases, paper and printer ink, and give the chance to put them all together and offer it to the world!","There ARE possible risks and challenges to completing this project, and, sadly, they center mainly around the chronic health issues faced by Baxter. Knowing this is always a possibility in her daily life, a ""back up"" plan has already been designed! Baxter has almost completed the recordings of her dramatic readings of each poem. Should her health become critical at any point, Walki's Monster is ready and capable of stepping in and completing the project."

Pixtorals. It's very fun to say, but what does it mean? It's a combination of two words: Pixels and Pictorals. Pictorals are my drawings, sketches or doodles of objects that become Pixels when i draw them into the computer.As the face of Pixtorals, I want to provide graphics in the form of clipart for use by schools, sports coaches and screen printing companies to assist with their design projects. Screen printing is a demanding business with fast turnaround and not a lot of time to spend on designing. Coaches and Schools frequent screen printing shops for their teams and clubs, but often only need 20-50 shirts, sweats, etc. Graphics for those designs on so few shirts can be very costly.Currently, there is a growing trend in the Clipart Industry where you have to buy monthy subscriptions or costly credits to purchase online. Once you do, you can't use it for your project without purchasing a license to go with it. It's hard to know what kind of license to buy. Resale? Business use? Costs can be $600 or more for one simple graphic. The artist selling the clipart on those sites only makes pennies on the dollar with most of the money going to the Clipart Site. There are books with discs available that are full of graphics for screen printing as well. They can cost as much as $500-800, but you may only need a few of of the graphics they offer.I want to be able to provide graphics to those in need of a simpler, more cost effective way to purchase clipart.I have gathered 3 years of sketches, doodles and graphics I've created to start my business, Pixtorals. This Kickstarter will give Pixtorals the recognition it needs to be so much more than it is. It will allow me to pay for supplies, and the programs I need to keep creating more clipart. My terms of use will be simple. Three things not to do: Don't use it in a business logo, don't create it for mass resale in retail stores, Don't sell or give it away as your own clipart. It remains the property of Pixtorals.","1) There are currently several ways to purchase clipart. Clipart itself isn't a new idea. However, I believe my designs, sketches and prices are unique. That will allow me to stand out.2) I don't have the room to have physical inventory, so my own clipart book and CD's are not a practical choice for me. All graphics/Cliparts are emailed. Email can be fickle, with emails going into SPAM folders and getting missed. Some email addresses strip large files all together. I have researched a company that will be an avenue to send the large clipart packages used as rewards in my campaign. They will allow me to email a link that will direct you to the files to be downloaded.

With this library you can easily include this capability into your own (C#) program. The code of this library is already used in my Android-app: ""Text Comparer"", available in the Play Store athttps://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.thieupepijn.textcomparerThe source-code of the library will be hosted on GitHub and released under the MIT-licensehttp://choosealicense.com/licenses/mit/This is a short permissive license which among others permits commercial use. I think this license is the most suited for this project. However if you think some other license would be a better choice please let me know and I will consider it. I will publish on GitHub a public repository of a C# software library/dll which will contain among others the following functions;1 A function which takes as input two texts and gives as output a list indicating which parts of the two texts are equal and which parts are different.2 A function which uses the function of above to generate from two given texts a html-styled text to indicate the similarities and differences between the two input-texts.In addition I will put on GitHub a console application which will show how to use this library.Backers giving €250 or more can ask for additional functionality which I might implement depending on the amount of work this will be for me. Contact me if you want to discuss this possibility beforehand. Also contact me if you have some other question you want answered before donating.I am doing this project on my own. Therefore I do not need to pay the salaries of employees/hired hands. Also I don't need to buy (expensive) software licenses for this project. What I do need the money for is to give myself some (in my eyes modest) compensation for the time I put and will put in this project. Also the money received will stimulate and help me to free up extra time in the future to work on other software projects which will be of use to others. ",The code of this software library is already written and already in use in an app of mine (see above). What is left for me to do is to polish up the code to make it more readable for others and put it in a separate library/dll. Also I still need to write some documentation and write the console application to show how to use the library. I have full confidence that I will able to do these things and bring the project to a successful completion.,https://www.kickstarter.com/projects/1981812785/organic-compound-identifier?ref=discovery_category_newest,1981812785/organic-compound-identifier,"Apart from my day-job as software developer I also pursue various other interests. Recently I became interested in learning basic chemistry. When encountering the topic of naming organic compounds/molecules I wondered if there would be an app for that. However I couldn't find a good one. So, being a software developer, I decided to write one myself.My work resulted into the app ""Organic Compound Identifier"", which can be found with the following link in the Google Play Store.https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.thieupepijn.compoundidentifierThis app can name a lot of different types of organic compounds/molecules. It can handle straight as well as cyclic organic molecules, branched molecules, double and triple bonds and various functional groups.However this app is now only available on Android. In order to bring this app to IOS (iPhone/iPad) I need a Macintosh computer, which I don't have. So with this project I want to gather the funds to buy a Macintosh computer as well as the other things I need to bring this app to IOS as well.The actual budget breaks down to.","For Android I already have a fully functional version of this app. Because the Android-app is written in Xamarin/C#, it will take little time and effort to port this app to IOS.The biggest problem I see is the long and rigorous screening process Apple takes to allow apps in their store. When the app is rejected several times before finally accepted it can easily take a few months before the app is finally available on IOS. That's why I choose February 2019 as the estimated deliverance-date for this project. However if the whole screening process goes smooth the actual deliverance-date can be a lot sooner."

After putting them in my containers, then into the fridge, life gets in the way and I simply forget about that great meal that is waiting to be eaten. OR, I come home with new groceries that get put up front in the refrigerator, pushing my leftovers to the back.  It's usually not until I get hit with ""the smell"" that I look around the fridge and find the now SPOILED food.WHAT A WASTE OF FOOD AND MONEY.Well, those days are OVER!!Leftover Lenny is my patent pending, light activated voice recorderspecifically for your refrigerator or pantry.Simply record your message (whatever food you want reminding of), then, using myproprietary adjustable button, set Lenny to play every time the fridge is opened, or every second time the fridge is opened, or every third time etc., all the way to every tenth time the fridge is opened.  That's right, the refrigerators light will activate the recorder from wherever your container ends up if you choose to attach Lenny to the actual container.  You can also attach Lenny to the inside of the fridge, OR simply place him in the door shelf for easier access.Lenny also has an on/off switch to preserve battery life, and a ""lock"" switch so your message does not get accidentally erased.I have also used Lenny to remind me to take frozen foods from my freezer for thawing, OR just to leave messages for the kids! You know they will be in the refrigerator right after school.  YOU will find even MORE uses for YOUR Lenny,As stated in the video, since using my own prototype, I have had NO wasted food from my fridge!I would like your help to take Lenny worldwide.                     I have the working prototype (with the help of Talking Promotions U.K.), and the C.A.D. drawings for the moulds for the ACTUAL Leftover Lenny units that will be very similar to the blue 3D model shown in the video and photos (Thank you Solid Print 3D, Winter Garden Fl.}.With your help, i will be able to get the moulds made, make a significant first production run, and apply for the full patent.After the original Leftover Lenny gets rolling, i already have 3 more related products i am anxious to bring to you!UPDATE (10-19-2015).  I have received the provisional patent for ""phase II"" of Leftover Lenny. Soon after Lenny goes into production, I will introduce my ""universal food storage container lid""!!The beautiful part of the universal lid is that it works ""in conjunction"" with any (soon to be) existing Leftover Lenny units.  Lenny will fit horizontally INSIDE the plastic lid with the photocell and speaker slightly exposed. This keeps the containers ""stackable"", and makes Lenny easier to use with ANY size container. When finished with the lid, simply remove Lenny, wash the lid, and store.I am also including one free universal lid with ALL contributions of $20 or greater (3 lids with $250 or greater).

Things like patch kits, thumb drives, keys, nuts, bolts, tools...There are no modifications necessary and you don't have to use an expensive proprietary multitool. Check out the video if you have any questions on how it works, how its installed or what can be stored in it.The idea for the Steerer Tube Storage came from the dislike of wearing a backpack while mountain biking. Ever since I started cycling I hated having to wear a backpack while riding. On my commuter bike I mounted large racks to carry all my stuff but they are heavy and ruin the look of any bike. For a designated trail bike or a stylish road bike, large racks are not an option. So,I started looking into other ways to carry my trail gear and eventually came up with the STS.Combined with a standard under seat bag, frame mounted pump and bottle there is now no need to wear a backpack anymore.After this having the idea for the STS there was a lot of work to make it come to life. I spent hours designing it, made a few prototypes and have been using them on my bikes for the last few months. Now that the idea is proven, I want to move into production and see if the STS can help other cyclists. This Kickstarter campaign is to fund a production run of 100 STS assemblies. If this project is successful every contributor will have a STS of their own and I have enough startup money to make prototypes of other unique storage ideas for cyclists.The STS has worked on every bike with an aluminum or steel 1-1/8th steerer tube I have tried. I've tested it on all my bikes and had a few local bike shops test it on their floor stock without a problem. Unfortunately it will not work on Carbon Steerer Tubes. The Carbon is too thick and causes the inner diameter of the tube to be too small.The STS can also work on tapered steerer tubes where the top part of the tube is 1-1/8"". Some additional measurements are required. There needs to be at least 6 inches of straight tube before the steerer tube starts to taper out. This can be difficult to measure without taking the fork off so its probably best to take your bike to the local bike shop and ask them for help.Each STS assembly comes with an aluminum tube, cap, bolt and o-ring.

Amy has danced in 7 countries and spent years choreographing and performing in the Greater Houston area. Recently she performed at the Wyly in Dallas with PrismCo Movement Theatre, and as a Super in Elektra with Houston Grand Opera. She has choreographed a group of dancers at TRF After Dark for the last two years, and choreographs the social dances at The Texas Renaissance Festival. She has directed productions at The Crighton Theatre in Conroe and Nancy Boch Theatre in The Woodlands. In 2016 she won an award for her choreography of Chicago with Jeff Baldwin.Amy has been working on this production for years, and now it is time for it to take shape. The show includes a wide variety of dance forms: Experimental, Contemporary, Musical Theatre, Tap, Ballet and Ballroom. However, unlike most dance concerts, there will be live singing. The dancers will be singing chorus parts, and a handful of local powerhouse vocalists will perform the lead vocals. The show will also include various other types of performance art: A grand ""maestro"" character will guide the audience through the performance, interacting occasionally with the characters and songs, and sometimes watching them from another plane of existence. The Maestro will always be aware of the audience, and perform most of the show's dialogue.The show also encompasses Aerial arts, including silks and span set work. One piece also includes stage combat: hand to hand and steel on steel.Jared Alan Barnes is the Fight Choreographer. He is a local performing artist and Fight Choreographer. He is an accomplished actor, vocalist and stunt performer. He recently performed with the Uptown Players in Dallas, and at Lyric Stage in Irving. He is also a fencer at the Texas Renaissance Festival where he plays King Henry VIII. Come Alive will be the first production of Haven Arts Theatre, a new local theatre company for the Greater Houston Area. Our eventual goal is to have a physical theatre. For now, we are founding the performance company and creating our first production. For this we will need a rehearsal space and a production budget.We plan to create a home base office and rehearsal studio in New Magnolia on 1488. This space is an office/warehouse style facility. It's a great space with high ceilings and natural light. It's an energy efficient, air conditioned warehouse with a nice office attached. We'll be buiding a floating dance floor inside for rehearsal.This will be our home base. We will be renting theaters to perform in as we get started, but having our own rehearsal space opens up a world of opportunity for us. We can rehearse with complete flexibility, as well as build our sets in our rehearsal space to begin using them immediately. This space will allow us to move forward with producing large amounts of high quality art right away.""I'm extremely excited to be creating this show. I have all these dance pieces that have been living in my head for years. They've had no forseeable way out... until now."" - Amy K BarnesOur proposed budget includes the production costs of our first production, as well as securing a rehearsal space for one year. This space will be available to us 24/7 so that we can work whenever and however we need to.   Come Alive will be our first production, but we aren't stopping there. We already have plans for two music videos waiting in line. After that we hope to produce a show by a local playwright. Our hope is that with this first production we can jumpstart a theatre company that will endure through the years. We hope to give local performing artists a place to create high quality art and be paid to do it.   We would love for you to join us on this exciting venture!https://HavenArtsTheatre.org","The first challenge is securing our rehearsal space.  There is a space we are hopeful about, but if that location falls through we will need to choose another office/warehouse.  Fortunately these spaces are becoming more popular and are being built rapidly in this growing area.From there we begin rehearsals-- the fun part!We will have to rent a performance space.  We are looking for a black box theatre in the houston area.  We've bugeted for the average cost of such a space.  Once we have our funding we can reserve a theatre and set performance dates.  Until then, all our dates are tenative.No matter what hiccups might come along, we are well versed in ""bending like reeds in the wind.""  My husband and I, along with those who are joining us, are experienced performers and equipped to handle any bumps along the road.  Whatever happens, the show must go on.The long term goal is that the momentum from this first production will carry us forward to more productions in the future as we build our performance company.",https://www.kickstarter.com/projects/1291847547/dunadance?ref=discovery_category_newest,1291847547/dunadance,"At Haven Arts Theatre we are passionate about bringing professional theatre to the greater Houston area,                       bringing jobs to local performing artists,                                                                                                         and bringing wonder to audiences everywhere.Haven Arts Theatre is a new professional, non-equity theatre company in the greater Houston area.  We are committed to producing high quality theatre with local performing artists.We strive to be a home for the arts, and the artist.  A haven for creativity and expression, bringing heartfelt and compelling theatre to the district.We would love for you to join with us on this exciting venture.  Donate and become an integral part of the arts by investing in local theatre today.Our first project is DUNADANCE. Amy K Barnes will be the choreographer for this project. She is creating an original 6 person dance to be performed on a texas beach at the beginning of June this year. We will be hiring 6 dancers to travel with us to Corpus Christi and spend three days working on location there.As actors and performers we take paying our artists very seriously. For this production we will be offering the performers only a small stipend, but we will also cover housing and travel costs for the entire company. There are too many ""starving"" artists in the Houston area, it's time we paid some of them!Once the project is filmed we will begin post production editing. After that we will host a private world premiere viewing and then will release the project for public consumption online. This film will be free to the public online. Art has a way of speaking beyond language and social barriers.We hope not only to create high-quality professional entertainment, but to cause our audiences to feel something deeply.",Filming a dance outdoors certainly comes with its fair share of challenges.  If there is a severe storm we will have to push our recording dates back.  Currently we have scheduled the film shoot for the first weekend in June.  The great thing about doing this as a video is that there is no need to rent a theatre or sell tickets.  We will be sharing the video widely through our internet channels once it is finished.  We can't wait to share this exciting piece of art with you!

All Frank and Michael haveis each other and the friendship they built through a wall. As Frank’s timedraws near, the youthful and tormented Michael must try come to terms with theidea of losing his only family.Will he understand the way life works andmake his peace in time?Here is a character study that contrasts the older,steadier nature of Frank with the tortured and desperate psyche of Michael.Their friendship has undoubtedly been a source of comfort to Frank, but he hascome to realise it’s a genuine lifeline for Michael.While still drawing on the purpose of capital punishmentand whether it is deterrent or vengeance, the play comes down to Frank’sattempts to help Michael see that, even on Death Row, there’s some value tobeing alive.Inspired by the works of Harold Pinter and MartinMcDonagh, 'The Pendulum Swings'is a remarkably sinister story offriendship, justice and complex human emotion.Through powerful dialogue and visceral movement design, our story is told in a way that's grounbreaking and memorable.Why?Although the story treads carefully around the subject matter, 'The Pendulum Swings' is nonetheless a bold venture and one that's never been done before.Channel 4's Crime and Punishment season and the Inside Death Row documentary with Trevor McDonald were both met with an overwhelming response in terms of UK viewings.This has shown and proved to us that there is a keen audience out there for a show that discusses Capital Punishment in close-up.'The Pendulum Swings' provides a rare opportunity for an audience to enter into a representation of Death Row and to witness an artistic interpretation of what happens there.So what have we got already?We’ve got a script that has received a number of industry appraisals and we’ve got a venue, which we will soon pay for. We are yet to cast the production but we are on the case and wecan’t wait to get started.Wherewill your money go?Every penny secured via Kickstarter will be stretched totake ‘The Pendulum Swings’ from script to stage. Here is exactly what you’re money will be used for. 1.Venue Hire 2.Rehearsal Space3.Set Design / Props4.Technician 5.Advertising Our actors will be paid on a profit-share basis. It wasimportant for us to work out a budget that was realistic and aprofit-share scheme meant that we were able to reduce our financial target, making it moreachievable.We’vegot big plans for TPS! After staging it locally, we really want to tour the showacross the UK and take it to the Edinburgh Fringe Festival. If you’d like us to bring the show where you are, pleaseget in touch! Schedule!We are aiming for a summer 2015 production (May/June). This will allow time for casting, rehearsals and dress runs to take place once funding is secured.Pleasehelp us to make this vision a reality!If this sounds like something that you'd liketo support, we'd really love your help, however big or small. We can't wait to get the rewards overto you too, so we hope you find something that you think is exciting.Please note: to those who willbe receiving tickets for the show, this is a UK-based production.If you can't support us directly, but love theproject, we'd be grateful if you could share it with your family andfriends.

You can also talk to us on twitter@ThePendSwings.Thanks so much and we hope to meet you all oneday.With love from everyone at TPS!#AnyLastWords?IMPORTANT NOTE: ‘The Pendulum Swings’ is a show designed for mature audiences and may not be appropriate for everyone. Although this is an important subject matter, it is told with black humour and some may find the language, imagery and nature of the piece too difficult to handle.","Although we plan for a smooth process leading up to the production, we are fully aware that this is the theatre and there are many aspects that need to come together on time for this to be successful. To make sure that they do, we have allowed enough time to resolve any issues if and when they arrise.   In the event that of the team failing to raise sufficient funds through Kickstarter:  At this point in time, we're relying on the success of the campaign in seeing the project through. If we fail to raise enough funds to pay for our costs, we will need to delay the project until a later date and look for alternative funding at that point.

It’s just that in here, we have the disadvantage of knowing when.”ABOUT‘The Pendulum Swings’ is a dark comedy set on America’s Death Row and it tells the story of two inmates awaiting their executions. The days are long and numbered. All Frank and Michael have is each other and the friendship they've built through a wall. As Frank’s time draws near, the youthful and tormented Michael must try and come to terms with the idea of losing his only family. Will he understand the way life works and make his peace in time?Here is a character study that contrasts the older, steadier nature of Frank with the tortured and desperate psyche of Michael. While still drawing on the purposes of capital punishment and whether it is deterrent or vengeance, the play comes down to Frank’s attempts to help Michael see that, even on Death Row, there is some value to being alive.Although this new piece of writing is based on information collated from books, interviews and documentaries, this is an artistic representation of that which occurs in one of the most unforgiving places on Earth, with all the atmosphere, spaces and uncomfortable pauses in that world.The play draws upon the dark tone of Martin McDonagh with movement inspired by Frantic Assembly.WATCH THE TRAILER HEREWHY?The steady influx of crime and punishment documentaries, from ITV’s ‘Inside Death Row with Trevor McDonald’ to Netflix’s more recent ‘Making A Murderer’, and the extremely high viewing ratings that they obtained, is evidence that people are very interested in the criminal justice system; and what better way to show it to them than with all the immediacy that live theatre provides?WHAT DO WE HAVE ALREADY?- An exciting five-star show ready to role out across venues nationwide.- Return dates off the back of our premiere (March 10-11).- Dialogue with interested venues looking to host our work.- Acomitted team of professional actors.- A clear vision of where we would like to take the production.YOUR MONEYEvery penny secured via our crowd funding campaign will be stretched tomake sure theatre-goers nationwide can enjoy the show thatwe're all so very proud of.Your money will gotowards venue hire, accommodation, food, travel and advertising.We have some incredible rewards to offer your in exchange for your monetary pledges and we look forward to getting those to you ASAP.Although your hard-earned cash will go a LONG WAY in helping us fulfil our project, the money we’re asking for will not cover all of our costs - it will simply give our project a 'kickstart'. We’ve calculated a minimum target here to get us off the ground, and we’re committed to recycling all production profit back into the show to keep us operational.This is so we’re not continuously relying on your money and it’ll help to keep us on course in our endeavour to show our work to as many audiences as we can.CAN YOU HELP?If this sounds like something that you'd like to support, we'd really love your help. We can't wait to get the rewards over to you too, so we hope you see one that you find most exciting!It is an incredible opportunity for us to showcase our work nationwide and your donation, however big or small, will be invaluable in enabling us to continue our journey.If you can't support us directly, but love the project, we'd be grateful if you could sharewith your family and friends. Every little helps.CONNECT WITH USWe'd be happy to talk to you and toanswer any questions you might have. You can comment here, email agameant@gmail.com or connect via Facebook /WeAreAGame and Twitter @WeAreAGame.Also, if you're in charge oftheatre programming and think our production would be great for your venue, or if you'd like us to consider coming to a theatre near you, then we'd love to hear from you.Thank you somuch - we hope that we can thank you in person one day.With love from everyone at TPS x","Although we plan for a smooth process, we are fully aware that this is theatre and there are many aspects that need to come together on time for us to be successful.

If all goes well I will be recording in January.",The only additional challenge is the cost of the flight and partial hotel cost but I’m not concerned about those as I’ve made the trip before.

(Please note that these arms will fit any drone or multi rotor UAV, not just the Spyder!)Just one small problem - the stock motor mounts were not very strong or nice looking and I read about people complaining how the motors can rip chunks out of the mounts in the event of a hard landing as the mounts are plastic.I searched for other options on the market which would meet the below requirements but could not find anything. Worse still, I found that most motor mounts out there had one or more problems. My requirements were:I found some options but none had all the requirements and So I set to designing and making my own.I found a person on peopleperhour.com who made the CAD file for me.Many revisions and optimisations later we had a version which could be milled into a real version.Then I found a company in China who could make the part using routing, milling and CNC. I tried sourcing this locally in the UK but prices were prohibitively expensive.After another long dialogue with the factory and many revisions later a version was ready for an initial production run. The factory made me a (quite expensive) prototype, which I have now tested and looks and works great!Picture below shows a single motor setup but you can combine 2 motor mount halves to set up coaxial configuration and have 2 motors per arm.I've already identified several improvements which will be in the final version - read on about this further down.Did I say they're light?!I was surprised to see they weighed in lighter than the original Sky Hero plastic ones!Sky hero mounts also need 8 nuts and bolts, mine need 5 only, further reducing weight. Why are 5 enough, you might ask? Because with aluminium being a metal and a much more structurally strong material, fewer fixing points are needed.I could make 3 more of these (I have a quad rotor drone) and be done here but the idea turned out quite nice and I want to share it with the community.I don’t want to go into full scale retail game, with distribution, stock, marketing, sales etc issues so thought kickstarter would be the best route.I’ve priced the parts pretty much just to cover costs and time spent hence the low price!The part will be made in 30mm and 25mm carbon fibre arm options and will fit most motors being able to take up to 55mm wide ones. When pledging - specify which version you need and also when sending our survey for shipping we will ask you to confirm this.If you have any other questions, please ask!Unlike many typical kickstarter projects, this one is in the final stages of development and will be shipping as early as September, worst case - October so you can get your hands on the product very soon!The final version will have the following improvements:If you have any suggestions, I may be able to amend the final designs and add your ideas to the product.The main features are:    Centring hole    LED window    Single motor with bottom cover plate or dual motor coaxial configs    Motor protected by protruding base and solid edges    Light! Just 70 grams per single motor set for a wide 50mm mount    Easier assembly with fewer tools - no need for spanners or pliers to hold the nut from hex holes    Neater - hex sink holes also mean no protruding nuts or bolt heads to catch on things    Longer lasting - hex holes instead of threaded holes means you don't need to throw away the whole mount if you damage  it    Sleek looking profile contributing to a better looking drone overall",Very little risk as the whole workflow has been already trial run from manufacturing to shipping. This is NOT a prototype project where production manufacturing is still to be set up and many things have not been tested.We have done small trial production runs and everything runs smoothly.The main risk is shipping and over subscription - if we get too many orders some people may get delivery delayed by 2-3 weeks.The good news is that unlike many kickstarter projects this one will be with you with a few weeks of funding - as opposed to months and months for many projects.,https://www.kickstarter.com/projects/1425032121/smart-power-extend-you-macbook-battery-time-x3-x4?ref=discovery_category_newest,1425032121/smart-power-extend-you-macbook-battery-time-x3-x4,"Q: What is Smart Power and why do we need you?A: An free for all to use app for Mac OS X which helps get more time out of your MacBook battery for which we need funds to develop it. All the research and feasibility studies have been done, now we need to develop it!Smart power is an app that runs on your laptop and helps get double or triple power from your battery, sometimes even more – compared to normal usage without the app.We want to develop the app and release as a free app for all to use!All backers will have early access to the app and be able to get your ideas and feature requests into the final product. This is a true not-for-profit community project!Look familiar?Nothing quite like realising you have 10 minutes battery left and are on a deadline to finish a presentation! Or even worse, to see the above - without ready access to a wall power socket.30,000 feet in the air or on a train (the ones without power sockets).Or somewhere out the field.By reducing screen brightness, backlight and turning off WiFi and Bluetooth, I noticed I started getting more time out of my MacBook Pro. A lot more time! Remaining operational time would go from 10 minutes to 45 just by doing this. That’s a X5 increase in time by not doing much at all!Smart Power will monitor and control the following to reduce battery drain: Smart Power will automatically set your above options to the best power saving configuration (you can customise these also) and alert you to any applications draining too much power, so you can close them.Smart power goes MUCH further than simple built-in Mac OS power management, which actually allows very little control over keyboard backlight settings, screen brightness and other power draining activities.Smart power turns off and reduces all non-critical resources so you get enough battery power to last you that long commute or flight or both!You can set keyboard backlight to be completely off, or just set to 1 ""bar"" and the same for the screen - plenty for working in a dark environment but pretty much doubling your time!Smart Power will alert you to any apps using more CPU power than normal, which leads to fast battery drainage.Why do you need this?I noticed that sometimes I get a lot of time on on my MacBook Pro (wht the screen brightness and backlight turned right down), and sometimes the battery would drain very quickly - as little as a couple of hours - giving me very little work time. By using various system monitoring tools, I noticed at the same time the CPU usage would be very hight. I was not editing video or rendering 3D or doing anything which would cause high CPU use. Then I found the main cause of this to be background applications (such as Google Drive, Microsoft Word, Mozilla Firefox, Mac Mail, etc) quietly draining the battery!The most usual offenders turned out to be:Even now that I know this, I don’t always quickly spot apps which run slowly, so I often run down my battery – by which time it’s too late.An alert to remind would save the day!But don't worry about the mumbo-jumbo if a lot of this does not make sense. The app simply uses several clever algorithms to manage power consumption much most efficiently. The app will automatically a) adjust screen and keyboard backlight brightness b) turn off wifi and bluetooth when not needed and c) monitor all applications running on your machine and alert you if any of them are using more power than normal.You can configure brightness as required and shut down the unneeded application to get more battery time (if you can/want).Whilst super simple to use, the application is complex and time consuming to code and test - not something I can do myself. An advanced professional software developer will take 3-6 weeks full time to develop this application.Unfortunately I also do not have the required funds to pay for the development of the app from my own pocket.I believe this app will help many and should be free, hence the kickstarter campaign.Please help and I hope you will find it give you that desperate extra 30 minutes, or as much as 1-2 hours for the urgent work - when you need it most!","Risks are mainly around time - as with all software projects it may take a little longer to develop the app than anticipated.I have been in the software industry for a 15+ years and have worked on many projects, however, so most risks have been mitigated and I have researched the project thoroughly and for a long time.The developer who will be coding this I have used many times before and the results are always outstanding!"
https://www.kickstarter.com/projects/braindream/maybe-independent-knowledge-magazine?ref=discovery_category_newest,braindream/maybe-independent-knowledge-magazine,"MayBe nasce dall’idea di voler dar vita ad un magazine online volto alla divulgazione scientifica, concentrandosi soprattutto nel campo delle scienze umane e del comportamento. MayBe vuole essere innovativo in questo senso, dando modo non solo a professionisti del settore, ma anche a studenti interessati a voler trovare uno spazio in cui poter pubblicare articoli che altrimenti non avrebbero modo di avere luce.  L’intento del magazine è quello di voler abbracciare, quindi, chiunque abbia voglia e capacità di stendere un articolo con argomento le scienze umane (o comunque materie umanistiche) ma non solo: anche interventi di persone provenienti da settori “lontani” a questi saranno presi in forte considerazione se interessati a contribuire. Questo viene fatto non solo per rendere il magazine vario, multidisciplinare e complesso, ma anche per riuscire a far interessare, appunto, lettori di ogni genere, che siano esperti del settore, persone interessate alla materia o semplici curiosi che siano. A cosa porterebbe tutto questo? Il magazine infatti non sarebbe il fine ma un mezzo per concretizzare un’aspettativa molto più ampia, cioè quella di voler far nascere una comunità che spinga chi ne fa parte a divulgare (come già detto) la conoscenza, a facilitare la comunicazione tra le persone del settore. Infatti il nostro obiettivo di più ampia aspettativa è quello di riuscire ad istituire un vero e proprio fulcro di ricerca, così da riuscire ad incentivare la ricerca dei giovani ricercatori Italiani, che sempre più preferiscono, giustamente, appoggiarsi alle opportunità al di fuori del nostro paese. Noi vogliamo riportare la voglia e l'incentivo giusto per far si che i giovani ricercatori, e non solo, potranno fare il proprio lavoro nel proprio paese. Inoltre, è importante specificare come MayBe voglia essere indipendente, libero da condizionamenti esterni che alterino in qualsiasi modo ogni intervento o articolo considerato valido che verrà pubblicato nel magazine.CHI SARA' AL NOSTRO FIANCO? MayBe per esistere e crescere ha bisogno naturalmente di autori. Il profilo dell’autore a cui vorremmo rivolgerci sono in primo luogo gli studenti. E’ molto difficile, infatti, per uno studente trovare un luogo in cui poter cominciare a pubblicare i suoi articoli, saggi e tesi. MayBe offre anche questo. Anche i semplici professionisti che operano sul territorio sono uno dei profili a cui MayBe si rivolge.  Un professionista che opera nel suo studio, potrebbe aver interesse o necessità di voler pubblicare un articolo scritto di suo pugno, ed è proprio su MayBe che potrebbe trovare il suo spazio. Seppur, visto il taglio del magazine, è naturale che gli autori provengano dall’ambito delle scienze umane e delle materie umanistiche in generale, anche persone provenienti da ambiti che possano sembrare esterni, possono trovare un loro spazio se ciò da quanto loro scritto è inerente al campo a cui ci interessiamo. In tutto questo l’autore avrà a disposizione uno spazio gratuito in cui sarà disponibile un’area personale in modo da favorire la comunicazione con altri autori, così da poter instaurare collaborazioni o luoghi di riflessione comuni. Nonostante la garanzia di non manipolarne in alcun modo il contenuto, è importante specificare come ogni scritto verrà vagliato da un team di controllo per garantire la qualità delle pubblicazioni.CHI NE FRUIRA'? Essendo una rivista online il target a cui ci rivolgiamo è molto ampio. Il nostro intento è quello di coinvolgere, oltre a curiosi e appassionati dell’argomento, anche gli stessi studenti. Proprio grazie alla divulgazione, gli studenti potranno infatti trovare spunti di riflessione per portare avanti i loro percorsi di studio, potendo così avere un riscontro con articoli o lavori pubblicati nel MayBe. I contenuti di MayBe saranno fruibili oltre che nel sito web, anche attraverso un’applicazione apposita per dispositivi IOS e Android che sarà sviluppata appena dopo il lancio della piattaforma, così da rendere più completa ed immediata l’esperienza. Ci teniamo a specificare, infine, come i servizi illustrati siano completamente gratuiti.

Come riconoscimento saranno elencati tutti i donatori all'interno di una sezione dedicata del sito web! Grazie di rendere tutto questo possibile! TI RINGRAZIAMO PER IL TUO CONTRIBUTO.ENGLISH VERSIONMayBe was born from the idea of ​​wanting to create an online magazine aimed at scientific popularization, focusing above all in the field of human sciences and behavior. It can be innovative in this sense, giving way not only to professionals in the sector, but also to students interested in wanting to find a space in which to publish articles that otherwise do not work clearly. The intent of the magazine is to want to embrace, therefore, anyone who wants and ability to write an article with the subject of the humanities (or in any case humanities) but not only: also interventions by people from ""distant"" sectors taken strongly consideration if interested in observing. The magazine is varied, multidisciplinary and complex, but also to be able to interest readers of all kinds, who are experts in the sector, people interested in the subject or just curious. What would all this lead to? In fact, the magazine would not be the end but a means of realizing a much wider expectation, that is, of wanting to be born a community that pushes those who are part of it to disseminate knowledge (as already mentioned), to use communication between the people of the sector. In fact, our aim of wider expectation is to be able to establish a real research hub, so as to be able to encourage the search for young Italian operators, who increasingly prefer, rightly, to rely on opportunities outside the our country . We want to bring back the desire and the right incentive to make young developers, and not only, have done their job in their own country. Furthermore, it is important to specify how May wants to be independent, free from external influences that alter in any way any intervention or article considered valid that will be published in the magazine.WHO WILL BE AT OUR SIDE? Perhaps to exist and grow it naturally needs authors. The profile of the author to whom we would like to turn first to the students. It is very difficult, in fact, for a student to find a place where he can start publishing his articles, essays and theses. May also offers this. Even the simple professionals who operate in the area are one of the profiles to which you can turn. A professional who works in his studio, may have interest or need to want to publish an article written in his own hand, and it is precisely on May. Although, given the cut of the magazine, it is natural that the authors come from the field of human sciences and humanities in general, even people who come from areas looking for exteriors, use their own space if they want from what is written about them is inherent to the field we are interested in. In all this the author will have a free space where a personal area will be available in order to encourage communication with other authors, so as to be able to establish collaborations or common places of reflection. Despite the guarantee of not manipulating the content in any way, it is important to specify how each writing will be examined by a control team to ensure the quality of the publications.WHO WILL USE IT? Being an online magazine, the target audience is very broad. Our intent is to involve, in addition to curious and passionate about the topic, also the students themselves. Precisely thanks to the dissemination, students must in fact find food for thought to continue their study paths, thus being able to get feedback with articles or related works in May. The contents of May will be available in addition to the website, also through a specific application for IOS and Android devices that will be developed just after the launch of the platform, so as to make the experience more complete and immediate. Finally, we would like to specify how the illustrated services are completely free. Perhaps, moreover, it embraces the environment and has reduced to a minimum the use of products and ""habits"" that somehow pollute and damage the environment.WHY DO WE NEED TO BE FINANCED? The funds that will be raised through crowfounding will go towards creating two different funds, excluding the sustainability costs of the platform and the team. 1) the first fund will be established in order to make an economic contribution to the authors who will write for the magazine. 2) A part will start building the ""SEARCH FOUND"" the research fund, which will then be used to finance research for young investments.How to recognize all donors will be listed in a dedicated section of the website!Thanks for making this possible!THANK YOU FOR YOUR CONTRIBUTION","Il nostro obiettivo principale, come già illustrato nel progetto, è quello di un fine più ambizioso, ovvero quello di riuscire a rilanciare spazi e incentivi per la ricerca nel nostro paese per i giovani ricercatori.

The innovation of MAY•BE gives both professionals and students a space where they can publish their articles that would never be issued otherwise. MAY•BE not only aims at gathering people interested in publishing articles related to human and behavioural science, but also allows people involved in other sectors to contribute to the magazine. The purpose is not only to create a varied, multidisciplinary and complex magazine, but also to catch the attention of both professionals and general readers, whether they are interested or not in the subjects. In order to give a sense to its official presentation, the platform was launched on 20th March 2020, a date chosen to mark Albert Einstein’s theory of relativity published in the magazine “Annaleen Der Physik” in 1916.What do we want to achieve? The magazine achieves to a bigger expectation, such as the creation of a community that spreads knowledge and simplifies communication between people in this sector. As a matter of fact, our main objective is the foundation of a research hub that motivates young Italian researchers who would choose to go abroad. We want to give young researchers, and people in general, the right motivation and desire to continue working in their country. Furthermore, it’s important to underline that MAY•BE wants to be independent and free from any external factors that may alter articles or papers in the magazine.WHO WILL BE AT OUR SUPPORTERS? MAY•BE needs writers. First of all we need students, as for them it’s very hard to publish their own essays, dissertations and papers. And that’s exactly what MAY•BE offers. MAY•BE also offers space to professionals who are interested in publishing their articles. Despite being a magazine related to general science popularization, MAY•BE provides space even to those who are not in this sector but want to publish something pertaining to our subjects. Writers will have a free space in which they can access a personal area in order to communicate, cooperate and share their opinions with other writers, with the aim of creating an actual online and scientific workplace made in Italy. We guarantee we won’t manipulate your articles, although a control team will examine the quality.WHO IS IT FOR? Being an online magazine, our target is varied. We aim at involving students, interested people and human science enthusiasts. Thanks to MAY•BE, students will find food for thought and confirmation documents. In order to provide a complete and immediate experience, the contents of MAY•BE will be accessible not only on the website, but also on an app available for IOS and Android which will be developed after the launch of the platform. We also want to highlight the illustrated services are totally free of charge. MAY•BE is also eco-friendly and we have reduced the use of products and “habits” that are environmentally dangerous and polluting.WHAT DO WE EARN? Our platform will have targeted web banners, affiliations for the purchase of our students and writers’ articles and, furthermore, we will sell ad space to businesses related to our sector.WHY DO WE NEED FUNDING? Funding obtained through crow funding will be destined to the creation of two different funds, except for the expenditure for our team and platform:1.Some funding to supporting economically our authors that will write for our magazine;2.Some for the “Research Fund” which will finance our young researchers’ studies.Thanks for making this possible!CEO: Manuele BattistiniEditor in Chief: Dr Francesco MazzoniDevelopment Director: Andrea MorgantiTHANK YOU FOR YOUR CONTRIBUTION.中文版MAY•BE 诞生于一个想法，想创造一个在科学领域上传播的线上杂志，而该杂志首先关注的是人文科学和心理学的领域。MAY•BE 希望在这种想法上进行创新，不仅仅是给该领域的专业人员，还想让那些对这个领域感兴趣的学生来发表相关文章，否则他们会错过一个启发的机会。因此该杂志的目的是要聚集那些想要或者有能力撰写或涉及人文科学（或者在人文科学领域上的人）为该主题做文章的人，不仅仅是：来自于不同领域的人，如果有兴趣，请认真对待。这样做不仅使该杂志具有多样性，跨越科学领域和不同性质的杂志，还想希望能够吸引各种读者，不论他们是该领域的专家，或对该主题感兴趣的人 也可以是对该主题好奇的人。该平台开启于2020年3月20日，并非随机开启，因为1916年爱因斯坦（Albert Einstein) 在《物理学》在这本杂志上发表了他的广义相对论。这一切会导致什么？实际上该杂志并不是最终的终点，而是一种实现更广泛期望的想法，并希望创建一个社交活动，推动该社交的相关人员传播知识，以促进人与人之间的交流。该部门实际上更期望的目标是能够建立一个真正的研究中心，从而能够鼓励跟寻找年轻的意大利研究人员（或者来自别的国家的研究人员），从而让他们能正确地倾向于依靠自身以外国家的机会。我们希望带回渴望和适当的动力，以确保年轻的研究人员不仅能够在自己的国家还能在其他的国家开展工作。此外最重要的是指maybe希望如何独立，不受外界影响，该影响会以任何方式改变会在该杂志上发表任何干预措施或文章。MayBe自然需要作者生存和成长。我们想要联系的作者简介主要是学生。实际上，对于学生来说，找到一个可以开始发表文章，论文和论文的地方非常困难。 MayBe也提供此功能。即使是在该地区工作的简单专业人员也可以成为MayBe的重点之一。在他的工作室工作的专业人士可能有兴趣或需要发表用自己的双手撰写的文章，而正是在MayBe上，他才找到了自己的空间。尽管考虑到该杂志的剪裁，自然而然地，作者来自人文科学和人文科学领域，即使来自外部地区的人们也可以找到自己的空间（如果他们所写的内容是固有的）到我们感兴趣的领域。在所有这一切中，作者将拥有一个自由空间，在该空间中将有一个个人区域，以鼓励与其他作者的交流，以便能够建立协作，共同思考的地方，也可以与以下目的进行合作：在意大利完全在线建立一个真正的科学工作场所。尽管可以保证不以任何方式处理内容，但重要的是指定控制团队将如何检查每篇著作，以确保出版物的质量。作为在线杂志，我们的目标范围非常广泛。除了对这个话题充满好奇和热情之外，我们的目的是让学生自己参与进来。通过传播，学生的确可以找到思想上的食物来继续他们的学习道路，从而能够获得MayBe发表的文章或作品的反馈。MayBe的内容不仅可以在网站上访问，还可以通过IOS和Android设备的专用应用程序访问，该应用程序将在平台启动后立即开发，从而使体验更加完整和直接。最后，我们要指定插图服务如何完全免费。 MayBe还可以与环境结合，并将对产品和“习惯”的使用减少到某种程度上污染和破坏环境的程度。我们的平台内部将放置有针对性的广告横幅，这将带给我们货币化，我们还将为购买我们撰写的文字或作者撰写评论的文字做准备，这些文字显然与我们的方向相关。此外，我们将为公司（与该行业相关）提供购买在我们平台上的广告空间的可能性。通过众筹筹集的资金将用于创建两个不同的基金，其中不包括平台和团队的可持续性成本。1）将设立第一笔资金，以便为将为该杂志撰稿的作者做出经济贡献。2）一部分将开始建立“研究基金会”研究基金，然后将其用于资助年轻研究人员的研究。感谢您使这一切成为可能！首席执行官-Manuele Battistini编辑总监-Francesco Mazzoni博士开发总监-Andrea Morganti谢谢您的贡献。","ITA_ Il nostro obiettivo principale, come già illustrato nel progetto, è quello di un fine più ambizioso, ovvero quello di riuscire a rilanciare spazi e incentivi per la ricerca nel nostro paese per i giovani ricercatori.

So already in itself this end contains a great risk. But in the worst case scenario, the magazine will be able to exist and still be able to spread science.中文_正如该项目已经说明的那样，我们的主要目标是一个更宏大的目标，即能够为年轻的研究人员重新开辟空间并激励他们在我国进行研究。 因此，这本身已经包含了巨大的风险。 但是在最坏的情况下，该杂志将能够存在并且仍然能够传播科学。"

guitarra eléctrica y los géneros que prefiero son el Metal y La música de Camara, Dentro de mis obras publicadas y no publicadas esta: ""Concierto Para Guitarra Eléctrica y Orquesta de Cuerdas en Re Mayor"" Sonata para Violoncelo y Piano, Mi disco Conceptual de Power Metal Progresivo ""Cuentos Prehispánicos"" y Mi primer disco conceptual de Heavy Metal ""Deportes Extremos"" Entre otras...Comencé mis primeras clases de guitarra hace mas de 20 años, cuando tenia aproximadamente unos 5 o 6 años de edad, a los 18 años ingrese a la facultad de música de la universidad Autónoma de Tamaulipas graduando me con un promedio Mayor a 9, actualmente estudio mi último año de la Lic en Arreglo y composición en la Escuela Superior de Composición y arreglo musical (ESCAM)Desde que empecé a dedicarme profesionalmente al estudio de la música pasaba el día entero estudiando solfeo, armonía,entrenamiento auditivo e instrumento, ademas de experimentar mis primeras composiciones, era tanta mi disciplina y obsesión que mis amigos y familiares se preocupaban sobretodo cuando inicie la LicenciaturaPrueba de ello es toda mi obra publicada y sin publicar 2 discos conceptuales que manejan armonía moderna y compases de amalgama, algo que no se ve común mente en el Metal Mexicano.La elaboración de estos discos fue muy complicada, invertí mis ahorros en ellos y entregué el alma a la música, todas las situaciones malas y buenas que me pasaron en su proceso fueron las heridas del tiempo que me hicieron mas fuerte.""Cuentos Prehispánicos"" mi mas reciente disco es una obra que musicalmente considero innovadora para el mundo del Power Metal Progresivo por su armonía poco convencional al usar acordes alterados, bajo continuo, conducción de voces, acordes a 4 y mas partes y escalas poco usadas en el mundo del metal, ademas de su riqueza rítmica con combinaciones de compases binarios, ternarios y de amalgama, no por esto diga que me considere mejor o que mis composiciones sean mejores que otros, sin embargo es un valor agregado que me diferencia de los demás.Mi Próximo concierto titulado ""Cuentos Prehispánicos"" es un sueño pues nunca he tenido un concierto propio en vivo (Solo presentè una canción en el guitar fest 2010 otra en el guitar fest 2012, otra abriendo a Fogo Ensemble en el Teatro Bicentenario de Nahucalpan, otra en La Fes Cuahutitlàn, y en la presentación del año pasado donde presente 4 de mis canciones donde compartí escena con Serio Luis Palacios ) Pero necesito saber que se siente tocar un concierto propio porque ¿De que se alimenta el alma de un músico si no es del aplauso del publico?.Hace ya varios años que mi alma se encuentra en las tinieblas, pues no logro sentir esa pequeña migaja de éxito en la música, por eso no solo quiero hacer éste concierto realidad, si no que quiero grabarlo en vivo y ademas poder maquilar mis discos los cuales solo se encuentran en las plataformas digitales (Todas) de streaming y descarga.Videoclip oficial: Viaje a Mictlan de mi disco ""Cuentos PrehispanicosLa colaboración que solicito es para dar un gran empujón a mi carrera musical, actualmente pago la colegiatura de mi escuela y el Viaje que realizo para llegar a ella y es muy costoso, mis padres me ayudan con una pensión para ello, pero no me alcanza para invertir en maquila, publicidad, renta de equipo, sesiones fotográficas etc.. y todo lo que he logrado ha sido de lo poco que ahorro para ello, al ser solista también el gasto individual es mas grande porque además tendré que pagar a músicos para los ensayos y la presentación, los gastos principales son:Ensayos, Renta de equipo, grabación de audio y vídeo en vivo, maquilas, publicidad, boletos, renta del lugar, diseños de arte, sesiones fotográficas, personal de staff y recepción y la lista parece infinitaLa aceptación de mi mas reciente disco ha sido maravillosa y he recibido muchísimas criticas favorables, muchos se han sorprendido y lo han descrito como ""Un discazo"" sin duda tengo mucha fe en este nuevo proyecto y las buenas criticas me motivan a alcanzar éste proyecto.""Un poco de como grabè los solos de Cuentos Prehispanicos""No solo es un disco mas de Metal, si no que rescata la cultura y la historia Mexicana, pues esta basado en 3 libros: , La visión de los vencidos de Miguel de Leòn Portilla, El Popol Vuh de Los Mayas y al final es un poema inspirado en Brevisima relación de la Destrucción de las Indias de Fray Bartolomè de las Casas.Si logro rebasar la cantidad mencionada, haré una gira promocional en mi zona el próximo año y si supera muchisimo mas de lo esperado tengo en la mira a Monterrey, Guadalajara y Ciudad de México para otra gira promocional (Ademas de las zonas cercanas a los Lugares mencionados como Puebla, Hidalgo Veracruz, Toluca, San Luis o Guerrero.)","El riesgo que conlleva animarme a hacer éste proyecto realidad, es un tropiezo mas de miles, es verdad que cada que recibo un golpe me desanimo y me da mucho coraje, `pero si no me levantara cada vez que me he caído no habría grabado mis dos discos anteriores, ni hubiera compuesto tantas obras, ni siquiera estaría en mi ultimo año de Lic.

""Something happened: we connected with people and have developed an evangelical like following. Our Calypso Wingers (what we call our Fans) are remarkably supportive and really believe in our creativity. We want to see our brand grow organically to reach every State and beyond. To continually enhance our brand in markets in which we’ll resonate,” - Chris McGregor (Owner).Calypso Wings LLC has positioned itself for a huge break though in the food market. We are simply taking a tried and proven process and kicking it up a couple notches. What I mean is, we are taking a simple but enjoyable food item like chicken wings and giving it a face lift.So let me tell you a little about us and where we're coming from and where we're trying to go. We know you will be energized after reading this overview. Calypso Wings started in December 2012 as a Catering Company with a goal of establishing a Fast/Casual Brick and Mortar for Walk-Ins and Take-Out.We are a Chicken Wing business that specializes in unique wing flavors, that infuses various sauces, spices and fruit to please almost every pallet. There are twenty flavors, from our signature ""Pa'Zing Pizza Wings"", ""Minty Mojito Wings"" and ""Bacon Cheeseburger Wings"" just to name a few. Calypso Wings concentrate on just the wings, that's why we believe our wings are top notch. We season and marinate our wings for 24 hours, so the flavor goes all the way to the bone.Since Calypso Wings began, we have gained a size-able momentum via social media. Our wing flavors have even received one million hits on the web and we were featured on such popular social media site as, The Chive, Imgur and Reddit. Calypso Wings was created to be a franchiseable chicken wing concept. Our goal is to start the very first Calypso Wings in Georgia.We will position ourselves as a unique, socially responsible, Walk-In/Take Out family style eatery that will serve the Best wings on Earth that leave a smile on everyone's face while making a significant impact on the world.","Calypso Wings will face lots of challenges going from a catering company to a brick and mortar location. Our main risk potentially involves accounting, time management and employee relationships.Fortunate for us we will utilize our various resources to assist us with the growing pains of any business.

I would like to continue to build the Island ArtBeat brand by becoming a vendor at The Painted Tree Marketplace in Buford Georgia. The Painted Tree Marketplace will be opening their newest store cross from the Mall of Georgia, which is the largest and most visited mall in the entire state of Georgia, with over a million visitors per year.

https://www.kickstarter.com/projects/mvpllc/rhyme-times-educational-animated-program-for-kids?ref=discovery_category_newest,mvpllc/rhyme-times-educational-animated-program-for-kids,"Rhyme Times Episode 1 Video Synopsis:To see written Synopsis scroll down.Hello, We are Multivision Productions, LLC based in West Lafayette, Indiana. We came up with this animated program simply because we are parents trying to teach our own children to learn and realize how challenging it can be at times. We have met with other parents and realized that we were not alone. This is something that a lot of parents are experiencing with their own children.So we decided to go public with the product and idea. While we know if we sold the idea to the big networks it would take off much faster, we want to keep the project fun and finish as much of the series independently so when the networks make the offer for the series, it will be complete and can keep its originality and creativity.After studying this method of teaching we have found that it is easier for children to learn when the material is put into song, animation, and  rhyme. This series covers mathematics, measuring, the alphabet, and identifying obstacles and conquering them.A little support will go a long way. We have the tools but need the budget to compete and complete our project.Multivision Productions, LLC Funding will be used for: 1. Hiring more animators to create more diverse programming 2. PR & promotion to let everyone know the program is available 3. Improved equipment (for maximum productivity) 4. Bringing ""Rhyme Times"" live to schools across the US 5. Working with networks to get ""Rhyme Times"" on T.V.We will be hiring interns from The Art Institute of Indianapolis, Purdue University West Lafayette, IN & Ivy Tech Community College Lafayette, IN to help with the animation of this series.Episodes are still in the production stages and we want to create and finish them before we release them to the public and pitch them to the networks.""We are determined and will not give up until Rhyme Times is complete""Show SynopsisAuthor: Multivision Productions LLCTitle of show: Rhyme TimesFormat: Children Animation (Educational Programming)Logline: “Rhyme Times”. An educational animated program to help kids learn multiplication and the alphabet, this is a fun way to help them learn. This series covers mathematics, measuring, the alphabet, and identifying obstacles then conquering them.Treatment/Synopsis: : Rhyme Times includes several different small episodes within each 30 min full episodes. First we start with Alphabet Times. this is a short animated episode that features a colorful and fully animated background and moving objects combined with each letter of the alphabet. This way as the child is learning the letters, it holds their interest and they have many different visuals to enjoy and don’t even realize that they are learning. This show also has an underline task of being very colorful and showing identifiable objects that subconsciously teach so that smaller children that have not yet began to speak will still want to pay attention. This helps them with their developmental skills.Next we have Space Times; this short animated episode takes place on a floating small planet in space. The planet has a small red house next to a space lake and we take the viewers inside the house where there are different pictures on the wall and props to give it a realistic feel. The learning takes place on a chalkboard to give kids the feel of a comfortable school. Space Times focuses mainly on teaching children how to remember their mathematics through repetitive rhymes. (Example: 6x6 picking up sticks, counted them all there were 36. 6x6=36) The host of this show is a small funny character with a 70’s voice and colorful appearance which helps keep the kids attention as if he is the teacher of their dreams.Then we have Clay Times: This short animated episode uses Stop Motion & Claymation. The main character is a small red clay figure with a big smile. The voice is unisex and can be interpreted as a small boy or young girl since it is very light, (similar to an Elmo feel). He rides into his little village on a motorcycle which gives him the cool biker look. His main objective is to teach children how to count numbers. Sometimes he takes a ride on his bike while passing by different numbers and counting them, or he dances around his animated village using little props to help him teach the counting. When he is through it is back to the intro scene where he is back on his peaceful ride through his peaceful animated village.The next few short episodes are filler episodes; Sky times, which is always something to do with the air to the ground. So far we have used a 2 dimensional skydiver in a 3 dimensional world that has to avoid obstacles while coming down and counting them on the way down. Then we recap to see how many numbers we learned to count today. Next is Nature Times; a short break just to view animated nature. This gives children a chance to experience watching a natural setting that may have never been to one or seen it for themselves, IE; city kids or sheltered children. These are followed by animated interludes with the name of the show repeated in creative ways to make sure the viewer remembers the name of the show.The next short animated episode is Measurement Times; this is all about measuring and the history of the ruler, different types of measuring instruments & where they all came from. We detail the inches, cm & show children how to use the ruler and how it impacts our world today. The background is motion animation and a ruler is usually used in the program.Then we have Robot Times; this animated episode is hosted by a 3d robot in a 3d world. He uses different portals on his wall to find letters that are mixed up and flips them around in order to try and make a real word out of them (similar to a puzzle book). Once he has solved all of the word problems he gives the viewers positive reinforcement and has a system overload spinning out of control and disappears. This gives the viewer a chance to see animation in fast forward and also helps children with their hand and eye coordination and focus since they are trying to keep their eye on the robot while he is spinning.Finally we have Sports times; this is a short animated episode designed to teach children how to keep score and to get them used to watching sports. We have basket ball courts with balls being shot into the hoop and low muffled commentary in the background audio and crowds cheering, or football games with field goal kicks, this way we don’t have to focus on the players but keep the attention on the score board and what earned the point.Finally we have Sports times; this is a short animated episode designed to teach children how to keep score and to get them used to watching sports.

This way we don’t have to focus on the players but keep the attention on the score board and what earned the point.After this we repeat earlier episodes with short versions of the earlier episodes and separate them with animated interludes and positive reinforcement messages.END“All Shows will have the name ""Times"" associated with them to mirror the show title” (Rhyme Times). We plan on starting with episode 1, continuing through to 10 full episodes per season. This however is up for negotiation if a network or project demanded more we would adjust our total episodes accordingly.We will follow this series by bringing Rhyme Times Live to different schools in the U.S. and give children a chance to participate while completing learning activities and games live and being recorded to be added on future Rhyme Times Episodes. Rhyme Times will also be translated in all the major languages across the globe so that kids of all nationalities can benefit from our programing.","We have minimum risk & very little challenges. The risk involves creating a program that will interest the younger viewers and appeal to the parents allowing them to watch but from the short samples and completed components we have shared we have received nothing but positive feedback from our program.The challenge will be pitching the completed series to the major networks and finding the correct outlet to broadcast it nation-wide but with the digital era arriving we will still be able to reach a wide audience on our own. YouTube, PBS, Netflix, Amazon, Itunes & many more.https://www.facebook.com/rhymetimesdvd",https://www.kickstarter.com/projects/mvpllc/hipsterz-wallet?ref=discovery_category_newest,mvpllc/hipsterz-wallet,"Hipsterz Wallet.The reason we came up with the idea for Hipsterz is because we were honestly just tired of struggling to pull out our wallet when we were at the drive-thru waiting on food, or the drive-up ATM holding up the line because we couldn't get to our wallets fast enough.We know that the fanny packs were a past solution but also observed that the trend had died out fast when senior citizens became branded with the packs.So this fixes the problem and also creates a new style to carry our most valuable items with us every day with quick access and safely by our side.BENEFITS OF HIPSTERZ WALLET:1. Stays strapped on your belt so it cannot be dropped.2. Is hard to steal since it is attached to you.3. Easy to conceal under shirts & coats so no one knows your wearing it.4. Speeds up the time spent at the drive-thru5. Is light and not bulky, perfect for a comfortable ride.6. Works excellent if your out for a ride on your motorcycle.7. Comes in men and women styles so everyone can wear it.DOWNFALLS TO HIPSTERZ WALLET:1. You don't have one yet! :)____________________________________________The Purpose Of Our KickstarterThe purpose of our kickstarter is to raise capitol in order to buy inventory and start distribution of our wallets. We already have a warehouse, office building, equipment, employees & marketing resources but now that we have settled on our logo, we need to purchase new material with the logo already printed on the fabric.This way it will be cheaper to manufacture and we can make enough wallets to distribute nation wide.

https://www.kickstarter.com/projects/wallinscreek/hope-is-never-gone-based-on-true-events?ref=discovery_category_newest,wallinscreek/hope-is-never-gone-based-on-true-events,"We need your help to make thisdramatic film that will open one's eyes and tug at their hearts.This short film, HOPE IS NEVER GONE, is based on true events and is a very important film that gives you a glimpse of what it is like for someone in emergency services (EMT, FIRE, POLICE)to suffer with PTSD. It shows how one might be able to overcome it or at the very least...control it.The film focuses on the emergency responders who must see tragedy on a daily basis. They can end up suffering from PTSD and if they don't know how to help themselves, they can't keep on helping others. They too become a victim. The story follows Hope. A woman who volunteers/works as an Emergency Medical Technician (EMT) and a volunteer firefighter. After responding to a house fire, for the past nine months or so she has suffered silently with PTSD. Not knowing where to turn to, she withdraws from everything even away from her friends. One friend confronts her and soon realizes what Hope is going through. She begins to help Hope cope and understand what is going on with her. You willfeel and hear what she has dealt with for so long. Typically, when you hear the letters, PTSD, you automatically think of the military. The colorteal is the official color ribbon for PTSD awareness.What you may not know is, and what very little attention is given to, is that PTSD is something anyone can suffer from it. It is a mental health issue that needs to have awareness not just for the military but for all citizens. There are a variety of ways on how everyday people like you and me can be affected by it.This short film will have a 3 day shoot and about a 20 minute run time. It is from a multipleaward winning filmmaker and writer, Kim Childers. Kim has been a certified EMT and a volunteer firefighter in the past. Jack Midkiff has signed on to this project for creating the score and music. They have worked together in the past on projects. Crew is nearly chosen and at least one member of cast may be signed on. One main cast role to go.It is our hopes that this film will help someone understand they are not alone and they can get help or maybe someone recognizes some of the signs and symptoms ina friend or loved oneand realizes they need to get them help. If this film can help just one person, then it has done its job and what we set out to do. Which is help others.Every little bit will help make this film and get it out there. You can be a partof getting it completed andbe helpingsomeone else in the process. We want to raise the funds, film it, complete it, and have it ready to premiere during mental health awareness month which is May.It takes Dedication, Service, Commitment, Honor, and Sacrifice to be an emergency responder (EMS, Fire, Police). It takes Courage for one suffering to ask for help.Here is our budget: (part of this budget, $1500, has been received as in-kind services or donations so far- this covers the promo, kickstarter fees, rewards, and misc items that may arrise)Items that are the awards: Wristbands with positive words like courage, strength, hope, etc. they come in teal (the word printed will be randomly chosen)Mental Health Awareness Lanyard and aDrawstring bagMini poster of film's posterand the posteron a tee shirtSponsor credits along with Associate Producer, Producer, and Executive Producer credits with IMDb creditsDVD's, Premiere Tickets (does not include travel,lodging, or meals)Movie reel playing cards, special thank you in credits, and sit among the filmmakers at the premiere","The main challenge we have is being able to sign on a well known actress. If we are unable to sign her, we can have someone ready to step in. With so few characters in the script, cast and crew are pretty much filled.We are hoping with raising the funds to cover costs that she will sign on. It's a small cast and crew so but it still could pose several challenges. We are planning on a variation of them to overcome them before we have to deal with them.",https://www.kickstarter.com/projects/wallinscreek/lost-hope?ref=discovery_category_newest,wallinscreek/lost-hope,"Based on true events, LOST HOPE shows that for firstresponders (EMT’s, Firefighters, & Police) one of the toughest things todeal with is a tragic scene. A scene that can and will ‘haunt’ the firstresponder throughout their lives often altering their lives forever. Typically associated with the military, anyone can in factexperience PTSD and no truer is that of first responders and what they seedaily. Many learn to live, to cope, and to control those emotions, visions, andmemories that trigger bouts of depression, anxiety, and guilt. Sadly, it isoften not spoken of amongst the ranks for fear of being seen as weak. Nor dofriends, family, and co-workers know what to look for when a loved one issuffering. Many times the one that is suffering believes that suicide is theanswer. Awareness must be brought to the light and help needs to be given tothese people. This film will show people the signs, comments, and otherways of identifying PTSD and or the suicide thoughts. If you see these signs,please get the person help as soon as possible. This film also shows how tohandle the situations, how to talk to the person, and how to react to theircrisis. To consider suicide, it takes the person going to a very, very darkplace. Without help, that person will have a plan and attempt suicide. To havea friend see what’s going on, it is essential that they do all they can to keepthe one suffering from attempting to do so. I know. I speak from experience. I suffered from PTSD daily after a tragic fire scene where athree year old perished. I have been in that very dark place. I had a plan. Someonesaw the changes in me happening and confronted me and helped me which helpedkeep me going. I still suffer today. I still have the memories. Does it stillaffect me? Yes it does. It will always be with me. But I chose to not let itdecide my fate. This film shows that not everyone can be saved.I need your help in getting this film and its informationout to the public. If it can save one life, it was worth creating.Breakdown of budget is fairly simple. Much has been donated already or are from in-kind services. The following is what's needed to go into production.Props $225Music $305Food/Meals $295Stock Footage $535Cast & Crew wages $1635Total $2,995LOST HOPE is being created based on true events. It is in good hands coming from a multi-award winning filmmaker and award winning writer. ",It is a sensitive subject and somewhat graphic descriptions which could affect the cast and crew as nothing else could. We will have an on-set counselor for those who may need it. We have the script completed and ready. The breakdown of the script is being completed presently. Lining up the cast and crew is in full swing. Locations might be a challenge to secure but alternative ideas are in place in the event we can't get a diner and bar. All else is taken care of. Scheduling might be somewhat a challenge but everyone involved has a flexible work schedule that will help. Instead of a couple of weekends shooting we may have to do some evenings through the week. Everyone is on board and supporting this important film.
https://www.kickstarter.com/projects/qcsaintsproductions/southern-nights-feature-film?ref=discovery_category_newest,qcsaintsproductions/southern-nights-feature-film,"What is ""SOUTHERN NIGHTS""?  Southern nights is a feature length horror film set in the backwoods of Gilchrist County in North Florida. The writer, Adam Cole, has lived in this area off and on for nearly a decade and could not pass on the opportunity to use it as the sinister setting of a horror film.  SYNOPSIS: When a college graduation party is crashed by a lone woman looking for help. Three college graduates learn why it's not safe in small, backwoods Florida towns.  WHY DO WE NEED YOUR HELP?  We've been working on this and other scripts for the past 3 years and have finally finished them and are ready for pre-production. Which is the stage we're in. We've begun casting and have many of the roles filled. We've also found many great locations to set the mood perfectly. Along with the cast, we've got an amazing crew including our director of photography, Doug Weldon. And our head of makeup, a very talented up-and-coming makeup & fx artist, Lynsey Randolph. We've got a ton of work to do. Let me be honest and say that ""Southern Nights"" will be made, with or without funding. What it comes down to is this: YOU are in a unique position to directly impact how awesome we can make it! You are the difference between a mediocre project and a memorable one. The essentials to making this project stand out are: Original music - All great films have unforgettable music. ""Southern Nights"" needs a haunting melody to guide the audience through the carnage. Color Correction & Visual FX - We really need the blood to shine and the gore to look grimey & real. There are a couple of shots that will test the talent of our make-up fx artist. Festival Fees - These can be costly and they can add up fast when you're submitting to a handful of them. Most festivals charge $30-$60 to enter a film! Then there's the hidden cost of burning DVD's and paying for shipping. Our hope is to submit ""Southern Nights"" to 5-6 film festivals. 100% of all donations will go directly to making ""Southern Nights"" the best it can be. WHO WE ARE  - We are an independent film and television production company & home of the film franchise ""The Adventures of Beer-Man"". Formerly, we were known as Brat Prince Entertainment. As Brat Prince, we produced live professional wrestling events, and their webcasts, for companies such as Professional Championship Wrestling, Carolina Championship Wrestling & Mid-Atlantic Wrestling. We currently have a catalog of 11 films that we will be producing, beginning with ""Southern Nights."" As for television, we have begun work on a new webcast television sketch comedy program ""W.T.F. TV"".  Our cast is simply phenomenal. They are all amazing actors in their own right and they each play their parts to perfection. From introducing the world to the talents of Sarah Macdonell, to our character actor, Jason Dentino as the evil Colton Grundy. Each actor has been chosen to fit their roles perfectly. We have also, from the script alone, received interest from a couple distributors who are interested in viewing and possibly purchasing the film once complete. Most notably, the legendary independent film company, Troma Entertainment. Please check out our rewards section and see if you find something that interests you there.

To make this project affordable I need some help. The models need to be paid as well as a couple of lights need to be purchased. In order for my vision to be expressed, all I need is the opportunity. Thank you.","The only setback I may have is having a studio to work with. I know there are many outdoor opportunities as well as finding the right indoor facilities, which can be a friend's house or my garage. I can find the right lighting with a good backdrop anywhere. I have confidence that I can overcome any obstacle that may come my way.",https://www.kickstarter.com/projects/886792937/being-human?ref=discovery_category_newest,886792937/being-human,I want to explore the beauty of nude women. A woman is the most attractive and alluring human being. They divert our attention to to them. It is hard not to notice a beautiful woman. To see them it is to desire them. This brings a feeling of excitement that is hard to control. It is overwhelming at times. That is what makes us lust over them. An instinct to be happy and content is to find a mate of the opposite sex. A life of fulfillment comes from being with somebody. Love is felt like no other feeling in human nature. Sex is the outcome we all hope to accomplish. It is part of being human. We all want to be loved. Which is why we enjoy the beauty that women extrude. I want to express this beauty through my photographs. Having a studio is a requirement for making such images that depict the desire of our need to be loved by such beautiful women. It is in a controlled environment so I can create the correct mood. I need the right tools to complete this project. I hope to accomplish my goal of expressing a mood we can't resist. The lust that overcomes us by witnessing such beauty from images I create is for everybody to see and feel. I just need the opportunity to show what I can do.,My experience and education has prepared me to exceed at overcoming any obstacle that may hinder my project. It comes from being creative in any situation that may arise. I don't see them as obstacles but an opportunity to think of new ideas to complete the project at hand. It is using what I have to my best ability to accomplish my goal. It is coming up with new innovative techniques for making great photographs. The challenges after the project is funded is marketing to the right demographics for increased sales of my images. Word of mouth and the Internet are great tools for selling photographs. Social media is another avenue to create revenue.

I began working in a donut shop and quickly fell in love decorating the donuts and creating coffees for people. I began a very deliberate, relentless mission to learn how to make the best gluten-free food ever because as much as I want to eat the food at the donut shop I couldnt due to my own food allergies and intolerances.Now, after only five months of officially being in business part-time with my daughter, we are feeding folks from all over Wichita County, Texas who want memorable baked goods that really make a statement. The fact that everything's gluten free is just the cherry on top (I'll also always have plenty of vegan and allergy-friendly items in stock). 🍒Usually gluten-eaters get to have all the fun, but we’re flipping the script! At CC Confectionery Creations, gluten-free food is the focus, not just an afterthought.Why? I was diagnosed with gluten and dairy intolerance almost 3 years ago. As a person who loves food this shattered me–food is such a big part of my life. How could I never eat bread again? My personal struggle combined with seeing the overwhelmingly positive reception and huge demand for gluten free really lit a fire under my buns to create an equally delicious and impressive option for people who are avoiding wheat, no matter the reason.I work to constantly develop new recipes: from cakes and pastries made with unusual and exotic ingredients to simpler, more nostalgic things. I’m doing it with an emphasis on, and commitment to, providing a seasonal menu that ebbs, flows, fluctuates, and adapts to the seasons, the climate, and mother nature. Supporting farmers in the area is not only great for our local economy, it also ensures you’re getting the best product at the peak of freshness and flavor. Farm to table baking is truly a no-brainer. 👩‍🌾From the moment I decided to open a commercial spot, I’ve wanted it to be community-funded. Why? I got here with your support, and I won’t be able to make it without it. 💞 So many people have asked how they can support CC Confectionery Creations–here’s your chance! If you can’t support financially, please boost this campaign in any way you can: through Twitter, Instagram, email, snail mail, screaming from rooftops. Whatever your preferred method, I am so grateful for your support.Its important to note that we have thirty (30) days to reach the 40k mark, and on Kickstarter, if you don’t meet your goal you don’t get the cash. Help me SMASH this goal and create an inclusive and exciting bakery for all!All of the money that you'll be contributing to this campaign is going toward building a bakery that will scale efficiently and thrive long-term. Here's what we're looking at, cost-wise:Securing a retail space will require a deposit of first and last months' rent, and cost up to 7k, depending on the location. This journey hasn’t been without its struggles; the biggest one being finding a retail space. I'm close to finding the perfect thing, and I definitely won't give up until I can find the perfect CC Confectionery Creations HQ.Build-out costs will vary, depending on the space 40 120. This includes tiling the space so it's easy to clean, painting walls, building a beautiful counter, and working with an architect to make sure everything is up to code. This is the most variable cost right now, but I'm working toward locking that in soon.Equipment is estimated to cost around 30k. That will buy a couple commercial convection ovens, various sinks and a dishwasher, several mixers, tables, refrigeration, storage, and tools so that the people who work with me have what they need to do a bang-up job! I'll be buying some of these things used or scratch-n-dent to cut costs and be friendlier to mother nature. Installation costs are also a thing, and could cost up to 10k.Various licensing will cost up to 5k.Legal fees and unforeseen expenses happen, so I want to have a 20k buffer for that.Hiring and training folks is at top of mind since demand is so high! I simply can't keep up on my own. I'll need enough money for CC Confectionery Creations second and third employee's salaries for a few months. Lets just ballpark it at 30k for two folks and a very part-time dishwasher.Just FYI, I'm all in. I've made a lot of personal choices and have put my saving toward this, and it's happening come hell or high water.🔥Bakeries are expensive things to open, so your contributions will help me make this a reality!Check out the rewards to the right! I spent a bit of time coming up with stuff I think you’ll feel really good about. There are options for people in Burkburnett like classes and snacks, but since CC Confectionery Creations has ~*mr. worldwide*~ support, I am including apparel and cute DIY kits as well! xThroughout the next 30 days, I'll be posting ""flash rewards""–extras and goodies to incentivize people to contribute to the campaign. Think cute videos, personalized shoutouts on the CC Confectionery Creations FB, stickers, and FOOD! If we reach the goal, I'll consider adding a stretch goal, and MORE rewards. So yeah, the more, the merrier. Truly.A note on reward delivery dates: reward delivery dates are pretty far in the future for some tiers. Why? Well, I am a one-woman operation, so for things like food, I have to have ample time to produce them around pre-booked orders, administrative work, etc! For parties and classes, I am on the hunt for a retail space and am not sure when I'll be able to host a crowd just yet (and may have to do it in someone else's teaching kitchen!). I do thank you so much for your patience and understanding on this stuff! 💞So.. it’s with an anxious and fluttering heart that I present to you this Kickstarter benefiting CC Confectionery Creations, a mother-daughter-powered gluten free bakery based in Burkburnett, Texas. Doing this feels terrifying, like sending your kids off to school–God, you’re so excited, and yet, you’re not sure if they’re ready, even as they’re whining at you to let go.And that’s where we’re at. We are ready to fly.","The biggest risk is not finding a space. I have potential investors, my own cash, and tons of ideas–but its been very difficult to seal the deal. I'm making some moves to strengthen my credibility and have recruited great help. The perfect space is on the horizon!The biggest obstacle right now is not being able to keep up with demand because of my tiny kitchen and physical limitations of my body, needing adequate sleep, etc. Getting a retail space would enable me to find a fabulous little crew and plenty of ovens and storage so we never have to say no to another order. 💞",https://www.kickstarter.com/projects/ccconfectionerycreat/cc-confectionery-creations?ref=discovery_category_newest,ccconfectionerycreat/cc-confectionery-creations,"So here is the scoop we would like to add a coffee shop to our bakery selection.

Why? Because for us it is one of the most exciting coffee cultures around where diversity, enjoying and taking time are the center of this unique way, consuming our most favorite beverage.To ensure a high quality coffee experience like no other, we are working with local Farmers in the Highlands of Vietnam. We established relationships with coffee farmers and their families, not only to have consistently excellent coffee for you, but also to ensure increasing income and increasing improvements of the local living standards. All our raw materials are direct farm traded to offer a unique coffee experience.My name is Dietmar and I am the owner of Farmers BlendCoffee. 8 years ago I came to Vietnam due to a job offer in my previousprofession, the hospitality industry. Having very little free time back than(and I still don’t have J) I went regularly to the highlands of Vietnam which was only a short and adventuresmotorbike ride away. Coming to the Highlands, you will see coffee farms as faras you eye can see, it is a really impressive sight which is difficult toexplain, the smell, the people and the shirr beauty of the natural surroundings.Over time the coffee bug bite me and Igot more and more interested, I learned more about coffee farming thru the helpof local farmers, the roasting process and the culture. In November 2014 I took the plunge andofficially created Farmers Blend Coffee Ltd. with the mission to introduce thisexciting culture to the world. And here we are….SEPTEMBER 2015 – voted under the TOP 10 Startups in VietnamJANUARY 2016 – first Export Shipment to Amazon in the USNOVEMBER 2016 - entering an agreement with Amazon ExclusiveFEBRUARY 2017 – signed contract with a German DistributorVietnam is currently the World’s 2nd largestcoffee producer aiming for 26 Mio, 60kg bags of green coffee, all exportedaround the world. The French introduced coffee in the 1870s and it continuouslygrew to one of the most profitable industries in Vietnam. Obviously, like inany coffee producing country there is a special way of enjoying the “black gold”.When the French introduced coffee to Vietnam, milk was avery precious good and hard to get by the general population. Since Vietnameseare very inventive, sweetened condense milk was a common substitute for milk. Notonly because it had a much longer shelf life, but also the sweetness of themilk perfectly balanced out the bitterness of the Robusta Coffee. Depending onthe Region you live in Vietnam, people drink it either as ice coffee (Ca PheSua Da) where as in the North it is most commonly enjoyed hot. Anotherdifference is that Vietnamese use a so-called Phin to extract or brew thecoffee. This contraption consist of 3 sometimes 4 parts, a chamber, a tamperand a lid. It’s made for single serve coffee as well as large quantities (theyare available in various sizes). They key difference is that first, Vietnameselove strong coffee, so an average of 20g coffee grounds per serving is used ona small amount of water. Once you start the brewing process, you can lean backand enjoy live. The brewing can take up to a few minutes per cup, the waterextracts all aromas and flavors of the coffee, slowly dripping onto a bed of sweetenedcondense milk which in itself is already relaxing experience as it creates awonderful color contrast. Once you adice cubes, you will have a wonderful desert coffee, perfect for hot days.Vietnamese Coffee Culture is the complete opposite of ourwestern way of drinking coffee. It is more of a celebration and ceremony ratherthan a necessity. Please support our mission by pledging our campaign,spreading the word and share. Every little affords to bring this great coffeeculture to the people is very much appreciated. The kickstarter is setup with a goal of 14.000 Euro which wewould need to setup a company structure. We have already moved into a newroasting facility 1 month ago, now we are looking to extend our staff membersand distribution channels to become a truly amazing Vietnamese Coffee Company.Our slogan is “proudly made in Vietnam” and all ouringredients are made here. From the packaging, the design as well as our staffall is proudly coming from Vietnam. We would need the funds to be able tosupply the demands and to stock up on inventory and of course fulfill yourpledges. We are producing 230km outside of Ho Chi Minh City in a small town called Phan Thiet (also a nice tourist destination if you plan to visit).At the moment we can produce 2.500 kg per month and we employee 3 Vietnamese Staff, which are with us from almost the very beginning.Living in Vietnam, we overcame quite a few obstacles already and we continue to love this wonderful country and the people, with it's utmost fascinating coffee culture.

I am also the Founder of Farmers Blend Coffee, an Artisan Coffee Roaster located just outside of Ho Chi Minh City. I created Farmers Blend Coffee with a single mission; Introducing the fascinating Vietnamese Coffee Culture to the world. Why? Because it""s a unique combination of deliciously brewed, high quality coffee combined with the ability to enjoy quality time with the people you love and care about.We created Farmers Blend Coffee end of 2014 after researching Vietnamese Coffee and connected with local Farmers in the central Highlands the past 6 years. Our goal was to make something special, something we can be proud of. So we partnered with local coffee Farmers and arranged direct trade agreements. This not only enables a sustainable living for the farmers and their families, but also it ensures the highest quality coffee, straightfrom the farmers. We pay an above market price to minority farmers and educate them about coffee growing and processing - in return we get ""first hand"" deals for upcoming harvests to be able to selected the finest beans.Beginning of 2016 we started selling our delicious coffee thru amazon.com in the USA. This was a big and important step for us to gain the trust of our customers and increase awareness of Coffee from Vietnam. We have been voted Amazon's #1 Release in the Coffee Category.Running into some major issues with our past Logistic Partner beginning of 2017 we decided to put our Amazon Business on hold. We have not been able to pre-finance our green coffee beans, working expenses and the shipping / fulfillment costs which arise when working with amazon.com. The eCommerce platform makes payment to their 3rd party vendors only once the products are sold which would have created a negative cash flow for our small coffee company if we would have decided to continue this strategy. Kickstarter allow us to continue our mission without falling into the negative cash flow trap whereas we can ensure the immediate and risk free shipping of all our perks to coffee lovers around. We are fully setup and have new logistic as well as fulfillment partners in place to ensure a smooth and on-time delivery.Doing business out of Vietnam has it's challenges. Shipping & logistics are expensive for small volumes which makes it difficult for us to reach new customers. With the funds we raise through Kickstarter we are planning to setup a new eCommerce Infrastructure which will enable us to work with North American / European & Hong Kong based warehouse and fulfillments services. This will allow us to fulfill orders immediately as we receive them with local shipping rates and without long waiting times.What about freshness you might ask? To ensure the freshest coffee experience possible, we are only working with Airfreight Cargo. From the time we roast the coffee to the delivery into warehouse and fulfillment services it takes a maximum of 2 to 3 weeks. When the coffee arrives on your door, it will never be older than 4 to 5 weeks. Our package is designed for export purposes to keep long-lasting freshness without the loss of aroma and flavors. We are planning to consistently keep freshly roasted coffee in our fulfillment centers, meaning Inventory Management is key to ensure a high quality product arrives at your doorstep; over and over!Our Working Process:Step 1:Source quality green coffee from reliable and trusted coffee farmers with whom we have built a relationship over the past years.Step 2:Purchase high quality green coffee for a premium price to not only ensure a unique drinking experience but to create a sustainable living for local coffee farmers.Step 3:Hand sort green coffee beans to remove defects and unwanted foreign matter.Step 4:Slow roast the coffee beans with passion and knowledge to create an unforgettable coffee aroma with distinct tasting profiles.Step 5:Blend & package the coffee and get it ready for shipment.Step 6:To minimize shipping delays and the keep freshness while in transit, we only work with airfreight carriers. The time from roasting to your doorstep will never be longer than 4 to 6 weeks. (likely shorter)As our Perks are available ""worldwide"" and various counties have different postal services and postal rates we have decided to Flatrate share the shipping expenses.We will charge a flat 3 Euro shipping rate, regardless of the destination. Should the Campaign be ""over"" funded at one point, we will reimburse shipping costs to our backers.Higher Volume shipping, will result in lower logistic costs per unit and the 3 Euro extra are calculated with our funding goal of 3000 Euro. Should, at any point we exceed this goal, we will be in a position to renegotiate logistic fees with our partners and therefore would refund an appropriate amount to our backers.Use 15 to 20g of medium fine coffee ground and place them in the chamber of the coffee filter. Slightly compress with the included tamper.Pour a few ml water on top of the grounds and allow to coffee to ""bloom"" to be able to extract all coffee flavors during the process. Add 50 to 60ml ""just before boiling"" water and brew.Lean back and relax while the coffee is dripping slowly on top of the sweetened condensed milk, creating a wonderful color contrast.Add ice or drink it hot. Enjoy Responsibly....http://www.kickingitforward.org","As we are an established Roasting Company we have all equipment ready to go. We are immediately able to fulfill your Perks without any risk. Having exported to the EU and the US before, we know what challenges lay ahead and we are ready to tackle eventual obstacles.One of our concerns is, in case the campaign gains more momentum than expected, we might have to sent more than 1 shipment to our fulfillment partners which would result in a longer waiting period (max. 1 month)."

The ChoreoJoey Project is a response to the challenge of creating and presenting innovative, site specific work with dancers for all audiences. the 8 artists that make up the company, including it's founder and Choreographer Joey, have been dancing for over 20 years completing coursework and studies in dance, multimedia, and arts education. The company is based in New York City and performs in various community service and private events in Brooklyn and Manhattan. 'The Cordials' (working title) is a modern work by the choreoJoey Project that explores the basis of friendships, relationships, ideas and concepts that leads towards marriage aside from romanticism. It is the premiere evening work and first concert for the company, and we call on the support of all contributors (including you!) to get us through the rehearsals and production and ultimately onto the stage. The Cordials is set to premiere august 7th, 8th, and 9th 2015 in NYC. ","our biggest risks involves having the memorbilia available for the premiere night. the company is working non stop to create a high caliber performance, but it may happen that our souvenir glasses and dvd's will not be ready until September. please do not fret, the show will go on in august as planned. the production team will work relentlessly so contributors can receive their wonderful glasses and DVDs in september. all other mentioned memorbilia, digital programs, t-shirts, tickets, etc. will be available for pick at will call the day of the show.",https://www.kickstarter.com/projects/1362532332/tall-tales-an-evening-of-dance-with-choreojoey?ref=discovery_category_newest,1362532332/tall-tales-an-evening-of-dance-with-choreojoey,"The ChoreoJoey Project is in the process of creating a delightful evening of works based on revered Tall Tales and needs your help to complete it! The ChoreoJoey project started back in June 2014 as a challenge to create and present innovative, site specific dance with artists on any level. It often invokes the creative efforts of a rotating team of artists, musicians, and dance educators to display a high vector of integrated mixed media dance performance. The work developed through the ChoreoJoey Project explores various themes decided by its collaborators and contributors, directed by founder and choreographer Stephen Hill.Our theme for the production this year is called Tall Tales. It will be an evening of ballets showing the relativity of life proceeding folklore and its many experiences that follow. It was a theme created through the process of rediscovering what Tall Tales are to us as children and how the morals within these tales affect cultural learning experiences through the perspective of adults.Your contributions will assist in the production, turning our black box theater into a tropical rainforest set. Funding will aid in the creation and development of the choreography that will bring to life the fables of Aesop, The story of Anansi the Spider, two stories of Johnny Appleseed and Johnny the hammer with a twist, Verna Aardema’s tale of Why the Sky is So Far Away, and an original choreopoem written by Antonevia Ocho-Coultes.All the funding of the campaign goes directly to the production to assist with the cost of technical rehearsals, set and costume design, and the cost of the theater rental.  The major inspiration behind the theme of this year’s production was the playful/larger-than-life aspects of stories and how those aspects can be used to teach morals through illustrations. Our main aim is to allow the illustrations to come alive through movement by letting the dance retell the tale, transporting the audience to a place and time where anything is possible.","One of the main risks will be a change in the performance venue or a change in the performance dates and times. should this occur, any backers that have purchased tickets will be informed immediately. If they are not able to attend the rescheduled date or travel to a different venue, we will happily refund your tickets."

I, basically, took the advice I received in a letter from the Director of The San  Diego Civic Theaters (pertaining to ""Secrets in the Sand"").  As he writes, ""I can understand why you would want the unveiling of 'Secrets in the Sand' at our venue, but. . . I suggest that you begin with a small venue to give it time to nurture and develop""."
https://www.kickstarter.com/projects/teamsolutionz/level-to-the-ground?ref=discovery_category_newest,teamsolutionz/level-to-the-ground,"Over A year ago, I (Tobias P. Alexander) found myself listening to my teenage son (Cornelius J Alexander) age 13, who I raise as an single-father, telling me he wanted to create a web series  called“My Problem Came Found A Solution!”  In this web series it would reflect problems in everyday life for us, and solutions to our problems. Along the way, we both took notice to what problems are being produced in today's younger generation, In which is partly factored from negativity  in music and videos.   With that being said, it lead to my son, following up with his passion as being a Positive Music/Video Producer, Director, and Photographer, Targeting Kids Battling  Depression.

https://www.kickstarter.com/projects/43409686/sasquatch-os-revisited?ref=discovery_category_newest,43409686/sasquatch-os-revisited,"UPDATE: Preliminary build and live testing of the first prototype is complete, I tried uploading but the iso was too big so I had to optimize the size some, will try again in the morning.this OS will target x86 and x86_64 Desktops and laptops, I eventually will be including tablets when I aquire one to build on. Bear in mind what I upload is going to be a prototype meant to demonstrate some of what I have included feature wise, it does not look pretty and some things don't work, ie there are bugs. What'll set this apart mainly is the level of backend automation I intend to do, and the level of security I plan to build in. The target audience will be Windows gamers that are crossing over to Linux operating systems. I'm building this with gaming as a forethought. Also I'm branching this off of ubuntu 14.10 LTS, the software center doesn't work due to rebranding, I've included synaptic instead. I've slated the software center for removal in the next release, I'll also be including KDE Plasma as the primary UI. I'll also be adding more features throughout the release cycle. That download link will be available in a few hours :)https://sourceforge.net/projects/sasquatchgnulinux/files/it'll be uploaded in another 1 hour or so.Like I said it is not going to be pretty, and stuff doesn't work but I'm building it hot and am working within a time frame and with sub standard hardware. It is a prototype, a proof of concept, I haven't even released it to alpha yet. I had a much prettier prototype built but my machine didn't have enough resources to live test it (I will not release untested builds). I'll be replacing MATE with KDE Plasma in future releases. To the canonical guys, I do realize the wallpapers are still branded, I'm working on getting that removed. My goals for this project is to have a gaming oriented, fun and enjoyable OS that is 100% binary compatible with Debian/Ubuntu/Mint.Ok there was some concerns about the amount of money I was trying to raise in my other project, I'm going to vacate that to lower my goal.Bear in mind, this isn't an application, or an application suite, it is an operating system, developing those is a whole different creature.You don't just buy 1 new PC, you need atleast 2. you need one machine to code and script the OS, customize the desktop etc. well you're not going to burn that down everytime you want to test install and bug check your alpha builds, that makes a second ""Test bed"" machine necessary. also I'll be compiling my custom kernels from sources. just compiling the kernel takes a lot of computer power, compiling an OS, we're talking about a grand for the computer, you want a testbed capable of running such an OS, that means something atleast dual core, talking maybe $500.00. than you need to host and mirror it and purchase the URL and bandwidth. I'll go with the cheaper hosting options. this can either take 1 of 2 routes, first one being, I buy a used server and host it myself and convert to business internet. or I can pay a mirror host and hosting for the OS website. option 1 money wise, at the very least, $500.00. option 2, I could probably sneak by with $400.00. I drastically cut my goal, that removes any compensation for time invested or hardware upgrades as my OS evolves. after startup it becomes my personal expense. as for who's developing this? I'm not using kickstarter to gain startup capitol for a corporation, I'll be doing this all myself, as more a pet project. the OS will be made freely available (Funding model is donations). as for changes, I'm shooting for full automation here, an OS that is friendly to Windows users. I plan to script WINE in such a way that it runs in the background. There's a couple tricks that can accomplish this. basically when you run a windows program, you'd double click and it launches and behaves like it does in windows. I'll have to go with lower powered off the shelf computers, as opposed to the development and test machines I was planning on buying.I'll also forgoe some expense by making it digital download only as opposed to hard media, that removes manufacturing costs associated with hiring someone to make the install DVDs.There will be other added features that make this an easy to use OS for everyone, even small children.ok the rundown, these prices are approximate.what I have budgeted for computers,1 development computer. counting whatever hardware upgrades are needed. $1,000.00 (it'll be an off the shelf computer that has the resources for big jobs)2. one computer for test installing and testing the OS builds. working out major bugs. I'll go high and say $500.00 (This machine doesn't need to be as powerful as the first, a laptop could even suffice for this).3. Hosting, mirroring install/live images, and hosting the website. I'll say $500.00 (The hosting isn't that bad, the kicker here is bandwidth)I'm downgrading hardware choices from my original goal, it won't affect much other than it will slow my build cycle some. I'm not using this to start a business, I'm using this to buy hardware to pursue a pet project, a creative venture.again this is an operating system, in those you can't wipe out your work by using your dev machine as a test machine, and this being GPL software, I have to preserve my source code and make it available as per the GPL. reason 2 for a test machine, is checking for installation bugs. God forbid it work fine on YOUR machine but the installer breaks if someone tries downloading and installing it. I want all them major bugs worked out before people start downloading this thing. If there's enough left over, I'll target the raspberry pi platform as well.I'm abandoning the 10k fundraiser due to backer concerns, and opting for a lower goal. If there's 2 things I want to do here, that's build a great OS and make my backers happy. :)100% of this will be spent as stated and none used on me.",This is going to happen if the goal is met. worst that happens is I fail to meet my goal and this gets shelved for awhile.  using downspec'd hardware slows down my build cycle but doesn't keep it from happening.,https://www.kickstarter.com/projects/43409686/sasquatchos-101?ref=discovery_category_newest,43409686/sasquatchos-101,"Sasquatch OS will be a general use operating system, with an emphasis on cross platform apps (Like games and windows/mac applications). unlike more traditional Linux versions, this OS will put an emphasis on GUI interaction and less on command line interaction (Friendly for novice users).This OS is geared toward home PC users, though it is flexible enough to work as a file server and workstation OS. Being downstream from Ubuntu means it has a wide array of available software in the software center and will run most softwares available on the internet. This OS is untested on mobile devices, though it might work on those too.I'm currently working on build prototype 2. after that I'll be launching the alpha builds (Series 2.xx).As the build process progresses, more emphasis will be placed on scripting and automation of things like installing windows and mac software. As it sits right now, it can run most windows games.",The risks are the same that exist with any software.

https://www.kickstarter.com/projects/1351542028/manson-solanas?ref=discovery_category_newest,1351542028/manson-solanas,"AimThe aimof the project is to create an album that combines art and music with theintensity of insanity and political discourse, from sexism to revolutionarythought; an ejaculation of the sublime and surreal. The final outcome of theproject is an album that can be considered for some the worst album ever made; analbum so odd and pointless it will snugly fit into modern life. It is from sucha point that the developing and interesting aspect of the project comes frombut also its title Manson Solanas, from Charles Manson and Valerie Solanas. Usingthese people as a starting point for the exploration, I am attempting to createa work that will captured the imagined occurrences of these two people meeting andcreating works of music together. So why Manson and Solanas, they are peoplewho are seen and exemplified by many to embody the problems that people who donot follow a constructed periodical norm will induce. Referring to theirreactionary situation that ended with violence, and in Mansons case extreme violence.Mansons cult of followers whose killing spree is well documented, alongsideSolanas whose attack on Andy Warhole and written S.C.U.M manifesto. Theabsurdity of the collaborative aspect of these two working together as acohesive body is worth attempting to capture however since the interaction isfictional and only in my mind the capturing is not based on any real researchbut rather an exploration of continual creation. We should thereforecollectively agree that the project has an interesting dimension andexplorative subject matter. Why Manson and Solanas So why Manson and Solanas, they are people who are seen and exemplified by many to embody the problems that people who do not follow a constructed periodical norm will induce. Referring to their reactionary situation that ended with violence, and in Mansons case extreme violence. Mansons cult of followers whose killing spree is well documented, alongside Solanas whose attack on Andy Warhole and written S.C.U.M manifesto.By using these people I am emphasising your and ours loneliness and confusion. It is not a celebration of their lives and action but a celebration of our joint adventure towering and conquering these people, evil and your/our turmoil in modern society. We want to welcome our new experience with grace and joy.Breakdown of project My aim is to spend an entire year working fully on the project documenting everything as much as possible. During this time music will be created and recorded, performance will be documented gathering all the material into one gigantic product, where everything is displayed and laid bare for the audience and thus few who invested into the project. For this process to function as sufficient as possible my aim is to break the year down into four nicely paced sections. 1, Development: during this period songs will be developed, ideas pursued and equipment gathered. 2, Exploration: During this stage I will begin the process of recording, visual and sounds. 3, Formulation: At this stage the aim will be to complete and fine tune the work, so editing and fine tuning of tracks and recorded video material into one cohesive work. 4, Completion: The exportation and shipping of the final works followed by the release of downloadable files, finalising with an exhibition of the created work. Tracking the project To keep a continuing up to date of the progress of the project and advancement a blog and YouTube channel will be created so that my project can be tracked and enjoyed through the year, more importantly so that criticism can be made and explored throughout the project. FoundsTo achieve my goal the project needs a fair bit of founding to gather equipment for the production and making of the music as well as the documentation of the events that will occur through its process. Since this project is part performance, part musical creation there will be a need to document both the sound and the visuals using decent equipment. No half measures shall ever be accepted when it comes to quality. Most cost will cover equipment since this is a project starting from scratch. What I hope to achieve and final outcomeI amhoping to achieve a very different experience in the exploration between artand music but also attempt and demonstrate the possibility to explore sound andvisual aesthetic. For an artist whose predominant form of expression stayswithin the realm of painting. A work that for many will be so bad that it is worthjust owning it for that reason alone. The completion of the project willhopefully end with the music created hopefully fill a Blu-ray. ","There is a risk of death. Not really, but there are going to be challenges and strains since the project will encompass and force me to spend every waking moment or a very large part of my life to working on the project. Apart from finical strains and things like that I think the major challenge will come from a day to day interaction with creation new and interesting sounds and visuals.

The exhibition was sponsored by AutoDesk, Nikon, Ultimaker, 3d Filaprint and MyMiniFactoryand was seen by an estimated 5 million passengers.The extraordinary metamorphosis from photo to bronze used by this process fuses dreams into reality - this is a story where words turn into images and images into bronze. The focus of the project was to try and capture the immersive power of children's books as a physical expression, a tiny glimpse into a child's world expressed in bronze.'Wake up, Alice dear!' said her sister; 'Why, what a long sleep you've had!'The inspiration behind this artwork is of course the wonderful book ‘Alice in Wonderland’ written by Lewis Carroll. Using ‘captured reality’ techniques the artwork looks to transfer some of that magic into a new dimension -  brought to life by 3D printing. The artwork shows Alice about to wake from her dream of ‘Wonderland’ - the time obsessed rabbit frozen in time for one instant will vanish as her eyes open - and then in that fleeting moment between sleep and the conscious  world  she recaptures him in her imagination and shares the story with her sister.""She pictured to herself how this same little sister of hers would, in the after-time, be herself a grown woman; and how she would keep, through all her riper years, the simple and loving heart of her childhood: and how she would gather about her other little children, and make their eyes bright and eager with many a strange tale, perhaps even with the dream of Wonderland of long ago: and how she would feel with all their simple sorrows, and find a pleasure in all their simple joys, remembering her own child-life, and the happy summer days."" (Alice in Wonderland)As shown in the image below the bookend is made up by combining many 3D elements together, all sourced from around 600+ 2D images which were then processed in 3D software to create a 3D mesh made up from millions of polygons (tiny triangles). This mesh was then manipulated and a full size 3D printed model was made. The whole process of creating the models from concept to final print was time consuming and an intense learning curve, taking around six weeks each to finalise.I started the capture process with the figure of 'Alice' which meant taking lots of photos from different angles as shown in the animation below:My 7-year-old daughter kindly volunteered to model for this - a process which involved taking up to 150 images with a Nikon D5 high speed camera in just 10 seconds to capture her from all the required angles: (Charlie and Lola are just here to help isolate the subject from the background!)The result of this process was the 3D printed PLA (bio degradable plastic) form shown below which would be incorporated with the other elements like a 3D collage.Below the final 3D PLA prints of the bookends. These took three days each to print each using an Ultimaker 3D printer.The second bookend is called ‘Reading Peter Pan’ and looks to capture the young reader totally immersed in another world of pictures and words. The work flow as in ‘Alice’ starts with the key figure and again stars my daughter Ellie. This is blend of 3D ‘captures’ of trees, grass and includes some details from Sir George Frampton’s 1912 ‘Peter Pan’ - all the images were sourced from Kensington Gardens in London. A mixture of Bas Relief and full 3D capture, the artwork is inspired by J.M Barrie’s classic novel ‘Peter Pan’ and seeks to hold in place that complete absorption as this magical tale draws the reader into another world.Peter Pan PLA model (front view)Below: Artist impression of the bronze bookends, unique in both design and appearance. This will be the project's finished product.The last step in the process involves making a wax mould of the 3D PLA print to create a cast in bronze. This is done in a specialised foundry and sample casts are first made to ensurethe quality of the final production.The finished bronze bookends will measure  13.5x1.5x10.5 cm.Details of all the rewards can be found in the right hand column.Cold cast aluminium photogrammetry bas relief of Alice offered for contributions of £150. see photo below.The greetings card and posters referred to in rewards 2-6 are shown in the two images below, 'Peter Pan in the Snow' and the 'London Thames View from Victoria Tower'.The project funding will initially go into casting 50 pairs of bookends starting with Alice in Wonderland and Peter Pan.We hope to use any additional funds to create further bookends including ideas inspired by ‘The Railway Children’ and ‘The Wind in the Willows’. We will keep everyone update as new designs emerge!

The money raised from this project will as set out above go towards the casting of the book ends in bronze. We have taken great care to ensure that this is a viable task and have made tests using a cold cast technique, with excellent results, which indicates we will have an amazing end product. There will clearly have to be new tests made in actual bronze which may delay the project slightly as we will only go ahead when 100% happy, but this should not amount to any significant period of time.",https://www.kickstarter.com/projects/reich1976/one-hour?ref=discovery_category_newest,reich1976/one-hour,"One HourA Totally Thames London Bridge project, September 2019.Introduction - a holistic narrativeAfter just a few moments standing by the river bank you become aware that its fascination lies in that it is never the same from one moment to the next - the idea of capturing it all with a camera in just a fraction of a second seems like an impossible task. This project looks to extend this time line by capturing the content of the image over a period of one hour using time based techniques* to create an image that tells a far more detailed story.Expo conceptWith London Bridge / Shard at its centre the project looks to cover a 2Km stretch of the Thames from Tower Bridge to Blackfriars with a series of just two huge panoramic images taken from each side of the river. The focus of the project is too look at this local area and create a time based portrait that captures the vibe and activity that makes this dynamic region so exciting.Work and play- one hour on the riverUsing time based techniques the two images will look to reflect the amount and variety of river traffic that flows past them by including all the passenger and recreational vessels as well as the freight tugs and other commercial craft that go past in one hour. Designed to give the viewer a real sense of the vitality and pace on this busy stretch of the Thames this project offers a comprehensive visual narrative of the extraordinary diversity of vessels that go past this stretch of river.Working riverLooking to tell a story that goes beyond the pleasure boats on the river this project also aims to celebrate the ever increasing use of its waters to deliver goods and other materials up and down the river in an environmentally friendly and efficient way.Exhibition partnersThe project is currently supported by the Totally Thames Festival, Team London Bridge and Network Rail.Team London Bridge “Working with our partners and 400+ business members, our vision is to: ensure London Bridge excels as a leading place for global commerce and continues to develop as a pioneering local centre for enterprise, culture and entertainment” - Team LondonBridgeTotally Thames Festival The 'Totally Thames’ Festival is a key London event - as London Mayor Sadiq Khan put it “An incredible celebration, and with something for everyone, it will give all Londoners the opportunity to explore the terrific Thames”Network RailAt the heart of your community, we’re committed to being a caring neighbour, keeping our communities informed and engaging them in our plan to improve Britain's railwayBenefits for project partnersExhibition duration and visibilityThe exhibition will run as part of the Totally Thames festival throughout the whole of September 2019.

It is our dream to not only to make the gallery a sustainable business but to create a real cultural asset for the town. We run of a shoe-string budget, but have big ideas and great ambition. I love the work of British sculpture, Leigh Dyer and want to show his work in our gallery. Leigh is very excited to show with us, but we have a shortfall of $4000 in the budget for the commission of the work and for the shipping from the UK.The show will consist of an installation, which creates an old study full of antiques, specimens and trophies being taken over by mischievous monkeys. In one corner, two of the instigators of trouble play chess as their cohorts wreck havoc amongst the room’s treasures. Everything in this room is meticulously made from metal.If we can raise this funding we will be able to proceed with the commission. I will go over to pack the work in March, so it can come by surface in the most cost effective way. The show will be in September 2014.","If we can confirm the commission Leigh will begin the creation of the work, which has already been conceived and planned. He will work to deadline of early March to complete the work. He will work on the main pieces and reward pieces first, so that if time does run out we can amend the number of works that will make up the show. Currently the commission is intended to include 20 individual works. The installation will work better the busier it is, but can work with less.The deadline has been set to accommodate delays in shipping or through customs.We are approaching this as a commission in order to both ensure the artist is paid for his work, and to alleviate the need for the costly return shipping.",https://www.kickstarter.com/projects/1484623194/creating-monkey-business?ref=discovery_category_newest,1484623194/creating-monkey-business,"I own a small but ambitious gallery in Boise, Idaho, and have commissioned the British sculptor, Leigh Dyer to create a new body of work, which will be his exhibiting debut in the US.Leigh is working hard, but in order for the commission to be completed in full, as the artist envisions, we still need to raise some funds. The vision is to create a body of works, which will hang together as an installation, depicting an abandoned study, filled with antiques, trophies and specimens, as it overtaken by mischievous monkeys. In one corner, two of the instigators of trouble play chess as their cohorts wreck havoc amongst the room’s treasures. Everything in this room is meticulously made from metal.","Leigh is already working hard creating work for this project, and we will host an exhibition of his work, come what may. However the installation will need to be adapted and may not fully represent the artists intent if we do not achieve this funding. We would also need to divert funding from our print and marketing budget, in order to fund the amended commission. We hope you will share our enthusiasm in helping this artist create his vision in full, and make his first exhibition in the US a success."

This is the deal though I am on a fixed income and I need to get this to a level that is beyond what I am known for doing as the deadline is 180 pages with the body of the book as I am publishing this with CreateSpace.com. (The band you';re hearing in the video is from Got-djent.comas this is under fair use I am doing the opening sequence.)This will compliment Issue Five and Issue 10 of my magazine and the anthology I am working on where it's got a LCCN and ISBN for one the one deal. The thing with this anthology is I will be drawing the cover myself. I am going to give you more than one way to help with this project as I will offer up a submittable page hosted on Lake Fossil Press for story submissions; where the word count is 2000-10,000 (ideal for a 180 page anthology is get a lot that are 3400-6800 words. Tabetha hasn't edited anything over 140 pages -- and her projects are the size of Legend Keeper, Cyber:Terror:Machine, or Norwood's Discovery; then in 2010 I penned a novella called When Angels Wept Blood. Over the years I produced some monsters in terms of page count on my own -- when doing anthologies, I didn't cheat readers when I produced a $15.00 anthology that's 300 pages. I usually break even sometimes.) If you want to see an example of what I edited see this one too as I have a few back in print. I have the submittable locked in as this is the direct link.  I have anthology almost ready to go and waiting on six more submissions with the other then who I call the intro guy or gal with the project. This is the fifth introduction I am handling as I might encourage someone to have me anonymously introduce an anthologyI am looking for short stories to be heavier than Elephant tits and that's Kerry King's wording for Gemini. I have seen a cool medium with my own work -- Tabetha's roster never seen a hand drawn cover. I will be drawing the front and back covers then turning them into a negative using Faststone.organd Nuance Paperport 12. I just released Collectives In A Forsaken Metascape which is a way for me to reissue The Fandom Writer II and Media Darling plus new material written entirely in 2014 and 2015 plus two which were thought were lost from 2007 and 2004.This is how fast can I get the funding as I am a one man show with Lake Fossil Press. Aspects of this I am looking to also market the other two anthologies I am overseeing (get them in schools and what not as the one anthology has a LCCN for it. Forbes in 2013 spoke of the anthology rise and CreateSpace.combecame home of them and do compete with Lulu.comon this level. This is one of my examples.)I have a prepaid debit card this is going to go on so I can get my art supplies and what not as Tabetha agreed to hook me up with a leather bound sketchbook and drawing kit (as I work with pencil and graphite.) I am looking to upgrade my equipment so I can turn my laptop into one-computer publishing studio.  I had a deal where I lost all my accounts and publishing license with Lulu.com over Legend Keeper last year and working on my ensemble project.   Sinister Souls will be reinvented to a grittier in your face anthology akin to what I do with Lake Fossil Press;  this will be under my moniker Lake Fossil Press.“Wait you’re begging online,”  no I am not when you realize Veronica Freeman ran a hell of a campaign to fund her solo release and Tourniquet’s Ted Kirkpatrick funded the last release and his solo release this way.  This will allow me to really push the levels of my design arsenal and the most advanced anthology I am doing where I am drawing the covers for this.  How you can help? Submit fiction,  fund this or help me track down a fund for widows to murder victims because the widow. I am looking to help raise funds from proceeds is the cab driver my classmate William Porras who is in Pontiac had killed this one for $51.I had survived a murder attempt when I was 22 years old as I will be re-issuing Dirty Black Winter on CreateSpace.com but I am going to oversee and help co-edit this anthology.  I have seen what Christine Morgan had attempted to pull and it’s not even funny when you think about it.   My goal is to raise at least $4300.00 for the budget to promote all three anthologies that are ready -- one is close to done and the other is waiting for the introduction.   Everyone retains their original copyrights for this bad boy.My AuthorsDen.com account is also seeking sponsorship as I will offer this up on AuthorsDen.com as a signed edition on the store and will be planning to go on tour with the project.  Caustic (Matt) explains how he got funding from his albums from doing this.  I am tired of people paying for air for literature;  no e-books for this because how intricate I am going to do when I design the deal.  IT will either be on CreateSpace.com or LSI Spark as I have all the tools to work with ISBNS with LSI. Bowers an ISBN is $125.00 to work with LSI Spark and I want to produce a tradeback version and hardcover editions.This is Tabetha’s project but I am outlining the submission call and doing the up-front and in-your-face attitude with the details of this damn thing. I am handing the direction of the project so it will compliment mine because she never did something like this. I produced haymakers over the years -- I've written haymaker after haymaker. Backers will see first copies and as many as I can get in one sitting.   I have a submittable that I will be running solely but members of the alumni who Tabetha can trust will be connecting with me. She hasn't done anything like this to allow me to outline this project and will get Issue Five to study to capture that tone.  Some never did anything like this before as they are rookies to dark subject matter.    I will be hooking members up with shit from my catalog and do shopping sprees on CreateSpace.com for backers.The whole deal will be the anthology's goal is to get 180 pages as fast as possible; and how fast can you all help with this one as I will be doing to artwork myself and when the time is right I will show the artwork right here with all of you along the way . I had just released my fourth collection and seventh solo title as I have some of my catalog back online. Anyone who wants to submit but please honor Lake Fossil Press house rules of no erotic content. This will be the article about my classmate as this anthology is very raw and how I want to go about this. What will I have in mind is get this in colleges along with the mixed era project as a way to counter the damage Hovind and Comfort had done.  I don't want the masses paying for air and have a physical copy and when the anthology is done; backers will have a generous discount code to get the flesh n bloods. Backers will see the pdf copies when the writers will. I have to pay for my own copies too so keep that in mind as they are print on demands.The one of the said authors out there gave Tabetha so much crap and pulled what Gail Riplinger pulled -- cherry picking things and piece together these things to make her look bad. This author worked with iUniverse and hasn't been published since. She did what Stephen Glass did as the sources where she got them from a questionable. This author made iUniverse look bad because I had turned authors who got published from here into small press staples.I started in 2004 with Booksurge as I left CreateSpace a few years after learning they were BookSurge; I forgot my password for many years. I had brought a tool with me to work with CreateSpace.comshowing I am back full time I introduced my namesakes and bringing over my roster as some of them were part of the fold already. The three anthologies and new collection; just released along with Legend Keeper last year along with my testimony, Suburbanite's Confessional, and the new collection were showing new material. .CreateSpace.comyou see rivals using them without knowing the history of the place. I knew their history and using that to my advantage; ECR's saw what I brought to the table. I was trying to get my print readies so I can deconstruct them Issue Five is the most unique looking hands down and I want to use fonts that will make this book interesting.  My middle-into-high school girlfriend was published with Writer's Club Press.I employ Open Source tech to edit my anthologies (LibreOffice, AbiWord which takes WordPerfect attachments. AbiWord had been in play since 2008. I had used Open Office for ten of my eleven years as a publisher as Atlantis Ocean Mind was how I first did Tabloid Purposes. I am doing this anthology using Libre Office then I use http://www.pdfsam.orgto merge everything with CreateSpace)I bought this just before I was published as she's the second highest paid on roster because she was bullied by my rivals in the business. She wrote one novel and a few collections and basically called it a day after that.  Tabetha almost called it a day because of this one author. This one will be her comeback anthology as my second namesake anthology was my return after a few years -- the ensemble project for me is the first anthology of all original writers in the modern era since 2008 I am doing mixed era projects a lot often but some will look Rod Serling as an editor he also did this so I am in good company. Paul Taylor of justsixdays.comcalled me an angry young man which something Rod Serling is and my new collection I just released houses my angriest work as an author. This anthology will compliment what came out on CreateSpace.com-- More Stories From The Twilight Zone. I have to say welcome to CreateSpace.com-- I have a collection on the same vein as this.What I want to accomplish with SInister Souls is have a book where it will go together with Rod Serling's book on CreateSpace.com-- as I tested The Statue out on Rod Serling's widow as R. L. Stine contributed to The Twilight Zone anthology.Alice Cooper on Mp3's he was saying kids are are tired of paying for air; as writers might feel this way too with ebooks. I don't want my readers paying for air, This is the reason which is why I had no e-book policy with publishers as I didn't think it was fair that many judge my print work on my free reads. I want readers to get their money's worth for a 180-190 page project. My want my readers checking out my print exclusive material and I have plenty of that going around. The writers retain their original copyrights outright -- I don't do contracts but writers help me draw them up upon request. My anthologies often hit the higher 294-382 page range, where Tabloid Purposes: Book Five and More Frightening Than Fiction were the runts.I am a small press and always been one; I have problems with authors who prefer traditional publishers as I had learned how to be Lake Fossil Pess from April Derleth and Bob Gunner. But having all the tools to do an anthology that gives Dark Regions Press a run for their money. This will allow me to pay a higher editor's choice. In my hand is Issue Five as the matte finish as the trade paperback for this project will have this -- if you need help with what I am saying in your language.Run this through Bing.comTranslator as you can see this in your own language. I want to produce an English version and an Italian language version (this will be tricky because online translators don't always do faithful translations so this will help me fund getting the translator too locked in.)Literary frauds don't use kickstarter to help get things done as I funded two projects myself as they got out there. Seen the flesh and blood CDS in their hand. Bloodgood funded their most recent deal this way. Where I see Rod Serling's own daughter putting her dad's work back in circulation using CreateSpace -- they got validated. Dio's son works with them too. Ramsey Campbell doesn't know that alleged proclaimed traditional outfits like Dark Regions Press are using CreateSpace.com. I had planned to put the first namesake out there this way in 2010 but the tech didn't catch up with me.I was ahead of my time in 2002 -- I almost became a publisher in 2002 but my techniques where not in play yet. In 2005 I took this side of things with stride. Ten years ago I got the hang of publishing though I had primitive imaging tools (MS Paint then upgraded to TriScape under a tip by future pub mate on Naked Snake Press.)  I was guest cover designer and designed House of Spiders 3 myself.  I will do all the design work myself as I am overseeing a project which is on par to what Rod Serling edited.  All I need with that one is the Introduction as this stimulus will help me promote all three projects -- get the one in schools. I will do everything in house with the artwork as I did with my own titlesThe publication that is a prototype for this anthology is one of my own publications: The Ethereal Gazette: Issue Five is the existing prototype for this kind of publication. I had seen Brian Keene attempt to say ""I will offer you $500.00 to give up as a writer.""Not happening but anyway I will be drawing these covers when it is closer to done and you can start submitting right now as the deadline is when filled.  The interview reward is going to be quite revealing as I will finally talk about what I hate to bring up in an interview details about Porras because I thought he was talking bullshit as usual.","The risk and challenges with an anthology;  some writers will have an ego and they do forget their TOC mates at times.   The setbacks I had with the last publications I had was losing my Lulu.com over Legend Keeper;  this will be the first anthology I am doing the artwork for as I had seen the bullying over the years.   Some authors had been singled out in an anthology or had been bullied over the years.Print-on-Demands have a hard time getting carried in bookstores but this will have a ISBN where it will be completely customized and I am wanting to buy some custom bar code generators so I can give this project something it didn't have before with my own projects who has seen a ISBN barcode that's black and green or gray and slate blue.The huge thing with small press writers some will get what I call Instant Fame Syndrome;  sometimes authors have passed away as with Andrew Ian Dodge who was part of Tabloid Purposes One.  The project I am almost finished with -- the unique problem with anthologies is getting someone to handle the introduction.  This one I am handling the introduction for as well as drawing the cover art.  Tabetha had a problem with an artist who had no experience with other mediums.The huge problem in the small press is everyone is using ""Stock"" covers as this is very common as you seen Tabetha Jones encounter this as her then designer.  Well looked like she used stock;  I had been accused of this and made a mistake but followed up on the cover then switched this out the next day.   I rarely use stock as in I would take the photo myself or draw it sometimes you had seen piles of crumpled paper because I wasn't happy with the drawing. Didn't come out right.  Creative Commons was handy in doing Tabloid Purposes' rebooted edition.Other challenges are those who you are the same subculture as you who gives you a weird look when you speak about humanities (as in what you went to college for because of it.)   I had overcame these challenges with the tools I came with the tech factor; the risks are high as in you will have strained longtime friendships over this.",https://www.kickstarter.com/projects/pacione/lock-n-key-project?ref=discovery_category_newest,pacione/lock-n-key-project,"Since someone did some misconceptions on Sinister Souls and the publisher claimed I had raised the funding for her wedding no,  so this kickstarter I am doing and hopefully to God it gets on wheels.   I am going to tell some of you how close to ready this is without the funding and this is where the readers help fund how I promote this.    It’s 185 pages before the TOC, and front matter is combined into the mix -- it’s got the ISBN and I fronted the cash out of my own limited funds to do this;  I managed to get the LCCN for this as I am waiting on the rest of my ensemble together.  I started this one when I was bored and figure it was interesting how I could try to get something together with writers on Linkedin.com.  Well a few said,  “I am in.”  I managed to get almost everything the introduction lady needs to do her author photos to create a nuance but this will fund the photographer to help with her promotional photos.I have almost everything ready to go with this one and a lot of the time I spent was in the research on the stories I grabbed up from Project Gutenberg and researching the information I needed about getting the clearance to use a very famous painting.   This anthology will be published on CreateSpace.com as the LCCN had been locked in.   Well there are no misconceptions with Lock ‘n Key project as this is the codename for the anthology.   Getting the backing for this will prove interesting as I didn’t have a successful campaign with the last one;  well this well every single one of the living authors are psyche’d as I am about this one  I really don’t blame them either.I am going to have to go through other avenues to get the word out because FaceBook.com has me in blocked jail -- well this anthology will compliment Issue Five while all my solo work is back online and I just designed Aiden Jenson Presents:  The Gateway as this anthology has an attention to detail with how everything is done.    Well The Lock ‘N Key Project as the contributors will know it as the title;  the introduction author I am getting her ready to do this and to create a real nuance if you are from Chicago.  Read about what Blake Judd had done then you will know why I am working on this -- Blake Judd gave Chicago a lot of negative press;  as I am now located in the Joliet area.    The short stories are as diverse as the fifth issue where I am in there taking the role the surrealist writers done in Issue Five and Ten.  I am celebrating a 25 year career as a writer from my writing period and didn’t get a chance to celebrate my 10 year anniversary being published.  So this project I want to do something that really gives back to what heavy metal provided me -- being literate an having became a writer because of thrash metal.  ",How the drill with the risks as there is always going to be a troll factor;  and sometimes toc mates don't get along.    You also have rival publishers who manipulate authors into warning not to work with someone.   I could write book with this but I am not though those of you who will ask - what are the rewards;   everyone sees copies of books that are also in my collection or DVDS (legal copies) of what I have personally.  Sometimes an author does pass away but what I do want to do is send this along with a heavy metal band on the road too so they have something after the hotel parties or those who rarely drink;  or stay away from illicit substances all together.  This well this will have a unique buzz going already -- the risks well there are many;  the rewards are just as many as I am trying to counter what Blake Judd had done.   I am tired of seeing people paying for hot air.

Moreover, the challenge is to bring together the large number of people we need at the same time on the set, and finally the big part of post-production will be the biggest challenge for our reduced team. Nevertheless, we will do absolutely everything necessary to make this project come into existence and appeal to the greatest number.Les risques d'un tel projet sont tout d'abord qu'en tant qu'étudiants, nous devons nous concentrer sur nos études, même si le cinéma nous intéresse davantage.

I have recently made and sold several unique sculptures in the US and UK, and I am eager to pursue a more permanent career in art and design.How You Can HelpWith this preliminary campaign, I hope to raise funds to produce a limited edition of sculptural porcelain vases, entitled ‘Crouched Tube’. For some time I have been fascinated by the sculptural form, and find that the paint tube is a perfect and recognisable vessel to create a variety of designs. I also enjoy creating practical works of art, and whether you choose to have a ‘Crouched Tube’ on your desk holding a pen, a flower, or nothing at all, I like the idea that these tubes are personally decorative, and can add a little tactile whimsy to a cluttered desk or table.I have been carving the individual paint tubes by hand, and have been thrilled by some successful international sales. I am now looking to raise money for a wider production run. Based on an original mould, I am looking to produce a limited-edition run of porcelain vases by scanning and 3-D printing my original design. I have had a sample made and I am very happy with results (photos of which feature above!).My goal of £4,000 will help to fund the first production run of ‘Crouched Tube’, the purchase of an in-house 3D printer to create my own models, and further research for paint tube lines. My notebook is full of ideas for further tube-related sculptures and products, and I would love to see them realised!I look forward to sharing my first design “Crouched Tube’.RewardsHere are the rewards I am offering should you decide to make a Donation:£30.00 (Maximum 100)Signed Tube Drawing.

'Crouched Tube' is the first of a series of sculptures using the artists paint tube, soon to be followed by 'Reclining Tube' and 'Nude Tube'.The Funds raised through Kickstarter will assist in getting production started, not only for the 'Primary Edition' of 'Crouched Tube' but future original limited edition sculptures.I really believe in this project and feel the 'Crouched Tube' sculptures will be a welcome and fun edition to any Art Collectors collection.

Once the funds are reached and the design is finalized, we will create a new mold for production and send out the first models to our backers for all the support that was shown!","One of our biggest challenges is the unexpected future. Since this is our first Kickstarter campaign, there will probably be some unforeseen challenges ahead that we have not prepared for out of lack of experience. We hope that if we encounter any issues, we can solve the problem in an effective and efficient manner. We will work our hardest to satisfy and meet the needs of our backers!"

That song is me telling a story of a situation that I experienced from the perspective of the other man.These are the kinds of concepts I love to incorporate into my music as an artist. That was done on a very very low budget as you can see of only $300. My next single exemplifies empowerment. The title is called ""Never Touch a Black Man Radio,"" which is a quote from Rush Hour that was stated by Chris Tucker in the movie. That was one of my favorite parts of the movie. To me, I took that quote for more than face value. A lyric I have in the chorus says ""never touch a black man radio, and what I mean by that is that I see right past your b.s. trying to play me."" The song provides empowerment for all races, meaning that we cannot be ""played;"" much like a radio. Metaphorically, no one can just slide anything past us and take advantage of our comprehension skills.A very eye-opening experience that I was blessed enough to go through and still survive from opened my artistry to all of these different concepts. What I would like to do in the video to ""Never Touch a Black Man Radio,"" is have a legion of people of all races walk with me through the city of Los Angeles just creating a visual of unity and empowerment for the human race. I feel that a budget of about $15,000 should be good enough to achieve that vision. Here is the track so that you can listen to it. Listen to it more than once, analyze it, and applying it to your own experiences so that you can make your own inference and take what you can from the song that you will relate to in your own life and experience. It is a very wonderful song. Thank you so much.http://soundcloud.com/jet2/radio","The risks and challenges I feel I would face is just getting you to believe in the vision and spreading the word of this project to get funding. I plan on overcoming them by more importantly visualizing the end result and believing that I will get there, and that you will help me achieve it because you believe in the vision yourself. Thank you so much.

Jet 2 discovered his passion for music at an early age through playing drums with his father Jerri Jheto, and listening to several genres of music growing up. Ultimately, this passion led Jet 2 to become the drum technician for Akon where he continually learned from experiences out on tour. Jet 2 began his passion for lyricism at Dorsey High School in Los Angeles, and his overall theme in his music is uncanny truth and confidence in sticking to what you believe in.Jet 2 is influenced by Jay-Z’s uncanny accuracy and vivid lyricism. His words rhythmically tell a story through each syllable. Jet 2 is also heavily influenced by Ab-Soul’s belief that humans are not only human beings, but spiritual beings. Each song nudges the listener to dig deeper than the physical outlook of life and question what you hear. Jet 2 ties both of these artists’ strong points into his musical view and exercises his own influence of inspiration to each listener.I am looking to record an official music video to a new track I just recorded titled ""Crystalline Stone."" The track vibe is like a West Coast party! This is a track that I want to be heard by many, and in order to do so, I need to be able to film a video that will match the vibe of the track and be very entertaining. I'm looking forward to making this video the best music video I have had to date. With your help, I will do so. I appreciate you all for your support, and I hope that you can see my art and feel inspired from it as well.","The only challenge with this project is simply the budget. After this project is succesfully funded, we will have enough to have an excellent production crew work on the video to express the visual in the way that it is supposed to be seen for you!"

Though I have yet to produce my own movie, I have always had a keen eye for observation and evaluation. This movie will set a standard for all movies to forever come. The key to this movie is taking the subtle phenomenons we as humans all experience and exploiting these fears at a rational level. The movie will feel plausible, and will put the viewers into the perspective of the actors within the movie. My priority is to create a seemingly normal experience that everyone can relate to, with the constant build of fear and disorientation within the actors mind. The actors just as normal people will be in shock at what it is they believe is occurring to them. The movie will focus on the unconscious mind and the theory that humans interact with indescribable entities that cant be comprehended by the average person. The darkness is scary because of its unknown features, I hope to grab at this fear of the unknown and allow people to experience life in a way they may normally attempt to avoid, in total and complete fear.","A challenge that will be difficult to overcome will be the time restraint. In a mere two years time I would need to hire all of the crew required to create this production, and then actually create the film.

https://www.kickstarter.com/projects/973846783/entrepreneur-competition-website-hs?ref=discovery_category_newest,973846783/entrepreneur-competition-website-hs,"We are creating a website for high school entrepreneurs' to submit business plans to a panel of judges. We currently have an elite panel of judges that have entrepreneurial experience and are willing to be on the panel. Multiple teams will compete to win and receive both experience from these entrepreneurs and funding. We created a demo website, but we need funding to finish the entire website features. The goal of this campaign is to raise enough funds to be able to create the intensive website that will host all of the users and teams. The website will have the ability to do live video conferences between the individual teams and the panel of judges. And while these mock ""sharktank"" pitches occur you, yes you the reader will be able to view this presentation live on the website. This allows teams to ask questions and vice versa. We want to create an environment very similar to that of EO (Entrepreneur Organization) that helps students connect and work together towards a shared goal.Currently today in the United States an economic gap exists between social groups and education. Those that are predominantly from social groups I and II are able to receive better education either through geography or through private education. Whereas social groups III and IV receive lesser education currently. By creating this website we allow anyone with an internet connection the ability to connect with successful entrepreneurs and pitch their ideas. Predominantly in private institutions entrepreneurship is taught and well understood. Whereas in public schools and economically depressed areas, schools do not teach this vital skill. This website bridges the gap and provides an equal playing field for all people by providing education to young people of all backgrounds. We have three steps to achieve our goal of being able to provide an educational experience for all people to understand entrepreneurship and submit their business plans to our judges. Step #1. Receive enough funds to build the website by the beginning of the academic year, August 30, 2017. Step#2. Have a panel of successful judges determined and ready to participate. The good news is that we already have completed this step! -CompletedStep#3. Have users and teams join the website. Teams will be able to delegate work and also create a business plan with google docs, and then submit it to the competition and they will receive help from an entrepreneur. The panel will then select two winners one for each semester and the panel will fully devote its time to helping these teams. We want people to succeed as we have and we want to educate the disadvantaged that have been forgotten in our current society. Now, by helping this cause you are not only helping create a website but you are creating an organization that will help students from all walks of life around the US that want to express their ideas and work  towards  their dreams. The project is not only about the students, but it helps create hope in school districts that are economically stricken. By helping now, you help students, teachers, parents, and most importantly you help balance our country’s unequal education system.If you look at the attached .pdf document you are able to see the exact quote from one of the multiple website developers we have contacted. They have agreed to reduce the amount substantially because of the good cause.  Link to PDF Here you will see multiple sections that are broken out among the different phases of development.The phase one is the UX/UI design which in layman terms is the look of the website and how users interact with it. Phase two would include the development for the portal where users would login and create free accounts. This is where predominantly a lot of proceeds would be directed. The development team has to create the following tools:      chat capabilities, user roles (e.g. leader, cfo, cio, etc for each individual team) submission tools, a panel of all of the teams, a panel to search for users, the ability to join a team, the ability to update a team's rss feed, the ability to incorporate social media, the ability to provide and upload documents for the business plan submission, the ability to integrate google services like google docs, google PowerPoints, the ability to create a tab for educational videos and webinars, web hosting on amazon, domain fees, mailing fees, and the ability for users to create their own website, a set area of the website for winners, and an area for CEOs and entrepreneurs to give live interactive presentations with all members.Phase three is beta testing, this will discover bugs and fix them. It should only take a week or so, but after that point the team will create alpha release. Phase four is the alpha release. This will allow people to create user and team accounts. Each team account has multiple users that are part of it. Then a team will be able to work on their business plan and communicate with all of our tools and win the competition. We will also create a page dedicated to every team that signs up. During this time we will also be asking users about what they like and if they want us to add more features to the website.Phase five will be adding whatever users want on the website. So if you think we should have a section of the website for x,y,z we will add it just for you! Well, first off, this concept is not new. That's surprising, right? Well, a lot of companies similar to us have thought of ways to generate money from students who are interested in entrepreneurial studies. We are the first that provides a 100% free user experience. Most of these companies offer schools an ""exclusive entrepreneur program"" for the cost of only $500 dollars per student! Well how is a student supposed to pay that?  The answer is simple, they do not and as a result they are not able to be in the class. And the students who can afford it come from that top 1% of society that gets better education and opportunities. We say NO to inequalities in education. By being 100% free we are able to give everyone the same chance of winning instead of those in the 1% that can afford that entry cost. We not only have a competition but rather a network. Other programs charge a lot for a class, but its only for one semester. Once you join for free, you can be part of the program forever! We upload our videos to the website so everyone can view the tips and learn more about entrepreneurial skills and business. We bring in multiple mentors as well to further your learning. And we have dedicated the platform to be user friendly so you can chat with friends and work actively together. You can also share your screen so others can see what you’re working on! With our task manager, you can also work together and set tasks for your team to complete. With the ability to invite others to join your team, we make sure you are always able to communicate freely with anyone. Every team can create it's own social media account to attract followers to support your business plan! The social media integrates flawlessly into the website.  We created a special feature so all you have to do is simply type one message and click ""send"" once and it will post it on all of your social media accounts like FB, Twitter, Instagram, Pinterest etc! That's easier than having to login to each account and update them! It's not only for students even adults can get involved. Unlike other programs, adults can volunteer their time and mentor a team. We encourage adults that have backgrounds in small business or have any type of executive or marketing backgrounds, even lawyers are crucial! Every business has many adults all from different jobs helping. A company needs lawyers, developers, engineers, marketing teams, venture capitalist, sales, tech support, and of course a leadership team. We want to educate you and help you write a business plan. And after you win, we will be there without team to help your team succeed! The panel has been selected and is excited to start once we get the website up and going. We have people from retail, current and former entrepreneurs, CEOs and of course we have media gurus as well! Remember we are here to help you. If you need help with a business plan just contact us. We have a live chat in the website and you can simply click it and we will help. If you need help with marketing your idea, we have dedicated people. If you need help with the legality of the idea we have a legal team! We are here for you, our primary goal is YOU. Have an entrepreneur club or FBLA team already, well create the same team on our website and represent your school. We help students with their pitches and their business plans. You can also enter our competition to increase your chances of winning. And to be honest some parts of FBLA are old, and do not cover entrepreneurship that well. We do, because of our dedicated tools and education videos and interactive programs. When was the last time FBLA gave you the ability to talk to an entrepreneur that has at least made $10 million dollars? Hmm, I honestly cannot recall. This is your CHANCE to become successful don't miss it!Students who show interest in a certain topic like entrepreneurship are favored by collages. College admissions are also impressed when you can say you created a successful business that provides jobs for your friends and the community. You can use the experiences you learn here in collage to fully create your master piece. One of our judges created seven companies before he hit gold. And gold in this sense is the 40-million-dollar company he created. He never got discouraged from his failures, rather he learned from these experiences and continued to pursue his passion, as should you! What is the downside of supporting us? We will even give t-shirts to people who donate to our KickStarter! Help create an experience that your children will be able to use and help make education equal for all. Just like Kahn Academy it’s important to make education free for all especially in entrepreneurship. Join, help, support, and forward this to your friends, cousins, relatives, and even if you have a dollar to donate it will help us get closer.  Thank you for all of your time and love! Sincerely, Entrepreneur Team Organization $1 = Free Account $30 = Mug $60 = Shirt $75 = Iphone 7 Case $100 = Computer Case $300 = Everything! (Note-all have our custom logo). Also for all users, once alpha is released everyone gets a free user account!","Risks and Challenges: Well first off we have been planning this for over 4 months now, and we have been able to mitigate a substantial amount of risk. There is only three areas of risk. 1. Panel of Judges2. Website3. Users#1 is not a risk anymore because we have already met with and established the panel. We also have back up judges if some are sick. #2 is not a risk anymore because we have met with 15 developer companies and have locked in the pricing with two. We have picked the cheapest option, but if they can not do it for some reason, we still have the back up company. #3 is a possible risk. We are about to start the initiative campaign that engages users to join the mailing list so they will be alerted once Alpha is released. We have already 20 teams comprising of approximately 200+ students. We are hoping to use this as a base and grow it exponentially around the US. Especially in metropolitan cities, which is our target market.",https://www.kickstarter.com/projects/973846783/entrepreneur-website-hs-and-competition-atlanta-ec?ref=discovery_category_newest,973846783/entrepreneur-website-hs-and-competition-atlanta-ec,"We are creating a website for high school entrepreneurs' to submit business plans to a panel of judges. We currently have an elite panel of judges that have entrepreneurial experience and are willing to be on the panel. Multiple teams will compete to win and receive both experience from these entrepreneurs and funding. We created a demo website, but we need funding to finish the entire website features.The goal of this campaign is to raise enough funds to be able to create the intensive website that will host all of the users and teams. The website will have the ability to do live video conferences between the individual teams and the panel of judges. And while these mock ""sharktank"" pitches occur you, yes you the reader will be able to view this presentation live on the website. This allows teams to ask questions and vice versa. We want to create an environment very similar to that of EO (Entrepreneur Organization) that helps students connect and work together towards a shared goal. Currently today in the United States an economic gap exists between social groups and education. Those that are predominantly from social groups I and II are able to receive better education either through geography or through private education. Whereas social groups III and IV receive lesser education currently. By creating this website we allow anyone with an internet connection the ability to connect with successful entrepreneurs and pitch their ideas. Predominantly in private institutions entrepreneurship is taught and well understood. Whereas in public schools and economically depressed areas, schools do not teach this vital skill. This website bridges the gap and provides an equal playing field for all people by providing education to young people of all backgrounds.We have three steps to achieve our goal of being able to provide an educational experience for all people to understand entrepreneurship and submit their business plans to our judges.  Step #1. Receive enough funds to build the website by the beginning of the academic year, August 30, 2017.  Step#2. Have a panel of successful judges determined and ready to participate. The good news is that we already have completed this step! -Completed  Step#3. Have users and teams join the website. Teams will be able to delegate work and also create a business plan with google docs, and then submit it to the competition and they will receive help from an entrepreneur. The panel will then select two winners one for each semester and the panel will fully devote its time to helping these teams. We want people to succeed as we have and we want to educate the disadvantaged that have been forgotten in our current society.Now, by helping this cause you are not only helping create a website but you are creating an organization that will help students from all walks of life around the US that want to express their ideas and work towards their dreams. The project is not only about the students, but it helps create hope in school districts that are economically stricken. By helping now, you help students, teachers, parents, and most importantly you help balance our country’s unequal education system.If you look at the attached .pdf document you are able to see the exact quote from one of the multiple website developers we have contacted. They have agreed to reduce the amount substantially because of the good cause. We have listed everything on the pdf that will be in our alpha release & beta.   Link to PDFHere you will see multiple sections that are broken out among the different phases of development. The phase one is the UX/UI design which in layman terms is the look of the website and how users interact with it.Phase two would include the development for the portal where users would login and create free accounts. This is where predominantly a lot of proceeds would be directed. The development team has to create the following tools: Chat capabilities, user roles (e.g. leader, cfo, cio, etc for each individual team) submission tools, a panel of all of the teams, a panel to search for users, the ability to join a team, the ability to update a team's rss feed, the ability to incorporate social media, the ability to provide and upload documents for the business plan submission, the ability to integrate google services like google docs, google PowerPoints, the ability to create a tab for educational videos and webinars, web hosting on amazon, domain fees, mailing fees, and the ability for users to create their own website, a set area of the website for winners, and an area for CEOs and entrepreneurs to give live interactive presentations with all members. Phase three is beta testing, this will discover bugs and fix them. It should only take a week or so, but after that point the team will create alpha release.Phase four is the alpha release. This will allow people to create user and team accounts. Each team account has multiple users that are part of it. Then a team will be able to work on their business plan and communicate with all of our tools and win the competition. We will also create a page dedicated to every team that signs up. During this time we will also be asking users about what they like and if they want us to add more features to the website.Phase five will be adding whatever users want on the website. So if you think we should have a section of the website for x,y,z we will add it just for you!Well, first off, this concept is not new. That's surprising, right? Well, a lot of companies similar to us have thought of ways to generate money from students who are interested in entrepreneurial studies. We are the first that provides a 100% free user experience. Most of these companies offer schools an ""exclusive entrepreneur program"" for the cost of only $500 dollars per student! Well how is a student supposed to pay that? The answer is simple, they do not and as a result they are not able to be in the class. And the students who can afford it come from that top 1% of society that gets better education and opportunities. We say NO to inequalities in education. By being 100% free we are able to give everyone the same chance of winning instead of those in the 1% that can afford that entry cost.We not only have a competition but rather a network. Other programs charge a lot for a class, but its only for one semester. Once you join for free, you can be part of the program forever! We upload our videos to the website so everyone can view the tips and learn more about entrepreneurial skills and business. We bring in multiple mentors as well to further your learning. And we have dedicated the platform to be user friendly so you can chat with friends and work actively together. You can also share your screen so others can see what you’re working on! With our task manager, you can also work together and set tasks for your team to complete. With the ability to invite others to join your team, we make sure you are always able to communicate freely with anyone.Every team can create it's own social media account to attract followers to support your business plan! The social media integrates flawlessly into the website. We created a special feature so all you have to do is simply type one message and click ""send"" once and it will post it on all of your social media accounts like FB, Twitter, Instagram, Pinterest etc! That's easier than having to login to each account and update them!It's not only for students even adults can get involved. Unlike other programs, adults can volunteer their time and mentor a team. We encourage adults that have backgrounds in small business or have any type of executive or marketing backgrounds, even lawyers are crucial! Every business has many adults all from different jobs helping. A company needs lawyers, developers, engineers, marketing teams, venture capitalist, sales, tech support, and of course a leadership team. We want to educate you and help you write a business plan. And after you win, we will be there without team to help your team succeed!The panel has been selected and is excited to start once we get the website up and going. We have people from retail, current and former entrepreneurs, CEOs and of course we have media gurus as well! Remember we are here to help you. If you need help with a business plan just contact us. We have a live chat in the website and you can simply click it and we will help. If you need help with marketing your idea, we have dedicated people. If you need help with the legality of the idea we have a legal team! We are here for you, our primary goal is YOU.Have an entrepreneur club or FBLA team already, well create the same team on our website and represent your school. We help students with their pitches and their business plans. You can also enter our competition to increase your chances of winning. And to be honest some parts of FBLA are old, and do not cover entrepreneurship that well. We do, because of our dedicated tools and education videos and interactive programs. When was the last time FBLA gave you the ability to talk to an entrepreneur that has at least made $10 million dollars? Hmm, I honestly cannot recall. This is your CHANCE to become successful don't miss it!Students who show interest in a certain topic like entrepreneurship are favored by collages. College admissions are also impressed when you can say you created a successful business that provides jobs for your friends and the community.You can use the experiences you learn here in collage to fully create your master piece. One of our judges created seven companies before he hit gold. And gold in this sense is the 40-million-dollar company he created. He never got discouraged from his failures, rather he learned from these experiences and continued to pursue his passion, as should you!What is the downside of supporting us? We will even give t-shirts to people who donate to our KickStarter!  Help create an experience that your children will be able to use and help make education equal for all. Just like Kahn Academy it’s important to make education free for all especially in entrepreneurship. Join, help, support, and forward this to your friends, cousins, relatives, and even if you have a dollar to donate it will help us get closer.Thank you for all of your time and love!Sincerely,Entrepreneur Team Organization$1 = Free Account $30 = Mug $60 = Shirt $75 = Iphone 7 Case $100 = Computer Case  $300 = Everything!

There is only three areas of risk.1. Panel of Judges 2. Website 3. Users#1 is not a risk anymore because we have already met with and established the panel. We also have back up judges if some are sick.#2 is not a risk anymore because we have met with 15 developer companies and have locked in the pricing with two.

It started out as a fun way to practice golf, as it evolved, it quickly turned into a popular game with family and friends. Over the course (pun) of 3 months, game-play has been perfected, prototype has been played on for countless hours, many different materials tried, provisional patent complete, write-up of official rules and documents, logo complete, stencils for putting green ordered. The only part that is not finalized is the flag, but that should be an easy project.Funds will be used for ordering more materials to complete the initial game sets. The official 1st complete kit should be completed in approx. 10-14 days for game-play and testing. These will be hand made kits by myself and sons. The costs for materials are in bulk prices, unfortunately not wholesale with our limited start-up budget. I would love to get the cost down eventually with wholesale prices, but this initial hand-crafted run is to test the market. Everyone who has played the game so far has loved it. This ranges from those who haven't ever picked up a golf club, to seasoned golfer. So far players have been ages 6-67. The game has been great for BBQ's, family and friends get-togethers..., I myself love playing while having a few drinks, and smoking a cigar. We hold tournaments and we play at different yards and parks.It is easy to set up, take down, and transport around. The green rolls up, and the rest goes in a tote bag. We have been surprised with the overwhelming interest from passer-by's. Prototype represented green. The finished product will be a solid mesh covered rope, with magnet ends. Flag will be logo'd and nicer materials.Prototype putting green. Completed green will be identical, with actual larger logo in the middle. The colored putting lines will be sharper with the ordered stencils. All direction putting cup will most likely be silver.This is the almost completed tee-off mat, 12x18"". I think some refinements will be made. As well as a metal stencil for sharper image.I Just decided to swap the blue out, move red, and ad orange to both represented and putting green.  This is just a quick edit of the photo to see what it will look like in a week or so.Here is some game-play video. Higher quality video and instructional video coming soon.OBJECTIVE & GAMEPLAYThe objective of Yard Putt is to be the last player standing.  Each time you lose a round, you receive a letter of the word PUTT.  Once PUTT is fully spelled, you are out of the game.  The way to win a round is to chip onto the represented green, and then putt into the cup on the putting green, however this must be done in par or less (successful round).  Par is decided by the player selecting the round.  If there is at least one successful player in a round, then each player that did not hole the ball in par or less, is given their next letter in the word PUTT.  1)To decide who goes first, all players hit their foam ball from an agreed upon spot, shooting towards the flag.  The nearest to farthest balls are the order in which players select rounds.2)Player who is first selects the starting point of the round with the chipping mat.  This can be anywhere, such as a street, a different yard, alleyway, etc.  Then the selecting player calls the par.  3)The selecting player starts the round by hitting their foam ball towards the flag.  Then all the other players do the same, as they are ready.  Players count each stroke as they go along, just like in golf. 4)Once everyone has hit their ball onto the “represented green”,  they then proceed to the putting green, except for any that have hit the ball in the white chain, which represents the actual hole on the green (successful round).  As well, any that have run out of strokes (over par), do not proceed to the green, in that case they have an unsuccessful round.5)Players place a golf ball anywhere inside the same colored lines on the green that matches their foam ball on the represented green.  Players use a putter to putt the ball into the hole.  For example, if it was a par 4, and it took a player 2 shots to get inside the represented green, the player would then have 2 putts left to successfully complete that round.  If a golf ball leaves the putting green, it is out of bounds, and the player must place it back inside the colored line and try again, assuming they still have any strokes left.6)Any player who completes the round in par or less is successful. Any player who doesn't get the ball in the hole (or the white chain with their foam ball on the represented green) receives a letter in the word PUTT, the exception being if nobody was successful.  If nobody has a successful round, then no letters are given. There can be multiple losers, and/or, multiple winners in each round.7)The next player selects a starting point and the par for the next round.  Rounds continue until only one person remains. The white area in the center of the represented green simulates the hole on the putting green.  When a players ball rests in the area it is considered in the hole on the putting green. This allows more excitement such as hole-in-ones,  the main purpose is that if a player only has one stroke left, and isn't yet on the putting green, they still have a chance at a successful round.",We are pretty well positioned right now.  Everything is figured out to bring this to test market.  The only risks I can think of are catastrophic illness to myself.,https://www.kickstarter.com/projects/1023025510/yard-putt-a-golf-game-anywhere-for-all-skill-level-0?ref=discovery_category_newest,1023025510/yard-putt-a-golf-game-anywhere-for-all-skill-level-0,"Any raised funds will be used for ordering more materials to complete the initial game sets.

https://www.kickstarter.com/projects/988476124/purplekit?ref=discovery_category_newest,988476124/purplekit,"Once you start discovering the beautiful world of robotics, you will realize that are are plenty of excellent electronic options available. You will probably find proper tools, tons of Arduino/Raspberry modules, and several other excellent electronic kits. The problem appears when you actually want to create ""real"" things that interact with those electronics. For the beginner, it's easy to get lost into the thousands of mechanical pieces, servos, motors, aluminium parts and beams available. It's likely that you will spend a lot of money buying some pieces that are not the proper ones, or that cannot be joined together; and eventually spending a lot of time across the several DIY websites to understand what's available and what you could do with those pieces. This kit bridges the gap between DIY electronics and mechanics.For example, assume you want to create a robotic arm with your specific customization, or you want to create a fan that swings according to some instructions, or a linear rail to place a camera, or a large enclosure for your Arduino projects. Instead of scavenging through internet, it would be easier to get a kit containing all the stuff that your need.Broadly speaking, this Kit includes: A) lots of aluminium extrusions and accessories to connect them for general applications B) other mechanical pieces that can easily be connected to the aforementioned extrusions for more specific applications C) motors and servos that you would typically use in your live projects.For example, this kit allows you to build a robotic arm (for which you can build a support structure using the aluminium extrusions from (A), mount the servo brackets, servo discs, and U-frames from (B), and finally mount the actual servos from (C).In particular the pieces contained on this Kit are:Some of the piecesare standard ones, whereas some of them are specifically designed by us.The parts come in a high-end 68cm x 30cm x 19cm aluminium case for the standard versions. The lower-end ones come in cardboard box with proper packaging foam.We know how frustrating it is for the beginner, to understand how to place the pieces, how to foresee when the acting forces will be just too high, or what's each piece for.We feel that this kit will help a lot of people translate those crazy hardware ideas into real projects. But in order to achieve that, we also want to provide the backers (and eventually whoever buys this) with general ideas, explanations, pictures regarding how to use this kit. For example, we want to explain using a set of pictures (and possibly video), how you would typically assemble a linear rail system.We will upload this material to our website. Probably this will consist:A) One video per project explaining the final resultB) Another video explaining the mechanical forces acting, and what are the permissible limits of each designC) Additional discussions, links to other websites, and possibly a forum per projectD) Arduino code with explanations1) Is this compatible with Arduino/Raspberry? Absolutely. The servos, stepper motor, and cooler can be easily driven by most micro controllers, with an external 6V(Servos) or 12V battery (Cooler or Stepper Motor). Naturally, the mechanical pieces are hardware-software agnostic.2) Can I build a 3d printer? Many pieces contained here will be useful, but you will need lots of additional pieces.3) I want to mount these pieces over a tank chassis, can I do it? Yes, aluminium is naturally very light and will be an excellent choice.4) What are the servo limitations? What are the implications regarding what I can assemble? These are Hi-Torque servos (that stall at around 16kg / cm - that's around 1.5 Newtons per Meter), but their effectiveness decays dramatically as the length of the pieces they work on increases. Typically, you don't want them to work on pieces longer than 20-30cm.5) Do the pieces come in anodized aluminium? The black pieces come in anodized aluminium6) Do you plan to add more pieces? We might add more pieces if we feel the backers will have difficulties assembling certain types of structures.7) What are the project ideas you will provide? What are the explanations you will provide? We will add tutorials with tips, videos, pictures, and discussions. 8) Assuming i buy this, what else would i be missing to begin my projects? You will typically be missing an Arduino, cables, batteries and a stepper motor driver.This kit requires pieces from different suppliers and manufacturers. If we don't achieve a minimum amount of backers, the components prices would be just too high (specially for the components designed by ourselves).The amount of backers will also determine the quality of the presentation: the stickers quality, whether we can afford foam slot inserts, the quality of the instructions we provide for assembly, etc.The standard parts will be bulk bought. Most of the non-standard ones will be produced in China by aluminium design factories we have been working with. We might be forced to change some of the pieces, and replace them by alternative ones, should we encounter logistic difficulties.","The project requires interacting with different suppliers. Many of the possible problems may appear in that direction - i.e: a supplier may be unable to get the parts in time, and we might need to find an alternative ones.Some of the motors or servos might be defective (as any other electronic product). In that case we will naturally replace them, but that might process might lead to some frustration to the backers.After we finish our initial batch, we would need to ensure we have the proper supply chain, to feed additional pieces to the backers who want additional pieces.We feel that the risks associated to this are much smaller than other typical technology projects.",https://www.kickstarter.com/projects/988476124/purplemob?ref=discovery_category_newest,988476124/purplemob,"When you design robots using Arduino, you will certainly need lots of components. This will imply dozens of connections, lots of cables, and several modules that will require proper mounting. As you know, the more complex the project, the more likely you are to make mistakes possibly damaging your equipment, and losing valuable time understanding where that unconnected pin should go!This motherboard is designed to be mounted on top of Arduino Mega (or its clones). If your Mega stops working for any reason, you can just mount this on top of a different Mega (the Mega is not included in this campaign)We designed this board aiming at people building their own robots, and it includes:The 12V input is assumed. You can operate the motherboard without it, but you won't certainly be able to: use the mosfet, drive the servos, move the DC motors, move the stepper motor. The assumption of 12V appears because for robotic applications you will typically need 12V DC motors.We have all experienced the situation of starting a project and then not remembering how all those cables should be connected. This is true specially for small robotic applications - where you need DC motors, communications, servos, current sensing, etc. Our idea is to ensure maximum applicability (no need to remember which pin was doing what?). Since everything here is internally connected, you just connect, load your program using our library and you are ready to go. The DC motors, servos, and stepper motor are not included.In the video you can see how the library looks like. It's essentially a couple of C headers that you can include in your Arduino environment, As you can imagine, the great thing is that you don't need to edit the pin numbers, as everything is internally connected (unless you are attaching extra things).We plan to allocate 2 small extra pre-production runs, fine tuning some things, possibly adding some proper fuses, and achieving a more rugged design. We MIGHT add a Wifi module and two extra servos, but that will depend on several factors, and we cannot commit to that.Naturally, the more successful the campaign is, the more components we can order our PCB manufacturers to assemble by themselves (not only is that more ""appealing"" visually, but it also reduces the amount of errors (and hence cost).We might decide to add new capabilities to the motherboard (maybe an extra sensor or something along those line). We will certainly try to minimise the changes to the current appearance. My long term goal is to manufacture non-expensive motherboards for Arduino that facilitates replicating projects (that feeling when you don't remember how you were connecting those cables...) and helps you maintain a clean hardware development cycle.The next version will have 40+ servo control, two - dual channel DC drivers (4 motors), and a WIFI module. It will be at least 30% larger in size.In the video, the IRF540 mosfet is not active/connected in the video, as I added that later based on the feedback of some hobbyists. I wouldn't expect any problem.","Currently there is an issue happening with the HC-05 Bluetooth module I have been using. It receives the proper messages, but sends messages that end abruptly (or sometimes sends half of the message it should be sending). I expect to solve this, since this is a problem I had never encountered. My current hypothesis is that there is an issue with the voltage there. The worst scenario is that I won't be able to fix this easily, and the board will be receiving ""correct"" messages, but will be sending ""incorrect"" ones.In the video, the IRF540 mosfet is not active/connected, as I added that later based on the feedback of an robotics hobbyist.

https://www.kickstarter.com/projects/motionsolution/motion-solution?ref=discovery_category_newest,motionsolution/motion-solution,"Motion Solution is the device that will help you move any diasbled vehicle on your own and for a short distance without physical strain to your own body.Motion Solution works by being attached to two or three lug nuts of any wheel on the vehicle. The vehicle needs to be put in neutral whether automatic or manual. Motion Solution uses an electric motor that turns the wheel at the press of a button. The device only gets the car moving, so the user would need to steer to navigate and step on the brake of the car in order to stop.As a mechanic myself, I know first hand the daily struggle that comes with moving vehicles on your own. This invention came as the answer to solving the most physically intensive part of my job and helping many others that face this problem, too.The idea for Motion Solution came with a harsh bite of reality -- I’m getting old. It’s not something I fear, aging that is, but what comes with aging was hard to swallow. My body has and continues to lose some of its strength. My daughter would tell you I’m the strongest man she knows, not because of muscles or anything, but because if my children or friends tell me I physically can’t do something I start working at it until I do it, like a difficult type of push-up, juggling, running, or riding a bicycle backwards, etc. I’m not a thin or muscular man, but I don’t like giving up and I don’t like feeling weak.On the night I first got the seed of an idea for Motion Solution was the same night I faced that my body was getting weaker. I’ve been a mechanic for over two decades and it has not been without its trials. My wife would tell you I’m obsessed with work, but I’m sure most blue collar workers would point out that the men and women trying to provide for their families by working over 10 hours a day, 7 days a week, do so not by desire but necessity. That same necessity had me pushing a disabled vehicle into the mechanic shop before closing up for the night. It was after 9 PM and I was the last man there so I had to push the last vehicles inside before heading home. This is something that happens regularly, so my body was used to this strain, but for some reason that night was especially difficult.As I struggled to get the car where it needed to go, two thoughts came to mind. The first, I’m getting old. The second, it would be great if there was something to help me push this car.I realized then that there wasn’t and that I needed to fix that. Since I was a child, I’ve always wanted to invent something that would help many. I’ve thought of many ideas over the years, but it was this one that I knew would help not only myself but my friends and any person that works with cars. This seed planted in my head and became my obsession. It is something that wasn’t just for me, but for others. I knew I had to make it real.I was further motivated when I first told my daughter my new idea. She had heard many others by then, so she listened with interest, but also doubt. Finally, she said, “Papi, a lot of people can say they have this great idea, but I want to see it work.”After using all my savings to purchase a provisional patent and sending to companies without success, I turned my dream to KickStarter. However, my daughter’s words were not far behind me as I moved forward: I needed a working prototype.What followed then was many late nights of drawing up, tinkering, welding, and restarts so I could start the first set of tests. From there, many motors were broken while my hands were bruised and burned until the first prototype was succesful.With the help of backers from Kickstarter, I hope to go back to the drawing board and create the second prototype with a stronger motor and finished look. Backers are necessary for me to provide workers, shops, dealers, and do-it-yourselfs passionate about vehicles with a finished Motion Solution product.2019 is the year I plan to dedicate to completing Motion Solution. In December the goal is to start ordering stronger and more durable materials and motors to develop the next working prototype towards that finished look. Come January, I plan to hire a mechanical engineer to assist me in polishing and testing the device.By May, I will start the process of setting up a contract with a manufacturer within the United States to order the first Motion Solutions. I want to provide sufficient time in the plan for research, manufacturing, and shipping times, etc. Therefore, the goal is to begin deliveries no later than November 2019.Your support and feedback is greatly appreciated and our top priority is to deliver to you Motion Solution. Again, we thank you for helping us make this dream one step closer to reality.Any and all feedback and questions are welcome at mannymotionsolution@gmail.com.","My goal is to provide our supporters with a Motion Solution in one years time that will take out the pain and struggle from the equation that is fixing vehicles. However, I am aware of the reality of life and Murphy’s Law: whatever can go wrong, will go wrong.To address any and all steps post Kickstarter, the following will be our first course of action: monthly, at times even weekly, emails will be delivered to provide our backers with as much updates as we have to provide, delays if they should arise, and to answer any questions you may have.Second, we will address concerns and feedback within 3 bussiness days. Every hour of the day is an opportunity to learn and I take this to heart.  Therefore, your feedback and voice is not only appreciated, but encouraged.Furthermore, while I have a working prototype, I know products can always be bettered so I am in talks with two different mechanical engineers to innovate Motion Solution. With the timeline above, we have planned sufficient time to create an improved version of Motion Solution and enough manufacturing time to meet our November delivery goal.Our first goal to meet, though, is communication. So our backers will be coming along with us every step of the way. This product is for not only for me to use, but for every worker and laborer working with vehicles: it is for the individual straining to get that one last car back into the shop after everyone has left, the do-it-yourselfer with a new project in their hands, the dealer closing up for the day, and you who knows that hurt on your body as you push against that car. Motion Solution is for us.",https://www.kickstarter.com/projects/motionsolution/abracadabra-0?ref=discovery_category_newest,motionsolution/abracadabra-0,I came up with this Gadget.

Obtain different poles, lures, baits, and techniques to help you catch hundreds of different authentic freshwater and saltwater fish. Enjoy individual and team fishing competitions, and get your name in the record books!Explorer Mode allows you to to fish any coastline, lake, or river you can physically approach. Fishing different places will yield different results, and global hot-spots can be shared with your friends/teammates.There are several benefits/features exclusive to Explorer Mode:Travel Mode will allow you to fish different locations around the world without leaving your couch.However, travelling costs money, and players receive less money for fish caught while traveling because they are not established with the local fish market.While designing this game, we considered many facets of what the fishing experience is. It is easy to get carried away in the technical details, and loose focus on what makes fishing fun and exciting. We are not professional anglers, however, everyone of us has been fishing heavily since a young age. So, we decided to work it a little backwards. Instead of defining what it takes to fish, we decided to list our most memorable fishing experiences and what we remember about them. Then we asked ourselves, ""What makes them memorable?"" - Through this exercise, we were able to identify what we should focus on, and what ideas we should expend minimal effort. Here are the results:This kickstarter is an effort to finance the initial US release of Real World Fishing. The application is intended as a worldwide distribution, and is being structurally developed to support all global requirements. However, we predict a regionally based roll-out would allow us to focus initial funding, release earlier, and address issues more effectively. The US release is scheduled for August 2018, with additional national roll-outs happening every 2 months there after. We have tentatively scheduled the following national roll-outs: The initial release of Real World Fishing will support both Android and IOS. Future releases will provide built-in support for a number of virtual reality devices.","Lets' be honest... There are less than a handful of companies building Augmented World games. This breakthrough genre of gaming requires an array of knowledge and critical skills far outside standard game development. This is one of the reasons there are very few examples to point at.One year ago, I would have not imagined we would be writing a video game. Mainly, because we are not video game developers. As scary as that sounds, it is also the reason this project is likely to succeed. Before you are put off by my candor, let me explain... This project was founded by two long-time friends and co-workers over lunch. We may have never professionally built a video game before, but, as programmers we have built games for fun in our spare time. We would often come up with game ideas and bounce them off each other, but never found the right idea worth chasing until now. For years we have built distributed systems for large companies. We are experts in enterprise-level software architecture, geographic information systems, and development process. We understand the scope of work, how to plan and execute it, and how to deal with the daily challenges that arise. We know exactly what it takes to build an application of this magnitude, and we enter this project confident in its' success .

It is a personal first-hand account of the cause and effect of opiate addiction, and the long-term challenges faced when loving an addict. I intend to go into the studio and give it everything. This is my one opportunity, and I intend to make it count.The opiate epidemic is destroying families across the world. I know because mine is one of them. I am a single father. I have four wonderful kids. Each day we struggle to face the emotional consequences of opiate addiction. This drug is a monster. The monster that took my children's mother from them. The monster that took the love of my life.Because of these circumstances, I was also forced to give up what I loved doing, making music. I had to worry about my kids, and I thought there was no time for me to be dreaming. I got a real job, and for years I killed myself just to put food on the table. For ten years, I have pushed music aside. I never stopped writing, but I have not pushed myself to do anything with it.Everyday I look into the mirror, knowing I have something to say, yet I stay silent. I made a lot of excuses why I couldn't do it. I didn't have the money or the time. I had four kids to dress, feed, and care for. But, the truth is, when it came down to it, there was no excuse.I always tell my kids they can be whatever they want. If that is true, why am I not making music? Why am I not at least trying? I realized I have to lead by example. If I am not willing to chase my dreams, my kids will never know to chase theirs. And because of that, I am more determined than ever. I want to show my children that you cannot be afraid of life or failure.Ten years ago, I made a few songs. I posted them to a few sites. People seemed to enjoy them, even though they were recorded in my living room with cheap equipment:I intend to use the money received from this project to record the release.

All of these elements visualize an impressive story about the story through the means of art.The fabulous and playful external form is a strong contrast to its serious theme: This project tells the true story of a young woman's resistance to the overpowering corrupt state - and is a sign of hope in these fleeting days of high-tech globalization. Resistance requires courage and perseverance. Just as the hope of a free, fair and strong Ukraine thrives, Natalia Ohar's project is also growing.Art. Power. Hope. Art can tell. | 艺术可以讲述。 | Kunst kann erzählen.Art can unmask. | 艺术可以揭露。 | Kunst kann entlarven.Art can strengthen. | 艺术可以强化。| Kunst kann stärken.And art can move. | 艺术可以推动。 | Und kunst kann bewegen.In this sense, Natalia Ohar, born in 1981 in the Ukraine, is working on a large-scale multimedia project. First, she tells her story through a complex collage.This artwork was selected for the International Award ""LORENZO IL MAGNIFICO"" at the Florence Biennale 2017 in the category of Mixed Media.Natalia Ohar is not only the daughter of a formerly successful Ukrainian entrepreneur, but also a lawyer and publicist. For 15 years, she has been conducting a tireless struggle in her homeland: against corruption and, ultimately, for human rights. This mosaic image (PRESS MOSAIC) works on several levels: it combines the past and present realities in Ukraine. Graphics and typography illustrate a story about the story through the means of art. On the one hand, they make the almost bizarre paradox visible. All integrated state institutions - the police, the judiciary, the public prosecutor's office and, above all, the courts - have the task of ensuring justice. Natalia Ohar’s story shows that, in the Ukraine, these institutions, alongside powerful financial clans, are the real criminals.The individual elements of the motif create the complex image of a fragile young woman, fragmented into a thousand parts. The sum of these parts unfolds the power to stun the system. The artwork also shows the positive effects: successful court trials, enlightening press contributions, crowded officials and high-ranking politicians. All of this gives hope for a free, fair Ukraine. People should not be on their guard against their state because the state should protect its citizens.This project tells the story of a young woman's resistance to the overpowering corrupt state - and is a sign of hope in these fleeting days of high-tech globalization. Resistance requires courage and perseverance. Just as the hope of a free, fair and strong Ukraine thrives, Natalia Ohar’s project is also growing.www.nataliaohar.comI am extremely honored to announce that The European Cultural Centre support my project and presentation of my artwork “PRESS MOSAIC” in the context of the 58th VENICE BIENNALE 2019 during the six month exhibition ""TIME - SPACE - EXISTENCE"" La Biennale di Venezia in the European Pavilion at stunning Palazzo Mora in Venezia from 11th May – 24th November 2019. ""The resistance of this girl is not heroism. Its reason for being is her exceptional strength of character and fortitude. She only confesses her truths to silence, in hope, this echo will be recognized by all who are not indifferent to others.""",Life and Art have no limits. Let's make this journey together!

It tells the story of a man who returns to his hometown after years of running with a gang of outlaws. The main character, John Adams, is now a notorious gunfighter who causes nothing but trouble.He finds out that his childhood love is betrothed to another man, the Preacher's son, who is known for his cruel manner with women, and he is enraged, so he sets about trying to win her from him... but she rejects him.I plan to make a full length movie, with all of the tracks from the album connecting the story in its entirety. As you can see, I've already been out to Spain and recorded a test video in which Adams is stumbling around trying to flee the gunman who has just shot him.

These sea creatures have the ability to revert their chromosome patterns temporarily enough to achieve asexual reproduction. The original creature laid a single Egg just before leaving and I've been raising it in secret for the past how ever many years.It is brought to my attention that the original creature could still possibly be alive though so myself and some crew members charter a boat to the coordinates she was left at and send pulses into the water. Initially we get no response but as we dock the boat we are overwhelmed by an absolutely enormous sea creature making its way on land. After a brief panic we head back to the lab and no sooner are bombarded with FBI and CIA agents.During the questioning the baby, who also has an excelerated growth rate, manages to break out of its secret enclosure, destroying our park in the process and causing the collapse of our main control/lab building.The FBI then informs us that we've got a certain amount of hours to get these creatures back to water or the entire city is going to be destroyed. They also issue a city-wide evacuation but purposely make it hard for anyone to really get out.The conclusion the this film is tragic. The government goes back on their word and unleashes a hell fire of bombs upon the city, leaving everyone dead.I can promise there is MUCH more that goes into this idea, but I wasn't sure if I could even fit it all on here.

Watering only the top bucket waters every plant and plant bed simultaneously without even moving the hose.This unit floods the bases from the bottom up of each plant bed on a timer (or manually with a hose), constantly draining and recycling either water or nutrient solution to the plant roots in each level. The draining cycle sustains about a 1""-1.5"" layer of water at the bases of each plant bed for the roots to extend into while running, then each layer drains naturally via gravity once the timer turns off. The water/solution from the base is pumped into the top, spreads to each layer uniformly (as shown in video) from gravity and displacement alone, then drains completely from gravity minutes after the timer turns off.A provisional patent has been filed for this invention successfully, so I can begin marketing it to businesses and online! This unit works indoors or outdoors.The Step-grower Hydroponic System seeks to benefit and uplift communities, individuals, and anyone whom wishes to begin cultivating their own crops in need of healthy food, or simply individuals wishing to create an easy, sustainable hydroponic garden for themselves, their family, or their community.

Yet, other animated shows rely on nutty premises and ridiculous scenarios to get their laughs. I want to create an animated sitcom that doesn’t fall into the regular pattern that mainstream comedies get into.Must Make It Hard On MyselfIn order to stop myself taking the easy road and creating something that people have seen a hundred times, I must make it hard on myself. • No dumb characters (it has been overdone)• No single person is picked on all the time (it is too easy)• No drinking because it normalizes alcoholism (and most animated TV shows have a drinker)• No drug taking for the same reasons• No funny and overly fat people for the same reason (plus the fat-funny thing is getting old)• No other worldly stuff, monster stuff, or stuff that doesn’t happen in real life to real people• No episodes that are non-cannon (I am looking at you Simpsons Principal Tamzarian and American Dad the 42yr old virgin)Evergreen ContentI am going to try to avoid references to modern things and movies. When I watch older TV comedies, I don't know which celebrities they are talking about or the references they are making to movies. To keep things evergreen, I will simply avoid talking about celebrities and referencing movies (plus, the whole movie parody thing has been overdone by this point).No Dumb CharacterHaving a dumb character is too easy and is getting cliche. There will be no dumb character, there will be no Morty, Homer, Fry, Francine, Peter & Chris, Trigger, Mrs Warboys, Chris Theodopolopodous, My Hero, Porridge’s Warren, Dougal Maguire, both brothers in Fraiser, Vivian in Young Ones, Cat in Red Dwarf, etc.It is possible to make good TV shows without a “Dumb” character. For example, these comedies do not have a dumb character, only characters that occasionally do something dumb.• Open All Hours• Everybody Loves Raymond• South ParkThings Must Be Kept RealThe only odd stuff will happen in dreams, hallucinations, and imagination. Otherwise, there will be no talking animals, weird creatures, or anything else that couldn’t happen in real life. No science fiction stuff that has not already happened, no ghosts, time travel, back from the dead, or injuries that suddenly heal. No implausible technology. I want to get laughs from the stuff we all see and not from imaginary stuff. Nothing Gross and No Funny TalkGross things seem to recur in TV shows because they make studio audiences laugh, so I will avoid gross stuff. I love Rick & Morty, but I could live without Rick drooling. I loved Family Guy back in the day, but I could live without seeing Meg squeeze her spots.I will also avoid silly talk. Funny TV shows give people verbal flourishes like Flanders with his Diddlies and Rimmer with his Right-Me-Laddie-O, or Rowan Atkinson with the way he puts emphasis on certain letters to make his words sound funnier. I will also avoid silly talk that studio execs use to pad the run time, such as when Marge Simpson calls a manatee an Oogly Boogly.Why I NEED HelpAnimating is painfully slow, especially at the beginning when I am building assets that I can reuse. Simple things such as building a background takes epic amounts of time. I can reuse the background in the future, but the time and effort it takes at the beginning is legendary.Getting started is very expensive, and I do not have the money to finance the project on my own. I can do all the animating, and most of the voice work and editing, but I need to be able to dedicate a good 13 hours per day to it, and I can’t do that without some sort of financial backing. The great thing is that once I have made my first five episodes, I will have enough material, pre-built characters, and so forth, that I will be able to continue making episodes on my own. Plus, as time goes on, I will get better at animating, create more sophisticated cartoons, and keep improving the same way all those old cartoon shows did. I mean, have you seen the old South Park and Simpsons episodes? They were pretty rough. Mine will be too, but thanks to Kickstarter funding, my sitcom will get off the ground and will get better and better after each episode. Without Kickstarter, there is simply no other way I will ever get my animated show on YouTube.","Once I have the funding, I will have the time, equipment, and capacity to make full-length episodes of my show. It will take me a month to create two episodes, and the money I receive will more than cover my expenses while I feverishly work on my animated episodes. There are no reasons why I cannot create two episodes per month if I receive enough funding. The more funding I receive, then the more episodes I can afford to make.",https://www.kickstarter.com/projects/tednipples/must-be-a-tuesday?ref=discovery_category_newest,tednipples/must-be-a-tuesday,"Every animated TV show seems to have unrealistic stuff happening all the time, from robots and aliens in the Simpsons, to fighting a giant chicken in Family Guy. Loads of hilarious stuff happens in real life, so that is what I am going to animate, without farce, monsters, or any sort of unrealistic stuff happening.“Must Be a Tuesday” will feature on YouTube, and I will post each episode as it is created. You will not have to wait months or years to see the show.With some start-up funding, I can start producing full episodes at a good rate.

This project has taken a long time to be put together. It started with an idea to do nice fight scenes that have realistic feel to it. Few people involved from the start really liked it and asked me to put in some more scenes in which they could extend their screen time. So from a few fight scenes the whole movie was born. At the beginning there were just a couple of people involved in it. Radomir Bajtek and James Tupino. In the end we used 16 actors ranging in experience from first timers to seasoned actors with movie/theater experience. We had also the help of Geoff Ryan, an actor and stunt man who played the part of Frank double and helped us with the fight choreography. Special thanks to our camera men Maciek Swiederski and Giancarlo Espinosa who are very talented people and Giancarlo composed majority of the music along with Rock Solomon who is locally known actor/musician. Some scenes were also shot by Radomir Bajtek or myself. The story is pretty straightforward, it is an action movie from the start to the end. The movie is edited the way that there is no filler, just the story flowing forward at the fast pace.

The gallery will be situated in the very heart of Bristol, the greenest capital in the EU and one of the top 10 friendliest, coolest places to live in the world.The ground floor will be where we exhibit artwork available for purchase while the  second floor will be a space for Art Classes, walk in workshops and a friendly environment for artists to  share their interests and make connections.Even a small contribution to the Art Gallery would help me to fulfil my dream of creating a truly independent and community focused art gallery in the heart of Bristol City Centre.Thank you for expressing an interest and I hope you like my page! Enjoy. :)","The challenges we face are legal cost to secure the premise, making sure its has been health and safety approved, the maintenance cost to tidy up the Gallery floor, that includes fixing the shop floor, maintenance for wall painting, lights, hanging rail systems and art supplies.",https://www.kickstarter.com/projects/661322581/contemporary-art-gallery-0?ref=discovery_category_newest,661322581/contemporary-art-gallery-0,"Hi everyone, Let me start by introducing myself, I'm Vitali Cortesi, founder of Gallery Du 808 LTD. The concept came to me 6 months ago, when I had decided to leave my old life behind and take on a new project which Involved opening an art gallery, I wanted to create a fun exciting space for the everyday people, I didn't want to become a commercialised art gallery, I wanted to create an inviting space, a luxury urban art gallery designed exclusively for exhibitions and showcasing quirky art that most people usually wouldn't get the opportunity to display.6 months down the line, the gallery has officially open, the journey has not been easy but luckily, I've gain many peoples support and trust throughout the process.I now need your help to maintain this beautiful art gallery, I'd like to organise more exhibitions and events for unsigned and exceptionally talent artist who deserve a chance to be exhibited.We require more funding to provide art class for beginners workshop, the funding will go towards, marketing and advertising, maintenance and staff hire. At the current moment, the upstairs of the gallery is unmaintained and unloved, we will need to add flooring,hire a plasterer and purchase new materials for the workshop.Since opening we have gained a huge amount of support from local artist, friends and Bristol, we've received a lot of attention and even gain a lovely reputation for restoring the value in art and Bristol City Centre.A little history! :)Why did I chose 'Gallery Du 808' as a name? The name came to me when I was practicing my faith to god/spiritualism in early December 2017, as aresult I had decided to name the gallery '808' after the angels numbers.Thank you for taking the time to read my story and my journey. I will be updating frequently, Ihope to gain your support.Kindest regards,Vitali Cortesi :)","The projects designed to support authentic artist, to assist them in price list, curating, marketing and networking.Our threats would be with our competitors who have already built a reputation and profile, it is not uncommon that some art galleries also offer art classes and exhibitions but we plan to concur this risk by building an exceptionally reputation and offering the best to our artist.We hope you will join us on this venture and support the project."

Otro tema sombrío rondaba por las calles, la supuesta existencia de las ""snuff movies"", películas de torturas y asesinatos reales que en poco tiempo comenzarían a tener más credibilidad con el caso Alcásser.Los protagonistas de esta historia son dos amigos de una aldea en la costa de la muerte de Galicia, rodeado por mar y montañas, forma parte de un conjunto de pequeños pueblos solitarios. Carlos, hijo único de una familia adinerada, y Hugo, su mejor amigo el cual solo tiene a su madre a la que poco tiempo puede ver ya que se pasa parte del día trabajando, dos vidas muy diferentes pero aún así muy unidos.Carlos recibe de regalo de cumpleaños por parte de sus padres una cámara VHS totalmente nuevo modelo inportado de América, y así deciden comenzar a grabar su verano de los 90, ignorando completamente que una niña de uno de los pueblos cercanos había desaparecido en la profundidad del bosque cuando volvía sola del parque, ya que todos se conocían en estos pueblos.El problema comienza mientras graban su camino por el bosque norte hacia el faro, el problema es que graban en la profundad del bosque a un hombre con una especie de capucha blanca en la cabeza arrastrando algo envuelto en sábanas, hacia adentro de un túnel.Lo más sensato hubiera sido avisar a la policía, pero todos conocían a Silvio el jefe de policía del pueblo, un patán corrupto que tenía muchas cosas que ocultar y que no movería un dedo, además en un sitio al que nadie quiere ir y donde todos quieren marcharse nunca pasa algo así de interesante, si descubren por su cuenta quién es el que se está llevando a los niños ese sería su billete para escapar de ese infernal pueblo.PRODUCCIÓNLa película será rodada en diferentes partes de Galicia, en estilo ""found footage"" pero implementando un estilo de rodaje novedoso dándole un look de VHS noventero. Se intentará recaudar todo lo posible por crowdfunding, para sumarlo a la subvención y a la productora implicada en el proyecto, así que la película se llevará a cabo 100% seguro.EL DIRECTOR, GUIONISTA Y PRODUCTORCarlos Almón Muñoz, nacido el 21 de agosto de 1992 en Santiago de Compostela (A Coruña), director miembro más joven de la asociación gallega de la Academia Galega Audiovisual.

Mientras niños, mujeres y hombres siguen desapareciendo en la oscuridad de las montañas, la gente del pueblo apunta a las sectas satánicas que se reunen en las montañas y que cada vez tienen más fama, presionando así a la policía del pueblo que cada vez está más en entredicho por su corruptela y pasividad ante las desapariciones.EL DIRECTOR, GUIONISTA Y PRODUCTORCarlos Almón Muñoz, nacido el 21 de agosto de 1992 en Santiago de Compostela (A Coruña), director miembro más joven de la asociación gallega de la Academia Galega Audiovisual.

You can also share layers that you have created with your friends.Layers can be made available for free, or you can charge a monthly fee for other people to use your layers.Here's an illustration of two people sharing an indicator and strategy based on a simple moving average.Layers can be technical indicators that display graphics on the charts.Layers can provide data to other layers, so that layers can help each other.Layers can implement trading strategies, that use data provided by other layers, to decide when to open trading positions with our back-testing simulator.Layers provided by the platform will then display graphics on the charts to show the back-testing results.Layers can be assembled in different ways across many trading plans so you can try out different combinations to discover more and more profitable strategies.The charts featured above show a commonly used technical indicator and trading strategy called Ichimoku breakout.FIN SHARE can produce charts showing any technical indicator, and the platform can simulate any trading strategy you can imagine.The rewards for donating to the project are free membership accounts.","Development of the app is on schedule, and our team of developers are committed to delivering a world class product on time and on budget.

It will be begin with a trauma narrative introducing you to the troubled mind of the artist, Myles Walker, then slowly begin to reveal over 100 original pieces of artwork, accumulated over more than a decade. The artwork includes poems, spoken-word pieces, photography, little hand drawings and song excerpts from Myles Walker's adventures across 3 continents.These are just a few samples of the art that will be included in the book.

https://www.kickstarter.com/projects/103092488/coconut-beach-bark-dessert?ref=discovery_category_newest,103092488/coconut-beach-bark-dessert,"Aloha,In November of 2011, Christopher and Maile Campbell had recently moved clear across the country to New England from the West Coast. Christopher had accepted a job as President of a restaurant group operating 13 steak houses in six New England states. They already had 2 healthy boys ages 8 and 2 when in July 2012, Maile gave birth to their third child, a baby girl. At the same time they should have been celebrating their new addition, Christopher unexpectedlylost his job two weeks before Thanksgiving. Their new baby girl was born with Down Syndrome and wasn't doing well as her health was rapidly deteriorating. She was not gaining weight and had difficulty breathing. The medical news came two weeks before Thanksgiving from her pediatrician - she had two tiny holes in her heart that needed immediate surgery because she was in Congestive Heart Failure. Thankfully, they lived two hours north of Boston in New Hampshire where one of the nation's best children's hospital was located, Boston's Children Hospital. At the tender age of only four months, their daughter had successful open heart surgery and the family collectively counted their blessings over Thanksgiving.Christopher still had not found a job after crisscrossing the country interviewing with multiple companies. One day in March of 2013, during a dreadful snowstorm his wife looked across the family room as he was desperate to find a positionthat would nourish and feed his young family when she uttered the words ""Just Do It, its Now or Never"", his ""moment with Maile"" he recalls so vividly. She encouraged him to open his dream creation, Braddah's Island Style a Hawaiian/Mexican Fusion quick casual restaurant concept that he knew could compete with Brands that had already saturated the gourmet burrito/taco/salad niche. He created a business plan and solicited capital to open. His concept would serve customizable tacos, burritos and bowls using a fusion of his wife's Hawaiian roots with fruit infused salsas and items that guests would point to while his teams hand made their orders. He also wanted something sweet at the register that would be quick and easy for customers to complement their meal for dessert so he looked to Maile for help. After weeks of trying new desserts, they finally decided on a recipe. After numerous taste tests and substitutions, the recipe was finally perfected. A sweet toffee bottom, cracker middle, chocolate top that was dusted with Pink Salt and Coconut. They affectionately gave its name Coconut Bark.In May 2013, after raising what he felt like was enough capital, he packed just enough clothes for a week or two, the two family dogs and left his family behind to sell the house. They would later join him in Las Vegas to open up the first Braddah's Island Style fresh grill.Coconut Bark was introduced as 1/4 lb Bag with no labeling or branding, and was instantly well received in Braddah's social media and online review sites by their guests as - ""The Best Dessert They Have Ever Had"", with its unique texture, and perfect balance of being sweet and salty, it became famous in Las Vegas. Braddah's had a drive thru and Christopher witnessed many people using the drive thru JUST to buy a Box of what everybody was raving about. In September 2013, when Braddah's was only two months old, it won its first of 3 straight Awards at the Bite of Las Vegas. After the first award, his entrepreneurial mind went into overdrive. If guests were willing to buy a 1/4 lb of Bark, they surely would buy a 1/2 LB and 1 LB of the Bark, as well. He got creative and produced labels as his Bark went from being sold in a Bag to a Box, sold in 3 sizes. It was late September 2013, so he envisioned Pumpkin Spice Bark being sold from Halloween through Thanksgiving and White Chocolate Peppermint infused Bark being sold for Christmas and the New Year. Shortly thereafter, in 2014, a tri-colored Bunny Bark was introduced to celebrate the arrival of Spring and the Easter holiday. The last Bark introduced in 2015 was Butterscotch Bark which rounded out 5 flavors of Bark desserts that the company affectionately calles Braddah's Beach Barks.When Christopher was opening his numerous restaurant locations, he needed a dollar when he only had a dime. This meant he had to settle for restaurant locations that would have to draw on great service and food alone, opening with negative cash in the bank each time. This also meant no money for a marketing budget or competitive salaries to operate the restaurants which now had grown to four locations in Las Vegas.  People who did find them would swear it was the best burrito, bowl, taco, salad or nachos they had ever had, much better than big well known recognized brands and the Coconut Bark was always a must purchase. The concept was recognized locally, regionally and nationally, although these accolades never produced a profit.His family has sacrificed much in the last four years as he watched lessor brands, serving processed food, thrive with long lines inside and in their drive-thru's, while guests trickled in to his establishments. They always had their expectations exceeded with service, food and dessert - Coconut Bark. At one time, Braddah's online store was able to sell and ship Beach Barks nation wide before budget restraints and lack of traffic forced him to work open to close as he tried to save the brick and mortar restaurants from closing.The four restaurants finally seized all operations in October of 2016. What has occurred over the last couple months is most extraordinary. To this day Christopher continues to receive multiple daily emails and inquires on Braddah's social media sites, ""Where did my favorite new restaurant go?...HOW can I still get your fantastic dessert Coconut Bark?""The Campbell family has a strong bond and is resilient. We are ready for a 2nd chance to introduce its line of famous Beach Barks to the public. We hope that this truly is our KICKSTART to make this happen. Your pledge will be rewarded with either a 1 LB. Tin or a 1 LB. Box of your very own original Coconut Bark enabling us to keep the spirit of Braddah's Island Style alive.

Christopher had accepted a job as President of a restaurant group operating 13 steak houses in six New England states. They already had 2 healthy boys ages 8 and 2 when in July 2012, Maile gave birth to their third child, a baby girl. At the same time they should have been celebrating their new addition, Christopher unexpectedly lost his job two weeks before Thanksgiving. Their new baby girl was born with Down Syndrome and wasn't doing well as her health was rapidly deteriorating. She was not gaining weight and had difficulty breathing. The medical news came two weeks before Thanksgiving from her pediatrician - she had two tiny holes in her heart that needed immediate surgery because she was in Congestive Heart Failure. Thankfully, they lived two hours north of Boston in New Hampshire where one of the nation's best children's hospital was located, Boston's Children Hospital. At the tender age of only four months, their daughter had successful open heart surgery and the family collectively counted their blessings over Thanksgiving. Christopher still had not found a job after crisscrossing the country interviewing with multiple companies. One day in March of 2013, during a dreadful snowstorm his wife looked across the family room as he was desperate to find a position that would nourish and feed his young family when she uttered the words ""Just Do It, its Now or Never"", his ""moment with Maile"" he recalls so vividly. She encouraged him to open his dream creation, Braddah's Island Style a Hawaiian/Mexican Fusion quick casual restaurant concept that he knew could compete with Brands that had already saturated the gourmet burrito/taco/salad niche. He created a business plan and solicited capital to open. His concept would serve customizable tacos, burritos and bowls using a fusion of his wife's Hawaiian roots with fruit infused salsas and items that guests would point to while his teams hand made their orders.In May 2013, after raising what he felt like was enough capital, he packed just enough clothes for a week or two, the two family dogs and left his family behind to sell the house. They would later join him in Las Vegas to open up the first Braddah's Island Style fresh grill. Braddah's had a drive thru and Christopher witnessed many people using the drive thru JUST to buy a bottle of HOT SAUCE, for a gift or for cooking their creations at home. People who did find the locations would swear it was the best burrito, bowl, taco, salad or nachos they had ever had, much better than big well known recognized brands and the Hot Lava Sauce was always a must addition to every meal. The concept was recognized locally, regionally and nationally, although these accolades never produced a profit. His family has sacrificed much in the last four years as he watched lessor brands, serving processed food, thrive with long lines inside and in their drive-thru's, while guests trickled in to his establishments.

What has occurred over the last part of 2016 is most extraordinary.

It has been in development for almost 2 years now. Currently I am a 5th year college senior in my last semester of computer science. I also have a business administration minor where I wrote a business plan for my company that I am starting, Solaryclipse. I am looking for a part time job but I want to keep Amoeblobs my primary focus.My Goal: Create a user driven company. That means that I want to make a company which takes your feedback more seriously. Imagine being a part of this community of people in control of the products that you are going to get. So please, go to the Solaryclipse Facebook and Twitter page and participate. I will be posting frequent updates on my progress so you know exactly what is going on.Amoeblobs: Amoeblobs is a game designed to be very simple to pick up and play while having some more complex physics based mechanics. Anyone can play and compete against their friends and even against the world! The goal of the game is to convert cells into amoebas without letting it get too large and touch the wrong color. There will be a free ad-supported version and a $0.99 ad-free version when it is finally released.Features:Current Status: I am currently in the late part of alpha testing. It still needs sound and in-game content like power-ups and achievements. The game play itself is mostly complete and the score system works through Google Play Leaderboards synchronization.Why am I looking for alpha and beta testers? I want to make sure I get as much user feedback as I can before I release the final product.Deadlines: I am hoping to be moving onto beta stage at the end of January but it could happen earlier. It just depends on how much of your feedback I get and have to change in the game.Slightly Technical: I am trying to do this with the lowest possible budget which means that I am not even using a game engine. I am using my own custom renderer for OpenGL. It uses triple buffering and runs very smoothly.Rewards:Here are the $25+ Amoeblobs supporter T-shirts.The deck of cards for the $50 reward will have the logo design on the back the cards. As for the in-game money, I am not sure how much since I do not know how much things will cost. Even if I gave you a number, it would be completely arbitrary and you would have no idea what purchasing power it would have.Your Support: Even if you can't support me financially, please join the community I am creating.Email: solaryclipse@gmail.comVideo Song: The background song in the video is Rye by Eric Lam | Facebook | Soundcloud","Like any project from a single developer, I may run into setbacks on the deadlines that I set.

With years of Android development experience leading back to Android 4.0, I've become well adept to making clean interfaces that offer good functionality while not cluttering the screen and increasing the app size. Here are some proof of concept screens that I have been designing.Details:It's going to be material designed with only the essential functionality for an app of this kind. My plan is to either make it completely free or ad-supported with a $1 option to remove ads depending on how much traction this project gets. I'm not going to sell user data or even collect it. It will be a completely offline app (besides potential ads).Why doesn't this exist yet? I have no idea but please help me make it exist.",My main risk is running out of time to do side projects like this.

I have already arranged the first print run of three hundred copies, with a total price tag of 600 for saddle-stitched books. I have a designer in mind at a cost of about 1000 dollars, and another 1000 for page-lay out and editing. With rewards, shipping, and any hidden fees (and there are always hidden fees) and a book price of 10 dollars, the aim here is to just break even and then use the recouped money to print more books and keep it in print for a while. If I get the required backing by end of August it should take about two months to pull all the pieces together and get a final product, meaning a printed book in your hand plus reward (s) by November. If you back the project I will maintain a Mailchimp list to keep you up-to-date on the progress of production, reviews, reception, copies sold, financial statements, etc after the fact. You will also be included in the acknowledgements. The introduction of the book will contain a brief summary of the Kickstarter concept, and an essay on posthumanism, new forms of publishing in the digital age, and the fall of the age of enlightenment. Since this description lays out timelines for the book the video is simply a reading of the title poem from the collection--Human Trafficking.Praise for Darren Greer[Greer's writing] is in a category of its own; if any school for it exists, it's the school of its own daring and invention.""---Andrew Lewis Conn, author of P: A Novel“[Greer} champions the idea that even the most fragmented life can be healed if one has the courage to face one’s deceptions.”---A Certain Bent Appeal""A writer of extraordinary sensitivity.”---Quill and Quire“Greer's observations are indeed sharp, his narrative voice infectious. He is adept at making the painful truths of life funny.”---The Globe and Mail“A rare writing talent.”---SaskatoonStar-Phoenix“[Greer] writes passionately about people, characters that are just too real, too believable. [He] is one of the emerging literary voices from Down East.”---The Owen Sound Sun-Times""If writing is theft, then Darren Greer is a master criminal.""--Halifax Daily News","I have been involved with publishing most of my adult life, so I know that, once the money is place, the biggest issue will be distribution. Is there enough interest in the book to get it into bookstores? Large chains do not stock books like this, so the focus will be on small independents. And yet I have enough presence there to ensure many of those will carry it.  If I have trouble getting it internationally distributed I will contact the independents myself and ship it to them, as well make it available online both in print and e-format. This will add costs to the project, which I will assume myself, and try to make back on the next print run, where the costs will be lower as the design and editing will have already have been done. I think the other barrier is that is just difficult to get people excited about poetry these days, even if it is unorthodox, as these poems are. At least, backing these poems, you can be certain they will have shelf-life and exposure, as I have yet to have single book go out of print. There are many worthy projects on here.

The goal is to raise $3000.00, which will pay for rewards, external editing and book design, and the printing of 200 hundred copies for a limited edition print run. I will use venues where I read from my novels to promote the book, and will have a launch in my home city which will be broadcast on the Internet for donors to participate.I'll set a low cover price of $10.00, which is enough if it sells through to reprint.","The poems are already written, and only to see print form (after professional editing). Once the money is raised, the editing, design and print process will take two months, with rewards out by the end of February.

It's too bad because its a really cool sim. It teaches how to adjust to small spaces, interfaces with modern technology like that used in a craft, and helps us understandand deal with failuresthat can take place during a flight. So, since we already have it, spent about 30K to build it, and its got lots of life remaining we decided to upgrade the electronics and monitors and take it on the road. With your help, we can polish it up, add the new techy stuff and take it to schools so kids can climb in, learn about technology and have some fun. The best part is...it won't cost the kids at the schools a dime!People here at Spaceport are volunteering their time to install the new equipment. Just imagine the look on the faces of a class room full of kids when they see us pull up.They'll freak when they find out they get to play in a space craft sim and learn about space flight and science!We're asking for your help to put together the equipment we need to upgrade the capsule and get it ready for the kids, and dedicate a trailer that can be used soley for the capsule.We aresupplying the capsule, scheduling support and transportation crew. Pretty straight forward. Once we have the funding, it will take about 60 days to upgrade the sim. What does the upgrade mean? Well. The interior has been gutted to remove all the old monitors and switches. We'll be adding a large touch screen monitor to the front viewing area of the capsule. The new seat will incorporate more interactive capability as well. This helps reduce movement in the capsule when it comes to the simple functions like thruster changes, comm links switching etc. We will also upgrade the lighting system so that the pilot can switch lighting conditions in the capsule. We will upgrade the sound system inside and add new software to provide even more realistic simulation of movement inside and outside the capsule.There will be hundreds (if not thousands) of kids who will interact with the sim over the next year.Why do wethinkso many kids will interact with it? When this capsule was in use the lines for it were huge. We had it at the Indiana State Fair in 2009 and ran about 200K people through it. So it's a rugged beast! Recently, we've been planting the seed with schools and the response has been awesome. We already see lots of kids with our programs so adding thecapsule will be over the top. We couldn't do it without you. The capsule has been officially retired so there was no budget to re-build it for this kind of use. Now we can with you as a partner. We'll have fun doing it and it will be a great opprtunity for the kids. ","It's a pretty straight forward project. The only delay we really see is ordering the equipment and finding something out of stock and back ordered.

What is a BalloonSat? A BalloonSat is a high altitude balloon that carries a payload to the edge of space. A place where only 1% of the Earth's atmosphere still exists. Where you can experience 99% of what space would be like. Aflight that helps students understand radiation, microgravity, radio frequency, tracking and more.We have done over 300 of these BalloonSats over the last 6 years. Many schoolsinvite us to launch and have a great time working with our team. Sadly, there are a number of schools that do not have the funds for the program. It's a great STEM project and the students have launched everything from Angry Birds™ to Moon Pies™. They also fly biological, chemical and electronic experiments. We spend a lot of time with students and teach them about the harshness of space and preparing a payload for the journey. Launching a rockoon takes more time and includes stabilizing the platform, the dereeling of vehicle and separation. Then its on to tracking and recovery. The process is complex but a great experiment for students and they learn a lot about many aspects of launch control, flight planning, mission execution, recovery and much more.Therockoons are very cool. Students learn to work in teams, take on roles and responsibilities and learn to be accountable. The attention to detail can mean success or failure. We show students how to integrate different technologies, do predictive models and track the payload during flight. We do these projects with middle schools, high schools and colleges.Your support will pay for all the materials to do the launches and release a rocket from the balloon at altitude. That altitude could be as high as 120K feet AGL. Below is one of our launches of a lifting body UAV. We use RF (radio frequency) to release the payload at altitude and then small transponders and trackers to follow its flight back to Earth. Start to finish it's a great project for STEM education!We will select schools to work with based on a call for papers. Once we identify the schools we'll begin working with Educators to work the programs into the academic year. Educators will work as partners with us as a way to help teach them about the possibilities of space exploration in the class room. We can do flights in Indiana, Michigan, Ohio and Illinois. So, If someone feels generous and wants to fund the entire project, we can do it in your state. The entire process will be documented and each school will get a video of their project to keep along with other artifacts from the flight.Materials include:Helium or Hydrogen, tracker, payload box, cameras, GPS, balloon (600g), parachute, recovery team. Thanks for checking out our project!","We've done many of these and things sometimes go wrong. Once we have taught the students about the process, they do a great job. Failures can take place during inflation with a faulty balloon, trackers can fail in flight, land in a tree, etc. But, 95% of our flights do just fine. We did have a horse try to eat a payload once. We convinced him to let go! We have two campaigns going right now and have assigned enough folks to handle the projects and fulfillment. If you have any questions please feel free to ask."
https://www.kickstarter.com/projects/artedei/artedei-sightseeing-on-canvas?ref=discovery_category_newest,artedei/artedei-sightseeing-on-canvas,"Paintings of cities and places that you like. Pictures of sightseeing hotspots and places in painting style on canvas, acrylic glass or posters. As a gift for friends or as a memento of your vacation in the form of a painting for you at home.ArteDei sees itself as a modern interpreter of culture, art and design. ArteDei is a company from Vienna / Austria - one of the largest cultural capitals in Europe. ArteDei offers affordable art in the form of art prints with themes that appeal to tourists. The motifs coincide with the areas of interest of the founders of ArteDei and represent an ever-growing gallery of works of art. ArteDei would like to convert photo motifs into paintings for its customers, which should always keep the customer in mind. The customer has the choice of having works of art produced on different carrier materials (we initially offer canvas, acrylic glass and posters (paper roll)). The works are priced between EUR 30 and EUR 900. The right format is available for every taste, every application and every budget. Of course, the works meet the current highest standards in terms of quality, design, color fastness, durability and robustness. The art print also makes it possible to respond flexibly to customer requirements in terms of size and coordination with spatial surroundings.ArteDei offers - compared to competitors offers - really new, individual art on a main topic (city tourism). In contrast to photo pages, ArteDei offers photos that have been artistically post-processed and represent a total work of art. The images are strongly related to tourism and cover the broad field of city tourism.Our target market is the city tourism market. Austria alone is visited by around 20 million citiytourists every year. We estimate the market at around 500 - 1,000 million tourists worldwide. We are starting with a small selection of cities (Vienna, Paris, Rome, Berlin) and are expanding our range of options. Each city has its own target audience segment (e.g. Vienna is mainly visited by German, Italian, American, Russian and Chinese tourists). Therefore, a separate marketing strategy must be created for each city offered.Marketing is initially carried out through advertising and blog posts in social media. Attempts are also being made to position the brand via influencers in the hotels / travel sector and by providing traveling plans as content marketing in a blog. Also ads on major airports (where every 2nd citytourist lands) are considered. Later we´ll turn to place advertisements in large travel magazines (e.g. Conde Nast) and in travel search engines.We produce the content ourselves and we hire artist friends. We have the products printed by external partners and delivered by white label. The products cost us about 33% of the retail price. incl. taxes, production costs, return costs, shipping etc. remain between 10 and 40% contribution margin depending on the product type. The logistics are supervised by us using digital tools, but are physically completely outsourced and are already factored into the prices.Since the citytourism market is very large, we think we have a good chance of gaining a foothold. We start with a small group of cities and want to address the relevant target group there. We expect 200 - 1,000 works to be sold in the first 12 months. Once this step has been overcome, the marketing and the cities offered would be further expanded. The next milestone would then be to sell 200 images / month. With the appropriate matrix establishment, there is nothing to prevent a value of 200-1,000 images / day in the foreseeable future. The target margin per image is EUR 15 - EUR 500 (we calculate EUR 200 on average).My wife and I have been interested in art, architecture and design since we met. In her free time my wife likes to paint (abstract) and I have already organized several exhibitions for her. My wife also sells her pictures through her own internet shop. Another of our hobbies is traveling and photography. My passion is among other things architectural highlights, but also special vehicles and vehicle design. I pursue both on our regular city trips. I mostly photograph urban and architectural highlights, objects with interesting designs and beautiful cars that line my path.At one of my wife's exhibitions, I presented artistically post-processed pictures and they were very well received by the audience. That was the trigger that I decided to make these pictures accessible to a wider audience together with the pictures of my wife. That was the hour of birth of ArteDei. We want to offer our audience affordable art with the flexibility of different size formats and carrier materials.","We think that there is a very large potential sales market in the city tourism market.

Help get it off the ground by pitching in for our first productionSLEEPING HANDSOME by D.M. LarsonSleeping Handsome is a witty multi-act play that takes a peasant heroine on an adventure to rescue a sleeping prince from a spell, all while dodging the spell-caster, and the prince’s very protective mother.Auditions will be held in mid-January 2012, with the production being in late May or early June. The hope is to involve the community in supporting and producing the play- through donations of time, energy, materials & space.The money raised here through Kickstarter will go towards core expenses, like sets, costumes and advertising. The focus is to bring the kids the experience of acting, and put on a spectacular show, even on a smaller budget. I want to especially thank Mr. Larson, and his website freedrama.net for giving the thumbs up for not only the production of the play, but some snazzy incentives for Kickstarter pledges as well!Thank you all for visiting, swing by the baby Mountlake Terrace Children's Theatre website, and I'll keep everyone updated and in the loop!",,https://www.kickstarter.com/projects/74172844/make-100-nebula-necklaces?ref=discovery_category_newest,74172844/make-100-nebula-necklaces,"I make Stuff as a hobby.

So here I am!The ""Make 100 Nebula Necklace"" will be limited to 100 signed and numbered copies, each will be completely individual and unique, with a special ""Kickstarter Green"" element included somewhere in the design; could be beads, could be a gas cloud...who knows!Nebula Necklacesare made from assorted beads, crystal, chain, and other jewelry bits, with a lobster clasp. They run approximately 20-22in long, and the nebula disk is 1.5-2 inches in diameter, made of hand painted polymer clay.Shipping will be USPS Priority Mail to USA addresses only, and shipping is included in the pledge amount. Sorry international peeps, I love you, but shipping cross borders is $$$.The total campaign goal reflects materials, packaging, shipping & fees.","The bulk of this project will be combobulating all the materials, making the necklaces, and shipping them.

The vintage photos that i have been collecting range from the 30s to the early 90s. The whole concept is that im taking my portraits and putting them into a surreal situation that never existed. Im taking the past and re-imagining it, taking two total different situations and making it one.Now that this project is coming to completion I decided to make a book of all the images so that I can share with everyone my vision of past meets present. Currently in the works with a book printer to turn the imagery into a hardcover book. With everyones help we can turn this book into reality. A lot of great friends have put in time with me as well to get to this point and we all would love to see everything come together.We created some really fun rewards besides the book so that everyone can have a little piece of the torn. project. There are stickers, a really cool patch custom made for the book, prints, postcards and a shoot with me for custom collages featuring you! If this project exceeds the funds we want to definitely add more rewards to really thank everyone for their contribution.After the book is all set and ready to ship we also want to have a release party and pop-up gallery showing of the images so everyone can take a big look at the collages from the book. This event will be set in NYC and hopefully with enough buzz we can travel and take a selected showing over to LA!",The hardest challenge that we may face is staying on our timeline with everything. we have been working on this project in all of our spare time and we really want everything to go as smoothly as possible.

Ive really enjoyed painting others and really appreciate them giving up all inhibitions by letting me paint their clown on them without them getting to see what their clown was before id photograph them, allowing me to photograph contradictions in emotions that are painted on their face and actual portrayals of emotions on the faces.The project will wrap November 1, 2019 and I would love to create a book to show a bunch of my clowns that have not been seen yet. All the new clowns in the book will be me but shot though another photographers eye.

A lot of the funding is going to the printing of the book which is being self-published. I have been working really hard on all of the clowning and it has been pretty expensive to get through. Just makeup for the clowning has become super expensive. In completing this project am having another photog shooting all of it for me.

The house fits on a boat trailer, has a queen-size bed, solar power, bathroom, shower, wood-burning stove and a water collection setup.It is designed to be completely off-the-grid. But modern enough to suit anyone.ADDITIONAL INFORMATION:Recycling:The main proponent, in terms of the recycled materials are construction oriented, the 4x2 used to create the frame, the doors, the windows. They will been taken from demolitions, renovations and spares from other jobs. Because of my Dad and our history in construction, I have the details of several 'recycling centres' - it means a small discount, otherwise available to everyone. But mostly, fixing a wood burning stove that has been sitting outside, and is on eBay for $100, getting some old batteries from a local mechanic, and most valuable: offcuts from glaziers, offcuts from lumber yards etc.Waste:Waste water, or white water, is filtered for solids and used for gardening... It's rain water anyway, so the waste would only be associated with soaps or detergents (both which can be eco friendly). The toilet is of a composting design, separating water and solids also, but allowing for the ""compost"" to be used for gardening if you were truly off grid, and the by-product (liquid) used for balancing of soil pH with the combination of ash from the stove: (crude ammonia nitrate), otherwise you could have it processed (personal preference)","The big challenge is weather, like any construction project, heavy rain will play havoc with building work.Myself, and my family having been building things for many years, from houses to boats, and everything in between.With your help, this project should present no significant challenge.And you are welcome to pop in for a cup of tea and see how it's going - rain or shine.",https://www.kickstarter.com/projects/555265912/escape-3?ref=discovery_category_newest,555265912/escape-3,"As you can see from the storyboard I knocked up, it's a short film about imagination despite your surroundings.The story of a man, longing for change, and oblivious to that feeling being mutual among his neighbours.Essentially, the only thing that needs to be funded is the video equipment hire... A hefty price tag I know...Luckily, I have a decent editing platform, and will be able to complete all post production without charge.The film will be a good social commentary on a world seemingly lost, with everybody fighting for positions they hate.Depending on whether Tropfest goes ahead for this next season, I will enter it. (the timing appears to work well)Also - just for the film buffs: the strange shots with the background appearing and changing are green screen aided, and the bagel being cut/tea being stirred, are utensils in first person. (Think: GoPro strapped to a breadknife)","Filming is always a challenging process, however I am surrounded by creative people and have a degree majoring in Film Production.You would have noticed, the semi-animated shots in the storyboard, with near impossible filming techniques: The camera moving with the clock hands, the record, etc... I have already trialled a rig to film these sequences, and they no longer pose any concern.Once again, filming is dictated by the conditions on the day, but the length of the film will hopefully combat this.Post production will be the most time consuming aspect, it is however the most interesting part."

https://www.kickstarter.com/projects/482320617/answers-for-jessica?ref=discovery_category_newest,482320617/answers-for-jessica,"On Sunday, October 4, 1998, a former classmate of mine, Jessica Elice Edwards, was murdered. Her naked body was discovered in a ditch the following day. She was unique to me in that she was the first girl to ever dance with me to a slow song at a school dance. We attended the same middle school, F. K. White, but went our separate ways for high school. Little did I know I would never see her again. She was 14. Her accused murderer was 16 year old Walter West. We had all attended F.K. White at the same time. He’s ineligible for parole until 2027. As I searched her name on the internet, I became very saddened by the fact that the only information on Jessica is her obituary. There is not one picture of her, merely a low resolution still of her gravestone. My sadness immediately turned to disgust when I discovered Walter has a prison blog. He never once mentions Jessica or even warns young, black males about his troubled life and how easily anger can turn to violence. It made me wonder what his true intentions were with this blog. There was even a chapter about making love to a woman, a disgusting entry considering he’s in there for rape and murder. By all accounts, I really hate this man. But, the reality is he was a kid when he got locked up and he’ll be an old man when and if he gets out. It has been over 20 years and I am still no closer to understanding why her life ended so abruptly. I knew the only way I would ever get answers for Jessica would be to visit him in prison and ask. He comes across on his blog as a born-again Christian, another redemptional success story. He might grant me an interview, but would his tone shift once I mentioned Jessica and the middle school we all attended together? I want to open a yearbook, show him his photo, how he looked before he committed this horrible crime. Next, I want to show him my photo from the same publication. More importantly, I want to see his face when I flip to the photograph of Jessica that was plastered all over KPLC (local news) in the days that followed her passing. I want to know why he did it, even if what he tells me is a lie and manipulation; the same type of con that possibly got that girl killed. No matter what, the world needs to hear her story. And I know I am the only one who will tell it.","I am asking very little for this documentary. Just enough to stay in Lake Charles one month to gather data and interview the people involved. Once the footage is shot and information is gathered, I'll return to Los Angeles and edit the documentary as I work my day job.",https://www.kickstarter.com/projects/482320617/like-michael-a-documentary?ref=discovery_category_newest,482320617/like-michael-a-documentary,"42 years ago, John Carpenter made a small independant film called ""Halloween."" No one involved expected the movie to do well only for the it to become one of the most successful indie films of all time. Shot mostly in South Pasadena, fans from all over the world flock there each Halloween to pay respect and homage to the now classic horror film. Some even dressed as Micheal Myers. Shot anamorphically in the style of Halloween, with rich saturated colors during the day and blue lighting at night.","Filmed over the course of Halloween Day and Night from 9 am to 7pm (or until I run  out of battery) in South Pasadena. Other pickups will be filmed in Hollywood (Orange Grove Ave) and Burbank (by Walt Disney Studios) where some of the film was also shot but stylistically resembling the original film to great detail. I  need an assistant to help with interviewing and lighting, preferably (but not required) someone with a car. Only I will be responsible for filming as the borrowed lens will be too expensive to trust anyone else with it. Also I need to make sure all shots are in focus. When that person picks me up, we'll dicuss the project on camera with a Go Pro attached to the outside hood of the car. We'll smoke a joint on our way to South Pasadena, much like Annie and Lauria did on their way to their babysitting gig in the movie. There's a coffee shop right across the street from the Myer's house and we need to have plenty of battery so the plan is to tip them 20 dollars so we can leave our batteries there charging throughout the day, have our morning meeting here, and being sure to retreive the batteries before they close. The only other option is to drop 200 dollars on a non-gaspowered generator.  Last year, I was able to interview the owner of the house on Oxley Ave that Laurie lived in the movie. The SD card malfunctioned and the footage is forever gone so I'm fairly confident I can get the interview again. The woman who lives there is very nice and embraces her home being in this horror film. I will be there for a considerable part of the day to interview people, especially the ones dressed as Michael Myers. (There will be several)Behind the Myers house, there is a Halloween Museum. Last year, they were kinda weird about me filming. They insisted I hashtagged their location in my vlog, which was strange considering I paid for admission just like everybody else. Filming at the school will be tricky, but I'm not that worried, as the school location is the least interesting part, as it looks so different now from how it did in the movie. The fact there are hundreds of minors there, I expect a little bit of resistance, but I can always steal the shots and leave before I get into any trouble."

We need £10K GBP to get started in delivering our franchise concept, creating wonderful stylish italian coffee shops dotted around London - can you help us get started ? ;)Added to this, we will also have an online store at Tramoni.com which will sell Tramoni branded coffee cups, coffee related items and fresh coffee in sealed bags for people to drink at home. There will also be an online coffee blog on our website which will serve as an online marketing tool providing a strong structure and backbone to support the 5 initial participating coffee shops with a strong visual online presence to help with marketing effortsOur stylish franchise model will be developed to build up the Tramoni brand as everybody's 'favourite little italian place' they go to for their coffee break.

Secondly by helping the rural coffee farm in costa rica, as we'd be buying the beans at a 'fair trade' price, and as the rural coffee farm will also be roasting the coffee beans there on-site, it will also guarantee the rural coffee farm the ability to employ local plantation workers, paying them a decent wage.Please pledge what you can, and see what rewards are on offer as per the amount you can give.

But from our research we find that coffee lovers wouldnt mind waiting 10 days if they get superbe coffee at the end of it."

For any questions contact feel free to contact here on kickstarter or via email: ms@xufoy.deThe hole Project is a yet small but innovative one. The Designs and Ideas come from Malte Seidler (Kiel, Germany), the production is happen in Dresden, Germany in the professional injection moulding factory of Max Stauß. The Name XUFOY (Xtraordinary Unfolding Forms Of timeless utilitY) stands for plectrum design on a new and high level and for high quality production. It started 2010 with the Idea to produce Plectrums for Bass players. The Result was the ""XUFOY dob"" Plectrum. Based on this Design we developed and produced the ""nap"" and the ""pyk"", some very massive but versatile Plectrums for guitarists who need harder Picks.Now we decided to change the art of Plectrum Design in a radical way. Users of flexible Plectrums now, that there are annoying Noises (""flap flap"") when you use conventional flat and flexible picks. With the patented noiseless Concept we are able to design and produce flexible plectrums without there noises. The ""XUFOY puur light"", a very flexible one, was the first Plectrum with this new concept. And it works. The ""XUFOY Rost"", a medium flexible one, shall be the second one. Notice: The Production of these sorts of plectrums costs a little money. If you support this Kickstarter project, you help to revolutionize the market for guitar plectrums and you get a few very innovative and high quality plectrums. The new XUFOY Rost Plectrum (above you see a 3D-CAD-visualisation) will set a new standard in plectrums, especially for acoustic guitars. Its flexibility will be comparable to conventional 0.6 to 0.9 (depends on the material) Plectrums. But unlike conventional flexible and flat picks it produces no unwanted (""flap flap"") pick noises. The gryd-like and patented design let here you only the guitar, not the plectrum. This is especially usefull for Recordings and Playing the Acoustic Guitar. The organic design and the polyamid material gives the plectrum a long live and protection against breaking. The grip is of course (gryd like structure) very good. It is a little larger, so you can raise the flexibility (hold at the end) when you want just play some strumming accords! For solo Playing just change the holding (more at the top). The tip is a little sharp, for a clear tone. But notice: You need not to change your playing style. This Plectrum just works as any other medium-flexible pick on the market. But it is the only medium-flexible pick worldwide which prevent typical pick-noises (""flap-Flap"").The XUFOY Rouble(above you see a 3D-CAD-visualisation)is a doubled Rost Plectrum, which will be a little harder and louder and more expressive, with increased attack, than the single Rost.The XUFOY Rosteel (above you see a 3D-CAD-visualisation)is an exclusive gift for ""big spenders""! It will be produced from stainless steel. There are no prototypes so far. This product will be produced not like the other XUFOY Plectrums. It will be CNC fine cutted from 1mm stainless steel and rounded with several industrial methods. So, this is also a project we can only realise if somebody pays for it. This plectrum will be not very flexible… It will sound very direct and clear, especially usefull on flatwound strings... But it will be a very longlasting plectrum of course!","This is a complete new product. There are a few prototypes (see in the video), but the end result will be only visible if we have enough money for the real production. It is, for example, still unclear if the XUFOY Rost plectrum will play rather like a 0.7 or 0.8 mm conventional Plectrum. The only way to test it, is to produce it professional. And therefor we need the money. But you can be sure, all persons who works on the product know what they are doing. Look at the Website and you will see that we keep what we promise."

This is important because I expect to get results from my products being on HSN, Evine and other outlets. I will also be able to hire an accountant to handle all the budget as well as a marketing expert to make sure that I continue to make the best decisions for my company."

This would include articles aimed at creating understanding and acceptance among those who know someone with ADHD, as well as ones that encourage those who may have it to seek a proper diagnosis, and arm them with the knowledge they need to get ahead in the workplace. (As of April 22, 2015, a rough draft of the first article is nearly completed, which focuses on the potential risks of 'going public' in the office with one's diagnosis, and strategies for seeking accomodations from an employer while being discreet about the condition.)At the same time, I will also be exploring the career implications of other adult learning disabilities, particularly where the overall themes overlap with ADHD.Your funding will pay my living and family expenses for 2 or 3 months and thus allow me to devote my energy and attention to this project on a full-time basis.","The main risks of this project is in the acceptance or rejection of the articles from propsective publications. This risk will be mitigated by proper research of these publications (i.e. knowing their respective audiences, and being well-versed in their submission procedures) and tailoring submissions to their editorial needs.",https://www.kickstarter.com/projects/1816073836/the-socioeconomics-of-capital-punishment?ref=discovery_category_newest,1816073836/the-socioeconomics-of-capital-punishment,"This project will be comprised of a series of freelance journalism articles on the topic of capital punishment submitted primarily to general interest magazines and newspapers, as well as online and niche publications.The articles will explore the economic, political and cultural aspects of state execution, and will seek to determine why capital punishment persists in some U.S. states despite some statistical evidence that it does not serve as a deterrent, reflects a very strong anti-black racial bias, and may not provide the sense of closure and justice that proponents would have you believe. Conversely, I will also probe the correlation in many U.S. states between the existence of the death penalty and a tendency towards lower educational funding.As for research, I will draw on available academic studies, news articles and other print sources, and will conduct interviews with people from all sides of the issue, including politicians, academics, activists and relatives of both victims and the accused.The articles to be produced would include (but not necessarily be limited to):I should note here that I am aware of my own bias against capital punishment, and because of that will take extra care to fully examine and consider views and evidence that may conflict with my own views, and treat all sources with the utmost respect.The funds for this project will go towards covering my basic living and family expenses so that I may devote my energy and attention to it on a fulltime basis.","The main risks of this project is in the acceptance or rejection of the articles from propsective publications.

https://www.kickstarter.com/projects/hannahneedham/wonk-a-teen-science-magazine?ref=discovery_category_newest,hannahneedham/wonk-a-teen-science-magazine,"This project is one that I feel very passionately about and believe that it is completely unique and effective in the way that it approached science. Often teen girls who show an interest in science don't have ways of nurturing their passion outside of school and can sometimes be put off pursuing a career in STEM due to feeling as if they will be stereotyped.Wonk! bridges the gap between science and everyday life, linking it to popular teen subjects like fashion, beauty, celebrities, etc. This way, teens interested in science can learn about outside of the classroom while staying in the loop with trends and gossip.Our hope is that those who may not enjoy science at school will also read Wonk! for the popular culture content and learn snippets of science along the way. They may even unlock a love for STEM that they previously didn't know existed.This quarterly magazine will be one that teens and parents will both love to read. To make it more accessible to more young girls, the digital issue is free to access, so money is no object for the brains of the future.","With so many alternative teen magazines being published, standing out and encouraging teens to switch from the magazines they know and love can be challenging. But this is addressed by the fact that, unlike other teen magazines, we are a publication that parents and teachers will actually encourage their children to read.Another challenge for us, being a startup, is having the funding to continue to produce regular, accurate content, as well as keeping up with the printing of physical copies and advertising.",https://www.kickstarter.com/projects/hannahneedham/wonk-a-fashionable-teen-science-magazine?ref=discovery_category_newest,hannahneedham/wonk-a-fashionable-teen-science-magazine,"This innovative new teen science magazine aims to make science more relatable to teens aged 13-17 years. Wonk! focuses on finding links in science to popular teen subjects such as fashion, beauty and pop culture. The outcome is a magazine that both parents and their teenagers love.An Option for Tech Whizzes and Old SoulsWonk! is available as a printed magazine as well as a FREE downloadable PDF. This caters for teens who are glued to the computer screen, as well as those who still love to have a magazine in their hands. We want to keep the digital magazine free to reach as many curious teens as possible, so that money is never a boundary.Each seasonal magazine is jam-packed with exciting science research, fashion trends, DIY projects and career options. The key to the articles is that they begin with a relatable teen topic and seamlessly lead into a sneaky science lesson. We hate stereotypes and are on a mission to build a bridge between the girly teen world and science.Aimed at teens, loved by allDespite being aimed at a teenage audience, the easy-going nature of the articles make it a hit with non-scientist adults too. We are inundated with messages from parents and teachers who have signed up for their child or student and have ended up spending hours absorbed in reading it themselves. It becomes a topic of conversation for teens and their parents.Take RequestsOur audience is so important to us and we really try to capture their interest in each issue. For this reason, we actively accept article requests for our readers burning questions and what they'd like to see featured in the next issue. Our readers really are the driving force of the content and always will be.Nurturing Young MindsWe love it when our readers show an interest in science communication and love to give them an opportunity to have their say. If a reader reaches out to say they would like to try their hand at writing an article, we will always help them find a topic that interests them and guide them through the writing and editing process, before publishing their final piece. This gives them an important experience and helps to build up a portfolio for their future.Please help us achieve our goals and continue to grow Wonk!, while keeping the digital issues freely accessible to curious teens from all backgrounds. Get sharing with your family, friends and colleagues to play a part in the growth of the next generation of scientists.","Following the success of our digital issues, we have an increasing demand for printed copies. In order to fund the printing, postage and admin at this stage, every penny is hugely important to us. As an extremely small team, we are working so hard to inspire young adults with an interest in science. Keeping the business afloat in these early stages is so important to us. We are very dedicated to the publication of Wonk! and to keeping regular blog posts being published on our website."

I'm Matt Harding, a photographer and journalist from Detroit, Michigan. I am currently working as a do-it-all reporter at the Mackinac Island Town Crier, a weekly community newspaper.For this project, I plan on living on the road for about a year (roughly September 2015 to September 2016), telling stories by photographing the great American West and the travelers who exemplify its spirit. Take a look at my photo blog for more of my work, or this more concise portfolio to get an idea of what to expect.I will be living out of my car with little more than my bicycle and a tent, traveling through Washington, Oregon, California, Nevada, New Mexico, Arizona, Utah, Colorado, Wyoming, Montana and Idaho ― collectively, the American West.In my travels, places in the American West have stood out to me as some of the most beautiful in the country. This photo project is about telling stories about traveling, road-tripping and bicycling in the West through mostly photographs, but also many short anecdotes and long stories. I know I'm not the only traveler who loves our western states!Ultimately, my travels will result in an e-book of about 200 pages (probably more!). I will be interviewing touring bicyclists, RV families, boat-dwellers, tent-pitchers and anyone willing to talk about their journeys through the West. And the book will also be a story of my own travels.I plan on driving about 20,000 miles and biking about 5,000 miles over the course of the year. Included in the e-book will be a comprehensive guide of my motorized and human-powered routes, which should give a complete sense of the journey.By car and bike, I will traverse through all terrains (mountains, valleys, prairies and city streets, and anything else you can think of). I'll be traveling through the most populous cities, and the most desolate back roads.On my bicycle, I'll mostly be doing day trips, but will likely have more than a few multi-day treks. I am working to find more loops (since I have to get back to my car), but I'll also have back-and-forth rides, which will account for the lengthier trips.I don't have a set-in-stone itinerary, but I plan on spending significant time at national and state parks, back-road campgrounds and tiny towns that dot the West. I also plan on spending close to equal time in each state.The Cost:When you contribute to this project, I want you to know exactly what you're paying for. For the last 3+ years, I have been a full-time student, oftentimes working two jobs at a time. I know what it's like to work hard, and don't want to take any money I don't need. This means my final goal of $5,000 accounts for the essentials only, namely gasoline for my car. I will only complete the project if my $5,000 goal is met. Anything less, and I wouldn't be able to travel extensively in all 11 states, which compromises the intent of the project.To make this project financially viable, I need to be able to live on the road for a year. I have about $5,000 saved for this project. This will pay for my food and general living expenses (~$3,500) and unforeseen additional expenses (new bicycle tires, etc.). So no need for you to worry about that. Also, I just got a deal on a new touring/commuter bicycle (my very first new bike!!) for the trip. I am insanely excited to get riding out West! The photo atop this project is me with that beautiful bicycle on Mackinac Island, where I'll be spending this summer.The biggest cost of this project is gasoline for my vehicle. I've approximated the maximum total driving distance to be 20,000 miles over the course of the year. Fuel, at an average of $3.25/gallon, will cost about $3,600. To ensure a successful trip, I've set the necessary monetary amount at $4,000. This is one of those things I just cannot be under budget with, so I've overestimated the cost. But, if gas prices start to exceed the budget, I'll simply spend more time on the bicycle.The other $1,000 is for miscellaneous things like a National Park Pass ($80), fees for campgrounds, etc. I will be sticking to free camping a lot of the time, but national parks usually require additional camping fees, which add up quickly. This $1,000 will also cover the Kickstarter and Amazon fees ($500) for helping me reach you!100 percent of your money will go to bettering this project and making great rewards.The Rewards:Every person at every price point will get a great reward (or rewards!) in return for their contribution. I am passionate about what I do and strive to produce high quality work. Prints and canvases will be printed with AdoramaPix. The print magazine ($100 perk) and the e-book will be created through Blurb.The e-book will be $10 for you and $15 after the campaign. There are lots of great rewards at higher price points such as the prints and canvases. But why have a project where the main result is not affordable for everyone? That's why I chose an electronic book format instead of a print book I'd have to charge an arm and a leg for in order to not go broke. And it's why I decided to include a magazine at $100. They're much cheaper for me to produce, but still really cool to have.Please contact me with any questions you have about the project. I'm almost always available.Note: the rewards may be delivered earlier than the projected delivery date. I will be in continuous contact with my Kickstarter supporters throughout the project.It is at this point where I could type ""thank you"" until my fingers bleed. I appreciate everyone who pledges at every level. And if you can't contribute, please share this campaign.Thank you!","#1: My car could break down. While I don't think this will be an issue, I would do anything to see this project succeed. Therefore, in the event that I am left without a car, I will finish the project on my bicycle. Of course, this is not ideal. It would take longer, and I'd not get to go to as many places. But I am committed to telling stories from the road, however it happens.",https://www.kickstarter.com/projects/mattharding313/where-do-you-think-youre-going?ref=discovery_category_newest,mattharding313/where-do-you-think-youre-going,"Whether on the open road, or in the skies above, the art of travel has always inspired me.THE FREEDOM PROJECT is my response to the question ""Where do you think you're going?"" It's my response to all of the people who discourage travel. Mostly, it's a response to those who elicit fear to discourage travel.Many of the photos in this collection will come from my archive of travel images, which includes areas around the U.S., Costa Rica and parts of Europe.The final batch will come from a week-long road trip in Arizona, Nevada and California planned for early or mid-March.The trip will begin in Yuma, Arizona, and go roughly as follows: Grand Canyon National Park > Las Vegas > Death Valley National Park > Sequoia National Forest > Los Padres National Forest > Los Angeles > Joshua Tree National Park > Salton Sea > Algodones Dunes > Yuma.While all of the images elicit a sense of freedom, the road trip set will focus on the open road and the physical act of travel.THE FREEDOM PROJECT will consist of a 40-page book (printed by Blurb), a short film, and printed images (printed by Clark Color). I'll be shooting still images during the road trip, but a large part of it will also be devoted to producing the short film.The main cost for this project is the Nikon 14-24mm f/2.8G lensthat I need to get it done, to be able to capture the wide open spaces and places I'll be traveling through.The rest of the funds will go toward printing the rewards.I'll also be upgrading, with my own money, from the Nikon D7100 to the Nikon D750. Anything above the $3,000 will go toward that costly purchase!Below are a few examples of the images that will likely be included in the book. What's cool about this project from a rewards standpoint is that you'll also be able to receive images that are not included in the final book.If you've made it this far, please consider pledging! Thank you, and happy travels! Feel free to message me with any questions.","Aside from unforeseen car troubles, or more serious issues, I don't anticipate anything that could keep this project from meeting its goals in the timeframe I've set."

I've been there.....!"" recounts Tim Ehmann.“But that was only the beginning….”Rocker Tim Ehmann says he's been personally called to create and release a new, original sound in what he calls, ""Inspired Message Music.""A form of divinely inspired songs with lyrics he says comes to him spontaneously from God. Most often— not until he steps up to the mike!Tim explains he hears the voice of God with uncanny clarity and simply repeats whatever God is saying through his music to his particular audience at the time. He’s also an artist that speaks intentionally to those in all too familiar mindsets and circumstances of life that he came from. Though with a powerful, positive, message set to heart pounding, foot stomping, alternative Rock n’ Roll—and all in an environment of abandoned fun.“My specific calling is to the world, rather than exclusively to the church”says Tim.“God made that abundantly clear to me one day on a visit to heaven,”he explains, where he says he sees, walks and talks with the Lord, Jesus Christ Himself often.“This is a John 3:16, “for God so loved the WORLD…” commissioned mission as defined expressly to me by the Lord. His heart is yearning and seeking for those in the world not even asking or looking for Him. He already knows there are untold millions out there who are His, even though they, themselves don't even know it yet! God has in a way uniquely prepared me as one that’s not only able, but willing to be sent back into places where many others won’t dare to go. That’s because I understand and know it well— I’ve been there too.”Tim’s music is meant to be performed before live, generally secular audiences. At times in the most unlikely places where you'd never expect people looking or asking for God to hang out.“I’ve played this inspired Message Rock n’ Roll in bars, roadhouses, coffee houses and nightclubs— anywhere God sent me to. Sometimes in the middle of some of the darkest places you could go. But that’s where God wanted me, because that’s really where He is too, always seeking and calling out for everyone He doesn't want to lose just by showing them who He is— personally, and how much He loves them already just as they are.A Rock n’ Roll veteran, Tim began his career at the age of 16, touring the United States and Europe from the late 70’s through the 90’s, bringing his bands and original music set to styles of Rock, Punk Rock, and Heavy Metal to eager, live crowds.“Though at the time quite successful, it was for all the wrong reasons and purpose,”states Tim.""But it was my message at that time in my life. Music influences people to just take a little time to listen to the message— it's important though that you're bringing a message that brings life. That's when God puts His power on it.""But it took a major pivotal event, causing a complete turnaround in Tim's life that led to the resounding new message in his songs, which he says,“is the only thing worth telling the world about.”He now refers to his brand of music as a sort of, “God Rock.”Fourteen years ago, after seeing most of his friends from the Rock n' Roll music industry die way too young through those wild, prior years, Tim one day found himself unexpectedly in the same predicament.“I was a heavy, 30-year drug addict that lived the proverbial sex, drugs and rock n’ roll lifestyle to the max. I lived through so many unbelievable and surreal situations daily; I began to think death didn’t pertain to me. That is, until the last time I OD’d, my heart stopped— and I died,”recounts Tim. ""Within moments I found myself in Hell. A place that’s horrific and real beyond your staunchest disbelief in it or wildest imaginations!I saw those ancient looking gates. I felt the penetrating fear and horror. I saw and heard those big demons and those millions of souls and voices without life screaming and crying in torture, pain and eternal regret. And shockingly, I also vividly saw and distinctly heard some of those old friends of mine there that had died untimely deaths years earlier.“I was never looking for or asking for God my whole life. Though for some reason, I just knew where I ended up was my just fate,"" admits Tim. But I sure didn’t know any way or have any power to get out of that one! Doomed forever in that unbelievable place, it never dawned on me to even try and call out for help. Who would I have called for anyway? I’d always just depended on myself.Just as those hideous demons were coming for me too with those big, heavy chains to take me away— Bam! God unexpectedly showed up right in Hell in His brilliant light and pulled me straight up and out. Next thing I knew, I found myself taken up to Heaven with Him in His arms. He spoke to me quite a long time there. Such encouraging, all positive, optimistic words in an atmosphere of indescribable peace, infiltrating life and overpowering love like I’d never known before. It wrecked me— because I couldn’t understand why He stepped in for me when He did, let alone talked so highly of me while I was with Him. But I can assure you— I was beyond grateful!He personally began to show and tell me just how much He loved me and how all He really wanted— was just me. He also wanted me to know my true identity— the one He gave me— and the destiny He said He personally saved me for. ""Get up and go!"" He said to me before He put me back in my body and brought me back to life. Then He whispered in my ear, ""I saved you— now you go and save my children!""Things became undeniably clear after that when I looked back and finally understood the real reason I’d survived all those surreal, death defying episodes that marked my entire life. This God of outrageous, determined love who I never cared to know, nor even had a grid for, I realized had in reality been chasing after me my whole life! He was obviously pretty determined to get me, and to get me to the destiny He said He called me for— and that’s to be a voice for Him speaking precisely what’s on His heart and mind to others... and it's all good!God’s given me a lot of indispensible, personal training and wild previews along the way since that fateful day back in 2000. This is part of that calling I’m doing today— and none of this was even my idea! I just get to be a part of what He is doing and with the outrageous fun of seeing Him show up— and do His thing!I depend on Him for everything now, because I’ve learned first hand— He’s ""the God who does it all!"" He just breaks the chains off people, sets the addicts free, heals the sick and broken, and raises the dead. I am living proof! But it gets much wilder than that. I’ve seen Him do so much more.”As a called and since honed, Prophetic voice after his extraordinary first encounter with God in Hell and then being literally resurrected, Tim says God was moving him up level-by-level over the years to new and bigger “assignments” He was sending him on. By 2010, God abruptly told him to give away all that he owned, including his large house back in Pittsburgh to a needy widow with sons to raise, and go across the country to the streets of Hollywood, California where He lived for three years. He left with only $500 to his name.With his rocker look, long hair and totally free-spirit attitude, Tim became an unlikely looking Pastor of sorts to the streets of Hollywood. God led him to reach out in directed ministry to the homeless, runaways, drug dealers, addicts, and prostitutes along the way and was also sent to media and entertainment industry professionals within Hollywood and its surrounding cities.“God personally set up many divine appointments with individuals He wanted to touch there.But primary to all that, He appointed me to the city at large to walk those streets and boulevards daily while speaking His words of life, love, freedom, mercy and grace and whatever else He gave me to release from Him over the people, places and it’s industries. Because God really loves Hollywood!Sometimes He’d send me down to L.A., 'The City of Angels,' to walk and minister on the streets of Skid Row— often, late at night to early morning hours. God’s heart for the homeless, broken and underprivileged is just stunning. It really wrecks me!”says Tim with small tears welling up in his eyes.“They remind me so much of where I have been.I’ve seen literally thousands of amazing miracles on those streets as God just did His thing. It was often a dangerous assignment, and it’s vital you stay in tune, but I never worried. When you know God’s the one who sends you— He sends you with all of heaven’s backing,”says Tim.“I also see hundreds of angels there in Hollywood and L.A. all the time. Though God cares greatly about every single individual, I know He's up to something way BIGGER there too!He meets people right where they’re at. Not in judgment, like some people think or say, but in outrageous love and mercy showing just who He is. It's His perpetual, chasing love He repeatedly shows you that attracts you to Him.When you realize and see it personally, it proves just irresistable in the end.Gods got a lot of real, gifted gems among the homeless and down trodden, as well as key hidden ones in high places He’s gonna’ reveal one day. I can’t wait to see the full outcome of His plans there. I think it will really blow people’s minds away! But it’s meant to—.This stuff is nothin’ for God. It’s just who He is and what He's all about and He’s working across all levels in Hollywood from the least to the greatest. But this thing He’s doing is meant to explode on out and affect the world through what He’s pioneering in Hollywood and the media industry there. His heart is yearning for His children in the world to come home and just step on into Him and He intends to use all means necessary. I know! I can hear and feel the overwhelming passion of His heartbeat for them now so close inside of me.God is so beyond what most people think or know about the real Him. He’s absolutely unrestrained, totally free, brilliantly humorous and really full of fun. He loves to show Himself off— and in the least likely places and ways. I’m just one of His many called agents to get to be a part of the fun in seeing Him do just that!One thing I do know, God is way wilder than I ever thought I could be— and I was pretty wild! Interestingly, that’s what first caught my hard to get attention and brought me a lot of respect for Him. His love for people just knows no bounds and it’s always totally outta’ control! That’s my message and that’s my call. To tell, incite and show people that aren’t really looking or asking for Him, who He really is and what He wants to do for them— personally.He uses me to speak what’s on His mind and heart through the music and through the platforms He puts me on too. For me, it’s been quite a long backstage progression, but God intends it all for His front stage display. My life is a miracle. It began with a miracle— then on all the way through. But I’m really nothin’— God is the real Rock Star!Tim reveals knowing God personally through Jesus Christ, His Son and experiencing Heaven is for now! Not just for some time later in the by and by. Tim’s music and shows are geared to bringing his general audiences into an unexpected encounter with the living God and experiencing His tangible love for them sponsored through non-confontational, free-spirited and fun entertainment concerts. Tim promotes,“Heaven is the true party place— jump on in!”The purpose and destiny God saved and has uniquely prepared Tim Ehmann for is to bring others into this reality as well.“This is an amazing kingdom mission God’s commissioned me to, but He really wants to expand the horizons now. He wants this stuff out there and front stage in front of the masses. God’s the one on a mission! And He’s pretty determined about it all too,”says Tim with a mischievous grin of ""imminent danger"" looming on his face. He knows the surprising ambush of God showing up when you least expect it— all too well. ""God has made it clear in no uncertain terms— THIS IS THE TIME! He's on a 'special opps' mission and He intends to invade this world like never before!""“He showed me the arenas 14 years ago. People just out enjoying a good rock concert. Then mosh-pits and crowds of people having fun and goin’ wild, because unexpectedly they were gettin' slammed up with the total freedom and power of God like a wind out of nowhere, collectively.Those are His powerful love waves bringing the actual realm of heaven right into the earth— and He personally shows them Himself who He is.Miracles spontaneously break out and one by one they get pulled out of those mosh pits. He encounters them right where they're at— and with Him, always comes freedom and all kinds of spectacular, great things in people’s lives!These weren’t majority, sanctioned church type venues either— these were worldly venues! I've found, the people of the world who aren't even asking or looking for God, don't really care, or don't have some pre-set grid for Him will seize the wild, ""impossible,"" supernatural stuff of God that just comes with Him, way quicker than a lot of those that have already put Him in a restricted, theological box. Many will even see Him! —This is just like how He began the relationship with me.I consider myself just a ""minister of fun."" And through the medium of Inspired entertainment brings what I call ""a ministry of fun!"" Because a lot of people don’t realize— God and heaven are into fun! He loves to have fun with His kids. Why do you think He tells people you can’t enter or even see His kingdom without simply receiving it just like a child?After nearly three years of staying on course with God's assignment walking those often harsh, Hollywood streets and doing whatever He led me to do, He totally surprised me one day. I happened to be walking off of Hollywood Blvd. and turning up Vine Street as was part of my general routine, when I was passing by the Capitol Records building. Suddenly, God in a matter of fact tone spoke up and said to me,'That’s where you’re going to record my songs.'I couldn’t believe it!""recounts Tim in surprise.“He shocked me! It’s tough to get in there for many artists. I'd already been praying and prophesying His directed blessings and words of life over that building and those connected to it, as well as many other key places for three years by that point— but I never thought this was something He had planned for me!But that’s just what God did. Later within that year, I just watched as He miraculously opened up that door to me and I’ve been laying down music and vocal tracks in this current, new album project there for the last two years. I’ve had opportunity to bring in other greatly talented, prophetically inspired artists, musicians and even intercessors and we’ve been releasing the powerful, 'now,' inspired words of God’s heart straight into and through the center of historic Capitol Records.It’s been quite a journey!”laughs Tim, as he shakes his head at the seeming impossibility of it all— apart from God.“12 years prior, I laid down most all my possessions, my whole life, everything— even my guitar for a while just because God asked me to. The house was the last thing to go. But from the beginning I'd finally realized it was time to give up doing things my own way, and walk fully in the love relationship that God had just started with me, and just get to really know Him. How could I not? Everything else I ever did my prior life was just for me: my way, my opinions, my things, my ambitions, and my desires. Look where it got me? I'm sure I had to be one of His toughest cases! But I finally got it— it was all really worthless in the light of eternity. All of that wasted time and life walking down the wrong road earned me only death and Hell in the end— apart from Him.It was only on hindsight, I realizedit was this same God who had been chasing after me my whole life— though I didn't recognize it was Him at the time. He's always talking to unbelievers and believers alike your whole life and calls you 'til the last possible moment. With me He went even beyond that— chasin' after me right into Hell! He just wouldn't let me go! I never asked Him for any of this— but I know now— He'll go anywhere and do all it takes just to try and get you. You're so worth it to Him because He's really, very madly in love with you. I've experienced firsthand, there's no barrier that can keep Him back and no place He can't or won't go, cause His""Love is Always Outta' Control!""It's all about that moment when He finally has opportunity to catch your attention, even whenyou'renot even asking or looking for Him, and He just shows you who He is— and He's always continuing that pursuit. He's always the one who pursues you and He's the one who starts the relationship. With that comes opportunity for Him to step inside of you— then He takes care of all the rest…Tim Ehmann Productions is also beginning planning stages for Phase II of this project, as the album is finalized for release and promo. Tim Ehmann and friends will headline events, while hosting other talented and gifted, artists, dancers and supporting inspired entertainment acts geared towards primarily secular, general public audiences through strategic concerts, rockfest's, festivals and other entertainment venues.“These shows will bring non-confrontational, inviting, free-spirited and fun entertainment offering unexpected encounter, that has made it worth it to us investing everything we've got into it.We realize this project is something way bigger than ourselves, but the fruits to all involved are not just temporal, but eternal because it’s directly targeted towards the most important thing on God’s mind and heart— souls! One thing that's certain— It can bring you crowns that will last forever...""                                            - Tim EhmannFor more information regarding Tim Ehmann, please see his ""BIO"" posted on this site's front page, as well as his listed websites.

We have been selling tamales to friends and family for 20 years now. Our kids are all older and we can finally open our Tamale business.Our dream started off when our Grandma Maria would call us over to help her make the Christmas Tamales and other traditional food for Christmas and we fell in love making tamales together because it became fun family time. Than before we knew itpeople were asking us all year round to make them some tamales. So we did and we haven't stopped. So because of Grandma Marias family tradition we found our dream in life. We are going to start out small with renting a commercial kitchen. We will do catering jobs and delivery to homes. Our ultimate dream is to have a brick and mortar, where people can come to us and buy the tamales and add to our menu such as our empanadas, homemade tortilla chips, Enchiladas and so much more. We willwork our way up to that.Our tamales areas authentic as they can come. We make our tamales with 2 pounds of meat per dozen, so they are not just all masa but filled with meat.We make several different kinds of tamales. Pork, Beef,Chicken with Green Sauce, Jalapeno and CreamCheese and several different dessert tamales as well. We would really appreciate your donation to help us startour dream business andone day pass on to our kids.Thank you soMuch",We are trying not to have risks with our new business and that is why we are starting small in a rented commercial kitchen. We have customers already waiting for us to open and will be marketing for new customers to come.

In turn, we are offering you great value on your pledge beginning at a 50% discount on final retail price.What you get: Copies of pattern books before everyone else at a deep discount as a thank you for supporting us and helping us build this product line!Why you want it: Professionally-designed patterns for professional-looking results. Needle felting tutorials make adding crisp, durable details to your plushes a snap! Fully-illustrated, easy-to-follow directions for every skill level, from beginner to expert.Each pledge level has a reward in the description. If you wish to add-on additional selections, reference the Milestones and Delivery schedule. Each Deliverable has an ADDON price. Simply make your total pledge the base price, plus anything extra that you want. As each milestone is unlocked, the available rewards selections or contents under each pledge level will be updated.This project is broken down into a series of milestones. When funding reaches each of these goals a new level will be unlocked giving more reward options available for each pledge level! Note that each milestone has a delivery date for when that portion of the project will be complete and delivered.Anyone pledging to receive multiple books, they are delivered as they are complete – not in one bundle at the end of the project. So you can get started crocheting right away!Grayed out levels are not unlocked yet. Pledge more to unlock them!For an example of the final product visitCrochet Chibis: Elemental Set 1available in the Etsy store,or see the image below.The bulk of the expenditure goes to creating patterns and then turning those patterns into booklets – this is reflected in the Booklet Creation, Photography, and Prototyping and Pattern Creation sections. The next biggest expenditure is in fees, both to Kickstarter and Amazon Payment Processing. What's left after that is some Administrative Time, Prototyping Materials and a small slice to Advertising and Social Media.There is no waste or risk in overfunding. No matter the funding level, this proportion of funding remains the same and more funding will not incur delays – the schedule is set upfront! More funding = more deliverables = more options for your rewards. We will work hard to deliver as many high quality booklets as your funding supports. It's a win-win!This chart shows the example funding breakdown when this project reaches the 8th Deliverable milestone at 36k. The money divides up very neatly with most of it supporting a full-time Pattern Creator and Graphic Artist working at Minimum Wage in Washington State, a part time Administrator and Editor, with the least amount going to Fees and Materials cost.I just wanted to thank everyone who has ever purchased a crochet plush from me in the past, commissioned a custom design, or considered supporting me in this Kickstarter. It's only through your response that I have come to the point of having a catalog of patterns and developed the skills to put this project together.Supporting this Kickstarter is more than just getting patterns developed and put into the hands of an increasing number of people enjoying the fun of creation through fiber arts. It's about supporting artists and letting us create and put beautiful things into the world rather than just wish we had the time to bring our ideas to fruition.Every bit of support I receive through this Kickstarter, on Patreon, or through purchases in my Etsy store directly translates into more time I spend making these products for you. And I am eternally grateful for the opportunity to follow my dreams.So once again, thank you for your support.In gratitude,AnyaTalisan CreationsQuestions? Comments?

When funding reaches each of these goals a new level will be unlocked giving more reward options available for each pledge level! Note that each milestone has a delivery date for when that portion of the project will be complete and delivered.Anyone pledging to receive multiple books, they are delivered as they are complete – not in one bundle at the end of the project. So you can get started crocheting right away!Greyed out levels are not unlocked yet. Pledge more to unlock them!For an example of the final product visit Crochet Chibis: Elemental Set 1 available in the Etsy store, or see the image below.The bulk of the expenditure goes to creating patterns and then turning those patterns into booklets – this is reflected in the Booklet Creation, Photography, and Prototyping and Pattern Creation sections. The next biggest expenditure is in fees, both to Kickstarter and Amazon Payment Processing. What's left after that is some Shipping, Prototyping Materials and a small slice to Advertising and Social Media.There is no waste or risk in overfunding causing delays. No matter the funding level, this proportion of funding remains the same and the schedule is set upfront! More funding = more deliverables = more options for your rewards. We will work hard to deliver as many high quality booklets as your funding supports. It's a win-win!This chart shows the example funding breakdown assuming all milestones are reached at 36k. The money divides up very neatly with most of it supporting a full-time Pattern Creator and Graphic Artist working at Minimum Wage in Washington State, a part time Administrator and Editor, with the least amount going to Fees and Materials cost.I just wanted to thank everyone who has ever purchased a crochet plush from me in the past, commissioned a custom design, or considered supporting me in this Kickstarter. It's only through your response that I have come to the point of having a catalog of patterns and developed the skills to put this project together.Supporting this Kickstarter is more than just getting patterns developed and put into the hands of an increasing number of people enjoying the fun of creation through fiber arts. It's about supporting artists and letting us create and put beautiful things into the world rather than just wish we had the time to bring our ideas to fruition.Every bit of support I receive through this Kickstarter, Patreon, Facebook, or through purchases in my Etsy store directly translates into more time I spend making these products for you. And I am eternally grateful for the opportunity to follow my dreams.So once again, thank you for your support.In gratitude,AnyaTalisan CreationsQuestions? Comments?

Plagued with constant nightmares and reminders of her loss, she struggles to move on.But all that changes when a cryptic text, sent from her brother’s phone makes her second guess everyone and everything.Torn between hope and reality, Grace must choose to blindly trust her brother’s instructions, or face the coming darkness alone.This story is strong and will look amazing on film. But there are some needed film items needed to make this a reality and complete my vision. I need a high end drone with a HD camera to take the audience on a different view of the action. Some updated computer and editing tools also are needed. Wardrobe and location budget.The film stars Rachel McGinley.http://www.imdb.com/name/nm5162047/Be part of this awesome project.Thank youMarty McGinley",Only one obstacle that could happen if my daughter get another role before  we start this one.,https://www.kickstarter.com/projects/1698889221/the-wanting-indie-film?ref=discovery_category_newest,1698889221/the-wanting-indie-film,"Two years ago I had a dream for a story. I woke up and wrote it down on a piece of paper. In the morning looked at it and thought...lets make a movie about this. It is kind of a Twilight Zone thriller. So we wrote the script but it was a process because we didn't want it to sound cheap or unbelievable. But we finished it and were ready to start to find investors for our project.You can see the teaser trailer herehttps://vimeo.com/212680277Over the last two years we have now a handful of investors and we are ready to start the filming process this August and September.After it is finished we will enter it into film festivals and try to get someone to buy the idea from us. The project can easily be made into a full feature film or a web series or even a Netflix series.So what is needed? Smaller amounts of things that add up. Things like camera rentals or film editing software. Its all the smaller things that add up. We need YOUR help in helping us complete this project.To make you a Participant or Support of this project would be awesome.I know you would love to sit back in a year from now and say ""HEY! I was a part of that idea""Thank youMarty McGinley",The only risk that we would come across if we dont have the funding to submit to the 4 Large Small Film festivals that we want to submit to. Also if we have to do some reshoots and rent the camera equipment again.

Sadie was at a local rescue organization. Nobody wanted to adopt her :( ... She needed some expensive surgery and had some uncontrollable fear aggression towards other dogs. We saw something else in Sadie. After several operations and TONS of TLC, she is the the greatest gift I have ever received.Every morning she wakes up and  comes to the side of my bed to say GOOD MORNING! She doesn’t care about my morning breath or how my hair looks. She is always excited to greet me. Thanks to Sadie I wake up every morning with an immediate smile.One morning I looked at Sadie  and said “you must have been the cutest puppy ever” ----- AND .... IT STARTED!So ... Myself (and my three friends *SHERRI , *STEPHANIE and *NANCY) decided that we needed to put a smile on as many faces as possible with ""Puppies Rule"". We contacted a graphic artist that had done amazing work for us in the past.We set out to find images that represented the cutest puppies of all breeds and have him ""Draw"" them in his graphic art style. He did the first Mastiff puppy and we were blown away! We now have over 30 puppy breeds completed... with many more to come.OUR GOAL ... TO REPRESENT EVERY BREED!and put these adorable puppies on as many different products as possible.The T Shirt design used for the pledge rewards will be a limited edition. This ""Puppies Rule ... Kickstarter 2017"" design will ONLY be offered as a reward during this campaign and will not be made available for retail purchase.*******************************************************************************More BREEDS will be available before the end of the campaign. You can choose one of these as ""your"" reward breed.Bichon Frise ... Boxer ... Bulldog ... Cavalier King Charles Spaniel ... Cocker Spaniel ... Collie ... Chow Chow ... Dalmatian ... Great Dane ... Jack Russell Terrier ... Shiba InuREMEMBER ... We eventually hope to have ALL breeds available(With your help!)*******************************************************************************We have also created several themes to highlight these adorable puppies. All breeds will eventually be available in each theme.Take a look at the first 4 themes that will go into production after the campaign!(LOOK AT SAMPLES BELOW)So far we have the ability to immortalize these puppies on the following products:*T Shirts (White)*Sweatshirts (White)*Mugs*Aprons (White)*Blankets*Towels*Welcome Mats*Canvas Prints*Posters*OrnamentsWe have a GREAT start... We have invested our own time and money to get this project off the ground. We are committed and we will move forward. But... we are so excited about these products, that we would rather it be sooner then later. We also want to make sure that we keep the integrity of these products in place at all times. WE WILL NEVER USE INFERIOR SUPPLIES.MOST IMPORTANT! .. We would like to supply these products in volume to Non-Profit Rescue Organizations. We hope to be able to have enough funds to have items produced in larger quantities. This will allow us to offer the products to Rescues at or below cost. Any money they make will hopefully assist them in finding forever homes for the animals in need.The pledges will help with the following items needed:The 4 people who make this project possible:Gabrielle - Creative force behind ""Puppies Rule""* ""This is not WORK... It is a fun obsession""!Sherri - Printing and IT Manager* Her patience for anything that needs to be ""Fixed"" is a must for any teamStephanie - Account Manager* There is no one out there that can compare in organizational skillsNancy - Sales And Marketing*Amazing people skills ...

I couldn't wait to see which one would be released next...THAT IS THE FEELING I AM TRYING TO CAPTURE WITH MY OWN SERIES!With the digital age upon us, I decided to collaborate with a talented computer graphics artist to assist me with making one of my ""Bucket List"" projects come to life. I wanted to create my own series of vehicle graphics with the same comical style of the original ""Odd Rods"". Then ... I wanted to offer them on various products so everyone could enjoy them!I know that I could never hope to recreate such an iconic series, but I wanted to try to capture that spirit of almost 50 years ago. I have been obsessed with working on this set and it has been a dream come true. It was quite an adventure to focus my creative side into something real.I have 36 images in the sketching stage already ... And I want many more to follow.

I have 16 more in the sketching stage and I plan to have them released one at a time as they become available. Each DigiRod will be available for immediate purchase upon official release through my already established web store ( 3sistersrock.com )I have been working 10 years with my own T shirt business and I have also forged a business relationship with several Print On Demand companies.  I have tested all images offered here to assure print quality!Therefore ... I anticipate minimal risk with this project.The main challenge would be marketing after this campaign. I want to maintain control over most of the aspects of this series.  I am hoping to offer wholesale products or licensing to only a few select companies/retailers. Those companies must have the same values regarding high quality production and complete customer satisfaction.My hope is that someone else in 40 years will be talking about my DigiRods series.

I wanted to create a livetheater broadcast like the old Playhouse 90 from the 40's and 50′s. It was called Sherri’s Playhouse. I not only produced my play above but 3 other plays. They were all verysuccessfulwith large audiences.My new idea is toproduce my play locally and see if we can get a local theater group going again here in the suburbs of San Diego. The money raised will go to renting a rehearsal hall, theater, programs, tickets, costumes, sets, refreshments...etc. If successful I will produce other works to make a season that will introduce live theater at affordable prices again.","To overcome the challenge of filling theater seats I will advertise it on my radio show, Chatting With Sherri, my blogs, websites and on other radio shows as well. To make sure it is a hit. I will also create ads for local newspapers and magazines.",https://www.kickstarter.com/projects/rithebard/be-a-part-of-theater-and-put-cats-pajamas-on-the-s?ref=discovery_category_newest,rithebard/be-a-part-of-theater-and-put-cats-pajamas-on-the-s,"The video is the very successful radio play with over 5 million downloads since it's original broadcast and they are still coming.

We have a lot of great actors in San Diego and with my show; Chatting With Sherri and my radio playhouse; Sherri's Playhouse, I have worked with a lot of great actors! All of them semi-professional or professional who would love to tread the boards for a chance to bring my play to life on stage.

If that comes up I will try to get local interests to help back this project because it will bring business to their establishments.

I do greatly appreciate you support anyway. People like you are very important to keeping the film industry alive. If you would like to keep updated about the DARK REIGN feature film project, please visit www.redfilms.ca/news.Your money Your purchase or investment goes towards funding a feature film based on one of the top 50 plays of all time, William Shakespeare's Richard III. Our story is a complete modern day adaptation, which is centralized around organized crime, using all modern day dialog. In film production, everything starts with a great script, which we have developed. From there, we gathered a great film crew, myself included. I am a professional director, cinematographer, editor & producer with over 5 years experience in tv & film. Then we collected many great local actors, all with many years of experience also. When you put all these great elements together it is easy to make a good feature film, and with bigger and bigger investments made everything just gets better. Take a look at our video above, it has many samples of our work. Also, here is some our Movie Soundtrack, great music, from great musicians.Some of our best rewards...","With a very small budget, the best solution is to minimize the cast, the number of locations, shoot with a small crew and write a script for a 90 minute feature. All which was factored in when creating the budget for this project. With your investment of $10,000, plus my own investment of $9,000, this will be enough to keep production quality good. Anything over that and the feature will just get better and better. Me and some of the cast and crew already have experience in this type of film production. The award winning feature film Wendy & Wanda in the video above, is an example of that.The biggest factor in us being able to produce a good quality feature film with just $19,000 is me doing some of the main production jobs unpaid. I will be director, film editor and cinematographer. This saves the production about $16,000 in costs.",https://www.kickstarter.com/projects/keepingitreal/keeping-it-real-sit-com-episode-02?ref=discovery_category_newest,keepingitreal/keeping-it-real-sit-com-episode-02," Watch the already completed sit-com pilot above, your purchase or investment goes towards making episode 02 of the Keeping It Real web series. This will continue until we have 6 episodes, which is enough for some tv and streaming networks to air the series. All about the series, it takes place behind the scenes of an action reality show. Where Pax, a real life bounty hunter wants to stay true to his legacy, but is always banging heads with Nina, who's an over the hill director and Tom the over acting actor. While the incompetent film crew and evasive bounties just make it all worse.  After we reach our goal, keep a look out for the following Kickstarter Campaign for episode 03.

With our budget of $3000, we keep each episode length at 12 minutes, and If we get over our budget goal here, all that extra money will go towards episode 03. No dollar gets wasted."

YES! And we plan to do it on a GRAND SCALE on the Black Rock desert, where Art and Science and Great Things blend as one. Past, present and future come together when tribes group, exchanging things, stories and different cultures. Food customs are shared as well as contraptions of science or unseen things that inspire great thinking. Challenges and gambles are a day to day experience. Monies won and lost, futures changed, some for the better and some, well, let's say no future at all. A carpenters pub trick to win drinks as well as money. This brain game on a small scale (16 penny nails) has also been entered in science fairs and used in the classroom to inspire problem solving. We propose to bring a scaled up version to the playa. The creative team of Union Phiwill construct a 15 foot  version of this carpenters trick with 10 foot steel nails fabricated and then assembled on the playa as close to the original small scale form as possible. Because of safety issues, the sculpture will have to bend the rules of the game a little to accomplish this feat of engineering. The sculpted form will stand as a simple reminder of how humanity can master it’s physical world to create functional yet beautiful and inspirational forms.The beautiful natural curved configuration of the contraption is a result of the weight, friction and balance of the nails. The sculpture seems to be manipulated to accomplish this curve, yet it is the rules of gravity and friction creating the natural beautiful curve. Broken down mathematically, it relates to Phi, known as the Golden Ration, a magical proportion that can be rationalized in monumental art, architecture and in nature. Some believe Phi is connected to how humans distinguish beauty at a subconscious level.Some good friendships have come out of this creation already. When the challenge was presented to me, it took time and some clues, but I was able to solve the balance problem. Two months later I met Koda on another of his playa art projects. Within 5 minutes of our initial meeting, I was scrounging the area looking for a hammer and nails to show him the puzzle. Although it had nothing to do with the task at hand, once it was completed, he realized that he had stumbled on a like-minded, creativeeclectic,much like himself ... and so started our artistic partnership, Union Phi. Though we are all such small spots on the plain of time, together our experiences make a difference in the lives of one another.  We walk a fine fine line between all things but one things remains the same... our balance of it all.Union Phi is a collaborative group of passionate and creative individuals that transform the eccentric thoughts we all have rattling around in our imaginations by physically manifesting them into beautiful and inspirational art that connects us all at a basic human level. With our collective experience of the playa and beyond, Union Phi is developing two large scale sculptures for Burning Man 2014. This Kickstarter campaign is known as Nails, The Contraption, but please explore our other project known as Burning Phi which is running in parallel to this campaign.","The challenges are many in a project of this scale, especially where we will be physically installing this piece (Black Rock City on the playa). Union Phi has several core members that have participated and have personally created and installed multiple installations at Burning Man over the years and as recently as last year (2013). Union Phi has been developing and coordinating this particular project over the past three months which includes developing renderings, a scale model, working drawings and coordination with a Nevada State engineer. Union Phi has multiple contingency options for every phase of the project. For example, we have priced structural steel from multiple commercial suppliers and are currently coordinating options to use steel components from salvage opportunities. Another example is the technical abilities of our crew.

https://www.kickstarter.com/projects/hoveysmith/professionalize-hoveys-outdoor-adventures-podcast?ref=discovery_category_newest,hoveysmith/professionalize-hoveys-outdoor-adventures-podcast,"Hovey's Outdoor AdventuresSixty episodes of the prize winning WebTalkRadio.net podcast of Hovey's Outdoor Adventures were produced by one guy during 2011-12. That guy is me, Wm. Hovey Smith. Kickstarter funding is being solicited toreplace XP and Vista computers,install atelephone-recording system, get better video stuff for my supporting YouTube videosand move me out of the kitchen. Geographic areas where last year's shows were recorded ranged from the Outer Banks of North Carolina, to Butler Island on the Georgia coast, to Las Vegas, Nevada, to Kellogg, Idaho, and points in between.  A boost to small-town America is given in my occasional Hunt Destination series where I feature locations like Seward, Nebraska, and Currituck, North Carolina, to give them a bit of an economiclift with radio and video coverage.  Show topics have been as varied as the locations. Items covered included not only hunting deer, bear, elk, turkey, geese, swan, squirrels and snipe; but also environmental restoration of the Gulf Coast, how to start an outdoor-based business, holistic health and human relations - all done with a touch of humor. Diversity is also exhibited in the shows' formats. Trade show coverage sometimes featured as many as 20 exhibitors, while on other occasions I have carried the hour-long show by myself, as when I described my home town of Sandersville, Georgia. On other occasions, I have employed a bit of old-time radio drama complete with the sounds effects of a back-alley bar at closing time.  The thrusts of my outdoor books, radio shows, blogs and videos is to provide factual and entertaining information about the outdoors that a person can use to provide for himself and his family. This is not about me killing so big a such-and-such animal, but is more likely how to drag a road-killed deer home and make meals from it for yourself and your pets as inexpensively as possible. Because this isthe equipment that I mostly use, write about and know; muzzleloading guns of all sorts, crossbows, axes and knives often figure in my stories and sometimes unexpectedly appear even in the cooking sections. This makes for interesting radio and videos as well as providing tangible links topast times and recent history.  Cooking and eating wild game has always been a part of my life, and I purchase almost no store-bought meats. I have adapted and developed many wild game recipes that are often featured on my radio show and YouTube videos. Perhaps the most outlandish of these was Bear Paw Pumpkin Soup for Halloween. This recipe was not all that tasty, but was interesting to cook - maybe with a touch of nutmeg? My creative ability to produce ground-breaking radio is still going strong, but I do need some updated hardware and a move out of the kitchen to continue inan effective manner. ",,https://www.kickstarter.com/projects/hoveysmith/hoveys-cooking-knives-of-ancient-origins?ref=discovery_category_newest,hoveysmith/hoveys-cooking-knives-of-ancient-origins,"Hovey.s Knives of China: New Cooking Knives from Ancient PatternsNew kitchen knives derived from ancient blades made thousand of years ago in China and elsewhere have provided more than a dozen eminently useful cutlery products for today's cooks and Chefs. Most of my designs are derived from bronze knives made during the Waring States Period before the rise of Rome when Chinese culture was the most advanced in the world.Many of these knives are multi-purpose tools in that they not only cut, but may scrape, mash, smear, grind, act as a palate, be used as a fork, to stir with or even serve from, rather than the cook having to reach for several tools to accomplish these tasks. These functions are illustrated in a dozen YouTube videos that I have posted about my knives. Specialized cooking knives were seen in kitchens that prepared hundreds of meals at the time, and the best of these knives were thought so useful that they were even used as models for money. Like today’s knives, these old blades were separated into chopping, slicing and paring knives.Their cast and hammered bronze compositions allowed them to have a smoother cutting edge than stone, but bronze developed stress fractures and underwent brittle failure. For this reason, knives for cutting large vegetables like cabbage and ducks were long, heavy and had long inclined grips. These features were used so that the pressure and leverage applied to the backs of the blades cut through objects instead of the force of  blows delivered by swinging arms.The oval or “D” shaped rings on the handles were designed to fit into the palm of the hands to provide a non-rotational grip. The index finger resting over the back of the blade applied pressure and exerted control over the knife. This oval also provided a handy means for storing the knives, which were typically hung on pegs or boards, rather than placed in drawers or in a knife block. This way the knives were always at hand, and each could be returned to its proper place after use.In my redesigns I am not after fancy or fantasy; but functionality. I am of the belief that the best cooking tools are those designed by the cooks who use them. For decades I have been a hunter and wild game cook who has processed game under the most challenging of conditions, always butchered my own meat and cooked a variety of products. Many of my 15 books have chapters on knives and how to best use them in the field and kitchen.These knives combined with my lifelong interests in geology and world cultures has prompted these developments.My travels to Europe, Africa and Asia have exposed me to a wide variety of knives, cutting and cooking techniques. I have incorporated this information into the designs of these knives and in my cooking videos about making meals with minimal waste and costs.The result of my efforts has been the introduction of new line of cooking knives that time has proven to be effective tools. These knives in the hands of today’s cooks and Chefs can help make dishes of character and quality that have not graced man’s table for thousands of years.   ","There is no lack of inexpensive cooking knives largely based on European designs in today's mass market outlets. What these knives lack are the multi-function capabilities seen in my redesigned knives, their new to today's market look and direct links to Chinese and other world cultures. My Point Square patterns trades its origins back to man's early origins 1.7 million years ago to the Acheulean stone hand axes of Oldowan traditions of West Africa which spread throughout Europe and Asia and rank high among the oldest man-worked tools in continuous use. When a point is needed for cutting the best control is provided by an object that is held in the palm of the hand with the index finger over the top of the blade where the hand, finger and point work as a unified unit to cut, sculpt or trace a design on the desired object. My version also has a short section of cutting blade for trimming. There is no existing tool that is stronger, more compact and better designed for this purpose; provided that proper steels and point designs are chosen for the task. An eminently useful knife is the Small Utility Knife, which I also call The Caterer's Friend. This knife is designed for users with small hands and has a two-inch wide truncated blade with a straight cutting edge and straight grip with my distinct oval termination at the end. The Caterer's Friend is designed for small cutting tasks, trimming, spreading or sculpturing soft materials. It can even, by itself, be used to make last minute decorations or dishes, should more than the expected number of guests arrive at an event. No single knife that exist today is so useful. Designed for larger hands, the Medium Utility Knife has even more potential utility as it also features a thumb notch on the top of the blade and an inclined grip for slivering or peeling as well as for cutting larger vegetables. Again, no knife with such utility exist in today's marketplace. These added, useful bonus attributes to this entire line of knives distinguish them from any knives made today as being designed from well-proven designs, brought to modern form by one who actually uses them, and presented to the market as the most effective, versatile and efficient cooking tools that exist. Not only are the practical use attributes of the knives attractive, but their direct links to Chinese and other world cultures provides a bond between the modern cook who wants to cook ethnic dishes in the most authentic manner possible to provide food of character and quality to his quests. These knives have potential sales to those not only or Chinese and other ethnic origins, but to all of those who wish to experiment with oriental foods.The general business plan is that these knives are to be introduced as open-source designs. Anyone, anywhere in the world may make them and sell at any price. Makers who send me knives for testing may sell them under my trademark at a 5 % royalty fee from their retail price. In exchange I will do videos about their knives and display them at annual trade shows. These knives will be introduced at the International Blade Show in Atlanta at the Cobb Galleria on June 3-5 at table 16 U. (The above paragraph is part of my general business plan and not part of this Kickstarter appeal.)These new knives will generate intense interest at the show, as few really new cooking knives, much less a dozen of them from one maker at the time, have been seen at this event in decades. Already, several magazines have requested information for press coverage. I have written for various knife magazines for decades and will receive exposure on this interesting and useful line of new cutlery products. The demand is expected to rise very rapidly with knives of my patters being seen in common use in kitchens throughout the world within the next decade."

And in this economy, Adriana quickly realizes, having a degree isn't all it's cracked up to be. DIRECTOR'S STATEMENT:For most of my twenties, I struggled to find my niche in the world. It was through traveling, working odd jobs and meeting unforgettable people that I became a storyteller. I've always loved to write for as long as I could remember and when I finally let the fear of judgment go, I  discovered that perhaps my stories could inspire others to tell their stories too. 'Hired Education' was conceived at I point where I was receiving what seemed like a million rejection letters on scripts. Then I remembered all the jobs I failed horribly at. It made me think: could this be another epic fail? No. I realized that I gained invaluable experience from every single job I had worked. And when my friend mentioned ""higher education,"" as a way of learning new skills, I heard it as as ""hired education."" When he corrected me, I said, ""no, HIRED EDUCATION... that's totally a thing!"" And the rest is history. --Michelle Dos SantosWe began productionon the show in September 2017. Since then, we've shot two and half episodes, plus the awesome promo video you see here. How did we make this happen? We pulled together our resources to assemble a filmmaking team comprised of industry professionals who have years of experience and who just love the project. It's really become a family atmosphere amongst cast and crew (we literally recruited family members).Speaking of cast, we worked tirelessly to find talented actors who could bring the writing to life and add a whole new dimension to the characters and their world. We held auditions after auditions, then callbacks after callbacks to find the right people. We made a commitment that if we didn't find the best talent who could embody these characters like no other, we would push production back. Thankfully, we found the right people!And we have to say... not only are these actors super talented, they're also really hilarious (at least we think so). And we're proud to say, that we have a female-driven cast... So let's get to introductions!""I wanted to do the project because of the writing, that's what drew me in right away... I thought the concept for the series was so fun, and to be backed up with great writing is a dream come true for me."" --Keeley Bright""I'm extremely thankful to be a part of this production with a very talented cast and crew, and can't wait to show everyone the magic we've created."" --Madison Brown“As an actor, you can only hope to work on material and projects that inspire you and challenge you.

The Pilot episode has six different locations. Each subsequent episode will have one new workplace location unique to the episode in addition to recurring locations. We believe in transparency, so here's a breakdown of our budget:Why does the pilot have so many locations? To effectively tell Adriana's story, we have to start from the beginning. That includes sharing her story as a med student and establishing all the locations that will be recurring throughout the series. These locations are essential to the story and believe us when we say, there's a reason why Michelle chose the locations she did. Every location has a purpose and tells a story within this much bigger story.Having so many locations must get expensive. How do you plan to budget for locations if the locations are always changing? Our strategy is simple: We plan to shoot by location rather than by episode. First, we shoot at the locations that are unique to the Pilot and second episode. Then, once we secure the recurring locations (that are in the pilot), we'll plan our shooting schedule to film 2 more scenes (same location) from 2 different episodes.So how many episodes exactly will you be filming? We plan to use money raised to shoot two episodes (the Pilot and Episode 102) as well as finish the last two scenes of an episode we began production on. If we exceed our goal, we will re-evaluate our budget so that we can shoot even more episodes. We just really like making stuff!How many episodes will air in the first season? The first season will be comprised of 10 episodes.Three episodes will be released beginning February 2018. We also have a Halloween Special that was released as a pre-promo to the promo (seriously). You can watch below!Where and when can I watch the show?Kickstarter Backers will have the opportunity to attend a live screening of the first three episodes. Episodes will be available to watch on YouTube and on our website,www.hirededucationwebseries.com beginning February 2018.How long is each episode? Each episode is approximately 8-10 minutes in length. Shorter in the case of ""promo"" and ""specials"" episodes, which are about 4-6 minutes in length.What is your long term plan for the show? Our goal is to continue producing the show for as long as the audience enjoys watching it and the actors love acting in it. It's such a fun dynamic on set and Michelle gets (overly) excited writing every single episode and is constantly developing more episodes on paper every day... in fact, she's probably writing one now as you're reading this. And yes, we would love the series to ""take off"" and be distributed on a larger platform but we cannot promise anything. We CAN be optimistic though. We're good at that!Take a look at us doing what we do best - having fun!","Each individual working on this production was hand-picked because of their talent, merit and work ethic.

What you give will go to help provide an income for the artist and allow you to get your hands on an early copy of the first volume.Polarized is about two brothers who have been hiding their special attributes from the world and are forced into revealing themselves when they are confronted with situations that they can resolve. These acts label them as threats and they have to take off to try and keep the life they had before or else their could be world splitting results. Lukas and Cole are our main characters and have the ability to manipulate polarities of ground based material and have enhanced strength. Note: All prints have a chance to be signed and all prints will ship in November through all reward packages.,"The biggest challenge is how to get the words of the script to change into amazing artwork that will impress.  This kickstarter's goal is to help get this over the top and clear this major hurdle.  I am actively working to find an artist for this project while working on the script, but not having anything upfront is hurting and limiting finding an artist to work on this project.",https://www.kickstarter.com/projects/polarized/polarized-awakening?ref=discovery_category_newest,polarized/polarized-awakening,"What would you do if you had powers? Would you hide them or would you use them to rule? What if you wanted to use them to protect, but everyone you love told you not to. Would you take a chance at protecting when it came walking through the door? How would you react when you knew that you could help? This is a story of just that. A family that doesn't want their lives to change even though they have special gifts. They don't want to be used. They, however, will try to control what they can as their world gets turned upside down. Two brothers will have to figure out how to properly work with the government and understand what their relationship will be with them.

My aim with your support is to purchase enough fleece to be able to send them to woolen mill for processing into beautiful Irish yarn, the wool is zwartble but I also hope to mix with alpaca to create a soft yarn also develop some roving.As a crafter and felter I understand the joy of finding a beautiful local yarn or roving. For me knowing that the possibility of having these fleeces not only educate local children form the beginning stages, there is a full circle, with the possibility of parents creating something for their children either wearable a hat or a soft knitted toy. I also hope to bring these home crafts to local school children as kits for kids introducing fiber art.Simply Felt Ireland is already an online shop and also available to local craft shops which offers unique handmade fiber art, but now I wish to take my business to another level. I plan to offer my current customers and future new customer a beautiful selection of local yarn, fiber art yarn and roving.I also have experience of spinning my own wool on a drop spindle I love to spin when I am not needle felting it is fascinating to watch the yarn develop before your own eyes. The satisfaction of stepping back when you are finished to admire the beautiful colourful yarn you have just created if second to none.Simply Felt Ireland is now in business two years and growing and because I have not taken a salary all profit has been reinvested to developing new items and building a brand.In a previous life I developed a bushiness supporting deaf children and publishing books and ran the business for ten years with my wonderful supportive Husband who is also Deaf .I have the experience, knowledge, passion and motivation to create and provide a beautiful local yarn and roving to be proud of not only by myself to the local community and community crafters.

(I'm convinced that why its called a drop spindle.)It also means I will have to be the sample knitter and needle felter, PR manager,negotiator, social media developer, salesperson, deliveryman, just ton name a few.

With over 80 recipes using giardiniera (and over a dozen more recipes that are just essential Chicago) I am introducing giardiniera as an ingredient to the kitchens of people all over the country. Traditionally, Chicago giardiniera is used as a condiment or an antipasto, but our giardiniera is made with so many spices that our oil is an ingredient all it's own.I've been making Chicago Johnny's Giardiniera since 2009 & have been selling since 2011. For the last 9 years I've been making unique recipes & using giardiniera in ways that no one else has thought of. Typically, Chicago style giardiniera is used as a condiment on Italian beef sandwiches, on pizzas, & as an antipasto. For me, giardiniera is a blank canvas of opportunity. Our giardiniera is hand made in Chicago with olive oil & sea salt. I use more than 5 times the spices as other giardiniera, & this gives us the opportunity to utilize our seasoned oil in ways other giardiniera just can't.A little bit about the recipes. We have a rating system on the recipes that show you how complex or more simple a recipe is. Some of our recipes are fairly intense to make, others are simple to make. We have snacks (spreads, dips, quesos...), appetizers (Italian beef egg rolls, giardiniera bread, poppers...), & entrees (giardiniera roasted cauliflower, my Italian beef recipe, pastas....). Recipes range from beef to vegan & many things in between.I've been working in the kitchen for over twenty years honing my culinary craft.

In addition to many challenges monarch butterflies face, listed above, there has been a pronounced native milkweed shortage. Monarchs depend on milkweed for their survival and the current trends are worrisome.Native milkweed (when in bloom) not only attracts monarch butterflies but also numerous other pollinators. Recent research shows that bees are not the only insects important for pollination. Butterflies, beetles, and other insects are also important as they add a much-needed variety and there has been a worrisome decline in species that pollinate because wildflowers, milkweed and other nectar sources have been systematically eliminated.Even the UN report recently warned that ""many species of wild bees, butterflies and other critters that pollinate plants are shrinking toward extinction"".Anyone who has tried to grow native milkweed from seed knows that it is a challenging and slow process, often with uncertain results. Monarchs need a good supply of milkweed to stave off starvation starting at the caterpillar stage because breakdown in just one generation could negatively affect the entire migration. We offer high-quality well-established plugs that are ready to be planted and will grow in no time.Your subscription will allow you to add new plants on a regular basis, giving the plants time to recover and allowing you to grow your butterfly habitat at your own pace. Planting milkweed plugs in the fall will help your milkweed to establish better and sprout faster the following spring. Planting plugs in the spring and/or summer will give you vibrant plants ready to welcome migrating monarchs and their hungry caterpillars. Having a well-established, vibrant and blooming native milkweed habitat will also help the fourth generation to fuel on much-needed nectar crucial to successful migration. You can still plant seeds, but our subscription will give you peace of mind with a steady supply of milkweed plants just when the monarch butterflies need them the most.We offer two basic rewards and three rewards with advanced levels of subscription.Monarch Supporter and Monarch Starter help to spread the word about saving monarch butterflies and building habitats.Caterpillar Helper, Pupa Master, and Monarch Savior subscriptions each include packages of milkweed plugs to get you well on your way to building a monarch habitat.The Caterpillar Helper subscription includes 15 native milkweed organic plants plugs sent to you once a year. You can select the season (spring, summer or fall).The Pupa Master subscription includes 30 native milkweed organic plants plugs sent to you twice a year during the seasons you choose. You can select two out of three seasons (spring, summer or fall).The Monarch Savior option is our full subscription by which you will receive 45 native milkweed organic plants plugs sent to you three times per year: spring, summer and fall.We are offering four native milkweed species: Asclepias incarnata, Asclepias syriaca, Asclepias tuberosa and Asclepias verticillata. We will mix and match these species based on their availability and your region, as not all species will thrive in all states.We offer an exciting but limited early bird option where first 15 backers will receive the Monarch Savior package for the year (2016) plus our rain gauge and our famous Monarch Butterfly Survival Kit, which you can keep or gift to someone to hook them up with a way to help monarch butterflies! Yes! Your subscription will include both our monthly newsletter about recent monarch butterfly updates and research and our support email option, where you can ask questions about issues you might encounter with your monarch butterfly habitat.","Native milkweed shipment might be delayed due to weather and availability, but we do not expect the delay to be longer than few weeks. The native milkweed growth rate will depend on your location, climate, and other factors, but we will provide instructions for the best and most optimal growth. Milkweed is a poisonous plant (that’s why monarch caterpillars love it so much!), so be careful around it, as its sap is toxic. Do not rub your eyes after handling milkweed, do not ingest milkweed, and keep milkweed away from children, pets and livestock.",https://www.kickstarter.com/projects/1970344518/monarch-butterfly-habitat-restoration-project?ref=discovery_category_newest,1970344518/monarch-butterfly-habitat-restoration-project,"Recent numbers show that the monarch butterfly population further dropped 27% in 2016, continuing the downward trend where overall population dropped by 80% since the 1990’s. The reasons for the decline are many including extensive native milkweed losses, insecticides, and pesticide use, climate change, and loss of habitat in wintering grounds in Mexico. Milkweed is the only host plant monarch butterflies can use for reproduction. There has been a significant reduction of native milkweed plants across the country. Native milkweed is a perfect host plant for monarch butterflies, as it is organic, it provides a variety of host plants (different milkweed species), and it actually helps not just monarchs but also other pollinators. Milkweed blooms attract a variety of pollinators and recent study showed that plaintive native plants actually help to boost pollination. Typically, it was believed that the focus of planting milkweed should be mainly on Midwestern States, as it appeared that the majority of monarch butterflies come from these areas. However, a recent study showed that nearly 40% come from other parts, where 12% of monarch butterflies originated in the northwestern US, 17% were born in north-central states and Ontario, 15% were from northeastern US, and 11% were born in the southeastern US. This project is designed for monarch butterfly habitat restoration. You can be a part of it and there are several ways you can participate. The main idea is to plant native milkweed patches for monarch butterflies. Based on previous research, it appears that a patch of around 20 milkweed plugs could produce a self-sustaining milkweed patch that could persist over years and provide an important breeding and feeding habitat for monarch butterflies and other pollinators. Native milkweed patches not only serve as a breeding area by providing host plants, but also serve as fueling stations during fall migration, let alone attract numerous other pollinators apart from monarch butterflies.We offer several ways of participating. You can be a project supporter and we will plant the native milkweed patches here in Florida on your behalf. Or, you can plant your own native milkweed patch in your garden or a wildlife area suitable for native milkweed and safe for wildlife, livestock, and people. Select your level of reward and start helping monarch butterflies!Each species does better in the habitat suitable for them. For example A. tuberosa does very well in dry, sunny areas, while A. incarnata does better in wetter areas. You will receive growing instructions for your milkweed plugs. This project will use what is called “landscape plugs,” young plants with well-developed roots ready to be planted once you receive them. All plants are 100% organic, have not been sprayed by any sort of chemicals, and are 100% safe for monarch butterflies. Important: The plants you will receive are habitat restoration plants; they are not commercial nursery plants grown for their aesthetic value. Instead, habitat restoration plants are grown to have a well-established root system, ready to be planted, and to adapt to their new home. This project is open for everyone who wants to help monarch butterflies to survive. If you do not have a garden or a yard, you still can participate and restore monarch butterfly habitat in suitable native areas. Since the downward population decline trend is more likely to continue, struggling monarch butterflies can use all of the help they can get! Let’s help these amazing butterflies together!","While native milkweed is less toxic than tropical milkweed, it is still toxic and has to be handled carefully. Milkweed sap is toxic, so make sure it is not rubbed into your eyes, or ingested by pets, livestock, or children. When planting your native milkweed patch, choose areas that are suitable for the plants, but are also safe for people, pets, and livestock. Since plants are grown for habitat restoration, they might not look aesthetically pleasing, but they will be healthy, robust plants with well-developed root systems ready for planting. Since plants will be shipped via postal service, we cannot be responsible for any potential damage occurring during shipping. Sometimes shipping can be delayed due to weather and availability. The rate of growth will depend on selected location, climate, and other factors, but you will receive detailed growing instructions."

There is a troubling level of division, culturalmalaise and political instability. There are also, as the great gift of freedomin America would have it, many people with microphones, podiums and airtime.There is a lot of noise. A lot of it is not helping.WitnessStand: Americawill bring to the “talking head” arena - balance, anacademic-style approach, and a preoccupationwith logic. Instead ofconducting a war as it were between guests and participants on the show,Witness Stand: America will be more inquisitive.Forexample, ""What is the Democrat Party platform?What is the RepublicanParty platform? What is capitalism? What is the rationale for taxation in the UnitedStates? What truly underlies race relations in America? How are males andfemales different?,""are the types of questions this show will ask.Then, after accumulating hopefully adequate factual information around a giventopic, the facts should lead the participants to the next logical place. Truthshould prevail.Atthe end of the day, Witness Stand: Americawillleave viewers with anunderstanding of “why” persons hold the positions they do on given topics. Theshow will not seek to convince anyone to embrace or relinquisha point ofthe view. Instead the show will seek to get Americans to “calm down” and“listen” to one another. When each does that, a level of mutual respect shouldgrow even if participants and viewers remain committed to opposing views.Theshow is planned for television although initial episodes may begin on the WorldWide Web.Severalproduction companies are candidates toproduce these talk shows for us.Appropriate cameras, proper audio, proper lighting, and good scripting are ofcourse absolute prerequisites for success. However there are options within theseelements. There are crews with relatively little experience up to crews with Award-winningpersonnel. Utilization of the highest level of expertise and preparedness isour goal.However,‘content is king,’ as a famous local author writes in his book. We want thisshow on the air. America needs Witness Stand: America. So depending on theresults of this campaign plus other budget possibilities, at least one to two30 minute shows will air by the fall of 2015.This$1,500 campaign will cover 12-15% of the cost oftwo 30 minute shows using higher-end talent with multiplecameras. Our plan is to fund the difference andpresent the shows as a “Pilot” to various networks. ","We have been working television and film production projects since 2013 and have learned many lessons. Different events can create risk and imperil success, and we have faced many of them. Cast and crew scheduling conflicts, equipment failure, budget challenges, television station specification requirements, are a few of the types of challenges that can be faced.  To mitigate risk and give success the highest chance, we have learned to increase time spent in pre-production. We plan more. We also have worked with various personnel over time, and have come a long way in practicing selection of the most reliable, capable, and professional.",https://www.kickstarter.com/projects/theworld2024/the-head-coach?ref=discovery_category_newest,theworld2024/the-head-coach,"We are producing this drama episode with a good splash of comedy mixed in to speak to some current issues in America.The displayed video is a trailer from one of our episodes presently available on Amazon, ""The Pugilist.""In particular, ""The Head Coach,"" will speak to the playing of the national anthem at sports events and why the ritual is respected by a majority of Americans.""Trial 2020"" is a program that delivers online episodes about America's challenges defining right and wrong. There are right ways and wrong ways to have grievances addressed in America.Your pre-purchase of the episode will help defray about 14% of the total cost of production. We are using one of four Phoenix-area production companies to provide camera, audio and lighting equipment. Along with that they will provide cinematography, editing and other operating expertise. We have to pay for make-up and set design articles, locations, the cast and certain administrative services. A Director may come with the production company or we will have to secure one as well.",We have to secure the star of the show and get him to Phoenix for the shoots. We have to come up with some up-front payment to a production company if all of them make that requirement. We have to secure an athletic facility in Chandler. We have overcome such hurdles before in completing the episodes currently available on Amazon. We believe will deliver this important episode to America.

The full goal for the commissioning initiative is $20,000, the amount needed for a 20 minute work composed by a world class composer.  We have two such composers on our short list, already approached and VERY interested in the project.  Our audiences have contributed almost $5000 over two concert seasons toward this project, and are desirous of the quality product we hope to commission.  Grants are being written to account for the rest of the commissioning fee.  Of course, if our Kickstarter goal is exceeded, we won't complain.  The fundraising is the hardest part of this project.  While funding the actual performance by an ensemble of 13 players is a bit beyond what we normally do, this is not anticipated to be a major obstacle.We have high confidence in the choice of possible composers.  They are highly esteemed in their field, one a Grammy Award nominee.  Both have expressed finding inspiration in the project and associated scenario.  However, the composers' busy schedules might interfere with a timely completion of the piece, although once the commission is accepted, there is no worry about it being completed.We have back up plans if our fundraising goals are not reached. We could simply commission a shorter work, or reach out to young up-and-coming composers, of which there is no shortage in our area.  They deserve to be heard, too.Although, the funding sought here is focused on the commission itself, long term goals include multiple performances of the piece and a collaborative project with a local dance company.

On the agenda was the future of Hop River Chamber Music (HRCM). Among the ideas brainstormed was the thought to a commission a piece to be premiered by the Hop River musicians. The directors became very excited at this idea and a small committee was formed to explore the idea.There was a wide variety of options on the table; a call for scores, a competition, getting a student from one of the local universities to compose for free, and others among them.You can see how the budgetary bottom line seemed to be driving the discussion, rather than the quality of the piece being commissioned.Soon we realized that if we were going through all this trouble, why not make a significant difference to the chamber music scene. When highly qualified composers can get $1000 or more per minute of music they write, we knew this was a HUGE step for us to take.As chairperson of the committee, I wished to utilize the considerable strengths of HRCM and the vast local talent. Using as many of our regular players as possible was a major concern, and when one director suggested a chamber orchestra piece like ""Appalachian Spring,"" we finally seemed to have a focus for our efforts. A comprehensive list of distinguished local composers was compiled and the directors listened to samples of their music. A short list of two remained.It wasn't until the inspiration for a ballet scenario came to me that this seemed to be a real opportunity to create something of lasting value. The idea was broached to the two candidates, and both immediately felt a connection to the idea. Choosing one over the other was very difficult. I could see the passion and skill set each could bring to the project and HRCM would be very well served by either of them.Ultimately, the commission was offered to Kenneth Fuchs and the rest of this history remains to be seen.The Composition's RequirementsThe piece is conceivedas a stand-alone work, although its inherent dramatic/choreographicpossibilities will be apparent and highlighted. Hop River Chamber Music expectsto premiere the work in concert in July 2018 and then collaborate with a localdance company to present it as a dramatic work within a year afterward. The intent is tocreate a work of linked episodes, although a suite of 4 or more “scenes” mightbetter represent the concept.The full instrumentation is: FluteClarinet Bassoon Piano 4 Violins 2 Violas 2 Violincellos1Double BassA portion of the work will be suitable for performance whenexcerpted from the whole work, scored for a subset of the full instrumentation.eg.

Want to know what convinced me to give it a shot? 11 hours in a tattoo chair with a very convincing tattoo artist. And I could not be any happier that I took his advice. This happened in September of 2019 following a separation/divorce filing by my soon to be ex-wife. Art pulled me up by my bootstraps. It is now January, 4 short months later, and I am already creating realistic drawings in both graphite and colored pencil as well as captivating abstract paintings.
