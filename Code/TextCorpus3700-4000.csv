With your HELP we plan on using the funding to create a few new jobs and bring on a couple of programmers to develop the app and assist out other developers with the supporting platforms. Bookedyou already has multiple business' and universities interested in implementing the service.

We promise it will be an added benefit to your life so have fun and always remember: BOOK LIFE. LIVE LIFE",The only challenge that concerns us most is privacy and security. At Bookedyou we take this matter seriously.  The privacy of our users is without question the thing that tops our list of challenges to tackle. That's why part of the funding used will go to ensuring that we have effective security technology.,https://www.kickstarter.com/projects/1972403344/taleprints?ref=discovery_category_newest,1972403344/taleprints,"There is a growing concern that is affecting our children and the generations that will follow. They seem to be swimming toward a dark cloud of blissful ignorance. Ignorance that doesn’t allow them to explore a vital aspect of their mind, and that aspect is their imagination.  Many of our children today are focusing much, if not all; of their attention on things that are diverting their minds from what is essential for human beings to reach the next level of the social evolution.  Being able to explore your imagination and bring those visions to life if the single entity that allows humans to remain at the pinnacle of all living creatures. However this vary ability is being taken for granted and neglected. And like all things neglected eventually they become too dull to be of any use and effectiveness. Our future generations are fast moving to a society that is solely governed on animalistic desire rather than reason and contemplation.  In this plan we will explain not only the issues but also unique solutions for those issue. How you many wonder; well simple put “writing” or more specifically “Collective Writing.” The projects name is TalePrints, and to understand this vision you will have to use your Imagination.What is TalePrints.com and how it works briefly?Like we mentioned in the introduction, there is a growing issue with our future generation not maximizing their imaginations full potential. One of the major issues contributing to this problem is lack of interest in writing and reading in our youth. Children are constantly be bombarded with movies, games and superficial media that, although they are imaginative, ironically they are the main culprits adding to this unwanted phenomenon. TalePrints.com is a new computer program that will work with schools to get children to utilize their inner minds and train it to extract the wonders they could conjure up with just contemplation. As an example and to simplify its explanation, let us imagine a classroom or thirty children aged between 11 and 12 years. We then break down these children into six groups of five children per group. Then, each of these groups will have to choose a leader (the preferred way), or a teacher can appoint one. The chosen leader will then have the task of beginning a story and ensuring that the others in the group don’t stray to far from the leaders main vision (of course, there are rules and limitation to the leaders control and power). Once the leader has started the story each group member will follow suit and add to the story but they to will have rules and limitations to follow. At the end of a specified time period the stories will then be complete, edited and printed. Parents will then be giving the option to buy these books for themselves thus ensuring the survival of this project for future generations. That is just a simple explanation of this project, and we are confident of its success but just in case, we have other enticing features to further capture their imaginations and channel them toward a competitive style of this exercise. ",The only challenges that we could potentially see is with the publishing companies that we use to print the books out for us. However this is a minor issue that could easily be solved should it arise.
https://www.kickstarter.com/projects/123teamcotton/mike-and-cjs-spectacular-shorts?ref=discovery_category_newest,123teamcotton/mike-and-cjs-spectacular-shorts,"Hello Fellow Friends,My name is Ronnie. I am the father of both Mike and CJ. They have young aspirations of becoming famous by having their own kids televison show. We've tried Nickelodeon and Disney to name a few, but the competition is fierce and the pursuit is extremely expensive. Not to mention we would have to relocate to California. With todays technology and social media networks, we have decided to start our own televison show using youtube and facebook videos. We want to be as innovative as possible. That's where we need your help! We would need hardware like microphones, cameras, computers, etc. and software to edit, produce, and render each episode. As a start, the show will be called ""Mike and CJs Spectacular Shorts"". Shorts meaning 2 to 5 minutes episodes of Mike and CJs goofy and hilarious adventures and shenanigans.We will also need to market and create buzz. We hope this obstacle will be overcome by word of mouth like sharing through social media and funds will be used to hire professionals through a marketing firm.I am the sole provider for my family who wants the best for my kids. I am not a father who is forcing fame on his children in order gain financial success. This is THEIR dream and I want to help them make it a reality! I am happy with whatever they choose to be and feel I am already rich and famous waking up each day with them in my life. Like all fathers should feel.The video intro of this project is just a taste, but I cannot tell you how funny, intelligent, and charismatic these two young boys are! They have convinced me through their personalities and actions how much they deserve to seen by the rest of the world! Please join us on our quest to be one of the few God fearing families whose mission is show the world that not all of it is bad and you don't have to sacrifice your morals for fame and fortune. You can be yourself and just have fun doing what you love!!! Thanks in advance!!!","Here are some risks and challenges we may encounter...Marketing:  We will need a youtube channel, facebook page, and personal website.  We will also need to a professional photographer for promotional pics. Also a stylist to help match their fashion sense with their personalities. The plan:  In the beginning we will consume all free resources like facebook and youtube.  Creating a channel and page is not hard and we will market ourselves by simply sharing our media with friends and family.  We will research the market and find out target audience which will include children ages 4-12 and parents 25-35 years of age.  I also plan to hit the pavement by reaching out to schools, daycares, and churches to name a few to spread the word about the show.  An idea is to also have live show performances at these establishments.Tools Needed for the Show:  As the show grows we would need multiple computers, tablets, laptops with a high memory capacity and the latest software.  Installed on these devices we will need video editing and recording software, audio software, mastering and mixing software, Not to mention add on hardware like printers, external memory devices and even simply cords are expensive.The show would need many mics, cams, lighting devices, etc as well.The plan:  To start we will work with we have...right now we have the latest smart phones and mics.  We also have a decent pc and are currently using free software to edit and produce shows.  So far so good.  As demand increases and the more people back this project gradually our tools will upgrade.  In addition to kickstarter, we will sell merchandise to raise funds like shirts, posters, hats, and sell food to our families, friends, and fanbase.The BIGGEST CHALLENGE:  Being independent has its difficulties.  I still have to work and the boys still have to go to school.  Many times our schedules will conflict with times to record shows.  Sometimes I work long days and they are sleep when I get home.  Finding time to do stuff could become a problem.THE SOLUTION:  The best moments are when things aren't planned.  We already have tons of videos that me and my wife have recorded of them being naturally silly.  We will use those to start.  I have also taught them how to use their tablets and record themselves whenever they have fun and cool ideas.  Neat huh?  Also my wife is a stay at home mom and has time to do what I can't.  As the show grows and their is a decent amount of income coming in I could get a part time job to be at home more and dedicate more time to this project!  But right now quitting my job would not sit good with the wife! lol.Your help is appreciated!",https://www.kickstarter.com/projects/123teamcotton/123teamcotton-the-vlog?ref=discovery_category_newest,123teamcotton/123teamcotton-the-vlog,"Greeting Friends!My name is Ronnie aka TheKing @123teamcotton!

Over time we thought it would be a great idea to make it something BIGGER!!!!The world is scarse when it comes to good, clean, christian entertainment! We want to bring more of that to the table and show the world that families like the iconic ""Huxtables"" still exist! However, we need your help in doing this!!!The funds raised will help us bring our project to a wider audience through the following:Currently, we do everything on the tightest budget possible, but to be able to stand next to the BIG BOYS in our categories, we need to be striving to be equipped with the best!!!We do everything as a family and learn and teach each other as we go!!! We don't mind rolling up our sleeves until we are in a position to hire a staff to help us along the way in the future! All pledges are appreciated!We have a plan to reach the masses! We have the research complete! We know our brand and our target audience! Not to mention we know we have God the father in our corner!!!

Out of Southern California, Prime Blaq (Artist) and Jo Jo (Producer) come together for a priceless West Coast collaborative classic called ""Dog Whistle."" We plan to make a double-disc deluxe album jam-packed with cold lyrics over hot beats.This album is intended to aim focus on the present time life we all desire to live or not want to live. Dog Whistle sends a direct message from the songs to the hearts and soul of everyone who it relates to around the world. This album's energy comes from a personal and societal perspective that is not being discussed through music on a consistent basis. We got the idea to accomplish this due to the on-going conversations we were having with people all over the world that were having the same frustrations and concerns dealing with their communities and the elite controlling their lives. This album is for the everyday worker, women of color, and the youth looking for a new voice of the community. We need your support financially to reach our goals of completing this album. We need your support with studio cost, music video budget, advertising and marketing, and brand merchandising. We have five songs done so far that we want to release to the world so you can listen to what you are supporting. We want to accomplish our goal by April 20th (4/20 for you weed head lol). We truly care about getting this message out across the world to get people on board with our movement. This movement cares about the nobodies, underdogs, forgotten, overlooked, unorthodox, and special people who are looking something monumental to stand beside. We truly thank you for your continued love and support in our endeavors. Please follow us on social media @primeblaq and @creativeoutlets1 ",We are in the process of completing this album. we can always run into technical issues where the equipment clonks out on us. We can run into not having the quality we are seeking. We can run into not having the right people on our team pulling their weight. We can run into not having the financial backing to support everything fully that we need covered.

I also live close to a hospital (which I hope I will not have to use). If need be, I will have my brother, who will also be helping me complete this project, drive me or me drive him to the hospital. Everything and every challenge is never hard enough to overcome with the proper motivation and will power. I believe I have those attributes with everyone's help and support."

There are language programs that exist today that set up people up for failure right off the bat. Some of the most popular computer programs promise people fluency when all they are really doing is selling people flashcards and a shiny.We have a different vision here at native pace. We consider ourselves visionaries and want to rethink the way the world learns from the ground up. The current programs aren't working. The best way to learn another language is to move to another country. Unfortunately not everyone has this opportunity. It's expensive and usually the visa poses a challenge. Our vision at native pace is to give people the opportunity to hear native speakers speak at a native pace. We want to bring the everyday spoken language to anyone that wants to learn.

Other apps and internet programs tell you that you can learn a language in a matter of weeks, some even go so far to say you can learn to become conversational in a matter of hours. This simply is not true and such companies make money by making people feel good rather than actually helping them. Learning a language takes a lot of work. This is the reality. When you think about a language, it's huge. There are a ton of new things you will have to learn and this will take time and there's no way around it. When you learn one word at a time, or worse one word at a time plus waiting for the screen to load each time, you will never reach fluency. If you want to become fluent you need a large volume of information in a short period of time. That's where we come in.

A much larger percentage eat some form of vegetarian diet. Prominent animal rights activist GaryYourofsky says there are 4 main reasons people eat animal food products. One of those reasons is CONVENIENCE. And that's the main focus on this project. While we care a lot about food quality, and providing tasty, nutritious food, we don't aim to be the leader in these areas. Our main goal is simply to try to offset the advantage in convenience that animal-based food products currently have in the marketplace.Vegan Lunch DeliveryOur goal is to use technology to make eating at least 1 vegan meal a day really simple, affordable and just plain easy. Our menu will be small but provide enough options that you could eat lunch 5-days a week from it without having the same combination of meals twice. We will provide an online ordering system and delivery within the downtown of Vancouver for maximum convenience. In addition to same-day ordering, we will also offer an order schedule. This will allow our customers for instance to preorder lunches 2-days per week for an entire month.Food Freedom Delivery Food SecurityVeganCafe.ca is partly about delivering food to vegans. It's also about helping non-vegans make the transition. One way we plan to help in that effort is through our Food Freedom Menu. This menu is a selection of affordable, simple vegan foods which we will distribute for free. A portion of all our sales will go to support this program, and we will also seek volunteers to minimize the costs to support it. We hope to deliver thousands of free vegan meals to people in need of food security throughout Vancouver and in doing that, help educate recipients about eating vegan.","Our first challenge is to find a suitable commissary kitchen to work from. If we had more funding we'd start our own kitchen but as a stepping stone we plan to rent space in an existing kitchen. We have several leads on kitchens already but so far these are all kitchens that have non-vegan food prepared there. While this is an acceptable plan B for us at this time, we would definitely to find a fully vegan kitchen such as partnering with an existing vegan restaurant that does not offer lunch service or has extra space.Our second challenge is logistics, setting up our delivery system. We're still determining whether we will hire our own delivery drivers or use a contracted service. We've contacted several existing delivery services and the challenge is most will only deliver orders received through their websites, whereas we plan to take orders off our own website and need those processed for delivery.

Not a vague brand name that can have any meaning. A brand name to represent commonly understood values considered empowering for women.The Mission:Establish a new brand representing the values that equality minded persons identify with.The Reward:A Venetian Glass Jewelry Jar to treasure your jewelry. Ideal for holding jewelry used daily. Large enough to hold watches with necklaces, bracelets, earrings, and rings.Project Objectives:Why is this different?Traditionally women align themselves with many fantastic brands that represent many things. But existing brands are not known to be a brand that strengthens and empowers women. They may suggest they assist women but rarely would we ever see a cosmetics brand sponsor female academic achievement or female sport.Why Amazonian Lady?An Amazonian Lady is a capable woman growing with confidence becoming a role model others seek to emulate. The Amazonian Lady brand is more than just a beauty or fashion brand, Amazonian Lady is a brand representing capable accomplished women that women could choose to align themselves to vote for equality and enable us to advocate for equality.Why this Jewelry Jar?The first product is this jewelry jar because it is related to the tradition of using gifts to communicate honor, thankfulness, love and respect for each other. This jewelry jar stores and treasures your gifted jewelry reinforcing these positive messages. Being made of Venetian Glass ensures you receive a high quality gift. It is also a very practical gift that will last a lifetime to become your heirloom to be passed down through generations. This jar will forever reinforce positive messages associated with jewelry gifts and gender equality.If you are gifting this Jewelry jar to someone then once you have made your Pledge, you can email this image to inform them their gift is on its way.Reward Options:You will see we also have non Venetian low priced rewards that you can gain. We have created Amazonian Lady branded recycled glass jars containing cosmetics clay mask. Both the jar and the mud mask are sourced from ancient Mesopotamia near the Mediterranean from the location rumored to be the source used by Cleopatra. As Cleopatra is an iconic Amazonian Lady then we feel creating this lower priced reward to enable more participants to be ideal.There is a low priced $300 Venetian Jar containing the same Cleopatra style mud mask as a limited alternative to combine Venetian glass with the mud mask.The Venetian Glass Jewelry Jar rewards are listed as follows:Gift Box:Each Jewelry Jar is delivered to you in the super high quality gift box you can see in these images.More about Amazonian Ladies:Who Are We?Soldiers know money and business is a more effective influence than bombs and bullets. Moving out of the special forces enabled Dean to study and work on this project to pursue peaceful positive change.With every purchase we make (anywhere) we all can decrease the need for soldiers to enforce human rights, as what we purchase, and how we spend our money, has bigger influence than whole armies.What is the ultimate objective?This initiative started in Dean's 2011 masters thesis. Now with society experiencing more refugees, demanding more equality, and experiencing global warming; combined with advances in blockchain technology, we have the required conditions to arm people with purchasing power. People are fed up with inaction from governments so we have to arm people with purchasing power to force suppliers and governments to uphold our values.This project is a first step towards our ultimate goal to empower a wider community to cause change aligned with values. If people care enough about female equality and us establishing a brand, known as the brand that empowers women, then we will know there is public sentiment to pursue our next ultimate project. Backers of this project will be invited to participate in the next ultimate project.The power in is your hands to force change.We seek to enable you to see suppliers transparently so you can know who benefits from every purchase you make. We aim to show you every cent you spend everywhere and who received those cents. We want you to see the values upheld by those suppliers that receive your money. We intend to increase the value of your money so that your money becomes a voting tool to achieve world wide outcomes you value. Collectively you will force governments to uphold and represent your values.The Future:In the near future people with be shocked to know we spent our money blindly enabling unethical things to happen. Banks are not allowed to launder money or facilitate the funding of terrorism. But as individuals we are funding many suppliers that do things against our values and we have been blind to it.For example, right now globally we have gender inequality, with women and men unknowingly purchasing products that contribute towards inequality. Many things we purchase have upstream suppliers working against our values. So Shopificaching is your interface to control your personal shopping data. designed as the process to enable everything you purchase to have greater influence on suppliers. With increased transparency on the values upheld by all the contributors for everything you purchase then for the first time in history, you, and every other conscientious person, will have the information to be able to decide if you want to continue purchasing that product or not. You will then be able to influence supermarkets and other retail outlets to stock only those items from suppliers that are aligned with your values.Every Journey Begins With One Step:This Kickstarter project is a first commercial step towards implementing Shopificaching in the form of the Amazonian Lady brand. Trademarked globally, to be the brand communicating support for female equality. When you have an Amazonian Lady product you are voting for the rights of women to experience equality. Amazonian ladies are capable, honorable, role models for all of us to admire and seek to emulate. So establishing this brand will show that people want to purchase products and services aligned with their values.Your pledge informs and enables momentum to establish Amazonian Lady as a major brand and to keep going towards establishing ShopificachingThe lowest funding goal is $10,000 to enable recovery of a small portion of start-up costs and gain confidence Kickstarter to launch the Shopificaching project. But ideally the more funds that can be received then the more chance there is of success for Amazonian Lady and Shopificaching. Without supporters it will take over two years to repay the money invested on this project. With four young children full time as the sole parent paying home mortgage, expenses are high. Recently elected to local government Dean is serious about causing positive change.",We have solved many obstacles so the only risk is the possible lack of public interest to support female advancement issues. We see how federal elections globally have surprised us so here we too can be surprised that the majority of people globally like women to be suppressed.1. We have trademarked the brand globally.2. We have completed some prototype products to prove suppliers are capable and these prototypes can be delivered before Christmas.3. We have courier contracts and packaging ready to immediately courier the Venetian product to you.,https://www.kickstarter.com/projects/2062505008/fix-climate-change?ref=discovery_category_newest,2062505008/fix-climate-change,"Climate Change is caused by government inaction to facilitate collective change so we must have a way to force governments to change. Governments have proven they are motivated by donations that keep them in power and that is why they are so easily led by lobbying self interest groups damaging to our environment.Only if we are united can we then influence governments to be more proactive and have more focus on our values and what the people want to see happen.We need your funding to cause sustainable change globally.We have designed the technical path for combining your purchasing power with other people similar to you to create lobbying power governments can not ignore. We now need your participation and if you live in an OECD country then you are a leader wealthy enough to participate to influence the world on to a better more sustainable path. We do not need billions or millions of people to participate. OECD counties contain 18% of the global population of around 1.4 billion people. If less than half of one percent of OECD people participate using our technical solution we call ""Shopificaching"" then we collectively can force change. With as few one hundred thousand people tracking their normal spending of around $50,000 a year we will then collectively have lobbying power of around Five Billion Dollars a year $5,000,000,000.There are some small examples of Shopificaching styled services that already help you direct your spending such as the Do credit card.Your alternative to being empowered by Shopificaching is to be victim of captology where large self interested tech firms use your data to profit from you for their own objectives. Right now the laws of economic gravity have already stopped working because:1. you have lost your equal access to data, 2. you no longer have transparency of the supply chain, and 3. big companies no longer have a shared moral framework.Shopifcaching restores the laws of economic gravity and will:1, Give you access to your data so you can have settings to maintain control over it and have it used for objectives aligned with your values.2, You will have transparency in the supply chains to have the knowledge you need to make more informed purchasing decisions.3, Your increased purchasing power as a result of being united with other moral people will influence suppliers to share your values and function morally.With Shopificaching individuals regain their rights over big business that will be reverted back to their role to serve the public. ( Could the banking royal commission spell the end of Friedmanism?, Alan Kohler, Sat 4 Jan 2020, 7:30am ABC Radio National Saturday Extra)Considering users will most likely will stay with Shopificaching for many years, if not all their life, then suppliers can expect at least $50 Billion in value of purchasing power from just 100,000 users and this is great influencing power for every user to ensure their values are upheld by suppliers. Shopificaching organises us increasing our purchasing power to push back on big business because every industry knows data is driving growth and $6 Trillion of growth opportunity is predicted for sales and supply chains. (Terje ""AI Could Add $6 Trillion to the Global Econimy"" Feelingstream May 29, 2018) as reported by McKinsey Feeling Stream. These companies will continue to disrupt the moral frameworks society rely on to function civilly unless we influence them to uphold values.The combined purchasing power for Shopificaching users will enable you to gain better value for just about everything you buy. On top of that you will be able to choose to be paid for your data that you will control in the Shopificaching software thus making the software fee of charge to users. Remember data privacy laws already exist preventing misuse of your data but unless you have Shopificaching you do not have a tool to know who has your data and how they use it to manipulate people.Dean visited Google in 2014 and discussed the inclusion of values in Google data but Google has not provided any interface for you to control your data.Why does Dean care? Because when you are prepared to risk your life to uphold human rights then it is very easy to risk persecution. We need to gain control over how companies use our data and our money to stop global catastrophe.For the last 15 years Dean and his Swiss based business partners have coded and developed commercial software used globally. Now with your support we are ready to use our skills to code Shopificaching. There already are partial examples of Shopificaching style processes around the globe so first steps are to work with and enhance leading examples. In Switzerland two supermarket chains already provide the public with their own interface to see the sustainable products that have been purchased. Such positive examples require less effort to gamify and bring in to a global database.1. If the $50,000 funding goal is achieved then we will be able to commission the making of a more professional film to attract funding.2. With $500,000 we will be able to technically structure a prototype and attract large investors.3. With over $1 Million we will be able to build and deploy a first stage working beta version and attract further funding.4. With over $10 Million we can have a full team building and deploying Shopificaching whilst generating self sustaining income.",The risk is if we do not receive enough funding then we can not gain enough attention to complete the steps required. If the idea is copied they do not have the details of the depth of functionality and value we will include and as this is an ethical trust based system then their trust will be undermined. The BAT and FAANG companies feed off of data as it is their fuel so they most likely will try to provide something similar that will not be neutral as it will be perceived to be favouring them.

https://www.kickstarter.com/projects/1972371942/the-charge-of-the-devastators-movie-project-midway?ref=discovery_category_newest,1972371942/the-charge-of-the-devastators-movie-project-midway,"....And yet most of the millions of people who owe their lives and their freedom to the men who made that charge on a fateful day in 1942 do  not even know it took place. My aim is to change all that, and you can help me do it! Having competed a screenplay that has already garnered critical acclaim and has had several ""near misses"" with noted Hollywood producers and directors, the time has come to get some crowd funding behind this project to get it moving forward into production. Through my own personally funded efforts (and no connections in the film industry) I was able to get very close on two occasions to getting this screenplay into production -- which speaks volumes about the impact, intensity, and power of the script itself and the true stories it tells of heroism and sacrifice in harrowing mortal combat. The prospects of pushing the project through to a funded production phase would be greatly enhanced by the funding that you can provide -- funding that will be used to ""kick start"" this script into becoming the blockbuster motion picture that it can be, a movie that will pay tribute to the great men of the greatest generation who laid it on the line for their country and the free world for generations to come.Like a lot of people, I derived my ideas about the battle of Midway from the 1976 Hollywood production Midway. Though the film spends over 45 total minutes portraying a fictional romance between an American aviator and an interred Japanese girl, only about two minutes of screen time are devoted to the torpedo squadron attacks, and just one squadron is briefly depicted. The time has come to tell the true story of Midway on the big screen, particularly focusing on the crucial role of the three torpedo squadrons who sacrificed all that day.The true nature of the Devastator's ""charge"" at Midway did not come to my attention until many years after i first viewed the movie Midway. I was listening to a radio program and heard a noted aviation author discussing the attack of Torpedo 8. I was so taken by his description that I began to read and research all I could find on Torpedo 8, whereupon I discovered that two other torpedo squadrons had attacked at Midway and also suffered catastrophic loses. All this took place around the time of the release of Saving Private Ryan, Steven Spielberg's epic D-Day/infantry warfare film whose stark combat realism and attention to detail set a new standard for war films. As I continued to research the charge itself and the role it played in the decisive. history changing American victory at Midway. I began to envision how powerful an impact a cinematic portrayal of the ""charge"" would be -- especially if captured with the same realism and power displayed in Saving Private Ryan. Indeed, the Battle of Midway's most riveting aspect -- as well as the most crucial key to the American victory -- all begins with  the ""charge” itself and its unprecedented nature -- three squadrons of obsolete Devastators attacking in succession,  roaring in at wave top level through a seemingly impenetrable shield of fighters and flack, desperately trying to strike at the same elite carriers and crews that had obliterated Pearl Harbor.  In the annals of warfare  there was never before anything like this ""charge"" and there will never be anything like it again. To accurately capture this action on the big screen utilizing both real replica airplanes and computer animation technology would unquestionably make for one of the mostriveting, exciting, and awesome portrayals of aerial combat, warfare and human drama in thehistoryof cinema, Add in the detailed, accurate accounts of various back stories and other true acts of valor and sacrifice that an army of screenwriters couldn't come up with, and you have the makings of what one Oscar winning producer told me would be ""a classic American film."" As a major motion picture,The Charge of the Devastators would do what has never before been done on the bigscreen: capture WWII aerial combat with the samerealismand intensity as Saving Private RyancapturedWWII infantry combat. In fact, The Charge of the Devastators would be the SavingPrivateRyan of carrier plane warfare in the Pacific -- an epic film portraying a harrowing battle that changed the course of history and saved millions of lives. In my quest to tell the true story ofthismonumental charge, I wanted to knowwhat it was like to be in Devastator on that fateful day, knowing you were in a crucial do or die fight while  knowing your chances of survival were next to nothing. What was going through the minds of these young American aviators as their hour of destiny approached? What was the scene like as they launched from their ships, and as they searched for the enemy over the open ocean? And what was it like to charge in against that massive armada, alone and without fighter escort in a plane nicknamed “The Flying Coffin” ?Through first hand accounts gleaned from years of research and interviews with the veterans who were there, The Charge of the Devastators puts you right in the cockpits of the charging Devastators as they roar in.  It tells the story of all the pertinent  decisions -- both simple and monumental -- and the amazing  twists of fate that led these men  to their destinies on that oceanic wilderness. Through painstaking research of first hand accounts, the script describes in detail what these men experienced every step of the way -- from their rushed and inadequate training days to the  day they headed to sea on an unknown mission, to the moment they found out what they were up against, to the hours before launch, the dramatic launches themselves,  the desperate search for the enemy, and the epic attack itself and its aftermath. The script also tells the untold story  I uncovered that traces the incredible  victory at Midway to the decision of a single Devastator squadron leader, whose willingness to sacrifice all -- coupled with the same  indomitable  fighting spirit displayed by his compatriots -- led to an incredible sequence of events that ultimately won the battle.But the unprecedented first hand accounts of battle don’t stop with just the Devastator crews. My script  also puts you in the cockpits of  Dauntless dive bombers screaming down on  enemy carriers from 20,000 feet with one pressure packed shot at scoring a hit. You'll be in the cockpits of  Wildcat and Buffalo fighters as they battle to the death against the far superior Japanese Zero. You'll be part of a gun crew aboard the carrier Yorktown, blasting away at enemy dive bombers that scream down from above, and torpedo planes that roar in low. As if  the epic “Charge”  itself and the other combat scenarios were not enough to set this story apart,  there are many other compelling elements that only add to  the story's unprecedented, transcendent nature. There's the backdrop of  the do or die nature of the battle, and the fact that the Japanese had been all but invincible  since they wrought epic destruction at  Pearl Harbor; plus you have the revenge factor of going after the same carriers and crews that had obliterated Pearl, and the fact that the U.S. was down to  its  last three remaining operational aircraft carriers. If the Japanese won at Midway, there was nothing left standing between them and the West Coast of America. Every one of the American combatants who fought that day knew they were truly defending their native soil and  families back home.  The impact of these factors  as they weighed on the minds of these men -- especially the young American aviators -- are thoroughly covered in this action pact script, all coming from first hand accounts. AN UNPRECEDENTED ACCOUNT OF AN UNPRECEDENTED BATTLETo create The Charge of the Devastators screenplay I spent years  traveling across the country at my own expense to attend reunions and  commemorations and  visit museums, military shows and displays -- basically  going anywhere I could to meet and interview the great veterans of the battle. Whether in person, by phone or through other correspondence  I did countless interviews with these veterans. I also read all the literature I could find on the battle and picked the brains of numerous scholars and historians, My research could not have been more extensive, and was all done to ensure that virtually 100% of the details of the combat sequences  depicted in my script would be  based on first hand accounts.I can say with assurance that a dramatic movie based on my completed script would be an unprecedented account of the battle. My  extensive research gives you the TRUE stories of combat as the veterans told them --  many of them never before published. The Charge of the Devastators would stand alone as a cinematic  portrayal of the Battle of Midway.  THERE IS A NEED FOR THIS FILM!The 1976 movie Midway was unfortunately based on a poorlyresearched, inauthentic Hollywoodscript that didn't even scratch the surface of telling the true story of this epic battle. As I stated, many people base their concept of the battle on this film. To date there has been nothing produced cinematically that comes close to capturing this epic carrier plane battle. Several years ago a major studio was ready to fund a new movie on the battle, but they were apparently unable to secure a decent script and the project faded away. But that interest as well as the near misses I had withseveralOscar winning producer/directors proves that there is interest in making a new movie about this battle. WHAT ALMOST ONCE WAS BUT WITH CROWD FUNDING COULD NOW BE...Before I even had a completed screenplay, a long treatment of the story found its way into the hands of a prominent Oscar winning producer. We had a lengthy sit down in his office where he made the comment that he thought the story would make for a ""classic American film."" He guessed that close to $200 million would be needed to fund the production. He wanted to produce the movie and had a name actor in mind for one of the lead roles. The producer needed $25,000 to begin work on the project. Unable to provide that type of funding, I could not take advantage of this great opportunity. But with your help, I can foray back into the the Hollywood fray, this time with some monetary backing that can secure a producer and get this film rolling! I would not expect to come close to getting full funding for the film through Kickstarter -- $200 million is a big number! But if I could secure my goal of $35,000, I would at least have enough money to travel to Hollywood and hire a name producer to start work on the project. ABOUT THE REWARDSGiven the fact that Kickstarter funding would be used to do just that -- ""kickstart"" the project into production mode, rather than fully fund the project -- my rewards cannot be based on the completion of a project the production of which would eventually be partly. mostly or even entirely out of my control. For that reason, part of my funding goal will be used to produce an epic page turner of a novel based on the already completed script. A BOOK WOULD BE AWESOME -- AND WOULD HELP SELL THE MOVIE! My original goal has always been and remains getting Devastators onto the big screen as the blockbuster epic film that I know it can be. But using part of my Kickstarter funding to produce a book of the same title can only enhance the chances of getting the movie produced. I can say with assurance that a dramatic book based on my completed script would be an unprecedented  written account of the battle.  Though many good books have been written on the subject, I've not seen anything resembling a dramatic portrayal in novel form like the one I am proposing -- a book that weaves in so many of the true intricate personal story lines while keeping strict accuracy with facts AND telling the complete story of all the combat action.My  extensive research gives my script and a subsequent book the TRUE stories of combat as the veterans told them --  many of them never before published. But instead of telling them in clinical, technical, interview format, the Devastators book will use the dialogue and descriptiveness of a fast moving movie script to bring the characters to life in a way that puts you right there with them in the action. But that's not all -- without the length restrictions that I had to consider in writing a screenplay, the book will include ALL the great stories I uncovered with my research, with nothing left on the cutting room floor. For all these reasons,   The Charge of the Devastators would stand alone either  as a literary or cinematic  portrayal of the Battle of Midway.FINAL THOUGHTSOf all the great reasons to get the ""Devastators"" story told, the most important is to create a well publicized, lasting tribute to the heroes who contributed so mightily to preservingour freedom and our very lives. Such a tribute is sadly lacking presently. The weakly scripted 1976 Hollywood movie on the subject was little more than a cursory look at the battle that ignored the numerous compelling personal stories, overlooked most of the combat aspects of the battle and devoted but a few brief scenes to the Devastators' ""charge."" As for the many well written but mostly clinically told literary accounts, the mainly technical and historical nature of these texts largely neglects the battle's many elements of intense human drama. Without the drawing power of a dramatic, exciting, ""best seller"" novel format, these literary works have failed to raise anywhere near the requisite interest and attention to the veterans that they rightly deserve. My desire in creating a movie and a dramatic literary account of the battle is to produce works that will have a massive appeal to the populous, getting all the stories out there for all the world to see as a tribute to the men who won freedom for millions worldwide.SO FEW of these men are still with us; and those that remain are all in their nineties -- my hope is to get this movie/book project completed as soon as possible so the few remaining veterans can experience this tribute to the bravery, heroism and sacrifice that they and their compatriots gave for their country and for the freedom of the world for generations to come. The need to recognize these men is simple when we realize how truly we owe them our lives and our freedom. As I interviewed one of these great veterans in his home, I gazed at pictures on his wall -- of children, grandchildren and great grandchildren -- as he told me of his numerous brushes with death that day -- a bullet wound a fraction of an inch from being fatal, nearly drowning after his Devastator crashed into the sea, finally getting a blood transfusion just minutes before certain death. I realized that had inches or minutes gone the other way, all the pictures on the wall, all those descendants, would not exist. For the many who never made it back that day, there would never be any future pictures on their walls. I then began to realize how many other lives were made possible by the victory at Midway. The crushing blow dealt to the Japanese was one from which they never recovered. It  put them on the defensive for the first time in the war, buying  America precious time to build better ships and planes to replace the obsolete equipment in use at the time.  Had America  lost at Midway, it would have been catastrophic. History would have been changed, and not for the better. The war would have gone on much longer. Tens of thousands,  even  hundreds of thousands  or maybe millions of additional lives would have to have been sacrificed for the U.S. and its allies  to gain ultimate victory over the tyrannical Japanese military regime and its Nazi ally  -- if victory could even have been won! The ripple effect of an American defeat at Midway would have meant that many thousands or even millions of future descendants across the world -- you and I perhaps -- would never have been born. We truly owe not just our freedom but in many cases our lives to the men who fought and sacrificed that day. HELP ME TELL THEIR STORY!

They took to the skies knowing the long odds they faced, well knowing that few would return -- yet when duty called, they answered, without delay, they answered, resoundingly, they rose to meet fate...

With the completed script serving as the basis for the book, completion will only be a matter of time.

My aim is to change all that, and you can help me do it!Having competed a screenplay that has already garnered critical acclaim and has had several ""near misses"" with noted Hollywood producers and directors, the time has come to get some crowd funding behind this project to get it moving forward into production.Through my own personally funded efforts (and no connections in the film industry) I was able to get very close on two occasions to getting this screenplay into production -- which speaks volumes about the impact, intensity, and power of the script itself and the true stories it tells of heroism and sacrifice in harrowing mortal combat. The prospects of pushing the project through to a funded production phase would be greatly enhanced by the funding that you can provide -- funding that will be used to ""kick start"" this script into becoming the blockbuster motion picture that it can be, a movie that will pay tribute to the great men of the greatest generation who laid it on the line for their country and the free world for generations to come.Like a lot of people, I derived my ideas about the battle of Midway from the 1976 Hollywood production Midway. Though the film spends over 45 total minutes portraying a fictional romance between an American aviator and an interred Japanese girl, only about two minutes of screen time are devoted to the torpedo squadron attacks, and just one squadron is briefly depicted. The time has come to tell the true story of Midway on the big screen, particularly focusing on the crucial role of the three torpedo squadrons who sacrificed all that day.The true nature of the Devastator's ""charge"" at Midway did not come to my attention until many years after I first viewed the movie Midway. I was listening to a radio program and heard a noted aviation author discussing the attack of Torpedo 8. I was so taken by his description that I began to read and research all I could find on Torpedo 8, whereupon I discovered that two other torpedo squadrons had attacked at Midway and also suffered catastrophic loses.All this took place around the time of the release of Saving Private Ryan, Steven Spielberg's epic D-Day/infantry warfare film whose stark combat realism and attention to detail set a new standard for war films. As I continued to research the charge itself and the role it played in the decisive. history changing American victory at Midway. I began to envision how powerful an impact a cinematic portrayal of the ""charge"" would be -- especially if captured with the same realism and power displayed in Saving Private Ryan.Indeed, the Battle of Midway's most riveting aspect -- as well as the most crucial key to the American victory -- all begins with the ""charge” itself and its unprecedented nature -- three squadrons of obsolete Devastators attacking in succession, roaring in at wave top level through a seemingly impenetrable shield of fighters and flack, desperately trying to strike at the same elite carriers and crews that had obliterated Pearl Harbor.In the annals of warfare there was never before anything like this ""charge"" and there will never be anything like it again. To accurately capture this action on the big screen utilizing both real replica airplanes and computer animation technology would unquestionably make for one of the most riveting, exciting, and awesome portrayals of aerial combat, warfare and human drama in the history of cinema, Add in the detailed, accurate accounts of various back stories and other TRUE acts of valor and sacrifice that an army of screenwriters couldn't come up with, and you have the makings of what one Oscar winning producer told me would be ""a classic American film.""As a major motion picture, The Charge of the Devastators would do what has never before been done on the big screen: capture WWII aerial combat with the same realism and intensity as Saving Private Ryan captured WWII infantry combat. In fact, The Charge of the Devastators would be the Saving Private Ryan of carrier plane warfare in the Pacific -- an epic film portraying a harrowing battle that changed the course of history and saved millions of lives.In my quest to tell the true story of this monumental charge, I wanted to know what it was like to be in Devastator on that fateful day, knowing you were in a crucial do or die fight while knowing your chances of survival were next to nothing. What was going through the minds of these young American aviators as their hour of destiny approached? What was the scene like as they launched from their ships, and as they searched for the enemy over the open ocean? And what was it like to charge in against that massive armada, alone and without fighter escort in a plane nicknamed “The Flying Coffin” ?Through first hand accounts gleaned from years of research and interviews with the veterans who were there, I'll put you right in the cockpits of the charging Devastators as they roar in. You will learn of the pertinent decisions -- both simple and monumental -- and the amazing twists of fate that led these men to their destinies on that oceanic wilderness. You'll know what they experienced every step of the way -- from their rushed and inadequate training days to the day they headed to sea on an unknown mission, to the moment they found out what they were up against, to the hours before launch, the dramatic launches themselves, the desperate search for the enemy, and the epic attack itself and its aftermath. You'll learn the untold story I uncovered that traces the incredible victory at Midway to the fateful decision of a single Devastator squadron leader, whose willingness to sacrifice all -- coupled with the same indomitable fighting spirit displayed by his compatriots -- led to an incredible sequence of events that ultimately won the battle.But the unprecedented first hand accounts of battle don’t stop with just the Devastator crews. My script also puts you in the cockpits of Dauntless dive bombers screaming down on enemy carriers from 20,000 feet with one pressure packed shot at scoring a hit. You'll be in the cockpits of Wildcat and Buffalo fighters as they battle to the death against the far superior Japanese Zero. You'll be part of a gun crew aboard the carrier Yorktown, blasting away at enemy dive bombers that scream down from above, and torpedo planes that roar in low.As if the epic “Charge” itself and the other combat scenarios were not enough to set this story apart, there are many other compelling elements that only add to the story's unprecedented, transcendent nature. There's the backdrop of the do or die nature of the battle, and the fact that the Japanese had been all but invincible since they wrought epic destruction at Pearl Harbor; plus you have the revenge factor of going after the same carriers and crews that had obliterated Pearl, and the fact that the U.S. was down to its last three remaining operational aircraft carriers. If the Japanese won at Midway, there was nothing left standing between them and the West Coast of America. Every one of the American combatants who fought that day knew they were truly defending their native soil and families back home. The impact of these factors as they weighed on the minds of these men -- especially the young American aviators -- are thoroughly covered in this action pact script, all coming from first hand accounts.AN UNPRECEDENTED ACCOUNT OF AN UNPRECEDENTED BATTLETo create The Charge of the Devastators screenplay I spent years traveling across the country at my own expense to attend reunions and commemorations and visit museums, military shows and displays -- basically going anywhere I could to meet and interview the great veterans of the battle. Whether in person, by phone or through other correspondence I did countless interviews with these veterans. I also read all the literature I could find on the battle and picked the brains of numerous scholars and historians, My research could not have been more extensive, and was all done to ensure that virtually 100% of the details of the combat sequences depicted in my script would be based on first hand accounts. I can say with assurance that a dramatic movie based on my completed script would be an unprecedented account of the battle. My extensive research gives you the TRUE stories of combat as the veterans told them -- many of them never before published. The Charge of the Devastators would stand alone as a cinematic portrayal of the Battle of Midway.THERE IS A NEED FOR THIS FILM!The 1976 movie Midway was unfortunately based on a poorly researched, inauthentic Hollywood script that didn't even scratch the surface of telling the true story of this epic battle. As I stated, many people base their concept of the battle on this film. To date there has been nothing produced cinematically that comes close to capturing this epic carrier plane battle. Several years ago a major studio was ready to fund a new movie on the battle, but they were apparently unable to secure a decent script and the project faded away. But that interest as well as the near misses I had with several Oscar winning producer/directors proves that there is interest in making a new movie about this battle.WHAT ALMOST ONCE WAS BUT WITH CROWD FUNDING COULD NOW BE...Before I even had a completed screenplay, a long treatment of the story found its way into the hands of a prominent Oscar winning producer. We had a lengthy sit down in his office where he made the comment that he thought the story would make for a ""classic American film."" He guessed that close to $200 million would be needed to fund the production. He wanted to produce the movie and had a name actor in mind for one of the lead roles. The producer needed $25,000 to begin work on the project. Unable to provide that type of funding, I could not take advantage of this great opportunity. But with your help, I can foray back into the the Hollywood fray, this time with some monetary backing that can secure a producer and get this film rolling!I would not expect to come close to getting full funding for the film through Kickstarter -- $200 million is a big number! But if I could secure my goal of $50,000, I would at least have enough money to travel to Hollywood and hire a name producer to start work on the project, and complete the book.ABOUT THE REWARDSGiven the fact that Kickstarter funding would be used to do just that -- ""kickstart"" the project into production mode, rather than fully fund the project -- my rewards cannot be based on the completion of a project the production of which would eventually be at least partly. out of my control. For that reason, part of my funding goal will be used to produce an epic page turner of a novel based on the already completed script.A BOOK WOULD BE AWESOME -- AND WOULD HELP SELL THE MOVIE CONCEPT!My original goal has always been and remains getting Devastators onto the big screen as the blockbuster epic film that I know it can be. But using part of my Kickstarter funding to produce a book of the same title can only enhance the chances of getting the movie produced.I can say with assurance that a dramatic book based on my completed script would be an unprecedented written account of the battle. Though many good books have been written on the subject, I've not seen anything resembling a dramatic portrayal in novel form like the one I am proposing -- a book that weaves in so many of the true intricate personal story lines while keeping strict accuracy with facts AND telling the complete story of all the combat action.My extensive research gives my script and a subsequent book the TRUE stories of combat as the veterans told them -- many of them never before published. But instead of telling them in clinical, technical, interview format, the Devastators book will use the dialogue and descriptiveness of a fast moving movie script to bring the characters to life in a way that puts you right there with them in the action. But that's not all -- without the length restrictions that I had to consider in writing a screenplay, the book will include ALL the great stories I uncovered with my research, with nothing left on the cutting room floor. For all these reasons, The Charge of the Devastators would stand alone either as a literary or cinematic portrayal of the Battle of Midway.FINAL THOUGHTSOf all the great reasons to get the ""Devastators"" story told, the most important is to create a well publicized, lasting tribute to the heroes who contributed so mightily to preserving our freedom and our very lives. Such a tribute is sadly lacking presently. The weakly scripted 1976 Hollywood movie on the subject was little more than a cursory look at the battle that ignored the numerous compelling personal stories, overlooked most of the combat aspects of the battle and devoted but a few brief scenes to the Devastators' ""charge.""

Our project will make this technology available for many applications, from graffiti removal, auto restoration, structural inspection and even welding preparation. This project will allow this technology to be used in the field, not just in a lab environment. There will be no requirement for chemicals or other consumables. And that means no waste disposal.To identify new applications, educate industry on advantages not only social but monetary as well. In this day of age we all have to work together to reduce our carbon footprint and make ourselves more competitive. With this project I am hoping to help average small businesses not only have access to this technology and become Greener but to also navigate the bureaucracies and raise awareness so others can follow in our footprints. Technology is always improving, I want to educate industry and give everyone a chance to catch up.Removing Paint from concrete: Great for Graffiti RemovalCurrent Specifications are so outdated they stipulate either chemical or abrasive processes. Both of which involve some sort of disposal being required.Cleaning Aluminum before and after weldingLook how quick and easy this is, the effect is very similar on Stainless Steel, Aluminum, and other materials.Our biggest challenge right now is to have the current specifications updated to include laser as an alternative to chemical and abrasive options. We have done extensive testing to prove the viability of this technology, now it is time to have our results verified by 3rd parties and have the necessary changes made to these outdated specifications. We have identified a multitude of new applications within a lab environment and now it is time to redesign for the field and changing weather conditions.This is High Heat rust paint being removed from cardboard.This isn't a common application as far as I know, It was just too cool not to share2 minutes with a laser cleaner and a shop vac, you are almost ready to re finish your favorite wood pieces","The 3rd party testing, field trials and evaluations are quite challenging as the cost of an independent labs services can accumulate quite rapidly. This costs can be in excess of $1000 per coupon, We have been working with and doing testing with local companies to identify the top applications and focusing on the top 5 for now to ensure the equipment will stand up. And the results are acceptable."
https://www.kickstarter.com/projects/lcfarrare/tyng-feature-length-indie-film?ref=discovery_category_newest,lcfarrare/tyng-feature-length-indie-film,"The Plan – To successfully produce the film, enter it into film festivals, and release it in as many formats and outlets that are or become available in a reasonable amount of time. I believe New England has a great deal of untapped talent, as well as some beautiful locations worth filming. I know Hollywood has made it’s way here, but I do not feel they truly value this area, and I want to show it’s true potential being a native Bostonian, and growing up in Lowell Massachusetts.The Purpose – Since 1997 my goal was to always be a filmmaker, and dedicate myself to the business, as I love to entertain people, and have a true passion for this industry. By making this project come to life, it not only allows me to make something I feel is going to be very entertaining, but I hope it will open up more doors for me to make more projects, as well as open doors for everyone involved in this project, furthering the careers of everyone!Your Donations – I bought all the equipment necessary to make this project happen, from the camera, lights, sound, etc. and have another $1,600.00 to invest into the props, locations, wardrobe, but I know it’s not enough to finish the project, only to begin it. I believe I can film this movie with 6-12 planned days. 3 -6 for initial shooting, 3-9 for pickups, and then ADR and things if needed can be done after the fact. I wrote a minimal amount of locations for this reason, the money donated will not only help with the look, and feel of the film, but will help pay for everything needed for the special effects, materials needed for makeup, hair, the clothing, food (cast and crew has to eat!) everything that I know the $1600.00 will make a dent in, but this will finish the job. Now if I get more then what I am asking for it will greatly increase the quality of the film, with even better everything instead of scraping the bottom of the barrel for things, we can get better makeup, better props, better well, everything. The donated money doesn’t just cover production, but also the post production, the Blu-Rays, posters, getting the film rated, and into theatres (have to convert the film from digital to actual film for most theatres) all cost money, even entering the film into festivals there is a entrance fee for most of them. Most don’t realize how much these things cost, but it can get very expensive. I am also going to post up receipts for everyone to see exactly where all of the money is going, not only so you all know, but also I think it will be informative for future filmmakers as well to give them an idea of what it takes to make it all happen!","No Crew? No problem! – I have some really great friends who are ready to assist in any way they can if for some reason I lose a crewmember or two during production. I have prepared pretty much my entire life to understanding the ins and outs of making films, and know how to operate all of my equipment; so teaching someone else so they could help would not be an issue. Also with most the scenes in this film, a minimal crew would not be an issue as I planned for this during the writing period of the screenplay. The crew I do have is really great though, so I do not see this as being an issue!Cast Bails? Understudy’s Ready! – The indie world is tough, and frankly people do flake, this is a non-union film as well, which makes it tougher, fortunately I am always up for a challenge, and have been combing the internet, and different locations, which not only put together a great cast and crew for this, but also got me some great backup individuals just in case of schedule conflicts, or someone simply dropping out of the project.Locations and Permits? – I’ve done extensive research on film law in New England in prepping this picture, and know that if I get the budget I am seeking, I will have no problem obtaining any permits necessary for filming. The cities and towns around here are fantastic to work with, and very much support the arts! As far as finding locations, I already have them scouted, and ready to go! I also made sure to obtain locations releases for all ahead of time as to ensure we will not lose them prior to filming!Production delays? – These things can happen, this is why I am schedule 2-3 days extra for each filming day so if someone gets sick, or injured (which we never want to happen, but unfortunately sometimes it does.) or anything else, we are able to work around it, and hopefully get through it as easily as we can. I will be updated the official networking sites and things as well, to keep everyone in the loop and out of the dark in regards to the production as well.Post Production? – Postproduction can take a while; I have my main workstation, as well as two additional laptops, and should be able to edit the film within a reasonable amount of time. I also have others I am working with who are either in school or graduated with degrees in the background of post, to try to make sure the film is as best as possible, for what the budget allows. The greatest thing about this film, is everyone involved really has an attachment to the project first!",https://www.kickstarter.com/projects/lcfarrare/feature-horror-film-wish?ref=discovery_category_newest,lcfarrare/feature-horror-film-wish,"This will be a new take on a genie horror film, that we feel will bring a different element of fear, and thrill to the audience.All of the money we need for this film, is going towards, cast, crew, wardrobe, set design, as well as the locations, special effects, and some visual effects. We also need funding for the marketing, film festivals, and release, both digital,and physical copies of the film.","We put together a great team, who is ready to work on this project, as soon as we have the funding."

This plan consists of understanding what you areeating first and foremost. Once you understand what is listed in the ingredientlists of the processed foods, you will start to understand why you andeverybody around you are getting sicker…For me this was a slow and painful process. I have recordedseveral hours of how this diet came to be, and the videos are available on theselfawarediet.com web site so I will give you the elevator pitch here.It started when my father passed at the age of 77 in January of 2013 at theend of a morphine drip and I could see in his eyes; that was NOT the way to go.So I had to find out why my doctor told me that I was “perfectly healthy” butcould not explain why I was overweight, sick, tired and depressed.Over the following 18 months I figured out there were a lotof toxins in my diet so I implemented the elimination diet technique. It started with aspartame and gluten, and then progressedto high fructose corn syrup, dextrose, maltodextrin, carmel color and naturalflavor. Once I eliminated those ingredients from my diet, the weight melted offme and I started to feel healthier and happier. However, once I found out thatthe conventional fruits and vegetables also had toxins in them, I switched toan all organic and non-gmo diet on top of all the other restrictions. Within 6months, I was feeling better than I had EVER felt. Totally blew my mind and itstill does.I cannot get into just how amazing it has been here on this site,but I can tell you that I have completely transformed my life. I lost over 60 pounds and mymental health counselor said I “look physically happier”, how cool is that? Also, I never set foot in a gym for crazy workout routines and I never counted a singled calorie. All I did was read the ingredient list and understand what I was reading. Tounderstand for yourself, you can download the first two chapters of my diet eBook for free @selfawaredietebook.com.The completely dumbfounding thing about this diet is;everybody knows GMO is bad for them but they don’t really believe just how badit affects them because their doctor tells them they are “perfectly healthy”. Iactually had one lady tell me that she was going to “ride her gluten to thegrave” when I handed her my new diet business card, she was a long time co-workerand I thought it was at least safe to approach her.So, instead of beating people over the head with a new diet ebook,I thought I would take the food to the streets. This way they can taste just howincredibly tasty these organic, non-gmo meals are. But I quickly ran out ofcreative and inspired recipes, hence this Kickstarter project. Also, one sure way to achievesuccess is to do what the people want and if you submit recipes, I will spendthe money to convert them to this new organic and non-gmo diet.The Self Aware Diet Food Truck Recipe book and mobile menu app will be acompilation of recipes submitted by you to be converted to 100% cleaningredients and served on a food truck near you and the recipes will be available via a mobile app ""Where's My Truck"" for recipe recreation and ordering ingredients and/or finished entries for pick up from a food truck near you all from the app.What I mean by clean ingredients is all ingredients areorganic, non-gmo, gluten free, yeast free, vinegar free, soy free, peanut free,dairy free, beef free, corn free, citrus free, canola free, maltodextrin free,dextrose free, carmel color free, acid free, gmo sugar free, imitation sugarfree, high fructose corn syrup free and natural flavor free. Like I said, itwas a long hard road.During my research, I read countless articles about howother people have had incredible results by not eating GMO and other toxins, so I thought if itworked for them, it should work for me, right?Aspirin works on them just like it works on me. So why can’tgmo affect me the same as it affects them?With this in mind, I decided to take this to the streets,literally. I will compile all the recipes, of which please submit snacks,breakfasts, lunches, dinners and desserts. Plus any specialty recipes you wouldlike to see converted and sold on the food trucks. It would be awesome if therewere enough recipes to have a few international and regional editions withcorresponding food trucks.This is really your project; I am just managing it for you. Once you tell me what to sell and where to sell it, I willmake it happen. I do work a 9 to 5 and will need some serious time management,so please be patient with me.Now we get to the where the rubber meets the road...The money will be spent as follows:What this project will accomplish: the creation of special editions of the Self Aware Diet Food Truck Recipe Book highlighting your favorite recipes that have been worked into this food truck concept with accompanying DVDs of interviews and the process of convertingyour favorite recipes with the 1st attempts at preparation.The benefit of this project: this project will solidify the business model of crowdfunding by combining crowdsourcing and crowdfunding to make this truly a project for the people from the people.The feature of this project: this project will bring awareness to the people about the toxins that are in their 21st Century diet. From my research I found out that almost everything called ""natural"" is shockingly nothing but artificially created chemicals that are ""sourced"" from ""natural"" sources. Not quite the same. And when I stopped eating anything with ""natural flavor(s)(ing)"", my mental health counselor told me I physically look happier. coincidence?The first edition recipe book will be shipped with anexclusive Kickstarter bonus, a sample of Austin’s Organic trail mix. Thatrecipe is available in the original Self Aware Diet ebook.I will be interviewing potential suppliers for the following:OK, now we get to what Kickstarter is all about, yourrewards for crowdfunding this project.Being a student of human nature, I have learned to giveextreme value in all my offerings and I wanted to give you extreme value in therewards for this project. My intention here is to offer a wide range of exclusiveKickstarter rewards to meet your funding requirements and our funding goal.With that said, I am confident we can meet the projectfunding amount. And I would absolutely love it if we exceeded our funding goal.The extra funding would allow you to take a MUCH larger role in this project.Both with the creation and future operation of this new corporation as awhole. What extended funding will accomplish: in the event we can exceed our funding goal then there will be extreme benefits from the new features created to streamline the food truck permitting process on a national level.We will assist, as best we can, www.foodtruckr.com with their work to better the system for everybody by establishing permitting standards to follow for safe food truck operations.Additionally, in the event we can exceed our funding goal by $125,000 we will be able to actually design and build the first Self Aware Diet Food Truck to be operated in Orlando Florida. This first food truck will be the base model for all future Self Aware Diet Food Trucks produced moving forward.But you know, one truck is not really enough for me to give up my day job of 17 years. Because if I'm not selling, I'm not paying the bills and there will be several months with no sales... ouch. But that is how you have to start a solid business. More to that, there are rewards to extend the funding so we can hire the first employee and purchase a multi use property for Corporate facilities, no equity is offered, all properties will be corporate owned.This is where that extreme value comes in, once in operation, the Self Aware Diet Food Truck Corporation will take five percent (5%) of the daily net food truck receipts and create a trust fund to raise awareness and promote consumer advocacy for a 100% clean diet for everybody.Crowdfunding is what the United States of America was built on and by looking at the results from Kickstarter, that spirit is still here, so now lets make it happen again.Where we go from here: is completely up to you. However, there are a places I would love to see the Self Aware Diet implemented. And those places would be:Beyond those categories, I am would love to work with any organization, public or private, professional or amateur that will benefit from this new diet plan.Thank you for reading this post and I amlooking forward to working with you, because my only life goal is to help atleast one person today. Changing my life goals from materialistic ideals tothis one fundamental goal, has taken my life in new directions I never could haveimagined or accomplished if I was just doing things to help me and only me. It’sa Universal Law of Attraction thing.To Your Health.Sincerely,Austin RoseCreator of the Self Aware Diet","The main goal of this project is to complete a recipe book of your favorite recipes that have been converted to an Organic, Non-GMO diet to be sold on a food truck.There are inherent risks with experimenting on new recipes. We could burn the ingredients....  no seriously, there are concerns if a recipe will convert or not. If the recipe calls for prepackage ingredients, there is as strong possibility that it will not convert without converting the prepackaged ingredient to organic / non-gmo first.Also, there are risks of delays due to recipes not working out like planned, printing/shipping difficulties and/or video equipment failure. With those in mind, I will be updating this project as things happen, good or bad. I am a very transparent person that believes in honesty, integrity and perseverance.So if/when things go bad, I will stick to it and make sure this recipe book gets published.

To my complete surprise Eagle Feather beganbeing selected to play in many film festivals across the country and beingvery well received too.Each time Eagle Feather played many people of NativeAmerican descent and non Native Americans alike would come up to saythat they were moved by the film and wanted to learn more; so I now want to make a feature length family moviethat portrays traditional American Indian life, lore and shamanism inan entertaining and also positive way.My hope in doing so is thatmany people who see the movie will be moved to learn more about thisculture and way of life.With so much of the Native American cultures having been lostand so much of their traditional wisdom lost too another hope is filmwill become a method of preserving what is left and in away that it is both easily accessible and also entertaining as making thefeature length movie entertaining too will make it a more interestingway to learn. The feature Eagle Feather will all be based on true stories andthe background music will all be traditional Native Americanceremonial songs that we will sing for this film the same way we didfor the original short film.My hope is to make the first visually beautiful NativeAmerican animated family feature film that provides a positive view oftraditional Native American culture.We will use the same animation team that we used for making Eagle Feather as a 4 1/2 minute short movie as they feel very committed about the project and its message. When the film is distributed, I plan to donate 20 percent of the profits of this film to wildlife preservation efforts to protect American eagles.",To be honest my largest obstacle is funding at this point.  I have made award winning short animated films and also one feature length animated movie that has been well received in film festivals too so completing a movie of this size is something I can do. The animation team I am working with has worked with me on all of my past animated movies and we have a good working rapport so things on this front should go quite smoothly too.  The animators feel strongly about the project and are excited to work on it with me.  I also have several very seasoned media veterans helping me oversee the project. Though this will be a challenging project I believe my past experiences in making animated films will allow me to not only complete the movie for this price but have it be a very good film.,https://www.kickstarter.com/projects/2113307325/eagle-feather-a-native-american-animated-film?ref=discovery_category_newest,2113307325/eagle-feather-a-native-american-animated-film,"When I started making Eagle Feather as a short film I was unsure ifanyone would want to watch an American Indian based story at all butfelt that it was very important to try to make a,family friendly filmthat portrayed traditional Native American life in a positive and alsohopeful way.To my happy surprise Eagle Feather immediately began being selected toplay in film festivals throughout USA and around the world - and evenwinning awards too.

I moved my family from Casper Wyoming to here, resulting in the loss of most of our furniture and most of my art supplies incuding several projectors and easels.

I will do a maximum of 5,000 signed and numbered prints for each, in rounds of 1000 for each of the Pheonix Rising and Dragon Moon prints. So if I could send more print sets to additional donors I will, I will need the addresses. The Initial Printing will be 2000, if I need mor than that, then I will print them off.","Risks might be I wouldn't get the prints done in time for the November Shipping. after the Initial 2,000 to 3,000 print run, I will have to carve a new print block per extra 1000 prints.",https://www.kickstarter.com/projects/highshadowmage/dancing-dragons?ref=discovery_category_newest,highshadowmage/dancing-dragons,"I am going to create a series of paintings of Dragons which I will then take pictures and post them on Deviant Art.

Imagined as a mission ofmercy similar to Hatzolah rescue services (http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hatzalah),the Knights could be used as a last resort by the Vatican to emergencyevacuate anyone, including Jews and Muslims, seeking sanctuary in CatholicChurches worldwide. It is the mandate of this study to provide the Vatican witha professional and frank analysis of restoring the Templars so our most amazingPope Francis will have options to save lives, should the killing escalate.

This documentary is not authorized by the Vatican at the present time.The documentary is dedicated to mothers worldwide who have losttheir children to religious persecution.","Because this project is investigative, all opinions are welcome. It should not be difficult to organize interviews; if participants cannot attend physically, we can video conference. The only potential obstacle to interviewees would be their affiliations preventing a complete discussion of the topics. For this reason, anonymous contributors will be considered.As a TV producer, I have agreements with two of America's largest show groups to develop programming depicting the acquisition of the world's finest antiques.

Scenario: You find a good channel on the Internet butit's off YouTube or Vimeo. If you search for it, it takes minutes every time!But now you can organize all your Internet channels in one place effectivelycreating the first iPhone TV remote control: Revolver. Revolver is a patentapplied for process that was originally conceived to combine chats fromdifferent Facebook groupswith a unique architecture. But the ability to serveup numerous platforms in a convenient design means Revolver is also a 21stcentury TV remote control for your iPhone! And what is really cool ismany other sites now legally serve up content on the Internet so yourchoices for viewing can only get larger. Works with: Vimeo, YouTube, Periscope, Meerkat, Movieswap, Netflix, HBO, Xfinity, Directv. Any public or member based Internet platform that streams video! But what if you don't want to stand at cords length?Enter Revolver Ghost, a second application that pairs any twoApple devicesthrougha VCN clientallowing users to sit down and relax by cutting the cord! With these innovations it is now possible to save a few minutes daily searching for every platform. If you watch a lot of video and movies, a few minutes a day adds up! At five minutes a day, by years end it is 30.41 hours. What would you do with over a day of your life back every year? Is over a day of your life worth 5 bucks? Good than please help us developthis great idea that we know we can bring to the world. Meet the boys: Vince Grupi founder, graduate of NYUFilm and TV with background in vintage design and animation, Larry Kaplan business manager, master moderator and Rolex expert, Alfred Tutechnical manager, advanced program design withemphasis on security, Zaf Basha code advisor, code writer on many government projects involving high securityand another vintage watch nerd specializing in Jaeger LeCoultre, and ScottFink, renowned Florida designer and musician, Scott plays every week with hisband both at church and in the casino! How do we know each other? We all lovewatches! And we have been working together on watch deals for years. Can abunch of geek misanthropes work together long enough to make this happen? Spend the5 dollarsand find out! And in 2017, savetime with Revolver!Features:Unique fractal screen.Convenient gesture controls.Username and password saved for each platform.Convenient fly-overs with saved list for each sub-platform.Unlimited number of platforms saved.One remote control for every platform!Chat Mode:This is another unique feature of Revolver. By selecting ChatMode, 2 chat windows openbelow your selected video platform.Now you may select your chat platform and you will see all the comments from other joined platforms as well as yours in one window. I know, it's magic! How can this be fun? Well imagine 5 chat platforms can comment in one window created by Revolver. You may ask why not all just chat on Revolver? Because as in the case of Facebook groups, they all have their own flavor and Revolver doesn't want to change that. But if you wanted to connect scores of groups for a charity or an auction, imagine the large difference in scale that Revolver makes. Finally you may ask how does Revolver join you to other chats automatically? It's simple, it unites all chat plaforms who have selected the same video platform address. You don't join Revolver, it joins you!Here is where we started testing Revolver Auctionon Facebook:https://www.facebook.com/groups/revolverauction Business plan: Phase one: Kickstarter campaign raises fifty thousand dollarswhich triggers construction ofRevolver Beta (without chat). In approximately ninemonths, delivery of beta app. Phase two: Begin retail sale of Revolver Beta financing construction of Revolver Social, Revolver Ghost, andRevolver for Android. All early adopters ofRevolver Beta will receive Revolver Social for free as an update.What do we need this money for? Applying forpatents are expensive. Initial costs of fifteen thousand dollars are typical.Then there's five thousand for other legal work. Add to that twenty fivethousand to create the application, five thousand for contingencies and fivethousand for Kickstarter. We figure if we can clear at least fifty thousanddollars, we can make the application and begin selling it publicly, financingRevolver Ghost in the process. To be very clear and upfront, the software has a patent applied for it however it has not been written yet. That is precisely what this Kickstarter is for, that and legal fees so nobody rips us off! And about Revolver Ghost, the software for that has also not been written yet.Architecture: Revolver Social uses feeds to dynamically stream and connect platforms.Some of the typical user features: search, alerts, favorites, secure entry,payment and shipping options, display of platforms and sub-platforms saved, display of user names and passwords saved and display of chat platformssaved with on/off switch.Revolver Ghost uses simple IP address and open port virtual network connections to search for and store as many Apple devices as you wish. Takea look at a demonstration video depiction:https://vimeo.com/161314795Screen:The inspiration for the screen design is fractals. They can recall a largenumber of saves from a single page and store favorites strategically. Where did the inspiration for Revolver come from? The truth is because 9 years ago, I sawa fractal lightin my house. I can't explain it except to say on April 2nd, 2007 at around 6 PM, there were lights in my doorway floating and pulsing in symmetry. I told a few people and some gave the usual snide remarks but the pattern was never forgotten. Revolver is simply based on that design of what I believe was living light, ever changing, and seemingly alive.The Internet and its choices are only getting larger every day.Couldn't you use a convenient hub to stream your favorite channels? Save timeand support the first iPhone TV remote control that connects you to your friends,Revolver!Enjoy the Spanishvideo! https://vimeo.com/161285347","The advisors in our group have coordinated actual private industry and government enterprise software creation. I am sure with our budget we can finish phase one and mayby even begin rolling out the social features early. Scott also manages a team for a graphics company. I think the only issues may be two; first that we all have jobs so much of this work will be part time slowing it down slightly. And second that if it is really embraced by the public, we will have to scale up fast which is hard. We should all have this problem called success."

We strive to give professional-quality performances of the world’s greatest orchestral and choral compositions, and to share our passion for music with audiences of all ages in Irvine and the greater Orange County Area. We are committed to enriching the arts in our community, not only through inspired performances, but also through cultural exchanges and educational opportunities for young and rising musicians in Orange County.We are now in our third season with performances held at Irvine Civic Center.During our first two seasons, our repertoire includedMendelssohn's 5th Symphony and Violin Concerto,Mahler's 4th and 5th Symphonies , Dvorak's 8th Symphony, and Copland's Rodeo and Fanfare for the Common Man.Soloists who have performed with us include: Mira Khomik (Violin) Elizabeth Johnson (Violin), and Tony Mazzaferro (Tuba).This season, we are fortunate to have Pipa soloist Tu Shan Xiang performing in our May concert.Tu Shan Xiangreceived a bachelor’s degree from the Shanghai Conservatory of Music and a postgraduate degree from the Tokyo University of the Arts.

The screenplay will be filmed mainly in Oklahoma where I will apply for film credits to help fund the movie. I will involve top rated production crews from Oklahoma to produce a quality award winning film with A List actors. The story line is comparable to Crazy Heart with much more action, bull riding, country western music, romance, strife, and country elements. It's a modern day western depicting the life of a woman from the city who falls for a struggling Oklahoma cowboy who raises bulls to perform at the PBR. I will use the connections I made during the 8 years I was a female stock contractor with the PBR to help contribute to the success of this movie. Bull riding is huge right now. The movie will feature top PBR bulls and today's riders. This is a project I've been dedicated to since I wrote the novel Farewell to Freedom in 2009. I will not rest until the movie is made.

Unfortunately withthe housing market like it is, those two options are not open to me. That iswhy I am looking to Kickstarter to get the project going.Toget started we are seeking $180,000. Of that, $80,000 will purchase and plant500 trees. We will need the additional capital for operating expenses and tomaintain the trees for a period of three years.

As of last week the magazine has just secured a deal with a major retailer to stock the publication in all their outlets here in New York. This has happened in just under ''three weeks''.The Man About Town, New York is the first men's only lifestyle magazine and guide for guys in New York. It covers every aspect of lifestyle. Think of 12 high-end lifestyle magazines rolled into one. From GQ to Men's Health and from Forbes to House and Garden or Con de Nast Traveler. There are several unique features to the magazine that you won't find in others like Details or Gotham. The magazine is aimed at 25-40 demographic.The magazine is more of an informative guide than a glossy and has tons of useful facts and information for the reader. It's not just about fashion but gives you useful ideas about who, what, where and when as well as investment for millenials, hiring a private jet is as cheap as one way ticket to other side of the country and do bromances exist and are you in one or what do guys think about their girlfriends as we delve into the psyche of a dude's mind to find out.","Currently we have had nothing but positive feedback from both the consumer and from retailers who like the look, feel, content and niche nature of the magazine. The magazine may be printed abroad in which case there may be delays in delivery but turn around time is factored in early to overcome that issue.",https://www.kickstarter.com/projects/915342470/mens-lifestyle-magazine?ref=discovery_category_newest,915342470/mens-lifestyle-magazine,"What are you planning to make? The Man About Town, New York is the first men's only lifestyle magazine and comprehensive guide for guys in New York. It’s 12 high-end lifestyle magazines rolled into one. From GQ to Men's Health and from Forbes to House & Garden or Con de Nast Traveler. The magazine is aimed at 25-40 demographic with tons of useful facts and figures. Also planning on launching one for LA, Miami, London, Cape Town, Paris, Munich, Hong Kong, Shanghai, Dubai and Mumbai. Planning on white labeling the brand and then launching an online TV version in 5 years (depending on funding, sooner).Where did this project come from? The idea for the project came to me after I couldn’t find a good magazine to actually READ and not just flick through. I was fed up of picking up a magazine full of pretty pictures and contained lots and lots of adverts. A magazine that wasn’t bitty or where the article was continued fives page down after all the glossy commercials. Above all, I wanted a magazine that was going to help me lead a better quality life. I wanted to read something that was informative, helpful, a guide to the who, what, where and how of living as a single guy in New York. The project is a culmination of my ideas and those of young guys (25-40), living in New York.  The magazine is about real people with real issues and real concerns. You’ll never see someone famous on the cover or inside the magazine. It’s a simple layout, no clutter, easy to read, user friendly and still has all the cache of a glossy and modern men’s lifestyle magazine without the pretentious nonsense. I did my market research and asked lots of guys in their 20s and 30s what they wanted out of a men’s lifestyle magazine. What you see is the end result of more than 6-months of research. The magazine is an extension of my passion for all things ‘men’ and ‘luxury’. So now, I gauge the needs and wants of men in NYC and what ‘I’ think is cool, fun, must have knowledge of and what ‘I’ would find crucial for a single guy living in NYC. This isn’t just another magazine. It’s a guide, a bible without sounding condescending or patronizing. What’s your plan, and what’s your schedule? We have already launched the first issue both online and in print. The plan now is to raise enough money to bring on a full time graphic designer, sales person, PR (low introductory rate already agreed) and cash to increase distribution. I already have orders but not enough cash to fulfil those orders. So in order or priority, immediate steps in 1st month: 1.	Employ full time graphic designer ($1,000 per issue) 2.	Employ a full time salesperson (low base with high commission, to start) 3.	Increase print run to meet demand 4.	Employ PR agency (low introductory rate of $1200 already agreed).2nd month of investment: 1.	Seek new clients for advertising and sponsorship created by new traction bought on by second issue. 2.	Create an e-commerce element to the back of the magazine and in between commercials spread throughout the magazine What’s your budget? I have budgeted $10,000 for each month. This will pay for: 1.	Graphic designer and salesperson 2.	Print run for wholefoods and airlines. More copies will be printed in agreement with wholesalers to pay either upfront ($.40 per copy or higher rate and the retailers keep 100% of the profit or monies from the magazines sold). Why do you care? The magazine started out as a simple experiment to pass time. I then thought about putting something online but thought ‘why not sell it to a retailer’. I knew I didn’t have the finance to print thousands of copies but possibly a test run. I convinced Wholefoods in New York to stock it. Then I approached the airlines, they wanted it as well. Then I asked the gyms to stock it (people literally stole the magazine from the rack at my local gym, Equinox in New York, Soho)If you have a question or a suggestion, we would love to hear from you. You can email us at contact@themanaboutown.com.","Here are a list of challenges we face:1. Rivals in the market like GQ and Esquire2. Less well known and need to take time to establish the brand or product.3. Better distribution and wider distribution.4. Our rivals have hefty marketing/PR budgets.5. Bigger staff and more well known writers working for established magazines.6. Funding may run out before we reach our goals or targets.7. Additional funding may dilute the equity.8. Our rivals already have established and better relationships.HOW ARE WE OVERCOMING THESE ISSUES:1. Despite bigger more established rivals in the same space as my magazine, we have managed to sell 75% of what was ordered by retailer in NYC (Manhattan) so there is clearly a need for the magazine plus, 2. Although my magazine is less established, I am aggressively pursuing and securing relationships with key brands and companies who actually like the concept of a no frills, no bullshit luxury lifestyle magazine for men.3. I am agreeing distribution wherever I go. I have not approached big retailers or outlets as that would mean more printed copies and that would mean, more money to print. Several companies have already said they would stock the magazine (includes the four major US carriers flying from JFK to London). 4. I am building strategic relationships with brands so at this stage it's 'give away' which means that we can link the magazine to other more established brands. This gives it more exposure and means I do not have to pay for marketing to compete as I am growing this slowly and organically. 5. I have smaller and much less overheads than my rivals which means I can keep the costs down and still pay for key reporters or articles.6. I have been very conservative with the funding I am looking for. It is enough to keep the magazine going for six months so we can capitalize on the traction already established and continue to win and attract more retailers and distribution outlets. That means more advertisers/sponsors and more funding coming in to increase the bottom line.7. I have 100 ownership of the company. I plan to retain full editorial control as the magazine is an extension of my name and brand. So any funding would mean a give away of only 20 per cent. After which the magazine will be self sustaining.8. I am great at networking and have brought the magazine this far off my own back and off the back of established and growing connections. Because of my travels and my former association with the BBC, I am able to leverage off those connections established with high networth individuals and finance as well as people in property, fashion, travel...etc. CREDENTIALS: I have more than 20 years’ experience in the media business, TV, digital and now print. This is my second magazine start-up in the luxury lifestyle sector. I believe I have the passion, drive and know how to continue the excellent sales and distribution I have so far achieved on my own. I have also assembled an experienced team for business support as well as expert industry mentors and advisors. Collectively, we have experience in everything from finance, property, travel, health and fitness, tech and digital platforms. Thank You Kickstarter We greatly appreciate your support and are excited to turn The Man About Town, New York into a national and international publication!"
https://www.kickstarter.com/projects/memoryart/holographic-gaming-tower?ref=discovery_category_newest,memoryart/holographic-gaming-tower,"Hello, I'm Amy and I would like to introduce you to 3D Creations and Designs, LLC. We are a husband and wife team using our passion for creativity to make life enriching products. My husband, John, and I had been in the automotive industry for a combined total of 32 years when we decided it was time to pursue a more rewarding and personally fulfilling lifestyle by following what we love to do and that is to create. We have enjoyed the entire spectrum of maker movement technologies from 3d printing and C.N.C. prototyping to Arduino based electronics, laser cutting and graphics designs for our plotters. John is currently expanding his artistic skills into 3d graphics, as seen in this project, as well as V.R. and A.R. design.The idea for the Holographic Gaming Tower came as an evolution of John's long time fascination with holography. His thought was to design a display as a complement to our computer system, something to trick it out by doubling the visual impact of our gaming tower. Having overcome the challenges of getting the right size tower for the selected holographic fan and dampening the noise when enclosed, John was well on his way to creating this display. Satisfied with the tower setup he began drawing 3d graphics and working on lighting to make this an attractive and unique display. We have decided to ask the community for help to take this product to the next level after multiple people have asked us where we got the display tower. Your support will be invaluable in helping us achieve the next goal of making these available to others.Thank you for taking the time to learn about our product and helping us make our vision a reality.John and AmyJohn and Jonathan3D design areaC.N.C and Laser design areaX-Carve",As with any company and manufacturing in general there are always unknowns that are outside of our control. We have done our research and are confident in where we have chosen to get our supplies and do not expect any unusual delays. Though we can not control delays in shipping we are confident that once the project is funded we will be able to fulfill the campaign within the specified timeline. Any delays in production will be shared with our supporters.,https://www.kickstarter.com/projects/memoryart/memory-art?ref=discovery_category_newest,memoryart/memory-art,"Who are we?We are Amy and John and our company is 3D Creations and Designs, LLC. We are a husband and wife team that love to take our creative ideas and make them a reality.John and I were in the automotive industry for a combined total of 32 years when we decided it was time to pursue a more rewarding and personally fulfilling lifestyle by following what we love to do and that is to create! We have enjoyed the entire spectrum of maker movement technologies from 3d printing and C.N.C. prototyping to laser cutting and graphic design and production with our plotters.Our love and passion for creating beautiful pieces of work have lead us to making these custom wood carved wall medallions and coffee tables. Let us capture those family values and emotions that you hold near and dear to you.What is Memory Art?Memory art is a way to preserve those unforgettable facial expressions, memorialize a loved one, or showcase your family motto/values. The idea came to us when we were talking about how we have no photo's or memories of our grandfathers as they passed away either before we were born or when we were very young. So whether its a wall medallion or coffee table it will become not only the center of attention at family functions but also one of your most cherished pieces of art. Memory art allows you the ability to add a passed loved one into a collage of your family as if they were still here and to remember those priceless facial expressions that make each person unique.Each piece of memory art is pre drilled for wall mounting.The Medallion!The wall medallion is 14.75 inches in diameter and perfect for those family mottos or you can choose up to 3 faces, 4 icons, and 3 words to create a mini collage. Each medallion is stained with your choice of color and finished with a clear polyurethane.The table!The table is 36 inches in diameter and 21 inches in height. You can choose up to 5 faces, 6 words, and 6 icons to have carved into your top. You will also be able to choose from 4 different stain options for your top or you can choose to leave it natural. All stained tables will be finished with a clear polyurethane. All table tops serve dual function as they can be separated from their base and come pre drilled for wall hanging. The beveled glass option gives this table an elegant finish.The base of the table is a parametric design, created by John, that is put together with our custom designed wedges. These wedges are easy to install and require no tools.Choose Your Stain!Chose from: Distressed walnut glaze, Classic gray stain, Ebony stain, or Honey stain.Choose Your Icons!Choose from 300 different icons: from dog prints, to sports, to tools, and much more we are sure you will find the perfect ones to compliment your memory art medallion or table.",As with any business there are always risks and challenges. We are confident with our suppliers and that we will be able to have all required materials for each order soon after the campaign funds and contributions are received. These are custom tables so we will be in constant contact with our contributors to verify photo conversions and layout designs. We have left enough time in the timeline to be able to complete the funding goal orders and even some extras when this funds for more than the set amount. We do not expect any delays with shipping as we have chosen UPS as our continental US shipping service and DHL for most of our international shipments. Please take this into consideration when viewing the shipping costs.

https://www.kickstarter.com/projects/1529420273/requiem-for-greed?ref=discovery_category_newest,1529420273/requiem-for-greed,"Gordon Gekko, the antihero of “Wall Street,” extolled greed. “Greed … is good,” he said. “Greed is right, greed works.” And greed, he argued, would save the USA.But recent events have proved otherwise. We have learned that greed causes misery. Greed caused the recent Great Recession, from which millions across the globe may not recover for decades. Greed has turned the 2016 U.S. presidential campaign into a farce.Greed is not good. That’s the tilt of “Requiem for Greed,” whose protagonist is not a person but an event. “Requiem” covers the Great Recession crisis, from what caused it to how it hit its peak, changing the fabric of our society. Having worked in the mortgage-lending industry for 25 years, I have seen it turn from good to bad. That this crisis would occur was not a matter of if but of when. I saw the effects of the corporate banking lobby’s influence on politicians, causing deregulation and a lack of oversight; of Wall Street inventing derivative investment products that nobody could fully understand; and of credit-rating agencies giving these products a stamp of approval.In turn, bankers and brokers pushed these products on clients so eager to become new homeowners – or to refinance existing mortgages at supposedly lower rates – that they got in way over their heads in debt. It was a vicious cycle that everyone thought would never end – until the U.S. economy came crashing down, causing tsunami-like waves around the world.From beginning to end, I saw the ugliness of this process from the eye of the storm.  “Requiem for Greed” is a satirical spoof but not a comedy. It lampoons familiar archetypes: politicians who will say anything for a vote, bankers who will do anything for a buck, captains of industry and cable TV personalities babbling on about the glories of boundless capitalism – all of them fueling the fire of the greed that consumed American society and led to the Great Recession.This saga is narrated by the imagined voices of Karl Marx and Adam Smith, who leave us to ponder what comes next.Enjoy this preview of “Requiem” – and think about what really matters! ","There are a few challenges, which include (1) animators not being able to finish the job; To overcome this challenge, I have several other sources for project completion should the original animators fail.",https://www.kickstarter.com/projects/1529420273/search-engine-the-musical?ref=discovery_category_newest,1529420273/search-engine-the-musical,"This play tells the story of Google – coinciding with the 20th anniversary of its founding in 1998 – through the rise, coming together, struggles, and then triumphs of its founders, Sergey Brin and Larry Page.This is a time when people and societies depend on relevant and reliable information more than ever.This is a story about two tech heroes who use science to advance human progress. This is a story about how Google, the search engine, has changed the course of the free flow of reliable information to people all over the world – and millions of people use it every day, for free.This story also relates how Brin and Page’s perseverance, brain power and vision have also led them to the future-forward projects of Google X, aimed at making human life easier and better.Last year my self-produced animated short feature, “Requiem for Greed,” was selected at 23 film festivals, winning awards and finalist/semi-finalist status in venues including Cannes, St. Petersburg, Milan, Dublin, and Hollywood.

https://www.kickstarter.com/projects/1492649084/scott-free?ref=discovery_category_newest,1492649084/scott-free,,Risks and challenges are listed in the project description link.,https://www.kickstarter.com/projects/1492649084/scott-free-0?ref=discovery_category_newest,1492649084/scott-free-0,"It is my proposal to continue to produce the screenplay “SCOTT-FREE” into a feature length film. We have already shot 99% of the film on a budget of 175k, the film is starring Felicia Pearson, Tray Chaney and Columbus Short as the most notable names in this film. What we are looking for is and investment of 60k for 10% of profits the investment will be used for post production and marketing and one shoot day. With the plan that we have in place we are virtually certain that this film will make it to the theaters, we have other contractual agreements in place with the above named actors to ensure this statement, but the only way to get this done is with the right post editor to make the film be as good as it can be .Why should I invest in this film or any film? A movie is the best investment one can make for the upside potential vs. the risk. They're better than real estate, blue chip stocks, gold, silver, precious stones, income-producing rental properties, futures, treasuries, and international currencies. They are better than anything, with the possible exception of investing in your own education or spiritual enlightenment.There simply is no business with manufacturing capital entry requirements as low as motion pictures where the potential return can be as unlimited over the short, medium and long terms. For instance, a movie such as Halloween, costing as little as $320,000 to produce, earned $75,000,000 and it does not stop earning money - for a lifetime. Return Of The Secaucus 7 cost only $60,000 and grossed $2,500,000. Benji cost $550,000 and grossed $45,000,000; Night Of The Living Dead cost $114,000 and grossed $40,000,000, Grizzly cost $700,000 and grossed $31,000,000, Dawn Of The Dead cost $700,000 and grossed $55,000,000 and Blair Witch Project costs $5,000 and grossed over $150,000,000. And just when we thought nothing could top Blair Witch Project, along comes My Big Fat Greek Wedding which was produced for about $1.5 million as an independent film (turned down by all the studios for financing I might add) and it has so far generated over $368,700,000. There are thousands of other examples where the return was at least three times anything done by securities listed on the New York Stock Exchange, the S&P 500 or the NASDAQ.In terms of quantifiable potential, if all went right that possibly could, what is the maximum amount of money a movie can gross compared to a real estate investment? You can build a 60-unit apartment complex for $3 million. You can rent each apartment to one or two people for $500 to $700 or more per month (average $600) per unit for a total gross income of $432,000 per year. To make more rental money, just add more rental units at a cost of $50,000 each and figure out how to get rid of the expenses and debt service you most likely have wrapped around your neck.If you have ever dealt with zoning authorities and mortgage lenders, you know what you can go through. You can help create a movie for $ 60,000, this is about 40 times less capital than the apartment. You can rent that movie to a potential 73 million people, using a round number, $5.00 per rental for a total gross income of $365 million dollars per year.To make more rental money, just sit and wait for another year and there will be another 73 million people born sooner or later who have not seen it. This audience will be able to afford it long before they can afford $600 to rent on an apartment. Of course it is ridiculous to say one will rent to 73 million people, the point I’m trying to make is, one has a fighting chance to access such a potential market, whereas with a 40,000 ton apartment building which is subject to termites and destruction by your tenants, it could take years to recoup your investment. For your $30,000 movie investment, you have 1000.9 times the income POTENTIAL over a twenty year period ($365 million divided by $30,000). Therefore, if we consider it is as easy to create and market a movie as it is to build and market a building, just two different types of know how, it makes a lot more sense to invest in movies than in real estate. I know for a fact that it is just as complicated to deal with real estate as it is to deal with movies on an effort per dollar basis. Again, ask anyone who has had to go before a planning commission, get a variance, deal with a builder and/or construction workers or who has partners. Believe me, making a movie is a lot more fun and the up side is much higher.Digital on Demand-Release is the easy route That is why we want to target a theatrical (art house) release first because we know that we can still go to the top digital outlets like the biggest players at the Sundance Film Festival Hollywood outsiders. Amazon and Netflix, with their deep pockets and big ambitions, have picked up several films and have driven up the bidding for others. Backed by the might of their massive audiences, superior technology, and business models unfettered by the typical constraints of Hollywood, these tech giants provide a new hope for independent filmmakers.We have the ability to accomplish this task and possibly exceed our own expectations, Amazon's bought five independent films so far, including the well-received Manchester by the Sea for a reported $10 million. Netflix, meanwhile, has picked up streaming rights for three films, including Tallulah starring Ellen Page, and they have just announced it will produce a slate of indie features.","MOCK ESTIMATE OF PROFITS based on tickets only costing 4 bucks with 60k investment from limited partners at 10% returnAdmission price x Number of People = $ Per Theater x Total Houses x Days = Gross1st Run: $4x300 = $1,200 x 300 (= $360,000) x10 days = $3,600,0002nd Run: $2x300 = $600 x 100 (= $60,000) x 10 days = $ 600,000Less 50% for companion feature = $ -30,000$ 2,970,0001st Run Gross $3,600,0002nd Run Gross + 600,0004,125,000Less 50% to theaters -2,062,500Less 35% to distribution fees - 721,875Motion Picture profit U.S. & Canada $1,355,250Odd Foreign Market expectancy +1,340,625Total World theatrical profit $ 2,695,875Add TV sales expectancy over 7 years $ 1,000,000Add Miscellaneous revenue + 100,000Total Motion Picture Gross $ 3,795.875Less Production costs -175,000Net after Investor recoupment $ 3,620.87510% Profits to Limited Partners $343,131"

https://www.kickstarter.com/projects/535332917/errlus-the-time-pirate?ref=discovery_category_newest,535332917/errlus-the-time-pirate," Copyright 2011 - Weiss-Celley - In Lansdowne, there's a compound of small offices just off a creek near Baltimore Pike. In the Lancaster area there's a hill overlooking woodlands and a huge warehouse that is used to make helicopters. These two areas are just two outside locations that can be used to make the film. The film opens in a large lab as high as an airplane hanger, everyone is dressed in white labcoats or new age suits except a young girl whose lab coat looks like it got mixed up with bleach and red socks in a washing machine. Everyone is anxiously looking at a pedestal while she looks at her watch, obviously wishing to be somewhere else. A young man approaches her, hoping to ask her for a date later. They talk amicably till a searing noise is heard as pink clouds start to form near the pedestal and a wave of voices and cameras flashing cause everyone to stare at the source of the searing noise on top of the pedestal. The young man talking to the girl bows to her and says, ""I was going to ask you out, but it looks like you're engaged."" This statement infuriates the girl into desperation. She bolts to the nearest door. It is blocked by guards, the ladies room windows are sealed shut. When she realizes there is no place to go, she walks out to the commotion, a spinning golden orb appears on top of the pedastal. The orb stops and a door seems to melt away. A wide-eyed young man steps out and everyone but the pink-coated girl claps as more cameras flash. He looks around at all the equipment and picture taking and notices the most stationary person in the room. She is so calm he thinks. He walks to her as if drawn. She notices he is more attractive than the paintings of him from long ago and he's much more... innocent-looking. He goes to her and asks, ""What's all the fuss?"" She looks at him and suddenly realizes he has no idea. He had only been in the orb for probably 15 minutes. To him his family was still alive, his brother and sisters, mother and father were--just a few houses away. As far as he knew he would see them soon. She realized the grief he would feel and tears formed in her eyes. ""You actually do not know."" she said incredulously. Then she took his hand and walked toward the door. ""I have much to tell you."" She opened the door to his new world to show him his home town he had not been in for over a thousand years. Gradually she would let him know what his father had planned for him when he disappeared over 1600 years ago in a Time Cell with an unknown future setting. He would create this colony in the future after being trained by scientists his father instructed. Without him, none of the schools, the people, the technology would be; but he had to want to stay and whoever was assigned to be in the lab when that timecell appeared, somehow that person made him want to stay in that time and not try to return to the past from which he came. The girl in the pink lab coat now realized the destiny of being a wife to a future time pirate was not so foreboding.","The lab scene is one of the most expensive. A large number of extras will need to be paid. New-age suits will need to be designed. Alterations to present-day suits will most likely be done. The helicopter place may be a good setting if affordable. Another location is in Wawa, PA. A backdrop can be used if a warehouse is unavailable. I may contract with a computer simulation company. I have three pilots in my family who can help with locations.Another obstacle is a diving scene where one diver is kidnapped. This should be interesting.The most important challenge is finding the right actors for the twelve main characters: Errlus, Johannah, Bernard, Gwendolyn, Andrea, Dominick, Popla, Olivia, Francis, Mindolyn, Jonas, and Marcus. I figure a way to help generate interest is to film auditions that help us search for the best actor or actress for the part. I have figured the best person suitable for the Errlus part would be someone who looks and acts like Jayson Werth, a former Philly and present-day Washington National base ball star. His look and mannerisms are perfect for the part. If he wants to be in the movie, he could either play Errlus in the major parts of the film or Errlus's father in his younger days. I have a list of people that seem to fit the look of Errlus. The auditions will allow this ""troupe"" to find a person who can command easily and lead unquestionably in dire situations.",https://www.kickstarter.com/projects/535332917/errlus-the-time-pirate-0?ref=discovery_category_newest,535332917/errlus-the-time-pirate-0,"This is a sketch by one of the main characters and her depiction of Errlus as he finds his unconscious wife after an erruption of volcanoes near a gold-mining colonyThe above is an excerpt of the book.

They desert her after a near miss.","Making lava look real is one challenge. Another is making a harpoon travel through water and look like it's not pulled by a string in a pool or river.

I intend to contract upstart creatives, authors, designers, and kids media producers to create a media haven unlike anything we’ve seen before.I don’t want bore or scare you with America’s lagging literacy stats. I also don’t want to just tell you that yes, The Brownies' Book will have your child reading on higher levels than any other magazine. And yes, their vocabulary will be that much more immaculate.","Publishing is generally a tough industry. However, I have support from my board with people from varying professions. Two golden men of YA  Jason Reynolds and Christopher Meyers are  helping me spearhead this venture. I do not foresee many challenges other than not being able to procure the funds to pay content creators and designers to actually get the magazine designed. There are few obstacles outside of the one listed. That being said, The Brownies Book will live up to its promise of being the literary treasure of the sun. We seek to create immersive experiences steeped in culture and literacy, and we hope to validate the multilayered and myriad of experiences of children of color, globally. Brownie children will be well-read, they’ll understand the beauty of diversity, respect difference, and know the healthiest representation of other people through fun activities, literature, and kid-created and kid-centric content about other great children.",https://www.kickstarter.com/projects/thebrowniesbook/a-revival-the-brownies-book?ref=discovery_category_newest,thebrowniesbook/a-revival-the-brownies-book,"A literary magazine created for Children of the Sun. We are grounded in history but steadfast about creating inspiring products that encourage paradigm shifts in literacy, teaching, and learning. Expanding the literary canon for the 21st century with transmedia provides an opportunity to create unique and relatable content based on the varied interests of today's youth. Our content will emphasize the importance of sense of self—a necessity for thriving in this rapidly technologically evolving world.Through our non-profit, The Brownie Collective, ten percent of profits from the magazine  will fund literacy programs and projects in the future. This resurgence of The Brownies’ Book is a revival. It is a nod to the intellectual and socio-political activism of Dr. William E.B. DuBois and the subsequent creation of the African diasporic children’s literary canon of the 20th century. ","Media production can be fickle and is determined by uncontrollable factors, at times. To guard against those pitfalls, we will produce quarterly magazines for the first year. Depending on the first year, we plan to publish six issues in the second year. Hopefully, this will provide effective pacing and scheduling during our building years. It is also very expensive to procure all the parts to produce a magazine. Artists, copyrights, licenses, designers, and other editorial staff are neither inexpensive nor an area to shortcut. We need complete our stretch funding goal to make 8-12 issues a reality. We hope after two years to have stronger funding, investments, and profits to avoid crowdfunding again. Independent crowdfunding for start-up funds is prudent to maintaining the intellectual integrity of the work."

Product riskThe Portal team has spent a lot of time not only insuring functionality, but making sure that said functionality is useful and save our users time and money.2. Efficient Budgeting The team at Portal has decades of experience managing large scale projects and businesses, furthermore every member of the Portal team has personally invested and believes in the product.

Fast FollowerAs an innovation we know there is nothing like Portal available anywhere, however we acknowledge that upon launch fast followers are par for the course. We have mitigated this risk by creating an innovation pipe-line with our customers, ensuring that we customize and adapt according to User feedback. 4. Long or Costly Acceptance CycleThe most important factor needed to mitigate this risk is ease of use as well as Portal's ability dramatically improve our Users computing life. In short Portal needs to be easier to use than the problems it's solving.  By continuing to focus on functionality and User feedback we will shorten our innovation's acceptance cycle to a minimum. 5. Market riskThe Portal team has mitigated market risk by identifying and targeting our initial ideal customer base. With the constant need to switch between tasks as well as share documents and websites, online education students are our ideal first customer. 6. Ability to scaleAs previously stated the Portal team has focused on functionality, including a robust back-end supported by world class cloud storage.

My goal is to get everyone who is a potential victim to have a structural barrier shield in their possession. When a red flag or level one warning is called, they can get it on their homes and businesses quickly, be on the road, and have peace of mind. I want them to leave feeling like they will not have to replace every item they owned. The lives they built in the home or business will still be standing when they get back and the only cleanup is outdoors of their intact structure.Our patented system was developed and inspired by the emergency tents that fireman use to fight forest fires. The Structural Barrier Shield fire protection system utilizes flame retardant panels that are constructed of a high-quality fire resistant material bonded to a reflective aluminum coating that reflects up to 95% of the radiant heat. Each panel is sewn with fire resistant threads. The Structural Barrier Shield’s design allows homeowners/business-owners to set it up themselves. It requires very little, if any, physical attachment to the structure. Anchors are screwed into the ground and are connected with straps. Once all of the panels cover the structure, each strap is tightened to secure each panel to the structure, effectively sealing the structure from wildfires. The reflective and insulating properties of the material protect the structure underneath from flame,embers, and radiant heat, keeping the structure and valuables safe from the flames.Our Plan:Build our Brand, create public awareness and assemble more quick response teams .Building our brand will take time and we will do this by attending home and trade shows, live demonstrations, and the presence of our response teams in critical areas. We will use social media marketing as well as conventional media advertisement.We will start to assemble more quick response teams in order to have our product where it's needed when it's needed. So if it takes our teams putting our Structure Barrier Shields on and removing them from each structure we will do it.Along with building brand awareness and assembling response teams, We would also like to create jobs. We believe once this project gets moving we will need extra hands to fill orders, manufacture panels and response team personnel to make this company as successful as possible. Although our focus now is on the United States and Canada eventually we would like to take our brand global and make it available to the world.","Challenges arise at the worst of times and unfortunately we have had our share and we will continue to have many more to work through. However my main challenge is product awareness, making the public aware of our product and getting product to the consumer before disaster strikes! Which is why we need you to back us and play a role in sharing this amazing product. Structural Barrier Shields is an effective way to keep structures in tact when the unexpected happens.",https://www.kickstarter.com/projects/153128811/wildfire-protection-barrier-shield?ref=discovery_category_newest,153128811/wildfire-protection-barrier-shield,"Wildfires have devastating consequences for people caught in their path. Thousands of families lose their homes, business and belongings every year.  Wildfires move quickly and unpredictably. People in at risk areas usually have little warning before they must evacuate their homes. Leaving them with no option but to abandon their belongings and get on the road quickly. They return to find that their home, business, family heirlooms and the memorable moments they shared in those places are gone. Many of them are left destitute and without a home. We believe that thousands of decent hard working individuals shouldn’t have to lose the things they spent a lifetime working for in a wildfire. That’s why we invented the Structural Barrier Shield. Inspired by the emergency shelters wild-land firefighters use in the field when trapped by fire. The Structural barrier shield is a simple and affordable but highly effective protective covering for homes, that reflects up to 95% of the radiant heat from a fire and prevents flames and embers from reaching the structure. The Structural Barrier Shield fire protection system utilizes flame retardant panels that are constructed of a high-quality fire resistant material bonded to a reflective aluminum coating that reflects up to 95% of the radiant heat.

The reflective and insulating properties of the material protect the structure underneath from flame, embers, and radiant heat, keeping the structure and valuables safe from the flames.Our goal is to raise awareness so that everyone living in a danger zone knows that they have an affordable, easy and accessible option to protect their property and valuables from total loss. We want to get a Structural Barrier Shield in every home and business in at risk areas throughout the country and eventually the world! With little resources to advertise we need to raise awareness for the Structural Barrier Shield and let people in at risk areas know that there is an affordable and easy way to protect their properties from the devastation of wildfires.Our volunteer wildfire response team will be traveling to at risk areas throughout the country to give away and install free Structural Barrier Shields to those in need. In order to accomplish this we need to pay for the traveling and lodging expenses associated with moving our team from state to state, as well as buy the materials (in bulk) to build the flame retardant panels.   It is crucial we buy the materials in bulk to keep the costs down and make each unit affordable. The lower we can get the cost the more units we can give away & homes that will be protected. We’re ready to roll. We’ve sourced all of our materials and have identified a manufacturer that can make the Structural Barrier Shield with little lead time. Orders can be placed at www.barriershields.com Please don't hesitate if you have any questions!","In an era of over saturation and with little resources to advertise we are constantly competing for people’s attention. Many of us today are adrift upon a sea of triviality, focused on the latest gadget, gizmo or video game, while truly important innovations that have the power to better or save lives go unnoticed. However, we believe this is changing, thanks to the power of the crowd. There has been a significant rise in the funding of projects for public good. That is why we are here.  It is vital that we raise awareness for the Structural Barrier Shield and let people in at risk areas know that there is an affordable and easy way to protect their property from the devastation of wildfires. Additionally, wildfires are not only a problem in the United States. They devastate communities all around the world. It is our goal to make this solution available for anyone anywhere that needs it. In order to spread our message globally we need to not only raise funds, we need to go viral. This is why your participation is so critical. We need all the help we can get spreading the word.  Please help us by sharing this campaign with your friends, family, coworkers, social media or anyone you think would like it. Together we can help protect families from the havoc wildfires wreak."

We are a team of dedicated professionals who love blockchain technology (emerging technology)and hope to bring the best there is in it. We come from diverse backgrounds and disciplines. What the team have in common is the innate need to solve problems regardless of how small or big. Majority of Distributed Ledger Technology (DLT) and Blockchain in their current states are not scaling: A fraction are truly P2P networks; a handful of these are quasi-decentralized; theirimplementation are rife with vulnerabilities. As a result, crypto-jacking is a new and rising cyber security threat. LokChain platform is designed to mitigate and prevent this problem.--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------LokChain means the development of an ecosystem consisting of protocols, a platform, and a suite of technologies that improve and securely integrate distributed ledgers or blockchains, mobile, and IoT.We believe that a hybrid-blockchain approach with the removal of all server (centralization) infrastructures will pave the way for interoperability- In turn, all platforms will scale at once, leading to cross-organization, cross-data storage, and cross certification. Mobile, IoT and Blockchain will be a match made in heaven. We have successfully resolved over 16 problems identified in the current blockchain space.All the technology modules behind LokChain Platform vested over 17+ years of research to potent patents that will augment the imminent and nascent distributed ledger technology (Blockchain):1.

How much you stayed outside in thatcold weather and sweated to clean the driveway? Wouldn't it be cool to have arobot to do this job? You can sit inside and drive the robot with a camerasystem, it will clean your driveway.Wewould like to make the snow cleaning job easier and even fun so we havedesigned and built our first prototype of the SnowBYTE.The robot body is made of aluminum and manufacturedby laser cutting. The Design of the body made it very strong regardless of the aluminum as the main body material.The power source of the first prototype is 4 units of 12VDCbatteries and the drive system is working with 2 DC motors which are runningthe tracks.Aftera huge number of calculations we came with a new design to overcome problemsfaced in the first prototype.Inorder to solve the lack of power, the new version is powered by a one cylinder30cc gasoline engine which can provide 2.7 HP energy. Thesnow throwing mechanism and thefront blades are powered mechanically by the gasoline engine.When the robotis running, the starter is used as dynamo to fill the batteries. By using this hybrid system the gas engine mechanical power is converted into electricity which is stored inthe batteries to be used by the 4x4 drive system as well as by the starter, sothat you don't need to pull a rope to start your robot engine.We've made the robot to be able to clean (servospeed) 33,3 m/min (109,25 feet/min). The robot's front blade is 36 cmwide(14,17 inches) and 21cm high(8,27). So that you can clean 11,88 m2/min(127,88 feet2/min).The thrower part is designed to rotate 4 timesfaster than the front blades, so that you can really throw your snow out. As an option SnowBYTE is equipped with an attachable blade under the body of the robot, making it a lawn mower - GrassBYTE.Speed: 33,3 m/min – 109,25 feet/minWidth: 36 cm – 14,17 inchesBlade height: 21 cm – 8,27 inchesSnow throwing capacity: 11,88 m2/min –127,88 feet2/minGrass cutting capacity: 10,56 m2/min -113,61 feet2/minEnergy: Gasoline powered hybrid.Gasoline usage: 0,9092 liter/hour – 32 oz/hour.Endurance: 1 hour – 712,8 m2 – 7672,8feet2.Incline: 10 degrees.The creator of the project is an Associate Professor of Mechatronics at the Istanbul Technical University. Earlier he worked on military and rescue robots. He has built an Explosive Ordnance Disposal robot for the Turkish Air Force, and another portable IED robot for the Istanbul Police Force will be completed this year. Different mobile robot platforms are needed for rescue operations and some of the platforms he has built include a fireproof firefighting robot, a screw wheel omnidirectional platform, an 8x8 portable border patrol robot and a camera stabilization system for an all-terrain robot.Majid is a Ph.D. student in Mechatronics Engineering, in Istanbul Technical University. He has a Master and Bachelor’s degree in Mechanical Engineering, with extensive experience in Ardupilot, calibration, motor drivers and sensors. He has been responsible for electrical and electronics design and implementation in many robotic and automation projects both for university and industry. In this project, he will be realizing the electronics of the SnowBYTE. Mehmet graduated from manufacturing engineering at Istanbul Technical University. Now, he is studying in the Mechatronic Engineering Master’s program at ITU. Also, he is doing a second Master’s program in Mechanical Engineering. He worked on robotic projects such as a Stewart platform, 3 DOF mechanism robots and industrial robots. He is working on robot mechanism, design and control.","Since we have been building robots for 11 years, so many of the risks have already been handled and solutions to these problems have been learned with the completed projects. The challenges of this project are:1)	Reliability: Calculation, testing and optimization. We are taking this robot very seriously and calculating every different section of it very carefully so we can build a very reliable robot. After the calculations we have already built the first prototype and are currently testing all the key sections to make sure everything works smoothly. Optimization of the robot will improve the performance.2)	Cold Start: To be able to start the gasoline engine in cold temperatures we are selecting our starter motor and battery capacity high enough so that you will be able to crank the engine at least 100 times to start.3)	No Charge: We have designed the electrical system such a way that once you start your engine the starter motor of the gasoline engine will work as a charger and keep charging the batteries so you don't need to worry about running out of charge when you are cleaning the snow. But you will still need to fill the gas tank!",https://www.kickstarter.com/projects/711113808/arduleg-open-robot-platform-arduino-based-android?ref=discovery_category_newest,711113808/arduleg-open-robot-platform-arduino-based-android,"This project is about learningelectronics and robotics in a fun way.

The philosophy behind the establishment of a Goat Farm is the protection and reconstruction of the Carpathian Goat breed.In the United Kingdom, the number of animals covered by the Genetic Resources Program for Carpathian Goats is currently 154 pieces, the species is currently in extinction, and we want to reconstruct the race.We wish to preserve and multiply the species at the same time producing high-quality natural cheeses in an ecological environment.We have designed the Ecological Goat Farm as an ultra-modern self-sufficient ecological farm with leading breeding of dairy Carpathian Goats and the production of cottage cheese and long-keeping cheese.Ecological goat breeding is based on solid principles of natural resources protection, limitation of carbon footprint, food and consumption of locally grown and prepared dishes, as well as creating a better world for life.This unique perspective clearly shows the quality of the organic production of cheese, green gardens, natural food and the ease of achieving it all.Ecological Goat Farm will be created out of love for nature to meet the growing needs of the community in the range of natural, local and organic food that shares the same views and is concerned about what they eat and what they feed their children. This is a community that is tired of ""fresh"" cheese bought in the grocery store. When it is more than likely that these ""fresh"" cheeses have been decorated with artificial dyes and stuffed with fillers and E, depriving them of virtually the entire nutritional value.Creating Ecological Goat Farm we had in mind the implementation of ecology in every aspect of the farm, from healthy rearing goats to renewable energy sources necessary for the smooth and healthy functioning of the farm.Photo-voltaic glassOnyx Solar is the world's leading producer of transparent photo-voltaic (PV) glass for buildings. PV glass is used as a building material and as an energy generating device that captures sunlight and converts it into electricity. PV was made of two or more sheets of toughened glass, safe and providing the same thermal and sound insulation and natural light as conventional architectural glass. Therefore, it is installed instead of ordinary glass on the facades of buildings, curtain walls, atrium, roofs and terrace floor.Photo-voltaic roof facade - Onyx Solar has designed a photo-voltaic ventilated façade and roof system that provides undeniable aesthetics, great thermal properties and a new source of free, clean electricity.Ecological Goat Farm, which draws on the resources of Onyx Solar - a recognized and awarded (over 40 awards) a global leader of transparent PV glass for buildings, would be the only undertaking of this type in Poland, if not in Europe.Green technology - Biological wastewater treatment and Zero Waste PolicyBy treating the Ecological Goat Farm as one living, healthy organism, we adhere to the Zero Waste principle. We have set ourselves the goal of reducing to an absolute minimum the production of rubbish and waste and for the purposes of Organic Goat Farm, apply the 5R rule:Refuse, Reduce, Reuse, Recycle, and Rot (compost).The collected funds will serve to create the most modern and the only self-sufficient in energy and production of the goat farm supporting the reconstruction of the Carpathian Goat breed.The collected funds will serve to create the most modern and the only self-sufficient in energy and production of the goat farm supporting the reconstruction of the Carpathian goat breed.We want to start building an organic farm within a month. The support, that you will give us, will not only help preserve the dying race of the Carpathian goat but also create a local market for farm goat cheeses that do not exist now.Our farm will be an example for other farmers who want to modernize the collapsing unprofitable farms.Once the Ecological Goat Farm starts it's activity, you will be very welcome to visit us.Thank you.","The biggest challenge we will face will be to fulfil all the provisions contained in the business plan on time.

The protagonist is a down-on-his-luck every man who thinks he’s hit the jackpot when a mysterious and sexy bombshell of a woman wants to go home with with him. He wakes up months later not only perfectly ok with her dark alley extra curriculars but also comes to aid her in them, killing various men for her to feed on. [From ScreenCraft 2016 Horror Screenplay Contest Evaluation]Hello my name is Alex Anico and I am a writer, illustrator, & director and sole owner and operator of Studio Mogura, a comic book, film & animation think tank based in Miami, FL.  My current project is my first feature film called Shannon.Shannon is my second feature length screenplay and my first horror script. It is also my directorial debut and has been in development for almost 4 years. It started out as 3 pages, grew to 30 and then became a 90+ page feature length script. It is a Post Neo-Noir Horror Comedy Thriller (or a Horror Noir or Noirror) and plays out like a mini-series. It is split up into 4 Acts and is filmed in black & white, a staple in Film Noir. I wrote the project so that the cost would be minimal as filming takes place in a limited amount of locations and the main cast in place is committed and eager to complete the film after working on Act I last year.I am seeking backers and producers to help elevate the feature. It will also allow me to hire someone to assist coordinating two major scenes: A car accident and a shootout in a public area. I am in no way qualified to handle the scenes on my own. Filmmaking is typically a team effort and I'm already stretched thin. I wrote the script, am directing and producing, handle the camera, the lights, the sound, the special effects, the scheduling, and the negotiating. This is my third or fourth attempt to fund this project on Kickstarter and besides what’s been donated through a GoFundMe, there is basically no budget outside of my own pocket. I’ve hired friends to play the main actors who the characters were actually based on and I’ve written the script in a manner that would allow me to film it without need for expensive cameras and equipment for the most part, keeping the budget as minimal as possible so that I can focus on finding funding for the two major scenes (junk cars, stunt driver, police, on site paramedics just in case, permits etc.) and also help give the film a professional touch. After filming Act I last year, I’ve spent all year pitching and gathering props supplies and doing the final castings. I want to prove to producers that I can direct and I’m out here making this not just writing it and crossing my fingers. I’m looking for backers who want to support an independent boutique studio with lots of raw talent, passion and original content and a project that is ready to film immediately. I do taxes as my real job and frankly I don’t want to anymore. It sucks. To a creative mind it's like locking a race horse in the stables while staring at an open track and making it handle your corporation. It wasn’t what I even went to school for. I went for art, film, and screenwriting and I'm ready for a change. So If you're interested in funding a small indie project that has the potential for aggressive expansion, please back this project.I also plan on putting the picture though the festival circuit and I'm hoping to find someone that would not only like to partner up on this project but also sees the potential in my other works.All donors under $15 will be eligible to win a DVD & digital copy of Shannon, a T-Shirt or a poster.All donors over $15 will receive a DVD copy of Shannon once the film is completed.Check out the rewards below for the specifics.A log line can be read below but a synopsis and screenplay are currently only available for viewing by verified studios, producers and directors.SHANNONACT Iby Alex AnicoLOGLINE:When a man falls for a sexy bombshell, he finds himself an accomplice to her particular predilection: cannibalism.CastTodd: Carla SaenzShannon: Carolina FerrerErica: Sabrina AnicoRoberto: J.C.

If not then I'll have to do what I did last year with Act I and cut out a lot of stuff. I'd rather not but regardless of what happens with the Kickstarter this film is being made.

It is a horror comedy anthology series hosted by Raymond, a skeleton gentleman in a blue suit that entertains readers with his many horror, mystery, sci-fi and occult tales. It takes after comics and shows like Tales from the Crypt and the Twilight Zone and is an homage to the many horror hosts that have come throughout the years.After being chosen as a finalist for the MIA Animation Pitch to the Industry contest in 2013 I decided to shift the project from a comic to an animated series targeted to a 14+ audience but ideally, best suited for young adults and will be pitched to studios like Cartoon Network, Fox, Netflix & Comedy Central among others..Over the years I've been refining the project and developing the pilot and 12 episode series which I finished writing this past year. Currently the pilot episode is only available for reading on The Black List., but I've included the Logline and a brief synopsis of the pilot and overall series below. This past month I've been developing an intro to the show to help give studios,producers, agents and managers a better idea of what the show is about. The video you see if the first draft and still requries the final music and final shading and animated details.The project's goal is basically to fund the studio for a year in order to complete the pilot episode, which is how long I estimate it will take to draw, record the voices & soundtrack and animate the whole show. Bear in mind this is low budget for an animated work which means I'll be doing the animation myself. If I can get funded then I can hire some extra hands for help. I would love to team up with MIA Animation and Miami Dade College which is nearby and have their student animators help out with a paid internship.Any extra funds will also go toward pitching the show to prospective studios, producers and agents and entering it in contests and festivals.Shirts are made by Teepublic and stickers will be done by StickerGuy.

Un día su vida cambia por completo al encontrarse a Gideon, un mercenario demasiado astuto y que solo piensa en sí mismo, y que por ciertas causas terminan armando un lazo muy fuerte.Pero detrás de todo esto surge la la gran incógnita.¿en verdad es correcto el dilema de Gideon?, ¿ser un superhéroe o solo es una ficción creada para qué Roy haga lo incorrecto?“Roy_Flowers” es una serie cruda, madura e irreverente al mismo tiempo, se aspira a tener un arco argumental y todo el humor posible, no cayendo en mexicanismos, y si tener su propia esencia y ser una de las preferidas del público en general, tocando lo políticamente incorrecto entorno a temas sociales de la última década, y a la vez mostrando personajes con problemas emocionales y comunes, que cualquier humano puede vivir, la esencia de los mismos radica en imprimir sentimientos y debilidades para poder hacerlos más humanos, que el espectador sienta conexión y de cierta manera puedan identificarse.“Roy_Flowers” es una explosión de cultura popular, toma elementos de diversas caricaturas representativas de los últimos años, a pesar de ello tendrá lo suyo, siendo fresca y tal vez podría ser única. Combina todo tipo de género, drama, acción, comedia y por supuesto humor.ROY FLOWERS.GIDEON.GARY & CATO.M-BOYSe decidió la presente propuesta en Kickstarter debido a que podría ser una buena idea para iniciar este sueño, después de todo, el objetivo es destacar en el ámbito de la animación en México, un país donde hay excelentes animadores y talento de sobra, infortunadamente dicha animación es estereotipada, por ende, hacen ver al Mexicano como fan de los tacos y el tequila, esta historia será hecha en México pero sin necesidad de implementar estereotipos. El objetivo de este proyecto es ser representantes de este medio de la animación en México, contamos con todo tipo de bocetos, guion y un sin fin de historias por contar, el principal obstáculo es el capital, el cual se requiere para cubrir todos los gastos que lleva esto, nuestra meta es producir esta serie y poder mostrarle a todo el mundo está increíble historia.Como anécdota, un día estaba en una dinámica con unos compañeros, en la cual se entregaría un mensaje donde podría motivar a las personas, al momento de que me entregaron mi mensaje supe que tenía que intentar esto y poder cumplir mi sueño:FACEBOOK:https://www.facebook.com/royfloweers/INSTAGRAM:https://www.instagram.com/roy_flowersmx/TWITTER:https://twitter.com/Roy__FlowersHello, my name is Rodrigo Alejandro González López I have 19 years old, currently studying at the Technological University of Emiliano Zapata and live in Cuernavaca Morelos.Everything starts to be studying high school, as it was everyday in class and not quite involved in it, I thought I scratch my notebook while it seemed to pay attention, and according to the time these lines seemed to make sense, resulting in what I considered at that time my first character, Same as I considered developing it with very peculiar characteristics both physical, psychological, emotional and even a name, I had definitely noticed in me a need to continue drawing another character, and then another and another, and not only that, but arose the Idea of correlating them in order to tell a story based on an adventure that included various genres of the seventh art.As time passed I was completing my purpose of creating characters, while still drawing I understood that I had to generate an harmony between them, and obviously, this step knew that it was not possible without a script, then I started with the task of writing Everything What each character had to express according to the personality that he had imagined from the beginning, as the days passed he went beyond a personal pastime,It became beyond a personal pastime, since it was not only to draw but to give sense and relationship in each of the characters that emerged from my mind, and in a way had a great impact on myself, as I realized the possibility of taking it as a project Serious and formal which could take a big dimension,so I considered sharing it to more people, exposing the idea to close people who could understand what they wanted to transmit and had the possibility to understand what resided in my mind, and beyond that it seems an idea too chaotic and in some way impossible.All this was changed when I made the decision to expose some friends what I had done and devised so far, and when I did, I was surprised that they had the initiative to support me in everything, for me was something incredible, but while explaining in front of them , my mind passed that this was an idea very crazy and in some way impossible, although deep inside I wanted to expose everything to the world.The argument of the story is about a boy and a glass experiencing an endless adventures of all kinds, strange, fun and very dangerous, while all this happens develops a very interesant history.Roy is a boy of 18 years with problems of self-esteem and addiction, quite affected by his experiences of the past, and that could be considered without concrete future and no virtue, him, a character that deserves to be analyzed to understand its philosophy. One day his life changes completely when he finds Gideon, a mercenary too cunning and only thinks of himself, and for certain reasons end up arming a very strong bond, but behind all this arises the great Incognita.Is Gideon's dilemma really correct?, be a superhero or just a fiction created for Roy to do the wrong thing?""Roy Flowers"" is crude, mature and irreverent at the same time, is aspired to have a storyline and all the humor possible, not falling into Mexicanismos, and if you have your own essence and be one of the favorites of the general public, touching it politically Incorrect environment to social issues of the last decade, and at the same time showing characters with emotional and common problems, that any human can live, the essence of them lies in printing feelings and weaknesses in order to make them more human, that the spectator feels connection and in a certain way they can identify with him.""Roy Flowers"" is an explosion of popular culture, takes elements of various representative caricatures of recent years, despite this will have his own, being fresh and perhaps could be unique. It combines all kinds of genre, drama, action, comedy and of course...humor.It was decided post this in Kickstarter because it might be a good idea to start this dream, after all, the goal is to highlight in the field of animation in Mexico, a country where there are excellent animators and talent, unfortunately said Animation is stereotyped, therefore, make Mexican as a fan of tacos and tequila, this story will be made in Mexico but without the need to implement stereotypes,The objective of this project is to be representatives of this medium of animation in Mexico, we have all kinds of sketches, screenplay and an endless number of stories to tell, the main obstacle is the capital, which is required to cover all expenses that takes this , our goal is to produce this series and to show everyone is amazing story.one day I was in a dynamic with some companions, in which would deliver a message where I could motivate people, the moment they delivered my message I knew I had to try this and fulfill my dream:FACEBOOK:https://www.facebook.com/royfloweers/INSTAGRAM:https://www.instagram.com/roy_flowersmx/TWITTER:https://twitter.com/Roy__Flowers","no contamos con el capital necesario para poder cubrir todos los costos,es evidente que se necesita de mucho apoyo para poder hacer un proyecto de esta magnitud,confiamos totalmente en las expectativas del proyecto nos aseguraremos de entregar un proyecto de calidad y poder cumplir todos los objetivos que nos propusimos como equipo.",https://www.kickstarter.com/projects/alexgl/roy-flowers-0?ref=discovery_category_newest,alexgl/roy-flowers-0,,No juntar el capital necesario para poder sacar el proyecto.
https://www.kickstarter.com/projects/civilized/sacrifice-and-solace?ref=discovery_category_newest,civilized/sacrifice-and-solace,"Canadians are in the midst of celebrating the 100th year anniversary of The Great War, in particular the battles fought on The Western Front from 1914 to 1918. We have composed a variety of songs, and added a few of the classics from this era, such as Danny Boy and In Flanders Fields, to tell the story of going to war. We are now raising the funds to record the album ""live off the floor"" in Toronto. These songs will be sung by anall-male hand-picked choir and this choral album will then take the listener through a emotional period in history that is flanked by patriotism on one hand to the horrors of war on the other; yet somehow, and in some place, the soldiersfound solace and showed us in their letters and poemson their inspiring journeythat their sacrifice was not in vain.","We have assembled a professional team to assist us and The Toronto Ensemble in making this unique and compelling album, from composers and arrangers, creative artists and engineers, to executives and advisors on many levels, in order to produce a product we are all very happy with and excited to release across the country.",https://www.kickstarter.com/projects/civilized/power-to-the-people-0?ref=discovery_category_newest,civilized/power-to-the-people-0,"The money being sought is not to produce a feature film but to attract and retain the needed staff from lawyers, accountants and writers to produce a decent pitch for Hollywood.This is a true story.In 2010, I and a group of friends decided to launch a company that would save the world. We intended to fly into developing nations and offer large-scale solar farms and, with a signed agreement in hand, then assemble the teams to bring each project to fruition, recognizing every country across the equatorial belt (roughly over 60 countries) are facing an energy crisis and escalating power shortages, due mainly to aging generators - fed by fossil fuels - which within a few decades will be redundant, not to mention the limited and declining and expensive supply of gas and oil.Before leaving Toronto, we had met with numerous manufacturers and financiers and (upon securing both critical elements of the equation) set about to provide what we called The Apollo Acre - a 2MW turnkey solar farm that could provide power to a small community of homes, a factory, hospital or school - that simply required roughly 5 acres of land, not to mention a nearby sub-station in order to effectively transmit electricity into the local grid.We first went to the Caribbean nations, beginning with Jamaica, and over the course of a few years had met most energy ministers to only discover these islands had their electricity supplied by a monopoly (and typically foreign owned corporation), a right granted long ago during colonial times. Due to a few elements of luck and timing, we ended up also visiting Nicaragua, the home of the Sandinistas, where, as fans of The Clash, we thought we would achieve great success, had we not met first Senor Pellas. We thought - with the erection of the Siepac Line - that Nicaragua would eventually become a net exporter of energy, and the dominos would fall one by one in Central America. We, sadly, are known as Gringos and came to learn thus are essentially hated in these countries. But, what could possibly go wrong? The UN. Basically, Japan wanted the pro-whaling vote of Nicaragua, and offered to build them a hydro dam in exchange, of course by flooding a valley in the process and dislocating an indigenous people. After our pitch, getting thrown out of the Energy Minister's office was the net result...After hearing of the huge tsunami that had destroyed a lot of the coastal areas of Sri Lanka (through a Belgian friend of one of our new VPs who had previously met each other in Nicaragua whose parents had lost their business), we ended up in Colombo in early 2012. Based on the people we subsequently met, and the things we heard - namely with respect to the civil war (a brutal period of 26 years) that had also recently ended, rather violently for the Tamil population located in the northern part of the island - and knowing the Energy Minister had written a book on how green energy would be the saviour of not only their own country but many others as well, we thought we could be the White Knights... until we met the Utility's Head Administrator who kindly introduced us to the word ""capacity"". Even if we financed and built 10 2MW solar farms, or 6 10MW farms, the utility did not have the capacity to distribute the new electricity.Disappointed, we left. Empty-handed. The day after I got back to Toronto, my dad died. My mum had died just a few months prior. It was a difficult few months, but still we persevered to save the world, and continued to speak with many people who knew many people who needed power.On Valentine's Day 2013 I had a mini-stroke, which left me speechless.Nonetheless throughout 2013, while negotiations and meetings continued unabated with many more desperate people representing many communities globally (and trying to manage expectations and determine priorities) we ended up in Belgium talking to the Libyans in the new post-Ghadaffi era, and in fact talking to the chap who was writing the new constitution. We met him and some other of his cohorts in several European cities, eventually after understanding our partner could not be Chinese, due to the fact they had helped Ghadaffi, we prepared a tender for four massive solar power plants in the desert, which was signed in late 2013 with a value of $1.2 billion, and so we excitedly waited in Paris for our Visas in order to visit Tripoli and to begin collecting our paycheques. What could possibly go wrong? Benghazi.We then ended up in Budapest. With Hungary in the European Union, the vaunted Great Plain was no longer a viable bread basket, but our long-time friend (from Toronto) who had suddenly inherited his parents land informed us it would be now ideal to locate a huge solar farm there, that could span many former agricultural acres, and he had met with the former farmers who agreed. And so, with the stage set for success, we visited the capital. What could possibly go wrong? Budapest is where our President of Solamon met the girl of his dreams, well, one of them, and decided to stay and make it his home.After attending a conference held in London in early 2014 regarding the future of West Africa and the many countries comprising it, from Senegal to Namibia, who were experiencing daily power shortages, despite their collective sunny climate, and deciding not to visit Cameroon but Ghana instead, we after receiving many inoculations, we headed to Accra, the capital, a safe and civil former British colony, expecting to meet decision makers from across West Africa from a central base of operations. Indeed after meeting tribal chiefs and government ministers, as well as administrators and bureaucrats, we registered a company and formed a partnership locally, who could also assist us with Nigeria as well. All was set for a very profitable run of providing solar farms big and small, for private and public use, not to mention also meeting people who could help us in Eastern Africa, from Somalia and Ethiopia, to Kenya and Uganda. While in Ghana, what could possibly go wrong? Well, not just Ebola, but also Boko Haram. We returned home, again, empty-handed.Essentially, despite our best efforts on behalf of all stakeholders, the company had gradually fallen apart with not a single penny being made from the sale of any solar power plant after five years of travelling thousands of miles, visiting over 30 countries, holding countless meetings and producing many valuable documents and providing requisite tenders. The last straw came after leaving Ghana, where an energy conference was held, at which our partners attended in our absence, and during which the Energy Minister held up our tender (to provide a 10MW solar farm on the outskirts of Accra on tribal land for which we had approval from the Tribal Chief himself), whereby at least half a dozen competitors from around the world jumped up to seize the opportunity and offer to build the project at half the cost.Yes, cost of equipment and in particular solar panels had crashed in 5 years and we could not compete, keeping in mind the corruption that was plainly evident at every level in every department in each government and we were not about to bribe anyone in order to secure a contract. Without contracts, unfortunately, we could not build. There were and still are many competitors, be assured, willing to pay the necessary monies to secure contracts. However, there is still in each of these countries a severe lack of capacity - there are no fat wires able to transmit new electricity. The answer lies in the building of what are called micro-grids - whereby electricity generated from the power of the Sun, possibly aided by wind turbines, is then stored in batteries or by many other new technologies now on the market and then supplied locally.There is still hope.If this film is funded, and I hope you agree the story is a great one, we can then begin to get back on the road and offer micro-grids for schools and clinics and remote communities around the world, and help stop wars that are being waged for control of resources and to make the world a better place for our children and their children. If you agree, donate and share this page and get some friends together and form a collective and you'll be named as producers or funders. It's a story that needs to be told.","In terms of a project, the production of a single film begins with a properly accessed and qualified team of professionals, before the process of shooting and editing begins. In this regard, I am familiar with many of these people and understand that once the script has been written a much larger creative team must then be assembled in order to then acquire a suitable distribution partner, in the form of a major studio based in Hollywood, capable of producing a product in the vein of The Wolf of Wall Street, as well as an ad agency and public relations firm."

They have their origins in Indian religions and have been adopted into East Asian religions via the spread of Buddhism. Preta is often translated into English as ""hungry ghost"" from the Chinese adaptation. In early sources such as the Petavatthu, they are much more varied. The descriptions below apply mainly in this narrower context.Pretas are believed to have been false, corrupted, compulsive, deceitful, jealous and/or greedy people in a previous life. As a result of their karma, they are afflicted with an insatiable hunger for a particular substance or object. Traditionally, this is something repugnant or humiliating, such as cadavers or feces, though in more recent stories, it can be anything, however bizarre.”It can easily be traits or characteristics attributed to ADDICTION.A more accurate description of the life of an addict would be difficult to write.

They have their origins in Indian religions and have been adopted into East Asian religions via the spread of Buddhism. Preta is often translated into English as ""hungry ghost"" from the Chinese adaptation. In early sources such as the Petavatthu, they are much more varied. The descriptions below apply mainly in this narrower context.Pretas are believed to have been false, corrupted, compulsive, deceitful, jealous and/or greedy people in a previous life. As a result of their karma, they are afflicted with an insatiable hunger for a particular substance or object. Traditionally, this is something repugnant or humiliating, such as cadavers or feces, though in more recent stories, it can be anything, however bizarre.”It can easily be traits or characteristics attributed to ADDICTION.A more accurate description of the life of an addict would be difficult to write. Addiction is a terrible disease that has ruined many lives for many years.  Recently, in the last century, a simple way has been proving itself in the lives of many addicts. Hundreds of thousands of addicts are finding relief and recovery from addiction by belonging to 12 Step programs, and applying spiritual principals in their lives.Pyetta.com was formed out of a belief that more could be achieved if we can communicate our stories and share our experiences.

Different batteries can provide more or less power so the number of hours will vary.  For a golfer that plays 2-3 rounds a week a single battery should provide 5-6 weeks of power on average.

The 4-Play is a universal console-to-USB controller adapter with 4 controller ports which allow up to 4 players to play at the same time on the Windows, Mac, Linux, or the PS3 with almost any controller of their choosing. It uses adapter cables which allow a variety of console controllers to plug into the 4-Play's universal controller port. This allows the 4-Play to support a wide variety of controllers on one USB adapter.  Before the 4-Play, players had to buy USB adapters for each console port. These USB adapters can be had cheaply but still add up the cost quickly. Some of these adapter required drivers and none of them map the buttons in the same way. The 4-Play solves this problem by allowing the player to buy one adapter and a number of low cost cables. for each controller port.   With the 4-Play almost any console controller in the history of gaming can now be used on Windows, OSX, Linux, Raspberry Pi, Android, and even the PS3! In fact, the 4-Play does not require the installation of software drivers by the user. It's a plug-and-play device right out of the box. Any operating system that is USB aware and can support USB hubs will work with the 4-Play.  The 4-Play already supports these 17 controller ports:  More controller ports can easily be added to the 4-Play's repertoire. All that's needed is a new adapter cable and a firmware update which can easily be applied from your PC via the 4-Play's USB port. The number of controllers that the 4-Play could theoretically support is practically limitless. See the Feature Listsection for a more exhaustive list of what this amazing device is capable of..: Using the 4-Play  The 4-Play comes ready to use. No extra assembly is required. Simply connect the 4-Play to the computer via USB. Then plug the controller into its corresponding adapter cable. Plug the cable into the 4-Play, and you're ready to go.  You can now use almost any controller ever made on your computer, Raspberry Pi, or PS3. Old games can be played on emulators the way you remember them: with their original controller. You can even use old school controllers with their excellent D-pads on modern games which require very precise input. Now your multi-emulator arcade machine can support as many controllers as it does games, and all from one simple device..: Feature List.: Kickstarter Exclusive Offerings  The Kickstarter reward version of the 4-Play will have a special translucent purple case for that nice, old-school look reminiscent of the Gameboy Color. It will also be the only version of the 4-Play to utilize the HDMI connector for it's universal controller ports. HDMI is a stronger connector and the cables can be extended more easily. We're calling it the ""Torizo Edition"" in reference to the notorious enemy in the old SNES classic, Super Metroid.  As for what we'll use in the production version of the 4-Play which we hope to see on store shelves someday, the DisplayPort connector has been selected instead of HDMI because of heavy royalty costs required to use HDMI in mass manufacturing. Don't worry though, we'll still provide the HDMI adapter cables for the replacement of defective or damaged cables. For more questions about the differences between the Kickstarter and future versions of the 4-Play, please see the FAQs section below..: The Goal  The 4-Play's design is already complete and our beta testers are helping with the final development of the firmware as we speak. The last remaining barrier to getting the 4-Play to the player is the manufacturing cost. We have found a fabricator to manufacture the 4-Play, but to get the final cost of the product to a reasonable figure the manufacturer requires a large order. Large orders are expensive and Bliss-Box doesn't have the cash to place such a large order on its own. This is why we need your help! Bliss-Box is so close to bringing this awesome product to the market, and crowd funding seems like the perfect solution for a small startup like Bliss-Box..: Stretch Goals.: Reward DetailsAll rewards (except where mentioned otherwise) will be in full retail packaging and include at least 4 adapter cables so no extra purchases are necessary in order to use the 4-Play. The MEGA Pack includes a power adapter that allows the force feedback to work at full capacity. The power adapter is not necessary to use the 4-Play so it is only provided for the MEGA Packs, but for those who want to use the full power force feedback, don't worry. Power adapters can be purchasedseparately..: Choosing Your Adapters  If you've chosen a reward tier which requires you to choose which adapters you want you'll be prompted to fill out a survey. At this time please specify which adapters you'd like to receive. If you do not fill out the survey you will get Sega adapters by default. When filling out the survey, please use the exact naming scheme below(without the description after the dash of course) so that we can handle your request properly:Sega - For all db9 controllers except the vectrex.N64WiiGameCubeNESSNESVirtual BoyTurboGrafx-16 Full - This is the common port.TurboGrafx-16 Mini - This is the mini port. Check your controller. PlayStationJaguarSaturnPC-FXNeo Geo - For all dh15 like connectors.DreamcastVectrexPippin.: ""Build Your Own"" Rewards Explained  These cables are fabricated for the 4-Play adapter, but could be used for other projects when paired with the HDMI breakout board pictured below. The HDMI connector offers a small, durable, and convenient interface, and this board is readily available on the internet for a cheap price. When paired with our adapter cables it provides a nice way to connect many different controllers to a device of your own.  Our cables are available in a wide variety of rare, hard to find ports such as the PC-FX, Virtual Boy, and Pippin controllers. The wiring schematics for the cables will be publicly available on the our webpage. Check out the ""Build Your Own"" rewards if you're interested in using our adapter cables for DIY projects. Remember, these rewards DO NOT include the 4-Play device. Only the adapter cables are included, and the retail 4-Play sold after the Kickstarter will use a DisplayPort connector instead of the HDMI connector to lower the cost of the final unit. These ""Build Your Own"" rewards are for enthusiasts who'd like to use Bliss-Box's adapter cables in their own projects, and we wanted to offer rewards to those who would be interested in that sort of endeavor..: Support  Support will be provided for the 4-Play via our website and on the forums. If the problem is found to be hardware related, the manufacturer will handle your issue and help you get a replacement 4-Play or adapter cable. All firmware issues will be handled by Bliss-Box..: The History of Bliss-Box  Bliss-Box started back in 2007. I was looking all over the market for a product that could adapt all the controllers I wanted to the PC for use with emulation, but I couldn't find anything that did what I wanted. I also didn't want to spend tons of money buying all these adapters separately, and there were many controllers I couldn't find adapters for at all.  One day I stumbled onto the work of Raphael at Raphnet and it set me on my journey to create the first Bliss-Boxes myself. I posted about my work online, and soon others were asking me to create custom versions for them. Soon enough the orders for Bliss-Boxes were more than I could handle, so I decided it was time to make a manufactured product to solve this problem for everyone once and for all. The Kickstarter is the final phase of this long journey.  The development of the 4-Play has been an ordeal in and of itself. Because I was dead-set on creating the 4-Play without the use of drivers, I met some difficult limitations early on. You see, the 4-Play uses a USB standard called HID (Human Interface Device). The wonderful thing about this standard is that if a system supports USB, it supports HID. This is what gives the 4-Play its incredibly cross-platform support.  However, there are some limitations with the standard that I had to grapple with early on. How would I transfer the inputs fast enough on a USB 1.1 interface? How would I support complex operations like memory pack saving which are not supported by HID?  Over years of toil I am proud to say that all of these problems have been tackled with the help of Mike at Etonnet and the long hours I've spent writing the code for the firmware. It required some clever tricks, but all the features I had hoped to achieve for the 4-Play have come to fruition or will soon. I hope that someday players will be able to enjoy the 4-Play as much as I have enjoyed developing it..: The Future  Bliss-Box has so many more projects we want to work on. From the production of the Single-Play to solving the LCD light gun problem, we're determined to continue the forward march of emulation and games preservation as well as enjoy modern games in ways that were impossible before. The success of this Kickstarter would bring Bliss-Box to a future we thought was much further away. We thank all our backers for their help in making this possible..: Open Source    The 4-Play is based on the original hand made Bliss-Box adapter which is an open source project based on other open source projects likeV-USB and the work ofRaphaël Assénatof Raphnet.Check out the project page for Bliss-Box and other projects and people that made the 4-Play possible:","In many ways this project is already a success. We have a fully working version of the product which is currently in beta testing to finish the firmware development, and we've found a manufacturer to actually build a batch of 4-Plays for the Kickstarter campaign. Our main obstacle is acquiring the capital to actually place an order from our mass-manufacturer, and to finish designing the final retail version of the 4-Play for store shelves (see the FAQs for an explanation of the differences between the Kickstarter 4-Play and the final retail version).    Mike Zhao at Etonnet has agreed to help design the final retail version of the 4-Play. Many prototypes have been tested and we're well on our way to finishing that as well. Mike is one of the easiest people I have ever worked with. He has helped us every step of the way and we truly appreciate his efforts.    For many projects it’s about money or popularity. This is not what Bliss-Box is about. We're gamers and our passion has driven us to address this shortcoming in emulation. It has been achieved with great success, and now we hope we can bring it to you with your help.",https://www.kickstarter.com/projects/544088930/bliss-box-4-play-one-adapter-for-many-controllers-0?ref=discovery_category_newest,544088930/bliss-box-4-play-one-adapter-for-many-controllers-0,"------------------------------------------------------------  Successes, Bliss-Box has reached its goal and we are proud to announce 4-play is a go! We are now supplying the product to multiple resellers. The goal of the discounted KS item was not reached (75k) but we have a deal for those that pledged. The Kickstarter had two goals when launched, to secure a solution for purchases in high volume and a low cost version of the 4-play. The answer came in the way of KS exposure instead of the funding goal. Bliss-Box wanted to let the community and fans have a first shot at a limited addition, low-cost, once in a life time opportunity. So, if you backed this project, we will still honor that price. If it was not for the overwhelming exposure we would not have succeeded and we are very thankful.  So, backers!

From the production of the Single-Play to solving the LCD light gun problem, we're determined to continue the forward march of emulation and games preservation as well as enjoy modern games in ways that were impossible before. The success of this Kickstarter would bring Bliss-Box to a future we thought was much further away. We thank all our backers for their help in making this possible.Open Source      The 4-Play is based on the original hand made Bliss-Box adapter which is an open source project based on other open source projects like V-USB and the work of Raphaël Assénat of Raphnet.Check out the project page for Bliss-Box and other projects and people that made the 4-Play possible:KS helper links: http://kickingitforward.org ","In many ways this project is already a success. We have a fully working version of the product which is currently in beta testing to finish the firmware development, and we've found a manufacturer to actually build a batch of 4-Plays for the Kickstarter campaign. Our main obstacle is acquiring the capital to actually place an order from our mass-manufacturer, and to finish designing the final retail version of the 4-Play for store shelves.Mike Zhao at Etonnet has agreed to help design the final retail version of the 4-Play. Many prototypes have been tested and we're well on our way to finishing that as well. Mike is one of the easiest people I have ever worked with. He has helped us every step of the way and we truly appreciate his efforts.For many projects it’s about money or popularity. This is not what Bliss-Box is about. We're gamers and our passion has driven us to address this shortcoming in emulation. It has been achieved with great success, and now we hope we can bring it to you with your help."

Allowing multiple people in a business to give input on one product results in products that don't make sense. Every person has their own preference and need, so haircare and body products are really a more individual and personal choice. By allowing the consumer to directly create the product that they need and want gives them a sense of power and confidence over what they're buying.Bee Leaf creates products for every need. We start with a base formula and tweak it to the individual's request - for example, they can request to omit certain ingredients and have the product be sulfate-free, vegan, paraben-free, etc, or they can request additions to their products (e.g. aloe, argan oil, wheat protein). This way, they know every ingredient that is going into their product, as well as a description of what each contributes to the formula. Every order will be saved to the customer's profile for easy tweaking and reordering.We will also use local artists to create the designs for seasonal artwork for each product, as well as framed prints and paintings. This way we can support local artists and have unique and customized labels for Bee Leaf.Funds will be used to rent a space, buy ingredients, make a user-friendly website, buy equipment and get packaging ordered.Bee Leaf in a better product!","There are always challenges when starting a new business, but I feel like the risk for this company is quite low.  There is a definite need for customized haircare and body products and I believe many people will enjoy this creative and innovative way of purchasing their products. The real challenge will be finding an appropriate space that is affordable, yet has room to grow, as well as purchasing equipment that will satisfy the demand for the product.  We will also need to find a reputable label company and a good way to customize individual bottles for every customer."

https://www.kickstarter.com/projects/1526882937/the-labyrinth?ref=discovery_category_newest,1526882937/the-labyrinth,"Audiences enjoy a good story. They also enjoy characters and situations that they can relate to. The story becomes personal when those characters reveal weaknesses andvulnerabilities, andfaceconflictsthat everyone, at one time or another inour lives, have experienced.And in doing so,create empathy, and convey universal truths about the human condition.While the story of my film project, The Labyrinth, is taken from mythology, the script for the film centers around the mother/child relationship between Queen Pasiphae of Knossos and her deformed and mentally-challenged son, Asterion, the minotaur.As such, the film is deeply character-driven. It is a timeless story of love, madness, redemption and hope, as Pasiphae uses all of her strength to keep her son from harm.The film is to be an animated short subject of 18-22 minutes, using pantomime performance animation (no dialogue), original music,and narration to tell the story. I will be using Kickstarter funds tohire the necessarytalent, equipment, and materialsto make this film a reality. Cameras, lighting equipment, building supplies to make miniature sets, materials for creating the stop-motion puppets, hiring an orchestra to perform and record the original music, and studio rental space, will be the principle amenities needed to achieve this goal.Animation, regardless of the technique, is an extremely labor-intensive process. To ensure that The Labyrinth is completed on time and on budget, the tentative shooting schedule will be a completion date of March, 2015, with the goal of completing it ahead of schedule.The Labyrinth will be created using stop-motion puppet animation.Ultimately, it is the story and performances, and not necessarilytechnique, that will win an audience over. But because puppet animation deals with actualthree-dimensionalobjects that exit in the real world,with the animator stepping in between frames to pose the puppet one frame at a time, a hands-on craftsmanship is established, creating anold-world charm that will complimentan ancient story like the minotaur. The child of Queen Pasiphae and her union with a bull, Asterion is the innocent victim of a curse played out by the sea god, Poseidon, on Pasiphae's husband, King Minos. Hideously deformed and mentally challenged, Asterion only understands the love and acceptance of his mother, who seeks to protect him from the cruelties of the world. When Minos imprisons Asterion in the labyrinth, it will be up to his mother to rescue him before the darkness and isolation drive him mad.All stop-motion puppets have a skeletal support called an ""armature"". It can be made of wire or machined from aluminum and/or steel. Machined armatures can be quite complex structurally, allowing the animator to pose the puppet a fraction of an inch during single-frame animation.This particular armature for Asterion has a breathing mechanism.  By turning a machine screw (which runs from the back, tothe front of thechest, the two forward plates are pushed forward or backward, suggesting a breathing action.There are a number of scenes between Pasiphae and Asterion, when Asterion isa little boy. Below is a conceptual sketch by Mark Sullivan, of the young Asterion.This sketch was then realized in 3D form; a clay sculpture by Tom Smith:The daughter of Queen Pasiphae and King Minos, Ariadne has become hostile to the Greeks, when her older brother, Androgeos, is murdered by thieves when he goes toAthens to participate in the Olympic games. Her racial hostility is fueled even more when the Greek hero, Theseus, arrives on Crete as a sacrifice to Asterion. But even in this hostility, Ariadne will ultimately hold the secret of rescuing Theseus from the horrors of the labyrinth.The following images are of the Ariadne clay prototype sculpture (sculpted by Jeff Yagher), which was used to create the mold that the final siliconeanimation puppet will be pulled from.Tom SmithA veteran stop-motion animator, sculptor, and illustrator, Tom is an Emmy-award winning animator on the TV series, Robot Chicken. A few other of Tom's credits include:Paul W. JesselPaul is a veteran stop-motion animator on many TV commercials (such as the Hamburger Helper stop-motion spots),having worked forfilm production companies such as Skellington Productions, David Allen Productions, and Sony Imageworks. Some of Paul's credits include:Mark SullivanConsidered one of the finest matte painters in the industry, Mark will be offering a traditional matte painting as part of a pledge perk. He has also assisted in creating various composite shots for The Labyrinth,using After Effects, and will be creating a composite shot of the opening scene of The Labyrinth. A former matte artist at George Lucas's famed Industrial Light and Magic visual effects facility, some of Mark's film credits include:Charles CourtlandBorn in California,Charles grew up in the city of Thousand Oaks, just outside Los Angeles. Beingthe son of actor/director Jerome Courtland, he was exposed to thefilm industry at an early age. He began performing in school and localproductions which led to commercial and movie roles during his teenage years. His passion for thearts became apparent early on and has spent most of his career working as afreelance sculptor and decorative finisher both in and out of the filmindustry.The music for The Labyrinthis being written by Tom Brierton. Tom holds a B.A. and an M.A. in music theory and composition/orchestration, and has written two symphonies, a tone poem for orchestra, and miscellaneous ensemble pieces. For The Labyrinth, Tom will be writing a full symphonic score with a largepercussion section, and mixed choir. Here is an excerpt of The Labyrinth's main theme, ""Pasiphae and Asterion"" :How it was done:To create The Knossospalaceshot, a number of elements were combined in After Effects.First, I needed a design to show the effects artist, Mark Sullivan. I dida quick line copy sketch of what I was thinking about:Then, in preparation for his matte painting, Mark rendered a color comp of an early-morning arrival of Theseus' ship:Once we agreed on a few changes and what-not, Mark created his matte painting:There was now the issue of creating a practical boat element.An image of a Greek cargo ship was found for reference:and then Mark created a small model of the ship:The boat model was placed on a gimbal so that Mark could animate it rocking back and forth on the water.The boat sail was a separate element as well, using a four-foot square piece of white canvas.Two strings were tied, respectively,to the two lower corners of the canvas while the top of the sail was affixed to ahorizontal stick. A small fan was trained onto the canvas, and as the fan billowed the canvas, I would pull on the strings whilst Mark videotaped the action.Finally, a live-action sea plate (later flipped to match Mark's view of the palace), shot off the coast of Washington, was inserted into the final After Effects composite:For this scene of Asterion turning to threaten Theseus, I first started out withproduction art (created in 3ds Max)of how I wanted the set to appear:Matte artist Mark Sullivan then created a combination matte painting and practical columns elements:The columns were created by acquiring a piece of wood at a Home Depot, which had been turned on a lathe for a table leg. I cut small square pieces of wood on a miter saw,and these were affixed to the top and bottom of the column:I handed this over to Mark, and he painted it to reflect the color scheme of ancient Minoan columns:The Minotaur puppet was animated by Tom Smith, against a green screen:Finally, I animated a Theseus puppet against bluescreen:and then all of these elements were assembled by Mark in After Effects.An animatic is a very rough visual, created as a movie. It is by no means meant to represent the appearance and look of the final film, but rather serves as a way for the director to get a feel for camera placement, composition, editing, music, and any possible sound effects, before committing to the final shot, using a low-resolution rendering to quickly get feedback. This particular animatic for The Labyrinth was created using computer animation, as most of the animation puppets for the film had notbeen created when the animatic was made. Distinct advantages of using a virtual world for animatics (virtual meaning ""computer world""), is that the director can quickly place his or her virtual camera and virtual lightsanywhere they want, and quickly, thus saving time and money before creating the ""Hero"" (or, Final) shot. While the trailer indicatesa December, 2014 release, the actual release will be March, 2015.","All projects have unforeseen obstacles and hurdles that can reveal themselves through the course of a production, and are often unforeseeable.  However, making realistic goals and working them into a production schedule pipeline can greatly help in seeing an overall vision's goal, and help to create workarounds should problems arise.Filmmaking and stop-motion animation have been passions of mine since I first sat out in the early 70s making film and animation experiments with a super-8mm camera.  Legendary effects artist and filmmaker Ray Harryhausen once told me that ""Experimentation will be your greatest teacher"".   How true his words were.  The best way to learn anything, is to simply do it, observe, and ask questions.Animation, regardless of the technique, is an extremely labor-intensive process.  To ensure that The Labyrinth is completed on time and on budget, the tentative shooting schedule will be a completion date of March, 2015, with the goal of completing it ahead of schedule.",https://www.kickstarter.com/projects/1526882937/offspring-a-tale-of-dragonflight?ref=discovery_category_newest,1526882937/offspring-a-tale-of-dragonflight,"THE STORYAudiences enjoy a great story. For a story to become truly memorable, an audience member must be able to connect to, and identify with, the character or characters in that story. OFFSPRING will be a 6 minute puppet-animated film that explores the need for leaving your childhood home, and embarking on your own life's journey. This is something that almost all of us have experienced, or will be experiencing, at some point in our lives.Audiences are attracted to characters and situations that they can relate to. A story becomes personal when those characters reveal weaknesses and vulnerabilities, and face conflicts that everyone, at one time or another in our lives, have experienced, and in doing so, create empathy and convey universal truths about the human condition.OFFSPRING was inspired primarily by the work of Norman McClaren, who was known for his innovative films in combining visual images and sound. McClaren worked for many years as an animator for the National Film Board of Canada, and created such films as the war commentary, Neighbors, as well as the haunting Pas De Deux. OFFSPRING is my homage to McClaren's pioneering work of combining animation, sound, and/or music to convey a story.OFFSPRING will be created using stop-motion puppet animation, and its final running time is tentatively set between 5 to 7 minutes.  It will be filled with majestic flying dragons, rocky vistas, towering cliffs, a compelling musical score, and a story centered on a mother's love for her child, and how difficult it can be to say goodbye.For those of you who are stop-motion animators, you realize the artistic and historical  importance of keeping stop-motion animation alive in a world of digital technology.  If you are an educator who teaches stop-motion as well as computer animation, you understand how important it is for your students to realize that computer animation and some of its principles were born from the technique of stop-motion and its traditions.  If you are simply a fan of animation and respect the art form, you may remember with fondness stop-motion as part of your childhood, when you saw such classics as the Rankin-Bass stop-motion productions (Rudolph the Red-Nosed Reindeer, The Little Drummer Boy, The Year Without Santa Claus, as well as the live-action/stop-motion fantasy films of Ray Harryhausen; Jason and the Argonauts, The 7th Voyage of Sinbad, and Mysterious Island, among others). Stop-motion animation is a motion-picture process where an animator moves an object slightly, shoots a frame of film, moves the object again, shoots another frame of film, and continues with this process until the animation sequence is finished. When these individual frames are projected at 30 frames per second, an illusion takes place where the viewer sees motion. Ever make a flipbook when you were a kid? If you did, then you'll remember that you made drawings on each page of the flip book, in different positions on each page. Then when you flipped all of the pages in real time with your fingers, the squiggly lines had motion and danced about on the pages!Because stop-motion requires a kind of hit or miss single-frame positioning of the object or puppet on the part of the animator, there tends to a somewhat rough and organic feel or look to the animation when it's played back.  This is unlike computer animation, where the computer mathematically calculates in-between positions of a digital character between key poses, and hence, makes it look too perfect. Dragons have been around for centuries, and they need a hands-on organic touch, which is why stop-motion animation was chosen to bring the dragons to life for OFFSPRING.The film will take place within a Monument Valley-type setting, with an original music score to complement the visuals.I will be using Kickstarter funds to hire the necessary talent and procure equipment and materials to make this film a reality.  Cameras, lighting equipment, building supplies to make miniature sets, materials for creating the stop-motion puppets, hiring a composer to orchestrate, perform and record the original music, and studio rental space, will be the principle amenities needed to achieve this goal.Animation, regardless of the technique, is an extremely labor-intensive process.  To ensure that OFFSPRING is completed on time and on budget, the production will adhere to a very tight schedule of approximately six months for pre-production, production, and post-production.A tentative release date of September, 2018 is the goal of finishing the production, with a preference of completing it ahead of schedule.WHAT HAS BEEN CREATED THUS FARUltimately, it is the story and performances, and not necessarily technique, that will win an audience over.  But because puppet animation deals with actual three-dimensional objects that exit in the real world, lit by real lights, with the animator stepping in between frames to pose the puppet one frame at a time, a hands-on craftsmanship is established, creating an old-world charm that will compliment the fantasy aspect of OFFSPRING.WHAT IN THE WORLD IS AN ARMATURE ANYWAY?Most fine art sculpture uses an internal support called an armature, which can be made from wire, wood, or metal. Stop-motion puppets have a skeletal support called an ""armature"".  It can be made of wire or machined from aluminum and/or steel, using hinge and/or ball and socket joints.  Machined armatures can be quite complex structurally, allowing the animator to pose the puppet a fraction of an inch during single-frame animation.STORYBOARDS, THE BLUEPRINT FOR A MOVIEStoryboards are sketches that outline a movie shot-for-shot. The sketches can be very detailed, or simple chicken scratches. The point of storyboards is for a filmmaker to lay out the film's shots in a linear fashion, which can save a lot of time once the final shooting begins. Animation is a time-lapse process, laborious and time-consuming. A simple 5 to 6 second shot can take hours, even days, to complete. Pre-planning with storyboards can save valuable time on the set if the correct camera angles and continuity are prepared in advance.PRODUCTION ART GETS PEOPLE EXCITED!Because movies are primarily visual, people get excited when they see artwork of scenes from the script. Below are a few production composites using pre-existing public domain artwork, of how some of the shots will appear in the movie. While the following images are actually artwork, the final dragons will be stop-motion puppets. Puppets will give the dragons a much more realistic appearance.THE PRODUCTION CREWThomas R.

FRANK L STEMPER, ComposerFrank Stemper will be composing the music score for OFFSPRING.Frank's music has been performed by orchestras, ensembles, and soloists in 23 countries and two-thirds of the United States — in Carnegie Hall, The Kennedy Center, Budapest’s Pannonhalma, Vienna’s Klaviersalon Englemier, Chicago’s Symphony Center, Bucharest’s Anteil Roman, San Francisco’s Cowell Theater, Milwaukee’s Performing Arts Center, etc., and has been heard on the national radio networks throughout Europe.  His work as a composer has been supported by the National Endowment for the Arts, the Illinois Arts Council, the New York Council on the Arts, the California Arts Council, Meet the Composer and MTC—Global Connections, the American Society of Composers, Authors, and Publishers, the governments of Mexico, Romania, Spain, Austria, and The Netherlands, and he has received 33 commissions from various new music foundations and societies throughout the world.Among the many awards and prizes for his music are the 1981 George Ladd Prix de Paris, four artist fellowships from the Illinois Arts Council, 26 consecutive ASCAPlus awards, etc., as well as nominations for both the Grammy and Pulitzer Prizes. Recordings of Stemper’s music are available on Albany Records, Prestige, Centaur, Advanced, Reception, Opus One, Soundcloud, and I-Tunes.  BLUE13, a recording of Stemper’s complete music for piano performed by the Korean pianist Junghwa Lee, received a Gold Medal and was voted the No. 4 in Global Music’s “Top 10 Albums of 2015.”  Through his multiple artist and teaching residencies in Mexico, Romania, Spain, The Netherlands, and France, as well as more than 50 Guest Composer appearances at international festivals, his music has maintained a presence on the world new music scene.From 1983 to 2014 he was Professor and Composer In Residence at Southern Illinois University, and he is now a freelance composer living in Milwaukee, Wisconsin.Thank you for taking the time to learn about OFFSPRING, and I hope that you will consider making a pledge for the production.","Risks and challengesAll projects have unforeseen obstacles and hurdles that can reveal themselves through the course of a production, and are often unforeseeable. However, making realistic goals and working them into a production schedule pipeline can greatly assist in an overall vision's goal, and help to create workarounds should problems arise.Animation, regardless of the technique, is an extremely labor-intensive process. To ensure that OFFSPRING is completed on time and on budget, the tentative shooting schedule will be a completion date of September, 2018, with the goal of completing it ahead of schedule.If you have any questions about OFFSPRING, please don't hesitate to contact me.  Thanks very much for your interest in the project!"

Flight is controlled either autonomously by onboard computers or by the remote control of a pilot on the ground or in another vehicle.In many ways, drones enable us to “go where no one has gone before” and see things from a unique aerial perspective.There are several types of drones that have been designed and built for particular functions, military, commercial and recreational.Up till now, they have been mostly deployed for military applications, and also used in a small but growing number of civil applications, such as policing and firefighting, and nonmilitary security work, such as surveillance of pipelines. Drones are often preferred for missions that are too hazardous or mundane for manned aircraft.The FAA banned commercial drone usage within the United States, meaning, that they can't be used by businesses, and can only be used for recreational purposes, while remaining under 55 pounds.  This is a bad blow to such companies as Amazon who wanted to provide deliver service with drones.However, the ability to use a drone for recreational purposes is great news for all of us who dream of flight and seeing the world from a different perspective.Over the past few years, a hand full of companies has brought to market playful versions of these drones. They have been all created to offer users a thrilling perspective from the skies without causing any harm or breaking any laws.PROBLEM – the really good drones with long-range distance and altitude capabilities as well as video and photographic equipment are very expensive to purchase.SOLUTION – We are the solution. We are ACME WEST, LLC, we are the only company to offer you superior, state-of-the-science drones for just a weekend or week. You don’t need to buy an expensive drone, just get one from us when you want it, for just the time you need it! For a very reasonable donation we are making the most expensive, most dynamic, and technically advanced drones accessible to you as a promotional thank you. Help us; help you see the world from above.We need your help to build our fleet so more people will have affordable access to these high tech aerial videography drones. Help us build our unique fleet by pledging a donation to secure your time with one of our drones. Watch the three videos we provided for you above. Learn more about the Phantom and the TALI H500. Then pledge your donation. The first drones we will make available have the latest technological offerings and advances, consequently the best performance. Our initial fleet will be populated with the DJI Phantom 2 Vision Plus and the Walkera TALI H500 aerial videography drones.These drones will work autonomously and will be able to follow you when you are in the action - snowboarding, skiing, or even snowboarding. You will be shocked at the ease of use. If you can operate a smart phone, you'll be able to operate one of these drones.For example, the newest Phantom drone we offer has four fans and is remote-controlled by an operator on the ground. The operator uses a conventional-style remote control to fly the drone and a smartphone to control and monitor the video camera. Pilots can monitor what the camera sees from up to 700 meters away, or about 2,300 feet. Flight speed is an impressive 50 feet per second, or 15 meters per second. The video camera capabilities are unreal: a 90-degree tilt that let’s you shoot subjects directly below the drone.You will be able to experience the new stabilization technology of the Phantom, a gimbal that reduces jitter and prevents pitching, rolling and yawing, while recording. Your resulting video will be smooth and fluid without unintended jarring movements.The new Phantom drone also has an improved battery, which can keep it in the air for 25 minutes, an upgrade from the 10 minutes with the previous version. There’s also an indicator on the battery pack that shows pilots how much battery life is remaining.The drone uses a GPS system that let’s you keep the Phantom in the same spot, hovering, in winds up to 25 per hour and pilots can also program an autonomous flight path. The DJI Vision app let’s you preview footage and access altitude, distance, and battery strength during video/camera shoots. Our Phantom 2 Vision Plus package includes a controller, drone, camera and three-axis gimbal. Building our inaugural fleet is a huge undertaking. That’s why your help is so needed and appreciated. We are currently working with manufactures at the moment to order the appropriate number of drones from each. We are also working with the most reliable insurance companies as well as domestic and international shipping companies, such as FedEx, DHL, and UPS to provide the protection and service to our donors and future customers.Securing our fleet and making it available to you, our donors, is priority number one!We are also putting together a special offer for those of you who will not be able to bring yourselves to returning the drone because of how much fun you're having with it. This special offer will enable you to purchase the drone in lieu of returning it.  You will save $$$ over a retail purchase.Acknowledgements and Credits: On April 6, 2014 Eric Cheng, Director of Aerial Imaging at DJI introduced the Phantom 2 Vision+ with the video above on You Tube. Our thanks go to Eric and DJI for the great information. On May 23, 2014 Walkera provided the above video dramatically introducing their new TALI H500 on You Tube. Our thanks go to Walkera as well.","As we said, securing our fleet and making it available to you, our donors, is priority number one! However, we will never have an unlimited supply of drones. There will always be a limit to our fleet size. Once we hit our donation goal of $50,000.00 (fifty thousand dollars) we will be able to begin shipping our drones to you. If you are an EARLYBIRD Donor, you will be one of the first 100 people to receive a drone. Then, after the EARLYBIRDS, as a donor who is among the first Pledges that helped us reach our $50,000 goal, we will communicate directly with you during this process so we can do our best to ensure you receive your drone when you want it.If we exceed expectations due to overwhelming support from donors, like you, and surpass our $50,000 goal, we will institute a process for the purpose of delivery sequence to those who have donated after our goal was reached. This way we will establish and effective mechanism for everyone to receive a drone in a reasonable period of time.And, one more thing. For those of you who will not be able to bring yourselves to returning the drone because of the fun you're having with it, we are putting together a special offer enabling you to purchase the drone in lieu of returning it.  You will save $$$ over a retail purchase.",https://www.kickstarter.com/projects/2139699175/wristguardian?ref=discovery_category_newest,2139699175/wristguardian," THE WRIST GUARDIAN IS THE ONLY SMARTWATCH DESIGNED          WITH FAMILY PROTECTION & SAFETY IN MINDJust turning on the news gives us chills and makes us more concerned than ever.

This kick-starter is a to fund expansion of our beehives programme. We are honey producers, and we currently are setup to manufacture our own beehives in our purpose built workshop. We have installed a Dewalt radial arm saw to cut the hive sides, a verticle panel saw to cut the floors and roof covers and a dovetail milling machine to join all the hive together.The queen bee can lay about 1600- 2000 eggs a day, so a full hive will take 45 days to lay.One hive can produce 60lb (27kg) or more in a good season, however an average hive would be around 25lb (11kg) surplus.Bees fly about 55,000 miles to make just one pound of honey, that’s 1½ times around the world!We want to expand to 250 hives this year, and produce 15,000 Ibs of honeyThe workshop is fully set up to produce beehives with all the equipment in place. Funding is required for material and bees","Honey Production is reliant on several factors    Weather (Rain? Drought?)    Temperature (Too hot, too cold?)    Hive placement (some locations look good, but turn out bad)    Hive moments (pollination can supply honey, but some plants produce little nectar)    Diseases    Pests    Pesticide exposure    How much honey one leaves for the bees (a very important question)If we were to experience any problems with our honey production, we will either use our honey stock, or roll over to the new stock as its produced.",https://www.kickstarter.com/projects/493031209/3000-beehive-across-sussex-kent-and-surrey?ref=discovery_category_newest,493031209/3000-beehive-across-sussex-kent-and-surrey,"Each of our locations (Apiary's) will have 20 beehives and they are approximately 3 miles apart form one another. Normally we would use wooden beehives, but with a project of this size, we are going to use a poly hive, Polystyrene beehives have been used on Continental Europe for several decades, until recently they were only available in Langstroth, we are going to make the British National hive, which is indigenous to Gt. Britain. These hives are about 20 times stronger that packaging polystyrene. We now are developing the mold tooling to achieveAs the popularity for poly hives grew, it became apparent that the poly hives provided a number of other significant advantages over keeping bees in traditionally wooden hives.  Colonies in poly hives, in general, start to build up 3- 4 weeks earlier than those in wooden hives, and will start flying earlier in the day.  Thus,the poly hive colonies are better able to take advantage of the nectar flow, which should result in a significantly increased honey yield. Reports have suggested that similar colonies in poly hives can produce as much as 25% more honey than those in wooden hives.Poly hives also have significant advantages for breeding and production of new colonies.  The 3-4 weekearlier build up means there is a longer season in which to make splits and raise new queens. The insulation provided by the polystyrene means that there are no cold outside frames, as you would have in a wooden hive, therefore the queen in a poly hive will often lay brood eggs across all the frames in the brood box, giving the potential to produce more nucs from each hive.The insulation properties provided by the polystyrene keeps the hive temperature far more constant than with wood. The summer heat is kept out of the hive, so the bees spend a lot less time and energy keeping the hive cool, and more time collecting honey.  It also keeps them warmer throughout the winter so a colony will need less food to see it safely through the winter. Polystyrene is particularly suited to beekeeping in Britain, due to our cold wet and damp winters. Wooden beehives become really damp which leaves the bees to contend with both cold and damp.  In a dry, warm, poly hive the situation is quite different.  The insulation keeps the bees warm whatever the weather, rain simply runs off as they are totally waterproof, and any moisture inside the hive condenses on the walls and runs out of the open mesh floor, keeping the colony warm, dry, and above all, healthy. Poly hives require no preservation, unlike wooden hives and they do notsuffer from woodworm and rot, the treatments for woodworm and rot can also have effects on the health of the bees.  Older and second hand wooden hives may have been previously preserved,using wood treatments, such as Creosote which havenowbeen removed from sale due to their deleterious health effects. We will set up a retail store for beekeepers in each of the 3 counties.Reward PicturesReward 1Reward 2","Honey Production is reliant on several factorsWeather (Rain? Drought?)Temperature (Too hot, too cold?)Hive placement (some locations look good, but turn out bad)Hive moments (pollination can supply honey, but some plants produce little nectar)DiseasesPestsPesticide exposure"

Mero is an 18-year-old rapper from Rüsselheim with Turkish roots. He has shown his skills in the past in the form of Instagram rap videos. This alone enabled him to build up a stable and large fan base within a very short time.Together with Iceberg (producer, among others, of Eno, Dardan, Capo, Xatar) Mero worked on his debut album ""Ya Hero Ya Mero"", which will be released soon. Mero particularly stands out due to his slightly oriental sung hooks and his precise double-time skills.This information can be found in his press release on Spotify. We now also know that his first album will be released on March 1st, 2019. If the hype continues as before, Mero will be able to celebrate the first million clicks on his debut single on Friday. What a brutal start!Why Mero App?Mero is not just a star who is rising to success but he is a brand as well. I am the biggest fan and I am passionate about his work which made me create this App in the first place.

It is not an easy thing to admit but given the circumstances, it is the truth same as the truth of Mero being an international sensation in Rappers World.I need the funds to get the app into the next stage. Right now, I created the basic bones of the App but it is still in need of lots of work. I have to tailor many sections.I have already developed a prototype, I need the money for the backend, frontend, and admin panel development. The app will very likely look like the prototype, it will require funds that are necessary for the development of the modules, in particular the live transmission function from the artist.The complete concept is ready to be developed and the money collected will be used to pay designers and developers with which I can implement the project.End Goal is to Develop:The cost of the App includes:Risks and Challenges:The world is changing on daily basis so are our motivations.

It's been put off as long as it could and the debating had to end sometime, all the questions of, is it good enough, how many listings should there be before a campaign, how many listings in each state? When would the questions end? So, taking a leap of faith the decision was made to show what has been done so far. The website is up and running but it's time to get things done a bit faster and to make that happen it takes funding. This project got started out of desperation, frustration, and of course being hungry when being out and about. Plus if you were out with others would they be patient, would they walk out with you if the restaurant didn't have anything you could eat? With a restaurant here and a restaurant there, oh my! It was like playing a game of choosing which one could handle multiple allergies or even just one, let alone, would they be willing to change something on their menu to met those allergy requirements. It becomes easier to stay at home and stop going out to eat. But, one has to eat out eventually so TAB Street was born. So that it might benefit:The better the information at hand, the better a choice that good be made for all.So what exactly is TAB Street? TAB Street is a website thathas listings that have been verified to have allergy free or gluten free information and it has been found that sometimes their is both. These listings cover restaurants, bakeries, hotels and more. It takes time and patience to review websites for that information. TAB Street, at the time of this writing has over 2600 listings which are color coded for allergy information, gluten free information among other listings that benefit both groups. TAB Street includes: On the table are enhancements that are scheduled for a later date that we want to try and push up to earlier dates such as special events and menus, reviews and comments. The focus is getting in listings to make the site a more viable site for when you or someone you love is hungry but can not just go out and eat anywhere. Being able to allow reviews and comments hasn't been turned on yet because there isn't the staff for it at the moment. The funding will help in getting this moving on a faster pace and allow to pay for data entry, research, consulting and adding to the (paid) staff. Why is this important? There are over 15 million people with allergies and they range in all ages, from young to old. Those 15 million people have family and friends that don't want to exclude them on eating out adventures, road trips, and travel. Restaurants are taking notice and making the changes to their website, menus, dedicating kitchen area and training their staff. Current plans are in progress to branch out to Canada, Australia, and the United Kingdom. Those sites will open in 2018 or when 500 listings are reached, which ever is sooner.

We will also have the areas first aquaponics system that includes a variety of fish. With aquaponics, it is a system that not only grows healthy fish, but also healthy foods. We will have many crops produced from this part of the farm. We want to make sure everyone around us can have healthy options for their family. Our goal with this kickstarter is to raise enough money to start our own self sustainable farm. We will be buying the property with this money, then using the rest to get the land prepared for our crops and animals. Our farm will be donating to local food pantries and charities throughout the year. We want to bring people back to a time where farmers were everyone's main place to buy their groceries. We invite you to be a part of this amazing project!We would like to help the other families of central New York by growing heirloom-non gmo foods. Plus, the benefits of having aquaponics are huge! Fresh local farm raised fish that are helping crops grow is an innovate way to have self sustainability. We already have most the equipment (minus the baby fish) to start that up. We need the land and space to proceed.","The main setback is finding the perfect land. At this time, we have a temporary farm that we will proceed to operate until funding becomes available to purchase land. We have been growing foods for 6 years. We are confident enough now to proceed with supplying fresh produce for our local area. Also, we are very excited to introduce aquaponics to our area as well. We have been researching that for the past 5 years and have most of the equipment already to start that process, but again, the one missing factor is the land and space needed. The land we have picked is 10.08 acres and is located on a main street of a little town. We expect a huge positive community response to this startup. Weather can also be a set back for the crops."

The base of this project will start with a 1950 Ford F-100, and installing the most powerful V8 engine that Ford makes and giving it a power boost. Matching the engine will be a strong and solid drive-train but making it look as if it was all original. Most of the work will be done by myself to help keep cost down, and I have a good budget made up of what will be needed for most of the build.","The biggest challenge will be do modifications and fabricating custom parts and mounts so everything is secure.

My name is Robert Lutz, and this is my kickstarter campaign. First off, I’d like to thank all of you who visit, and extra thanks to those who actually read the whole thing!  It may be a little long, but wanted as much detail as I could place on here. Not very good in front of the camera, but supermodels are budget busters!What it’s for  My campaign is to raise funds to open a water-transfer film application shop.What is water-transfer? It is taking a pre-patterned hydroglyphic film of the customers choice, and applying it to virtually any metal or plastic object. As this is accomplished using a water dip tank, it’s more ecologically sound than using older methods of glue and acid. And allows for a better, smoother finish. With the advancements in films and application methods, the process has come a long way from its infancy.Why water-transfer?   I’ve always enjoyed giving customers what they want. And as I’ve always had pride in my work, this business will give me the ability to continue that tradition. With over 500 patterns readily available, plus custom design and custom paint, I’ll be able to turn anyone’s toys and small furnishings into their dream design. From switch plate covers to atv’s, it can be patterned to the individuals taste. Basically, I’m taking your blah items and giving them a bold exciting new look.   The idea is to continue to grow the business and myself, through the aggressive actions below, to put on new hires as it expands, thus being able to give back to my community also. This business is perfectly suited to address those demands as it fits with my skill set. The production process also allows for a rapid turn out time, which benefits both the customer and the bottom line.How it works  Once the customer has decided to have an item patterned, it gets cleaned & degreased. From there, the hydroponic film is cut to size and is floated in the pre-heated water of the dip tank. Once the film has reached the proper temp, the item is then placed onto the film and submerged.  ( electronics don’t get dunked!) This causes the film to permanently bond to the item. After that, it gets rinsed and placed in an infrared oven to dry. When dry, it gets sprayed with a clear coat and back in the oven to cure.  For items that get a base color, or just small paint jobs, that gets sprayed first, then in the oven to cure.  Other than some personal tweaks and tricks, that’s pretty much what’s involved. Actually there is a lot of spray work involved. Glad I’m good at it! Hence I’ll need 2 spray booths. One for paint, and one for clear coat. And at least 3 spray guns with extra nozzles.  And a separate booth I’ll hand craft for the oven. All these machines- Tanks, dryers, ovens, air compressor) need juice, so I’ll be hiring an electrician to install the 4 dedicated 220volt lines I’ll need. Can’t wait to see the electric bill on that! & a tin man to run exhaust ducts so I’m not breathing vapors all day long. That for sure would get the creative juices flowing all the wrong way! Once completed, the finish is very durable and long lasting. If you imagine the wood grain paneling inside of a vehicle, that is pretty much a water-transfer piece. This process is an excellent alternative to other hard and soft coverings at a reasonable cost. Here's a link to some u tube vids; click any one, they all show the basic process. https://search.yahoo.com/search?p=hydro+dip+u+tube&fr=ush-mailn_02&fr2=p%3Aml%2Cm%3AsbWhy I’m stoked on this   As a former business owner, (custom home improvements) for over twenty five years, I dropped that field when the economy tanked and profit became elusive. I went into retail(logical, as one always has to sell oneself before selling to others) to learn the ins and outs of receiving, selling, and merchandising. After 5 years of that, last year I contracted stage 3-throat cancer. Through determination and aggressive treatment, I am happy to say that my doc says it’s gone. Will still have to monitor it, and am definitely looking forward to reducing the frequency of tests I have endured. That said, the disease made me realize I belong back in a market where I can produce custom projects for the consumer. I’ve always had a passion for doing all the finish work in my career, along with dabbling with paint and body work.What I love about this is that it provides that custom feel good product. Something for the consumer to show off. With moderate investment, and hard work, it is a business I also will be able to pass down to my daughters or grandsons. The market.   As this will be a Florida based business, I will be initially marketing to the hunting, fishing, marine, and general outdoors interests in this area. Seeing as there is no business in this area that provides these services, I expect a healthy response. Eventually, through web page, and family contacts, I expect to take orders nation-wide.  Preliminary research has led me to believe that this is an up and coming market, with over 500 designs, plus custom painting, each order can be personalized to each individual taste. Which is a great thing, as in my area people like to trick out their toys! Everyone I have spoken to has expressed an interest in having designs placed on their motorcycles, boat parts, atv’s, gun stocks, even the mods of those who vape. Possibilities are numerous. . I still have some leg work as in meeting with marina owners, tackle shops, car dealers, and local bike shops. As each day passes, the more people I speak to, the more the expressed interest is in contracting out and/or referring my work.  Where I’m at. At this point in time, with about 200 hours invested, & one very full notebook, I have set up the supplier, detailed the list of equipment needed, with prices, spoken to permitting agents, received approval from my supplier for use of their patterns in promotional material, have looked at shop space. I have aligned with a company to provide me with a comprehensive POS (point of sale) system allowing me to take and track orders, inventory and sales. I have all the necessary paperwork (permits, registration, lease, corporate submission, bank accounts, etc) waiting to be filled out and ready to submit at end of campaign.  To be able to do this commercially, you need the dip tanks, sprayers, dryers, film, cabinets, sinks and so on.($$) That’s just some of the hardware  Cabinets, storage, tarps; incidentals add up fast. Lined up a mechanic, at a fair hourly rate, to disassemble auto parts prior to dip and reassemble after product is finished.  I’ve rough sketched out the floor space needed (1200sq ft-contractor, I know how to do that!) so that I can get it all in place when delivered.  Once all the equipment is in place, I’ll be able to take orders & provide finished products. You can’t bake the cake if you don’t have the oven! Basically, everything except for the financing is ready to go.  I’d like to add that my supplier will provide me with complete and thorough training on the use of the equipment.     Once financing is achieved, the following requirements are needed. The purchase of equipment, storefront, permitting, marketing and shipping. You know, the fun part!The plan (&where the moneys going)    At the end of campaign, or once my funding goal has been reached, things will be hectic for the first 6 weeks. Expecting major outlay of funds at this time. All permits and corporate and bank papers will be filed in the first 3 days. Lease will be signed & insurance acquired.  Equipment will be ordered and set up for delivery while permits pending,(budget time 5 weeks for permits and inspections) . During the wait time on the permits, I’ll be training on the new equipment at suppliers location, setting up equipment, producing the web site, POS station and other tools to make opening and operating go smoothly. I’m budgeting an extra 10 days after zoning inspection for electrical & plumbing work. Will contact local paper for opening day interview. Small town, so the paper loves writing up new business.  Once up and running, for the first few months, I will need 1 employee,(reason to spend the extra $ on the POS system, ease of taking orders) outside of hiring a web designer. As orders expand, and business picks up, I will put new hires on as needed. I would prefer to hire other cancer survivors, I know how difficult it is to find work after treatment.  Equipment will be shipped to the new destination, with enough material to cover the first 3 months or so of operation, so that product can be turned out rapidly. Custom orders will be taken, with an allowance time for ordering new material. Normally it’s a 3 day delivery on film from supplier.  The storefront with combined shop area leasing is available in my area at a reasonable cost, It will also double as the production space needed . I have also considering renting space in an existing body shop, as that will eliminate most of the permits needed. We’ll see how that goes.   Marketing will be by signage, web, social media, local business store displays, word of mouth and placard displays at various craft shows and yes, even flea markets. I have seen firsthand how profitable a booth at an established market can be and do not want to discount how valuable they can be. A place where people can touch the items is extremely important, as I have noticed over the years that once someone picks an item up, they’re not likely to put it down and therefore make the purchase.  .    Receiving orders will be multi faceted, from walk-ins to web. Telephone orders will be accepted as well, although customers will have to visit the web page first to pick their design. As for shipping, I already have a contact who handles UPS and Fedex, she will supply me with fairly accurate table of costs so I know how much to charge. Smaller items can go USPS. North America shipping only as international (overseas) would be cost prohibitive. My POS system will incorporate printing shipping labels, that’s a big plus. Turn around time for orders should be under two weeks from receipt of item to be printed.   After speaking to the supplier, and web searches for comparable companies, I found there is no other company in the southwest Florida offering this type of product. And being midway between Sarasota and Fort Meyers, I have a large customer base to draw from. Therefore the time is now to get it up and running, to grab the market share while making a name producing excellent product at a reasonable cost. Prices will only rise in the future, and this is an investment that can be held in the family for years to come. Again, everything is in place except for the financing. I’m determined; can I count on you for your support?  Backers are encouraged to contact me for more details, questions, and any ideas that you can come up with! Backers always get priority processing, will have item sent back to you within 3 days of receipt. You’ll get an unique ID number to use for rewards and future orders.  I should be up and producing no later than 8 weeks after end of campaign, and expect rewards to be out late December.(I’m allowing time for snags, Murphy always shows up) This way you can show off to friends and colleagues what you have helped create! And helping a cancer survivor get back to a rewarding, second chance career. Thank you and let’s get this started! Robert .  As a disclaimer, this is my 3rd attempt at running this idea through Kickstarter. Previous attempts were denied due to lack of clarity of project. Here I’ve attempted to detail everything needed, suggestions are most welcome and will be listed in FAQ’s","First off, I have excellent problem solving skills. Toss a wrench in the works, I'll get a blowtorch to cut it out. That said, I understand  the challenges any new business takes on.One of the biggest is attracting new customers, that will be handled by an aggressive marketing campaign. Government bureaucracy is a concern at the outset, but I've learned over the years how to deal with that. Mainly, one has to make them feel that they are superior to you, second is having all your paperwork in order. It also helps to have an experienced accountant(important) and a lawyer(not so much) on stand-by to ease out any kinks. I chose my suppliers well; therefore do not expect any complications when needing more product. If a delivery problem arises, supplier is only a 3 hour drive, so can always go get it. If not, there are others to choose from.Unsatisfied customers are easily worked around whether it's re-doing a project or refund. A well thought out plan of action, and a well written contract , with a deposit to cover materials, eliminates most of the miscommunication between client and provider. Acts of God. Well, we can't really plan for them, just do the best you can afterwards.As with my cancer treatments, I do extremely detailed research on everything I am about to embark on. This in itself minimizes the risks before beginning. That's why I've planned it all out beforehand. Any comments or concerns you may have will be answered in the FAQ's.My promise to you is to grow the business so in ten years time, you can say I helped create that! This business is poised to explode so one concern I do have is the need for a bigger dip tank. As I want to start small, then grow, I'll be limited at first to items smaller than 24X48"". The next tank size up, with supporting hardware is a major investment, and not prepared for that at startup. I will research a workaround for larger pieces when I go for the detailed training on the equipment  If and when I land a major manufacturer, then I'll spring for the bigger tanks.Lastly, I realize the need for a facebook account. Never had the need for one before but will have my web designer set one up.",https://www.kickstarter.com/projects/1809976398/dip-this-turning-ho-hum-into-holy-cow?ref=discovery_category_newest,1809976398/dip-this-turning-ho-hum-into-holy-cow,"Hi.

From switch plate covers to picture frames to ATV’s, they can be patterned to the individuals taste. Basically, I’m taking your blah items and giving them a bold exciting new look.   This is a business that, having come back from stage 3 cancer, I can turn into something truly profitable. Through the aggressive actions below, I’ll be able to grow the local economy with new jobs as it expands.  This business is perfectly suited to address those demands as it fits with my skill set and eye for detail.. The production process also allows for a rapid turn out time, which benefits both the customer and the bottom lineHow it works It's a 4 step process to achieve fantastic results. 1.The item to be dipped gets prepped & a base color is applied. 2.

I’ll construct custom booths for the oven, and film & paint storage. We’ll be needing racks, tables, benches, dryers, cabinets, a ton of misc items, along with the POS system.($$)  All these machines- Tanks, dryers, ovens, air compressor and a small A/C unit for the film, need juice, so I’ll be hiring an electrician to install the 4 dedicated 220volt lines I’ll need, a tradesman to run EPA compliant filter ducts so I’m not breathing vapors all day long and since paint is involved, a fire suppression systemThe market   As this will be a Florida based business, I will be initially marketing to the hunting, fishing, marine, and general outdoors interests in this area. Seeing as there is no business in this area that provides these services, I expect a healthy following. The short unscientific surveys I've done are encouraging; seems everyone I speak to has items they want patterned. A number of local businesses have already given their approval to place advertising in their locations. I've contacted various national manufacturers with mostly positive feedback so landing a multi-unit contract and taking orders nationwide looks promising.   Preliminary research has led me to believe that this is an up and coming market, as every order can be personalized to one's individual taste. Which is a great thing, as people like to trick out their toys by having designs placed on their motorcycles, boat parts, ATV’s, gun stocks, even the mods of those who vape. Possibilities are numerous. As each day passes, the more people I speak to, the more the expressed interest is in contracting out and/or referring my work.  Like it or not, I’ll be reaching out to firearm manufacturers, as I’ve noticed that they are starting to sell dipped designs on their products. Although I realize this will be a predominately custom design work, I will be producing knick knacks and other small printed items for showroom and online sales.Where I’m at At this point in time, with about 600 hours invested, & one very full notebook, I have produced a few trial pieces, set up suppliers, detailed the list of equipment needed, with cost analysis, spoken to permitting agents, received approval from my supplier for use of their patterns in promotional material, have looked at shop space. I have aligned with a company to provide me with a comprehensive POS (point of sale) system allowing me to take and track orders, inventory and sales. I have all the necessary paperwork (permits, registration, corporate submission, bank accounts, etc) waiting to be filled out and ready to submit at end of campaign. Mechanic's lined up, at a fair hourly rate, to disassemble auto parts prior to dip and reassemble after product is finished.  I’ve rough sketched out the floor space needed (through my expertise in contracting), so that all equipment can be set up upon delivery.  Once all the equipment is in place, and waiting on inspections, I’ll be return to the supplier (along with employees) for advanced training on the equipment. Basically, everything except for the financing is ready to go. The plan (& where the moneys going) I've come up with a 5 point, 8 week plan of action to accomplish the short term goals.1. Upon successful funding, all corporate, bank, zoning and permitting paperwork will be filed within the first week. During this time building lease will be signed and all equipment ordered. Budget time: 1 week2. Delivery and set up of equipment, finalization of shop layout with necessary modifications. Filing of final permits. Set up of Point of Sale system. Design and launch of web based store. As all this activity is separate but can be accomplished concurrently, budget time is 5 weeks.3. After finalizing shop set up and waiting on final inspections, myself and two employees will attend 16 hours of detailed training on the new equipment. Invaluable experience to ease out any bugs in the system.4. Two weeks before opening. Rewards will be produced & readied for shipment. Sample items will be patterned. Advertising placards and samples will be distributed to local businesses. Local newspaper will do a pre opening interview and story. Web store and Facebook page will be launched. Short term goal are to get the shop open and producing for local customers; longer goals(1 year+) are to land national multi unit contracts through aggressive marketing and pricing. Eventually I am hoping to expand to the Northeast US with a satellite shop to cut down on shipping times. The storefront will be integrated with the manufacturing space needed. Units are available in my area at a reasonable monthly cost. My point of sale system(POS) will allow customers to browse all available patterns on a separate monitor    Marketing will be by signage, web, social media, local business store displays, word of mouth and placard displays at various craft shows and yes, even flea markets. I have seen firsthand how profitable a table at an established market can be and do not want to discount how valuable they can be.

Turn around time for orders should be under two weeks from receipt of item to be printed. As our winter population swells considerably, I expect the bulk of customers to be walk-ins. Let’s do this!   After speaking to the supplier, and web searches for comparable companies, I found there is no other company in the southwest Florida offering this type of product. As a tourist destination, this area is ripe for this type of business. Therefore, the time is now to get it up and running, to grab the market while making a name, producing excellent product at a reasonable cost. This will lead to being able to market to larger corporations. I'm trying to get this started before prices rise in the future, and with your support, this is an investment that can be held in the family for years to come.

","One of the main hurdles is dealing with government entities & the personal biases they have.. Since I have the experience with the permitting process, even though each situation is unique, should not be too much of a problem.  Product delays are rectified by me having several suppliers. I have two of everything and everyone lined up in case one cannot follow through.I may need to put on an experienced, polished marketer to contact the larger companies I will seek out for business. If I am doing day to day hands on work,the amount of hours needed for PR may exceed the daily hours available to me.  Competition is a concern, but I have a great marketing approach laid out, so should be able to overcome that.  Not bragging, but I have excellent problem solving skills,(very high IQ) along with successful business people I can bounce ideas off, so should be able to handle any wrenches that get thrown in the works. Only glitch I can see is if cancer comes back, but my doc says I have it licked. Made it through the last round of treatment, if things go south, one of my daughters will take over until back on my feet."

It was during this time I first made acquaintance with Bob Marley at his home/recording studio.After a year in Jamaica I left for Africa and travelled across the Sahara Desert from Algeria visiting Niger, Burkina Faso, Ivory Coast, Benin, Togo and arrived in Ghana where I spent a year. In 1977 I left Ghana for Nigeria to attend the black arts festival FESTAC and became friends with the noted Afro Beat King Fela Ransome Kuti. I was in his home in Lagos the day it was burnt down by renegade soldiers and would spend five months being detained by the military government on the pretext of being a CIA spy and for my friendship with Fela.After three years in Africa, I returned to Jamaica and assisted in managing Diplomat, a major photographic studio in Kingston. 1977-1980 were dramatic years in Jamaica's history and during this period I captured a wealth of photographic images and also became the 'unofficial' house photographer at the Marley's home. I was also aphotographer on Survival, the worlds first Rastafari newspaper published by Marley in the summer of 1980.In September 1980 I left for the United States with Bob Marley and The Wailers on Marley's final tour and after his demise, spent three years photographing in New York and Los Angeles and returned to Jamaica in 1984.In 1985 I returned to London and began working with the Caribbean Times newspaper in London. Later, I began teaching photography on the Broadwater Farm Estate in Tottenham, north London, scene of a notorious riot in 1985. During the next fifteen years I worked exclusively as a freelancer with my work being published in the Daily Mail, Time Out magazine, the Observer, The Voice, West Indian Digest and Which magazine. Recently I had three photographs from Portrait of a Legend and other Folks prominently featured in the Kevin Macdonald feature documentary, MARLEY.In August 2013 I successfully launched my first book Portrait of a Legend and other Folks.Portrait of a Legend and other Folks represent over thirty years work and features probably some of the last unpublished photographs of Bob Marley. This book is a testament of my vision, perception and perspective of a photographic culture. ",There are NO risks involved in this project.Why?I hold all the risk cards.,https://www.kickstarter.com/projects/poalaof/poalaof?ref=discovery_category_newest,poalaof/poalaof,"POALAOF is the acronym of the book Portrait of a Legend and other Folks.Portrait of a Legend and other Folks is the title of a 300-page coffee-table black & white portfolio book which covers over thirty years of my work and features probably some of the last unpublished photographs of Jamaican reggae legend Bob Marley, members of the Marley family and his band, The Wailers.Also included in this book are images of iconic world figures whom I have met and photographed during the course of my work. These have included Muhammad Ali, Michael Jackson, James Brown, George Bush Snr, Michael Manley, King Hassan of Morocco, Mike Tyson, Gladys Knight, Jesse Owens, Peter Tosh, Stevie Wonder, Jimmy Cliff, Socrates, Fela Anikulapo Kuti, James Baldwin and other Folks. This book has been self-published and was launched at the Jamaican High Commission in London two years ago.Photographs from Portrait of a Legend and other Folks were prominently featured in ""RasTa: A Soul's Journey"" a 2011 Canadian television documentary which features Donisha Prendergast the granddaughter of Bob Marley and also in the Oscar winning Director Kevin Macdonald's feature ""Marley"" released in 2012. With the proceeds earned from both productions and on a very tight shoe-string budget, I spent 18 months researching the process of self publishing, editing, designing and finally was able to publish and launch Portrait of a Legend and other Folks. This campaign is not to raise seed capital for an idea still on paper because the idea has already been manifested. This campaign therefore is to raise production finance which will enable the printing of 4,000 copies of Portrait of a Legend and other Folks. By reaching my Kickstarter goal the production unit price per copy and the future cover price of this book carrying a high-production-value, will be substantially reduced enabling the work to reach a much wider audience.The financial restraints encountered of being both an unknown photographer and an independent self-publisher, created a climate in which I could print only 10 copies at any one time at a high cost of £105 per copy. In order to cover other miscellaneous expenditures I market each copy at the cover price of £150, excluding postage.During the past two years I easily saw the difficulty for many ordinary people to purchase a book costing £150, hence the reason why I have sold 37 copies to date. The cover price of a book is highly determined by printing costs. It is therefore imperative that I seek outside financial assistance via Kickstarter and with sufficient positive pledges, the printing of 4,000 hardback copies at a reduced cost of £22.50 each will become most viable. During the four years I spent with Bob Marley, we would at times have deep discussions regarding various things on both a material and spiritual level. On numerous occasions Bob and I would talk about a subject many are unaware of. Bob Marley had a desire to travel to Peru and play a concert at Machu Picchu. Naturally, this was never to be.Since his passing, I would learn of a surprisingly great love that exists for Bob Marley in Peru. Therefore, with a positive conclusion of this campaign, I will endeavor to travel to Peru and present 26 copies of Portrait of a Legend and other Folks. One copy will be given to each of the 25 regions and one copy will be given to the province of Lima. This is purely a spiritual gesture of which Bob Marley would have been truly happy.Book Specifications: Pages: 300 - Size: 33cm X 28cm. - Weight: 2.5kg - Photographs: 260 - Words: 4,000 - Paper: Resin Coated - Dust Jacket - Binding: Stitched. Gold Embossed: Cover & Spine.The key element to this campaign is that I have spent the past two years studying and gauging a potentially huge book market which exists for this book. Current social media estimate there are over 600 million Bob Marley fans on the planet and with copies currently residing in the Bob Marley Museum and the Jamaican national archive, the title Portrait of a Legend and other Folks will have a very long shelf life.All photographs © Lindsay Oliver Donald.","Unlike other projects on this platform, I have completed Startup and have produced the finished article. Therefore, this campaign is simply to raise finance for Production. I have already used what capital I had to design, print and launch Portrait of a Legend and other Folks and with a positive response from contributors, I am confidently positive that within 12 months of this campaign, Portrait of a Legend and other Folks will become a self-publishing success story for myself and to those who graciously helped in making this campaign possible.May I therefore Thank You All in advance."

It would be an amazing thing to be able to get my creative works out there for all to enjoy.

However I have written a lot of screenplays and have joined short film competitions and have also written comic books that have been published online. The movie I have written hear is wildly based on a real life story with me and my two dogs. I took on a dog as a puppy, I named this puppy Thunder, I had him for about two weeks and then decided to take on his brother from the same litter (who I named Lightning) so that Thunder wouldn't feel lonely when I went to work, after trying to take care of both of them for about two months I realized I simply couldn't do it so I sold Lightning to a young couple who loves him so much and is giving him the best possible life. Me and Thunder still visit Lightning every other week and plan to keep doing so. Through this experience I wanted to do what I do best and write about it, even though Lightning is no longer my dog him and Thunder have still made a great impact on my life and I would love to use that to create an amazing animated movie that I named ""Thunder And Lightning, A Dog Story"" With your help I can create this movie for all to enjoy as I have enjoyed them.","When it comes to animating many don't know it but it is a very costly thing to do, for professional animating it can be as much as $1,000 per minute, as me and my time have full time jobs this is more of a passion job so we do what we can in our free time, if we have these funds we will be more than equipped to handle this as we do not require the typical $1,000 per minute price tag."

I understand that TYCOR Community Development Corp, Inc., a 501(c)3 not-for-profit entity, has taken the lead on a number of development projects in the neighborhood  which recognize the diverse people and culture that have impacted and continue to shape the community.  It has recently come to my attention that those efforts include getting the name of the 31st & Troost station changed to the ""Osage Trail"" station. Such recognition of the Osage presence in the Kansas City, Missouri area honors our people and our heritage. We are humbled to play a part in the development activities designed to bring greater prosperity and recognition to the richly diverse area and fully support your efforts.I have also become aware that TYCOR will be incubating small businesses, some of which are American Indian owned and/or operated.  Again, the Osage Nation offers support for such endeavors.  This support extends to your work to secure the funding necessary to stabilize the building (3103 through 3109 Troost Avenue) which is home to TYCOR.The Osage Nation encourages and welcomes all people to share in gaining a greater understanding of our proud heritage and the historical impact Osage society had in shaping this part of the country. The area that includes the Troost neighborhood was our ancestral homeland and we recognize the area is now home to a diverse society of people who have their own rich heritage to build upon.  In closing, it is my hope that all of our future generations share and prosper from the distinct history which ties us collectively to the same land.Please don't hesitate to contact my Office if you have any questions or require additional assistance.

Although Whangarei area is a small semi-rural city our small microbrewery has been developing delicious low percentage craft SHANDY beers. - First of its kind.Our two messages.1) Home of light & delicious shandy lager beers2) Beer that starts conversationsTraveling through this territory we have learnt some hard lessons yet we have slowly gained an understanding of what our product is. Its organic growth has come from regular testing, experimenting, feedback from the community and has been key to our survival.Our goal is to have New Zealand seen as a destination for craft beer lovers from all around the world.We have obtained our council registration, GS1 NZRecall certificate & major supermarket distribution. This was not easy task yet we knew we’re on the right path.We constantly heard people say they were tired of the same old range of beers. We set out to rectify this.However, the proof is in the pudding of how good our beer actually are e.g. fast sale records, product being sold out & urgent re-stock orders being received. We hope this will help get the word out about the great New Zealand craft beers and satisfy the 'drinking adventurer'. We've continued to adapt and evolve to our changing surroundings, but we're making sure we thank everyone that has been there for us right from the start.We now plan to export through international waters and aim to make our product more accessible to the world.We have had great advice from Lucy @ NZTE (not an endorsement), fellow NZ Master brewers, operators & local NZ craft beer connoisseurs.

ThynkBot is the world's coolest mind-controlled robot. This project will be the best because we are fully passionate about making a difference.ThynkBot by ThynkWare Innovation, Inc. is based upon the founder’s patent-pending technology for a “mind-controlled virtual assistant on a smartphone device” as it is applied to robots. Check out the patent here. ThynkBot is easy to use! ThynkBot is fun and people of any age can use this brainwave technology gadget. We have proven it by letting a 5-year-old demonstrate it in our video.The ThynkBot Bundle includes a fantastic self-balancing robot, an incredible EEG headset, and the ThynkWare Innovation ThynkBot app for iPad, iOS or Android phones.ThynkBot uses an off-the-self robot that connects by Bluetooth with the ThynkBot application and the user’s mobile wirelessly. Once you get started, you think “forward” and the robot moves forward. Think “back” and the robot moves back. Further extend your mental “telekinetic” prowess by thinking “turn left” and “turn right” and the robot will get turning in the new direction.If you are not giving the robot enough of your mental attention, ThynkBot will let out a voice of dismay. If you are totally in the zone, ThynkBot will also let you know by voicing a burst of excitement.The key to the ThynkBot is the patent-pending technology which takes the input from the Neurosky MindWave Mobile EEG headset and translates the raw signals into words that are used for commands to the robot. The result of all this is sheer fun in controlling an actual robot with your mind!Why do we have a kitten?Who doesn't enjoy looking at a cute kitten? And a cat is a whole lot better when it stands behind ThynkWare.ThynkWare Innovation technology does not stop with ThynkBot and controlling robots by thought. We are working on projects on a variety of platforms and framework including iOS, Android, Raspberry Pi, Arduino, RFduino, Windows, and Node.JS. We have a number of products in the works for the future that use thoughts for control:ThynkWare Speech (for ALS and physically challenged patients)ThynkWare TV(for television/media consumers)ThynkWare Home (for smart home users)ThynkWareOffice (for office and work professionals)ThynkWare Assistant (forsmartphone virtual assistant users)ThynkWare Games (gamers, of course!)ThynkWare Car (forcontrolling vehicles systems, not driving)ThynkWare Outbound Telepathy(for the rest of the world who want to communicate with others).ThynkBot BundleBackers of the ThynkBot Bundle get a bundle of goodies, including the bluetooth robot, the EEG brain-reading headset and the ThynkBot application for iOS or Android. This application will allow you translate your thoughts into action for the robot. It’s easy! A five-year-old can do it. Just in case, we will provide you will simple instructions on getting started.Help us become the biggest staff-picked Kickstarter project on Earth and the first ever mind-controlled robot to shatter all the backer records in 2015! We can do it with your help. And we will push the stretch rewards to the max if we can do it.All supporters will get mentioned on our social network platforms once we reach our fundraising goal.

https://www.kickstarter.com/projects/250385133/jeny-lee-bridal?ref=discovery_category_newest,250385133/jeny-lee-bridal,"Jeny Lee Bridal Studio's mission is to create a bridal and bridesmaids collection that can cater to the booming millennial generation that seeks diversity, individualism and versatility. This brand will offer brides and bridesmaids a unique style and collection that can be worn on the day of the wedding as well as after the wedding. Jeny Lee Bridal Studio will offer unique separates as well as traditional wedding gowns, but the goal and vision of this brand is to create a collection that has versatility as well as a unique point of view of what a wedding dress and bridesmaids dress should look like. Wedding dresses and bridesmaids dresses are never worn after the day of the wedding. Our mission is to make sure that these outfits are worn even after the day of the wedding. Making way for a fresh new perspective of what wedding dresses and bridesmaids dresses can look like, making them approachable and versatile yet special enough for that unique day.The bridal industry has a unique untapped niche market, ""Ready to wear bridal"". This company will create bridal outfits (as opposed to dresses) making way for brides and bridesmaids to wear these unique items even after their special day. Most brides never wear their dresses after their wedding. Bridesmaids most definitely do not wear their dresses after the day of the wedding. They either get thrown out, donated or just sits in their closet. This brand will create a collection for both brides and bridesmaids that can be worn during the day as well as after the day. Hence calling it ""ready to wear bridal"".The Business has a window of opportunity to introduce its products and gain a significant piece of the market share.","The biggest challenge will be marketing this product and mind set to the consumer.  Delivering a purpose to buy our product but also gaining their attention through appealing designs and aesthetics and quality.  The concept in theory is approachable, but marketing it to be covetable and salable will be a challenge.  But once we figure out a marketing approach, tapping into this niche market will gain this company market share and a shift in the bridal industry's mind set.",https://www.kickstarter.com/projects/250385133/jeny-lee?ref=discovery_category_newest,250385133/jeny-lee,"I've been in the fashion industry for over 12 years working for small startups to big corporate brands. My main goal was to learn all about the business aspect of fashion, learn team dynamics that make a successful brand work and constantly trying to find that one missing piece in the fashion industry that can give me the opportunity to make an impact and create a successful business. While the fashion industry, in almost every aspect, is over saturated with new designers and brand names and fast fashion, I noticed that the bridal industry was still missing something unique.I have been a bridesmaid time and time again for my friends and my cousins, and while being a part of that special celebration and milestone in their life was an honor, I couldn't help but think how much money I was wasting on dresses that I would never wear again after that evening. Twice I have thrown my dresses in the garbage right after the reception. Being from the industry and having such a keen eye for fabric and quality, it hurt to spend hundreds of dollars on polyester fabric, made in china quality and a dress that I would never wear again. That's when I decided I needed to fill that void in the bridal industry. While this idea may not be for most traditional brides, any fashion forward thinker and edgy fashionista bride would most definitely understand this niche market. And I guarantee the bridesmaids will appreciate it as well. The concept is to create separates, but dressy separates, in silk and high quality fabrications, but most importantly made in USA. Having control over quality, color and fabric is most important to designers but customers alike. If i'm spending money anyway, I want to spend it on quality and know that I can wear it time and time again. The idea is to be able to offer brides and bridesmaids dressy separates in common colors that are typical of brides and bridesmaids. While one might ask, ""why not just go to a mass retailer like gap or j.crew?"", they will not have the silhouettes in soft bridal party colors that most brides choose. The mass retailers have a color story set for that particular season all across the brand departments, which limits the options for most brides. This line will be able to offer all silhouettes in the most popular bridal party colors. The bride may choose to have the bridesmaids wear these separates in the same colors or color block them, but either way, the bridesmaids will be able to wear them with jeans or skirts, dress is up or down from their closets after the big day.This line will offer wedding dresses as well as bridesmaids dresses to stay competitive to other brands, but the main focus and reason for this brand to stay alive will be to offer ready to wear ideas to the bridal parties.The funds will be used to pay for development costs (pattern making, fittings, grading), production costs, photography costs (to post on website), website costs, advertisement costs and e-commerce costs.This business will be an e-commerce business that has the potential to sell to department stores and wedding boutique stores alike.","The challenges and risks are plenty in the fashion industry.  But if the right product is offered the success rate is astounding. The first round is e-commerce, selling online.  The next step is to create a private client list and offer one of a kind special items. Once the e-commerce business is set up with development to production and shipping and handling, the next move would be to work with a sales team and showrooms to showcase the brand to department stores and boutiques such as Nordstroms, Saks Fifth Avenue and Kleinfelds. Once that relationship is built with buyers, simultaneously doing trunk shows across the country will be next necessary move. While I don't anticipate this venture to be easy or to succeed over night, I know that hard work, patience, passion, commitment, dedication and belief in what you do always trumps any negative feedback or naysayers and any obstacles that this industry is infamously known for."

Hvac contractors are increasing and widening their service capabilities, particularly in areas such as high-speed cleaning systems and preventative technologies. The trend toward innovative air conditioning technology by a range of producers, most notably the Hvac industry, will further increase this sector's demand.Market Size StatisticsSAN FRANCISCO, Feb. 14, 2019 /PRNewswire/ -- The global HVAC systems market size is anticipated to reach USD 183.8 billion by 2025, according to a new report by Grand View Research Inc. The market is estimated to witness a CAGR of 5.7% during the forecast period. Growing commercial sector and rapid urbanization across the globe are driving the demand for HVAC equipment. Furthermore, incentives and rebates programs offered by various governments to promote the use of energy-efficient units is anticipated to bolster the HVAC equipment market growth.Market value of heating, ventilation, and air conditioning (HVAC) globally in 2017, by region (in billion U.S. dollars)Market value in billion U.S. dollarsAsia 114.36North America 13.78Europe 13.75Latin America 11.31Middle East 9.68Africa 7.44Oceania 2.05Market Size StatisticsOver the five years to 2019, the Heating and Air-Conditioning Contractors industry has expanded alongside broad construction trends. This industry includes operators that primarily install and service heating, ventilation, air-conditioning (HVAC) and refrigeration equipment. Accordingly, the industry is heavily influenced by activity in the construction sector. Over the past five years, the value of residential construction has increased at an annualized rate of 3.5%, while the value of nonresidential construction has expanded an annualized 0.3%. During the current period, interest rates have remained relatively low, resulting in low borrowing costs. Additionally, per capita disposable income has risen at an annualized rate of 2.2% over the five year…Heating, ventilation, and air conditioning is what makes up the HVAC industry. It’s something that you’ll find in buildings, homes, and even vehicles. We often take these needs for granted, wanting to turn on the heat when we’re cold or the A/C when we’re warm. For owners or operators, the HVAC industry has trends which must be followed to keep a building healthy. Regulations drive HVAC industry trends. In the northern US, furnaces must have a 90% efficiency rating, but in southern states, only an 80% efficiency rating is required. This means HVAC industry trends tend to be fueled by local and regional data instead of an overall set of trends. To discover what is in store for this industry, we must look at emerging technologies, integration, and how local regulations are evolving to get a picture of what to expect in the days and years to come. The HVAC Industry is Getting a Whole Lot SmarterMany within the HVAC industry are beginning to automate their sales and service processes, allowing them to cut their customer acquisition costs to keep pricing competitive.Smarter technologies, such as they use of smartphone apps, allowing building managers to control lighting, ventilation, and other processes with one control point.Better measurements of building environments thanks to the collection and mining of big data and analytic information will allow for more efficient HVAC systems to be installed in the future.At the local level, HVAC contractors will also be using software, SEO, widgets, and other online tools and strategies to help connect with local customers who are researching their system.Mobile solutions will continue to drive innovation within the HVAC industry as more potential customers look to meet their needs through the use of tablets, smartphones, or tablet PCs.As HVAC systems continue to develop innovative, but complex, solutions for buildings, consumers are expected to continue turning toward mobile technologies to set up preventative maintenance and service programs.There will always be a need for the HVAC industry. The real question of the hour is this: how much demand is this industry expected to see year after year? Much of that will depend on how much innovation can be achieved within the industry. As the world continues to globalize, more information than ever before is at the fingertips of consumers. They can research best practices, installation techniques, and they want mobility like never before. The Relationship Between Construction and HVACAn increase in new building construction will always provide a similar increase of HVAC unit installations.In both residential and non-residential, HVAC equipment installation are expected to be on the rise in the coming year.From 2014 data, the spending on construction projects for non-residential use rose 4.2% from the year before. In 2016, up to 7% growth could occur.Lodging construction projects with a need for HVAC unit installations saw an increase of 11.3%.Office and commercial construction projects saw increases of 14.7% and 8.4% respectively.Even sewage disposal construction projects with a need for HVAC components saw an increase of 13.6%.Residential storage heater shipments have seen increases of over 20% in the past 5 years for total shipments.Warm air furnace shipments have seen nearly a 23% increase thanks to the increases seen in new construction projects.Once an HVAC system is installed, it generally needs maintenance only. This creates two unique sectors within the HVAC industry. On one hand, you have the installers who need new construction in order to find the revenues that will keep them in business. On the other hand, you have maintenance and repair personnel who receive an expanded customer base with every new system that is installed. Although the maintenance sector can still thrive when there is limited new construction, the industry as a whole sees a decline and that affects everyone’s revenues. This is why the relationship between the construction and HVAC industries is so critical. How HVAC Innovations Are Inspiring New TrendsElectronic air cleaners are 40x more efficient than a standard filter you would throw away to remove unwanted particles from the air.Rightsizing, system updating, and types of refrigerant used can significantly affect HVAC efficiency.Variable speed heat pumps can help to trim monthly costs by up to 40% for homeowners.Proper insulation for a home or building on its own can improve HVAC efficiencies by up to 30%.75% of the utility costs of a home come from power that is used for home electronics that are being kept in a “standby” or “off position,” including HVAC equipment.Heating and air conditioning are two of the three most common expenditures for building owners today.A properly maintained air conditioning system will last 10-15 years, depending on the manufacturer and if it was properly installed.Filters must be changed every 2-3 months at minimum to maintain the efficiency of an HVAC system, which helps to fuel ongoing supportive revenues for the industry.Ductless HVAC systems could come to represent up to 15% of the total industry revenues in the next 5 years.Did you know that someone who lives in a home with air conditioning actually loses some of their tolerance for heat? Not that this is necessarily a bad thing, but it does go toward showing the importance of installing and using an innovative HVAC system for comfort purposes. With the average system operating at full efficiencies for 10-15 years, it is up to each owner or operator to find a qualified technician in their area to maintain their system. Otherwise, the cost of a new HVAC system might come around sooner than necessary, and although that’s not a bad thing for industry revenues, it does take money out of your pocket unexpectedly. We always think our HVAC system will be useful, but if we don’t pay attention to new trends, we could be paying a lot more than expected. The Global HVAC IndustryAnalysts forecast HVAC equipment market in China to grow at a CAGR of 8.51% through 2019.The global HVAC industry is expected to have a 4.34% CAGR through 2022. This is expected to generate total revenues of nearly $70 billion in total.Asia-Pacific continues to be the leading revenue generator in the global HVAC market thanks to the increase in demand for split-air conditioners.Global demands for HVAC equipment are expected to increase by 6% annually through 2020.Both the mature markets for the HVAC industry and the developing markets have a lot of potential. It’s the new construction opportunities in the mature markets which are fueling new revenues, while in the developing markets, it is innovative products and technician maintenance and/or installation. Although the HVAC market isn’t one of the larger markets in the world today, it is still a solid contributor to local and regional economies and that is why a healthy industry is so important. HVAC Future TrendsThe total HVAC industry in the United States is expected to see around $60 billion in revenues in the next 12 months.Industry revenues within the HVAC industry have been growing steadily at a 1% annualized rate since 2008.28% of the HVAC industry is comprised of single family homes. Another 6.1% of the industry serves apartment buildings.The healthcare industries contribute just over 13% of the total revenues that are collected by the HVAC industry annually.Manufacturing and industrial applications [10.5%] are just slightly higher than office building applications [10.1%] in terms of HVAC revenues.Demand for HVAC equipment is forecast to increase 6.8% annually through 2019 to reach a total of $20.4 billion.Shipments of HVAC equipment are expected to grow at 6% per year through 2019 to $16.5 billion.Imports are expected to account for a growing share of the demand for all HVAC products, exceeding 25% of the total demand for the first time ever in 2019.44% of HVAC sales will continue to be unitary air conditioners, which are consistently the largest share of the demand this industry sees.Heat pumps and warm air furnaces are expected to see the highest levels of total growth in the industry.When the recession started in late 2007, the HVAC industry took the same hit as the construction industry, but their pain didn’t make the mainstream media as often. The recovery being experienced within the industry is still continuing to build slowly, but at least the industry has come to the point where they have a positive annualized growth since 2008 at this point, even if it is at just 1%. The future looks very bright for the HVAC industry. Hopefully, another recession won’t come along to damage the progress that has been made in recent years.4.3.1 Industry ParticipantsCompetitive threats come from buyout opportunities and licensing agreements, Because this product is patented,unique and desirable there will be larger manufacturers in the industry looking to obtain product rights. however, Maymoun manufacturing will not be looking to withdraw equity.4.3.2 Competition and Buying PatternsMaymoun Manufacturing believes that our customers choose our products based on the following criteria:Price.Performance.Customer service and support.Strategy and Implementation SummaryThe market strategy is to capitalize on our expertise by positioning the company to acquire strategic companies within the industry.

One of its products is the line follower robot which is an educational toy/game. With this game, while learning algorithmic thinking, you can control your robot by using an interesting yet simple graphical programming language to define the robot’s movement strategy. After implementing your algorithm using your own computer you can download it to the Robot after which the robot will automatically follow your defined strategy (in your algorithm).You can program your robot over and over, test it in action and improve your algorithm based on the feedback you’re getting from the robot’s movement. Remember, your robot can follow any lines!We believe that Robots will play a more significant role in our future and we will be dealing with them in almost every aspects of our lives. Playing with robots is one of the very important things for kids and students. Therefore, we are planning to introduce a new toy to the market which will be known as an educational game for children/students. This way, children and students, while playing, will be encouraged to learn robotics and acquire problem solving skills.

The presented product is the result of thousands of hours of work conducted by professionals and carefully selected subcontractors. We take care to ensure the highest-quality standards, so we are talking with professional manufacturers.For example, when the assembly process is conducted by a third-party company, there is a risk that the production plan will be slightly delayed due to changes in delivery times.What is more, our product is provided with the housing. For now it’s 3D printed, but the final housing will be created using an injection molding machine. An injection mold is a very expensive item and requires a complicated manufacturing process. A tiny error in design can result in high cost in terms of both time and money.CE and FCE test risk. Failure during tests can increase delivery time or the cost of XROBOX(Tracer Robot). There was no point conducting the tests before, because the project evolved over time. Such tests are always done shortly before a product hits the production line.A major challenge is the shipping to various countries around the world, but we plan to work only with proven logistics companies to ensure that XROBOX reaches you on time and in perfect condition."

The love, passion, the artist and the dj's who travel world wide singing and whining from here to Japan. Carnival is a multi million dollar business and I want Gem's Carnival Life syndicated world wide on a network telling the story of the Carnivalist. As I build my brand, I'm filming a pilot engaging in deep passionate discussions about the good, bad and indifferent opinions whether married or single. I also interview famous artist and DJ's about carnival and their relationships and what they think about having a reality show. At the end of this project Gem's Carnival Life will share the sexiness, the indulgence and heritage of Carnival and why some people hate it or love it...In this one specific project I'm filming a pilot of the lifestyle of carnival in Kingston, Jamaica. My videographer/photographer Keynon Duncan whom is from Miami will capture the island by attending events, visiting historic venues, the specific carnival bands, designers, promoters, Dj's and famous artist up close and personal, which allows you to see the ins and outs of the hard work that brings carnival to life.Also, including in the pilot I need to hire a cast of ten people, one heterosexual couple, one lesbian/bi-sexual female couple, two heterosexual single women, two heterosexual single men, one lesbian woman and one gay male. This is when the raw discussions of love, sex, trust, mistrust, happiness and passion occur during the carnival lifestyle. How does carnival effect, encourage, persuade, damage, uplift, embrace, and push the love in each others lives.When all the filming is finalized, editing footage is pertinent to the final master piece of Gem's Carnival Life. The pilot will be ready to shop to Networks like Bravo, MTV, Viceland, Fuze TV or BET.Thank you for your trusting support,Gem","Common risks are missing major carnivals for ex. Trinidad and Tobago is in February. Because traveling and documenting carnival is state to state or in the islands. Once each carnival passes you can't participate until the next year. So planning in advance is key. The next planned carnival is Atlanta, GA, in May, St. Maarten and Jamaica in April, St. Lucia in July and Barbados in August",https://www.kickstarter.com/projects/gemscarnivallife/reality-show-about-carnival-and-love-good-bad-indifferent?ref=discovery_category_newest,gemscarnivallife/reality-show-about-carnival-and-love-good-bad-indifferent,"EXECUTIVE SUMMARYObjectiveGem’s Carnival Life Reality Show is about the lifestyle of the Carnivalist, how his or her relationships develop, and/or prosper. GCL is also about the music, the culture, the artist, and the Dj’s who are transforming this world into a multi-million dollar business into a billion-dollar industry. From Island to Island, State to State, and Country to Country, women and men travel to the carnival every month and every year to celebrate the heritage and their freedom of expression through music with each other. Gem's Carnival Life will show the reality of life lived by men and women, through the good, the sexy, and the indifferent when celebrating this carnival culture. GoalsGoalsGem’s Carnival Life in association with Gemstone love productions and Kilimanjaro Rest and Nightclub has supported the culture for decades and now it's time to take this genre of music to the next level of entertainment. TOFU TV is an independent network that will air on every local and non-local channel around the world. As we grow brands like Heineken, Red Stripe, Grey Goose and Hennessy will gladly and proudly be a sponsor, which will immerse more acknowledgment that the Caribbean and Carnival is multi-million dollar industry and is growing and here to stay. So much so that Africa is doing Carnival in 2021 introducing the genre of Afro-beat.SolutionTo make awareness of Gem's Carnival Life the Reality Show, we're raising funds from you our supporters, and sponsors that already support the music and culture and should support the music and culture. Brands like Jeep, Wrangler, Ralph Lauren, and Vans. We love them and we want them to love us back. We also have several other liquors, beer, food, and non-alcoholic brands that support our focus.GCL is filming a pilot at Villa Mimosa in Discovery Bay on October 18th from 11:00AM to 8:00 PM. We hope and pray that this is the right time to continue the focus and goals of GCL due to Covid. We wish everyone good health and love.Sincerely,Gem's","The potential risks and challenges for Gem's Carnival Life is Covid 19. As the world shut down in March 2020, we actually turned the fire up by tackling other needs of the business like corporate sponsors and marketing in each Island. Companies like Red Stripe in Jamaica and Mt. Gay in Barbados were one of our first contacts.  We look to partner with restaurants, food companies and liquor brands.  We also reached out to other corporate sponsors in the United States like Red Bull, Jeep and Van's.  Because this is a world wide genre of music we have hired several people to handle tasks that will make Gem's Carnival Life a successful reality show.  We now have an HR department, Marketing and Merchandising department, Business Strategy department and Sponsorship department. Caribbean and African music has grown during Covid and we've realized that Gem's Carnival Life is exactly where we want to be.  As our business grows, we've also realized that Soca, Reggae and Afro-beat is ready for the next level of entertainment and GCL will supply what the world is asking for."

We have quite a few projects in the works right now, we are hopeful that trailers will be out by the end of the month for two of them!What Do We Do?Well, as of now we have two project managers, Seb and Josh, and these guys make sure that everything is running smoothly through the pipeline to get quality work out for the viewer, we are hoping to bring on another project manager in the future.We have one animation director, Vironz, and his job is to oversee who does what throughout the process of animation, and makes sure that everything looks consistent to bring quality videos to the viewer each month. We hope to bring someone else on to help him out with managing the animation for projects.We have a small team of about 10 artists, and 20 voice actors, and we would like to be able to bring more people on as we start to launch and we would like to be able to pay our long term people and commission artists to help make our concept art look amazing!What Are Our Projects?Well, we have a few running right now, and a few more ideas down the line.The Lost Princess Animated SeriesThis series follows the story of an angel as he struggles to keep his faith through many trials. He is sent to The Pit to save humans, but then the angels fall and it becomes Hell, and his whole world is turned upside down. He teams up with two unlikely friends and attempts to overthrow The Devil, only to fail, but there's always time for a second chance to restore his faith, can he stay strong until he finds the missing princess?Haunter of the WoodsEveryone knows the urban legend of 'The Woods Estate', but one day when a girl gets a strange call from one of her friends, a group of friends starts to believe that it may be true. It takes a week and a new phone call every night for them to finally go. It's a trap, but they find out too late to save themselves. 5 bodies are recovered, but what happened to the others? The truth is buried with 6 teenagers, only to become another urban legend at 'The Woods Estate'.The Game Of LifeFour friends find their world turned upside down when it is revealed to them that the world they know isn’t what it seems and they are living in a simulation. Almost instantaneously, they are thrown in the midst of a civil war between those who desire free will and the powers that be.Why Do We Need The Money?Well, as I said before , we need to be able to pay our staff and commission artists to help us with our concept art, but it would also go toward launching a quality website, buying software that is necessary for animating, and paying musicians. There's a lot that goes into such a small project, but it all adds up to getting you quality content every month!Thank you so much for taking the time to check out our project, and we hope you'll take a chance on us because we are determined to make these projects happen.

He has become like a human, relying on blind faith instead of his usual Revelation, he struggles to stay true to himself while everyone around him seems to go mad because of the darkness. How does he become like the monsters he is surrounded by without losing himself?The Game of LifeThis project borrows from the simulation theory. The idea that everything is fake and we’re all living in a simulation constructed by a superior society ahead of our time. It’d be a three part series which would focus on a group of friends thrown into this journey of discovering that the world they know is a lie and that once they know this truth they become enemies of the state or “Degenerates” and will have to make a choice to fight against this system and perhaps escape the simulation.Thank you!","We may fall slightly behind in production of physical gifts because there's no telling how quickly we can get things shipped to us, and then turned around and shipped out to you."

And two, an audio engineer.","The music industry is and always has been a very high risk proposition. Music studio's generally fold within the 5 year ""sink or swim"" period.

The songs  will be marketed to record labels, music publishers, and most importantly, learning centers/learning websites. Some songs will be derived from classic literature and nursery rhymes and converted to pop song recordings. The lyrics will contain ""theme"" forms of the books, stories, nursery rhymes, with important phrases and text related to the story.  Copyright and usage rights from the authors, music publishers, copyright holders will be paid for and used with permission.  This will be an important selling point to publishers and copyright holders since they have a stake in the success of a song recording of their material. The will likely be grateful and even  helpful in promoting songs. Book publishers also have a financial interest in some of the songs. And in addition to ""learning songs"" or ""classic stories converted to pop songs"" I will also be focused on ""remakes"" of classic hit songs (used with permission) cover songs re-recorded with new Pro Tools technology. This will also be an important selling point to music publishers and copyright holders because of their stake in the song copyrights, royalties. Additionally, when financially feasible, celebrities will be hired to sing ""cameo"" ""featuring"" vocal performances. Or celebrity musicians will be hired to perform their instruments on song recordings. Making money and finding paying clients at record labels, learning centers, etc. may take years.

Facebook is now supporting 360 Spherical Video. at the Global Mobile Internet Conference GMIC SV the panelists projected that bye 2020 Augmented Reality with be a 120 Billion dollar a year industry and Virtual Reality another 30 Billion. bye 2030 it will be a 300 billion a year industry. personally i don't think it will take that long.,https://www.kickstarter.com/projects/1195724592/merlin-360-vr-web-browser?ref=discovery_category_newest,1195724592/merlin-360-vr-web-browser,"the merlin project.please forgive the typos no man is perfect. that takes a team.with the emergence of 360 Video and Photospheres into the VR world and the revolution of Mobile VR to include watching 360 videos and Photo's on the web the current developers and Bug business companies seem to be ignoring the mobile and desktop VR that's not game related. everything is specific app program features and leaving out a lot of important functionality.The Merlin VR Plugin and Browsers are designed to specifically to facilitate browsing the web and its content in 360 or VR mode. it allows an unlimited size desktop so you can rotate between multiple desktops as if you have dozens of monitors around you. you just puch the active desktop back from full screen to idon level and tap another desktop to make it full screen. you can set the screen at a specific resolution or look up and down plus zoom in and out on each desktop to take a closer loo at a specific part. word processings sites like google docks can be used in stereo mode or 3d Mode. zoom in and out to change how much is displayed and look up and down ore use a controller or bluetooth keyboard and down to scroll the page. Tap images to zoom in or change between flat mode 360 Mode or 3D mode. hold down the switch or button in the headset or google cardboard to bring up an option window or activate features.be able to zoom in and out on 360 Videos and Photo Spheres. see any jpeg photo in 360 mode even if its not a 360 original so you can load 360 photos to your favorite photo sharing site like instagram, flickr, pinterest, google, etc that does not support photospheres and stiil be able to see them in 360 format. sites that support 360 photos and videos the software will add in several interactive layers. one to add annotations that's pinned to the image not the viewing frame like google does. so as you turn your head the annotation stays pinned to a specific spot in the image. click on or select the annotation to bring up content on a display layer that will show info on the item you select or in shopping apps allows you to add that item to the shopping cart. there will be an animation layer so you can animate an avatar or other interactive content on top. a special effects / HUD layer to add in special features and controls that stay constant despite the orientation. etc.With the VR gaze keyboard and voice command typing the viewer can enter text messages and fill out forms hands free. the popup keyboard would appear as a large translucent keyboard and typing is done bye moving your head and lingering the cursor over the keys. the main input is through voice commands and errors can be corrected bye selection and word forecast selections.the apps and browser will allow both a chromecast feature so you can broadcast hats on your screen or virtual screens to other physical displays. it will also have a tethering function that allows you to pair your screen with your computer so what on your computer is shown on the screen. you can also tether with a USB HDMI Firewire, or other data cable so you can use your google cardboard type or Gear VR HMD as wireless VR display from your computer. this is not meant as a gaming HMD because that would require too much bandwidth, data throughput and head Tracking synced to the system. this is meant to augmented regular non gaming apps or the type of games you would pay on a normal android smartphone.Stereo imaging desktop. this feature would allow you to run most android apps in stereo mode so you can play your favorite cell phone games and apps in VR mode or with 3D VR features so it can add 3d options to normal 2d programs. this would require the business creating the app to allow the merin plugin to add stereo and 3d Viewing options to their app or just show the normal flat app in stereo mode inside the HMD.multi user interactions controls. this would allow multiple users to synk their phones or computers together so that the same streaming content is displayed on each of their devices but allow them to choose with viewpoint they want in the 360 environment. watching 3d an 360 Movies where each person if focused on different parts of the whole image.imagine going into a theater and renting a Headset with a micro SD controller that has a 360 movie loaded into it. the theater has the headsets all synced so everyone is watching the same part of the movie at the same time. or different parts of multi threaded movie . one side empire, the other side rebel. each watching the same general feed from differing viewpoints. all synced together so everyone is reacting to the same thing at the same time. each is sitting in a swivel chair so they can turn their body's as well as there heads to whats going on. having 3d sound coming from all over the theater not just the screen in front so when you hear footsteps or motors behind or beside you, you know where to look.now imagine sitting in your home with your own headset lined into your wifi broadband. in a multi channel VOIP program synced up to others scattered around the world. all synced together so your all reacting to the same content at the same time. each able to comment on the part they are watching and guide each other through the viewing experience. taking a Virtual tour of Yosemite and watching their geysers, hot springs, caves and other points of interest. join a horseback riding tour through the park virtually while sitting in your swivel chair at home in anywhere in the world.Watch a sold out concert Virtually in streaming 360 video and feel like your in the audience. watch a sporting event in the middle of winter from the sidelines or in the stands and be able to jump from camera to camera teleporting your viewpoint around the stadium but still feeling like your there, while your thousands of miles away or the game was recorded months or years earlier.Take a Tour of a House in 360 photosphere and Video. view every room and be able to see the complete room not just snapshots. have the realtor walking around the room or property explaining the amenities and features. watch 360 videos of the neighborhood. the local school, the shopping malls, the churches and restaurants that are close to the home but your still be on the other side of the country. deciding on weather you want to work for a company that's is on the other side of the country but not sure you want to move? take a Virtual Tour of the offices, production area, working environment, Break Areas and recreational facilities, gym etc. while your still miles away.with the merlin Augmented Reality features you can pull out your Cell phone and clip on a portable set of folding VR lenses. look at a QR code on a storefront and see what the inside looks like and what the atmosphere is like even though the business does not open for another couple of hours. look at the menu and check their prices and selection. then look them up in google maps and check out other business around the area. plan your date virtual before you go there even though you're in a new city only for the weekend.walk into a brick and mortar store and with the AR feature you can pull up info on any product bye just scanning the barcode or the label on the front. or sit at home and watch a 360 video of that same brick and mortar store they uploaded to the web. see all the inventory not just what happens to be in the add or what the search engine pops out. the difference between shopping online and in person is that while your in the store you'll see lots of things you did not know existed, or that they have on sale. from the 360 video select the annotation for that item and add it to your shopping card or read the product details.these are just a few examples of what can be done with the new technologies that are coming out now. we want to enable this vision of an interactive web and bring us closer to an immersive view of the word around you.","i have been working with digital imaging since 1980 when my highschool bought 2 apple 2 computers. i have been creating 360 models , animations and VR content since the lat 80's. first on the amiga then for the PC. and a little for the mac. i started using the Term multi media for my work back in 1990. long before it became common place. I ran a Virtual Reality sci-fi convention back in 1994 when VR was mainly the amiga and HMD;s made from pocket TV's running NTSC resolutions. from 1995 to 1999 i ran a cyber cafe in a gaming store in willow Glen California, while working as a senior prototype assembler at 3COM developing high speed network cards. and making Kodak Photo CD's for Wolf Camera in San Jose. in 1999 i worked with a construction company making 3D models of houses in VRML before they were built and showing them off with the Virtual IO Glasses HMD. i have worked as a freelance photographer since 1986 and in august 2015 got my first bublcam 360 video camera. I have been a MOBILE VR Evangelist since then showing off the future of mobile VR beyond gaming and recording many Tech conferences in 360 Video. i started thenewsbubbe.com website and its affiiated Facebook page on august 10th 2015 to help inform the general public about the emerging Virtual Reality, Augmented Reaity, Virtual Presence and 360 Photo and Video technologies. i have seen how the existing big businesses are falling short of the potential and want to bring this new technology to the massed. Oculus is targeting the 250 million high end gamers around the word. Gear VR only works with samsung phones.i'm after the other  Google and facebook support 360 Video but only in chrome and microsoft edge. I'm after the other 6.5 billion users whose only access to the web is a smartphone.  no one is properly supporting 360 Still images and 360 Video support is very limited. compare the quaity of video between a 360 video on bub.io site and the same video on youtube and youl see a world of difference. but even bubl is only for its cameras images. 360 photos is mainly supported on google maps but family photos, wedding pictures, Birthday parties and company picnics have no place there and no place to share family photos. with the basic cameras like the kodak 360 and the Ricoh Theta cameras being so affordable more people are joining the 360 evolution of the net. apps like PhotoSphere, and Google Camera, making 360 content can now be done with any cell phone and a bit of patience. but they cant be shared on the social media sites and be viewed in VR mode yet. I am not a programmer or business manager. i will hire professionals to do that right. but i am a Visionary and Media Talent and have seen so much potential that is not being tapped into bye the big business that look at the bucks first and the minimal work to get it. My dreams are boundless and i want to carry the Vision i see to others Arthur C Clarke said "" Any sufficiently advanced technology is indistinguishable from magic.""  I want to bring the Magic of Mobile VR/AR/VP out of the web and into the everyday word."

We must fill up the empty seats, and do it on a mass scale, because we are stuck with the system we have for now. Uber and Lyft are efficient computerized taxi systems i.e. two people - one trip - bad greenhouse outputs. The whole world is not going to work for Uber and it would not address the global warming problem if everybody did. It would make it worse. They are also not designed to coordinate virtually all transport by route and schedule on an emergency basis, using existing trips, handling hundreds of millions of transactions or more overnight in a streamlined easy and quick manner. Solomon's Chariot is designed for exactly that. It is fully automated and requires no staff or maintenance. It is an open, efficient and free communications channel, and its available now. Log on and Try it ! How urgent is the problem ? Do you remember the ferocious Fort McMurray fire last spring in Canada? Do you know what caused it? Underneath the arctic ice cap is 50 billion tons of frozen methane. It's been slowly warming for 100 years and is now near transition temperature. It's like a warm bottle of soda. Shake it and up it comes. A small earthquake kicked 20,000 tons of methane up last winter and it settled in a cloud over McMurray in March and April driving the temperatures to 80's and 90's, both day and night. Night is the important part, the signature of methane. It was 93 degrees in this patch of the arctic circle as fire started on May third. It dried everything to a fair-the-well and you saw the results.The arctic ice cap covers not 20,000 tons but 50,000,000,000 tons. The picture displayed for this project is the North Pole Sept 08, 2016. Open water everywhere and disappearing ice. Once the ice disappears and white goes to black the methane is going to rapidly warm and transition to gas. Heat waves are going to rapidly rise into the 100's, 120's, 130's and more. That is the opinion of leading climate scientists from Cambridge to Harvard to Yale. (see Arctic-news.blogspot.com). Cambridge University Arctic chair Peter Wadhams predicts an 18 degree temperature rise in 10 years if we loose the ice,.... and added ""I don't think we can survive that"".Save the Planet you ask? From What? From the third massive methane discharge on the planet in its history (see Permian-Triassic). Even if it's doomed to failure, we must try to save the planet from these events, at least do what we can. Solomon's Chariot is an incredibly fast, very simple and basic interface that can handle 200 million users and more tomorrow morning. It works everywhere in the world and in every language. It is a simple basic fast interface built for massive scale on Google and it runs on every conceivable device. It has universal access and reach out of the box. This free public service, has the power to cut vehicle greenhouse gas output in half with every single use. Sudden worldwide usage could dramatically reduce gas output and do so immediately. It is the only way to do it that is available now. It's online right now, and it is designed to handle world wide volumes overnight. It runs on Google App Engine (same as G-mail i.e. unlimited volume capabilities). Log on, Join, Try it. Like it, Donate, and face your maker with the certainty that at least you tried to do something about the demise of all Gods Creations.https://fastlanesplease.comGive the world a Christmas Present, and face the new year with a new set of priorities, and a prayer that we are not too late.For Arabic Try egypt.headlessuber.com !! (See Note)Note: Sign on by Traditional Logon Only. The supporting Facebook, Google and Twitter apps for Oauth applications have not been created yet for the full 128 foreign languages which the system fully supports. ","Solomon's Chariot is a completed and functioning system that is free to the public everywhere in the world right now in every language. It works great. This offering is to retain one or more marketing firms to assist in launching it's first pilot marketing effort. Funding will be used for a highly targeted marketing campaign aimed initially at Seattle/Everett commuters. Commuters in this corridor can save up to ten hours a week in traffic in just minutes with this app. Nobody seems to want to save the natural world so far, but they DO want to get there fast and easy. The funding is to point that out and to support ongoing interface development in Angular for the latest in user interface quality and a progressive web app feel and capability on mobile devices (i.e. native) . It is hoped that congestion and the dramatic time savings in this corridor can provide sufficient personal motivation which being kind to the planet does not provide,...yet. Once a critical mass of participants has been recruited the advantages will become abundantly obvious.The system works with multiple domains for multiple languages and situations. Other Domains are easily added to rapidly adapt the system to local needs and languages everywhere. (see https://fastlanesplease.com, or https://HeadlessUber.com for example) This is a highly sophisticated system that can handle thousands of domains, each setup for a tailored purpose, marketing target, or language, and all working in unison on a world wide basis behind the curtain.  This is ready to go now. Every day delayed is more greenhouse gas output. Recent reports of incredible melt rates on both poles also highlight the fact that by increasing occupancy the system also increases overall system efficiency. Sixty percent of the world's refining capacity is at sea level, and since the Petro's have been denying global warming, nothing has been spent on mitigation. That Capacity may disappear more rapidly than expected, with insane price escalations and transport difficulties being created at the worst possible time. Sudden onset of these conditions may dramatically increase system acceptance and usage when the cost of empty seats skyrocket. If people prefer global death to giving up their driving privacy, they will certainly give it up verses not driving at all. The world is about to radically change, and this system is capable of being an important and vital part of that new world, providing a service that will be essential, however events develop. Support it and your name will be included in the credits !Additional challenges to the systems transportation coordination role are anticipated service interruptions.

The issue is getting acceptance of the system and enough users to make the connections easy and accurate.

https://www.kickstarter.com/projects/joaquin/the-emergency-fund-challenge?ref=discovery_category_newest,joaquin/the-emergency-fund-challenge,"Hello,After learning a lot about personal finances, I realized that many people don't have an emergency fund in place.What's an emergency fund? It's just some money set aside for life's unexpected events. It's the difference between stressing out over a car repair and sleeping soundly at night. It's knowing that you can lose your entire income and you have some time to find another source of money.My goal is to create a free app, without any ads or in-app purchases, to help people get in charge of their personal finances.Here's how it works. The simplest way to start and finish a goal according to most sources, is to simply start very small and have a clear, achievable goal in mind with a set finish date.This works for ANY goal, from losing weight to finishing a marathon. The most important step is to just get started.Here is where the app comes in. After installing the app, a savings schedule will be created based on the user's personal circumstances.The app will just ask you to start by saving 1 cent, then two cents, and so on.When the habit is ingrained, the sum to save increases slightly, but never more than just a few dollars per day.In just 6 months it's possible to have an emergency fund of $1,000. This money can go a long way in helping anyone prepare for an emergency.In most developed countries, around 28% of adults don't have an emergency fund, and the percentage is higher in third world countries.Not even 50% of the population has enough money to live for 3 months from savings alone.With this app, I hope to encourage people to start saving for emergencies. $1,000 is the absolute minimum amount that an independent adult should have to solve an immediate emergency.After the emergency fund is saved up, the goal is to continue saving to have enough for at least six months worth of expenses. So once the $1,000 milestone is reached, the user will have the option to continue in the same manner until a proper emergency fund of six months worth of expenses has been created.They say that a journey of a thousand miles begins with a single step. In this case, the journey of financial freedom begins with just one cent. I would really appreciate if you could donate anything to this project. It's for a good cause - anyone can start saving today with just the right amount of motivation. There's no better motivation than to just start saving one cent.Thank you very much for checking out my project, and I'd really appreciate any help you can provide to make this a reality.","The greatest challenge will be getting the word out there.

By reserving your copy, you help us create the best handmade books and support various artists in the process.Printing books is easy – making a masterpiece is not. Each of our books is carefully hand made using very simple tools, such as:- Brushes- Shears- HammersAnd so on…The art of traditional fine bookbinding has been mostly forgotten over the past decades. Our mission is to preserve this tradition and demonstrate how bookbinding techniques can create a superior product to even the most advanced modern printing processes.For this campaign, our goal is to bring The Picture of Dorian Gray to life in a new edition made using the art of fine bookbinding.When you hold one of our books in your hands, you’ll instantly notice the difference, not only in the superior design, but also in the quality of the individual components.We are a small creative agency located in the heart of Mexico. We routinely print books and pamphlets for special events. In the age of automation, we love creating handmade goods, and we have the capabilities to create books by hand that are outstanding.Our team is composed of artists and artisans. We work together to create products that exceed all expectations.The Picture of Dorian Gray is Oscar Wilde’s story of a young man who sells his soul for eternal youth and beauty. The first had over 500 words censored and was quite controversial back in the day.As Oscar Wilde claims, in every piece of art there is more of the artist than of anything else. By reading The Picture of Dorian Gray, we can take a glimpse into the life of Oscar Wilde himself, who explores the nature of sin, morality and immorality.This is a sad and haunting book that tells of the joyful naivete of youth and the sad wisdom of maturity. By understanding the life of Oscar Wilde, we can come to understand his work itself in a more profound way.Oscar Wilde was an Irish poet and playwright born in October 16, 1854. In the 1890’s, he became one of the most popular playwrights in London. He published many poems, lectured in the United States and Canada and eventually returned to London where he worked as a journalist.He became a very well-known personality of his day. In 1890 he wrote his only novel, The Picture of Dorian Gray. A few years later, he was jailed from 1895 to 1897 and left for France immediately after his release. He died at the age of 46 in Paris, France.Our books are made to last. They feature the highest quality Hard cover for durability. The best paper material, for resilience. High-quality glue that will remain standing for centuries.Each book we create is a true masterpiece. You'll feel the difference when you first hold the book in your hands.The book is pressed while damp between wooden boards, for several days, to ensure a high-quality finish.We only work with the most-talented artists to ensure that each copy is something special to behold - a true work of art.We will ensure that no two books are alike... and your limited-edition book will be different to everyone else's.Some of the pages in the book contain decorations made by hand. We do this to ensure that each one of our books is unique from each other. Look at the following video to see the kind of decorations we add to some of the pages of each book:Each book is numbered. In general, the lower the number, the more valuable the book is. However, certain numbers might have an important meaning for you. You’re free to choose your favorite number.We pay attention to even the smallest of details. The result is a marvelously crafted book that represents hundreds of individual steps.We choose the materials that are longest-lasting. Our paper, glue, and so on is of the highest quality, ensuring that the result will last for entire lifetimes and will be passed through generations.We create the books in our workshop located in a small city in the heart of Mexico. As such, we can keep the costs low while ensuring high-quality manual work. Our artisans are very experienced in the art of bookbinding and they create top-notch products.We are a very small team of graphic designers, writers and artisans. We create high-quality books that require a lot of creativity. Being in Mexico, we can provide products with a substantial amount of manual work that might be more costly to produce in other places.By reserving your copy, you’re helping Mexican artisans do what they’re best at.We want to reward you for your kind support. You will receive amazing rewards for your contribution:The Picture of Dorian Gray Book:This is what we’ve taken a long time to create. This is the hard-cover handmade edition of The Picture of Dorian Gray designed with a beautiful golden cover, while preserving a vintage look.For some contributors, we’re also releasing 5 limited-edition paintings of The Picture of Dorian Gray. This will be the artist’s representation of Dorian Gray in his youth, making for a compelling painting with plenty of story behind it.There will only be 5 paintings of this kind ever released, and they will be all signed by the artist himself.Every contributor will receive a limited-edition handmade paper bookmark with our sincere thanks.

My friend Marco decided to move to Colombia, I visited him and felt in love with this country. Now I´m still living in austria and fly over couple of times a year. But I´m rid of living in this fast and unhealthy environment.We visited Yacopi for the first time and decided to buy a big piece of this untouched nature. We found a small area where coffee already growed,We came back at harvesting time in November an had our first few hundred kilos of coffee. Asked some locals to help us understand how to grow and cultivate coffee. Fascinated by the beauty of this area, we decided to make a project out of our idea.A 100% sustainable coffee farm, where everybody can come and see how we grow coffee., is allowed to stay for a few days and help us working in this untouched nature.When you look on youtube, how coffee is grown nowadays or any other plant, we think is was not the idea of god, to do it like we do nowadays.We are sick of all this industrialization and we want to show that there is another way to do it.Of course we want to earn money with this project, but the most important thing was to save a small piece of heaven.When you walk through this wonderful deep green nature, you just feel the energy and you find yourself relaxed and satisfied within minutes.We own about 300 hectares of natural forest near Yacopi in Colombia. There we grow coffee. Right now there are just 1 hectares planted with coffee. We want to add 50 hectares more, to get an annual output of 20 tons of coffee.We don´t grow coffee as the big plantations do. We plant our coffee under banana, mango, papaya, lime and orange trees. No pesticides and no fertilizer is used. We just let it grow as mother nature does.The core idea of this project is to grow just the best coffee in Colombia and let people come to our farm to give them an idea of what we do. People should experience this wonderful nature and learn how to grow coffee, what is important and finally taste this 100% natural coffee. Everything is handmade, no big machines are used. We grow our own vegetables and fruits there, have some cattle's and chicken too. The local people around this area have no possibility to earn money there, so we want to show them a sustainable way too earn money and preserve nature.This project is 100% self-sufficient.Beside coffee, we want to create a small retreat for people interested in nature and coffee. Not a luxury retreat, just some simple naturally build houses, only build out of materials available on our farmland. Electricity made by photo-voltaic, water out of our own well or the river passing by.We want to build 10 houses, each with its private garden and an breathtaking view.Colombia always is described as a dangerous country, and at some places this might be true, but our mission is to show you how beautiful this country is and that agriculture within the nature is possible and makes so much fun.We want to give you the possibility to see and experience what we already do.","We eliminated almost every possible risk. We founded a company, own the land, have the license to export the coffee out of colombia. We just need to find a roaster which loves coffee as we do.Need help to plant more coffee. A lot of manpower is necessary to plant and cultivate coffee in the jungle."

Dann nämlich läuft der jetzige Mietvertrag zwischen Herrn Ullrich, der das Theater seit über 60 Jahren führt, und der Stadt Bonn aus. Schon im Mai 2019 beabsichtigt Herr Ullrich den Spielbetrieb einzustellen. Nahezu zwei Jahre haben meine Kollegen und ich mit Herrn Ullrich und der Stadt Bonn verhandelt und wir standen am 30.01.18 kurz vor dem Abschluss eines Kaufvertrages und der Übernahme. Da unserem Investor aber die kurzfristig geänderten Bedingungen über die Zahlung des Kaufpreises nicht passten, zog dieser sich ganz zurück. Auch meine Kollegen zogen sich von dem Projekt zurück.Die Stadt Bonn hatte daraufhin mitgeteilt, dass die Immobilie nicht mehr verkauft werden soll, sondern eine Ausschreibung zur weiteren kulturellen Nutzung in Erbpacht angedacht ist. Ich habe mich daraufhin mit dem Kulturamt der Stadt Bonn in Verbindung gesetzt und mein Interesse bekundet, die Fortführung des Kleinen Theaters auch alleine in Angriff zu nehmen. Das Kulturamt will mir im Mai die Bedingungen mitteilen.Natürlich gibt es viele Überlegungen und Pläne von diversen Interessenten, die Immobilie anders zu nutzen oder den Spielbetrieb des Kleinen Theater evtl. an anderer Stelle, wie z.B. in einer ehemaligen Lagerhalle fortzuführen. Damit würde man auf das Potential der Abonnenten verzichten, die einen solchen Wechsel meines Erachten nach nicht mitmachen würden. Ich bin der tiefen Überzeugung, dass das Theater nur in der jetzigen Form und am jetzigen Ort eine Chance hat und indem man es behutsam in die Moderne holt. Den akuten Sanierungsstau hatten wir mit 200 TEUR beziffert. Es wird abzuwarten sein, wie dies in den Bedingungen für die Übernahme durch die Stadt Bonn beziffert sein wird. Dennoch wird es auch ein Spiel mit der Zeit sein. Eine lückenlose Übernahme zum Spielzeitbeginn im August/September 2019 müsste gewährleistet sein, um die Abonnenten nicht zu verprellen.

The location is next to a busy farmers market and local business area with no tacos directly nearby. The market itself services all the locals in the area with fresh fruits and vegetables as well as household staples. Playa Del Carmen is going through a lot with this pandemic and we thought this would be a good time to start something new here. We are also taking the opportunity with this project to help feed less fortunate in the area during this time of unemployment and lack of resources for the needy. Not only are we providing tacos at affordable prices but we also include Potatoes, Nopales, Cucumbers, and Pico de Gallo with all orders. This will insure people are full when they leave TACO EN PLAYA.We live in the neighborhood and see the immediate need for an affordable take out taco location. We will also be providing jobs and a pay it forward option to help the needy in Playa Del Carmen.We will do this as much as possible and also give people the opportunity when they come visit to do that as well. We will be offering an option to purchase as many items as you'd like for the needy when you order as well. We will then at the end of each week distribute these out throughout the community. We call this program our ""taco with love"" program.We have an amazing location already in place and we have construction and equipment 100% ready to commence when funding is in place. We will be helping with all construction as well as employing some local tradesmen.Our marketing will be heavily involving social media and direct marketing as well as word of mouth in Playa Del Carmen. We will also provide a delivery service for people who need this or cant make it to come in.A little about us.....Hi everyone I'm Santino , I have been doing business in Playa Del Carmen now for 9 years now and helping the local community with volunteering and tourists as they reach out to me as needed. I am super excited to start this taco stand and to give back.

We've been lucky to open our first location and now we are looking at expanding and opening another one. The location is next to a busy area next to all the collectivo drop off and pickup and another market. The market itself services all the locals in the area with fresh fruits and vegetables as well as household staples. Playa Del Carmen is going through a lot with this pandemic and we thought this would be a good time to start something new here. We are also taking the opportunity with this project to help feed less fortunate in the area during this time of unemployment and lack of resources for the needy.Not only are we providing tacos at affordable prices but we also include Potatoes, Nopales, Cucumbers, and Pico de Gallo with all orders. This will insure people are full when they leave TACO EN PLAYA.We will also be providing jobs and a pay it forward option to help the needy in Playa Del Carmen.We will do this as much as possible and also give people the opportunity when they come visit to do that as well. We will be offering an option to purchase as many items as you'd like for the needy when you order as well. We will then at the end of each week distribute these out throughout the community. We call this program our ""taco with love"" program.We have an amazing location already in place and we have construction and equipment 100% ready to commence when funding is in place. We will be helping with all construction as well as employing some local tradesmen.Our marketing will be heavily involving social media and direct marketing as well as word of mouth in Playa Del Carmen. We will also provide a delivery service for people who need this or cant make it to come in.A little about us.....Hi everyone I'm Santino , I have been doing business in Playa Del Carmen now for 9 years now and helping the local community with volunteering and tourists as they reach out to me as needed.

Not only will the usual product be created, with the associated normal business for actors, set designers, sound and effects. This production plan aims to create both temporary and longer term employment for local people in the locations where the movie is filmed. Essentially, there have been some great movies over the last decade or so, which are beginning to create a sub-genre of their own. Films like 300, Troy, Gladiator, Braveheart, to name a few, have begun a trend of taking us back into historic times, to see epic tales unfold among people whom the directors manage to cause us to empathize and sympathize with.","My varied education and working life has been filled with intense experiences and steep learning curves - I have the attitude of approaching this creative task with a willingness to think outside the box, embrace new ideas and develop strategies on-the-spot in order that this project reaches fulfilment. Unique challenges are in the realm of creating the right production crew, and finding the right actors and actresses to bring this story to life. To facilitate the possible collaborator mishaps I plan to retain a larger-than-needed support network, so that there are always more options available should the need arise. As for production I believe in taking plenty of time to plan well, which I have allowed for, so that actual location filming is short focussed and disciplined, and I have allowed for plenty of time for the pre and post production work to be completed.",https://www.kickstarter.com/projects/245190432/a-21st-century-review-of-exactly-what-mankind-valu?ref=discovery_category_newest,245190432/a-21st-century-review-of-exactly-what-mankind-valu,,"Filming a documentary like this, with such a potentially diverse array of people to interview, carries a requirement for some diplomacy and the need for interpreters in any area where I am unfamiliar with the language. However, my previous work in teaching English to foreign language students, coupled with a keen interest in world history, means that my small production team will be well equipped to gather a diverse range of footage from around the world. I plan to minimise cost by using newer camera technologies, which will enable me to conduct many interviews myself without need for a large film crew, and by using local interpreters and guides.The parts of the documentary that are to be filmed here in the UK, or in similar “1st world” nations like the US and Australia, will utilise film students from Media colleges, with the view of enhancing their education. I studied GNVQ Media and was able to take part in a real world project, and it assisted my learning considerably – to be able to share this with other students would be a great bonus to the overall project.10% of the proceeds from the finished DVD will be given to Charities that provide the most basic needs to vulnerable adults and children, to include Julia's House and outreaches that provide night shelters and soup kitchens to homeless people.Our funding target has taken into account everything from travel costs, filming & sound development equipment, editing, and producing the finished DVD, to being able to give donations to those in need who volunteer to be interviewed for this project.Really, the target audience for this documentary are all of us who are fortunate enough to be able to afford the luxury of choice in our domestic lives - what food we will eat and where, what colour we will decorate our homes, what clothes we will wear if we choose to go out and socialise...

Dans mon travail, je rencontré des centaines de professionnels et de particuliers ayant un pourcentage élevé du même problème, changer le connecteur, car le câble réseau ne reste pas dans nos appareils et donc nous subissons une perte du signal de connexion. Avant le «Bridge-L» Il ne restait alors que deux solutions:1-    changer le câble : achat d’un nouveau câble, besoin de retirer le câble en entier donc de défaire et refaire l’installation.2-  changer la fiche « Rj45 classique » : posséder l’outil nécessaire ou faire appel à un technicien.Dans les deux cas, du temps de perdu, du travail supplémentaire, un coût supérieur au simple changement avec le « Bridge-L » qui lui se branche en quelques secondes et solutionne le problème de cassure grâce à son système innovant. Le « Bridge-L » est la solution économique et rapide (plug and Play) sans perte de signal et adaptable sur tout appareil utilisant la fiche « Rj45 classique ». Acheter moins de câble veut aussi dire une contribution à l'environnement. De surcroit, il est plus facile d’avoir un paquet de « Bridge-L » dans le tiroir que de nombreux câbles qui sont peut-être aussi endommagés d'un côté. Le « Bridge-L » est utile pour le repérage via des couleurs différentes, facilité pour tracer les connexions physiquement.Une plus grande surface permet de personnaliser le « Bridge-L » (logo, texte ou symbole, suivant vos besoins), évitant ainsi les étiquettes ou écriture improvisée sur câble. Désolé pour les professionnels, plus besoin de couper le câble et de refaire la broche, un soulagement pour certains techniciens (professionnel ou non). Simple d’utilisation et de mise en œuvre : Plug and Play ! Il suffit de le connecter entre le boitier et la broche défectueuse («Rj45 classique») et ainsi retrouver sa connexion sans perte de signal !Toute la structure sociétale est en place, brevet déposé, modèle 3d réalisé…, il ne nous reste que les dernières étapes avant la mise réelle sur le marché.Network cables are often broken in the upper locking part of the RJ45 connector. In my work I met hundreds of professionals and individuals with a high percentage of the same problem, changing the connector because the network cable does not stay in our devices and so we are experiencing a loss of connection signal. Before the ""Bridge-L"" There were then only two solutions: 1- change the cable: purchase a new cable, need to remove the entire cable so undo and re-install. 2- change the ""Rj45 classic"" plug: have the necessary tool or call a technician. In both cases, lost time, extra work, a cost greater than the simple change with the ""Bridge-L"" which connects to him within seconds and solves the problem of breakage thanks to its innovative system. The ""Bridge-L"" is the cheap and plug and play solution without loss of signal and adaptable to any device using the ""classic Rj45"" plug. Buying less cable also means making a contribution to the environment. In addition, it is easier to have a ""Bridge-L"" package in the drawer than many cables that are possibly also damaged on one side. The ""Bridge-L"" is useful for tracking through different colors, making it easy to trace connections physically. A larger area allows to customize the ""Bridge-L"" (logo, text or symbol, according to your needs), avoiding labels or improvised writing on cable. Sorry for the professionals, no need to cut the cable and redo the spindle, a relief for some technicians (professional or not). Simple to use and implement: Plug and Play! Simply connect it between the case and the defective pin (""Rj45 classic"") and thus find its connection without loss of signal! The whole societal structure is in place, registered patent, 3d model realized ..., we only have the last steps before the real put on the market.","La pièce a déjà été testée et est fonctionnelle, le défi actuel reste dans la maîtrise de l'industrialisation (production) et de la distribution.

Founder Joseph had a famous quote “The one reason you are going to use olive oil is because it’s going to make your food taste better, not only because it’s good for you!” The Sciabica Family whole heartily believes in the idea and Great-Grandson Andrew Sciabica introduced EVOO Food Truck to share his family’s passion. EVOO is a gourmet food truck without the marked-up price tag, for small portioned food. EVOO believes in honesty in ingredients with no fillers or preservatives and honesty in pricing with those who are on a budget in mind.EVOO, short for Extra Virgin Olive Oil will be the featured product used in every dish. EVOO will exclusively use Sciabica’s California Extra Virgin Olive Oil and incorporate the amazing flavored oils into classic home-style dishes. The menu will be prepared daily to ensure a consistent quality and all dishes will be made with fresh produce and ingredients. EVOO will be a gourmet food truck that does not inflate pricing around the popularity of the concept. With a consistent, honest pricing basis EVOO aims to build a loyal customer base for expansion into a future café and hopes of a full-service restaurant. ","EVOO will be established in Orange County, a highly competitive market for food trucks. If challenges in sales arise, EVOO will be prepared to re-evaluate the strategy of locations with the mobility of a food truck.",https://www.kickstarter.com/projects/evoofoods/join-the-evoo-foods-truck-journey?ref=discovery_category_newest,evoofoods/join-the-evoo-foods-truck-journey,"It all goes back to 1936.

Here, they meet Deanna Cruz, a caring soul with a passion for delicious food. In the following months, the three amigos trained side by side in the fine dinging industry.Nick and Andrew began sharing their passion for the family olive oil with Deanna and together they started assembling something unique. EVOO Foods was born on a blend of Mexican, Asian, and Mediterranean flavors mixed with California's wonderful agriculture especially the extra virgin olive oil, or EVOO for those in the know.EVOO Foods opened for service on June 14th, 2019 in a taco truck running on hopes and dreams to begin testing their concept in a food truck. Through rough beginnings and growth in the following months, EVOO Foods retired the taco truck and began leasing a modern truck. This opened major opportunities for EVOO Foods not only for the menu with a state of the art kitchen but for the people they can reach through large events and catering. Nick, Deanna, and Andrew have worked diligently to get to this point. They dream to secure the future of EVOO Foods with purchasing a food truck.

https://www.kickstarter.com/projects/1774758311/american-fork-star?ref=discovery_category_newest,1774758311/american-fork-star,"   Utah County had, in the past, several community weekly newspapers: Orem-Geneva Times, American Fork Citizen, Lehi Pioneer, Pleasant Grove Review, Springville Herald, Spanish Fork Times, etc. About 20 years ago the Provo Daily Herald bought out all but one of the weeklies (the Payson Chronicle which covers Santaquin, too - it ""was too small"" for the Herald to worry about). Then the Herald closed all the offices, after a brief attempt at maintaining the community connection.  That was a business move which I can understand. Yet, over the last several years the Daily Herald has failedto continue to cover those same communities - another decision I understand, but one I cannot condone. No one is really watching the city councils, school board, watching the city budget and special district doings . . . which IS the job of a real newspaper, to be a Watchdog!   I have more than 40 years experience as a newspaperman, and I admit I am old schoolwhen it comes to covering the communities I have served in and covered as editor, reporter, photo-journalist, owner/publisher, even. I have worked in and for more than a dozen communities in Utah; in Evanston, WY, Rifle and Aspen, CO, even out in Humboldt County, CA.   Being old school, I agree with Benjamin Franklin when he said, in 1729, ""To publish a good newspaper is not so easy an undertaking as many people imagine to be. The author of a gazette [or a 'Star'] (in the opinion of the learned) ought to be qualified with an extensive acquaintance with languages, a great easiness and command of writing and relating things clearly and intelligibly, and in few words; he should be able to speak of war both by land and sea [and air]; be well acquainted with geography, with the history of the time, with the several interests of princes and states, the secrets of courts, and the manners and customs of all nations. Men thus accomplished are very rare in this remote part of the world.""  While the eminent Mr. Franklin was talking of 18th Century Philadelphia and we are dealing with 21st Century rural Utah . . . yet, there are many similarities!  Never being called 'shy' when I see a community need, I feel it is time for someone to stand up and tell the stories of the communities the Daily Herald isn'tand apparently does NOT want to cover: if the city council and mayor are doing their job or just being 'good old boys' and raising taxes because they can; if the various high schools are doing their job academically as well as on the sports field/courts and if the Alpine School District is doing it's job, too; as well as covering the feature stories of the real neighbors and people IN those communities . . . as well as many of the events in those communities.   The Herald didn't cover all the State political conventions held in Provo, recently (June 2017). A few years ago they failed to even cover the County Democrat Convention but ONLY coveredthe Republican County Convention. So, according to them,it didn't officially happenbecause they didn't deem to 'cover it!'    Newspapers have a responsibility to the historians of the future, as they are literally or they are suppose to be, 'documenting current history' (as well as having an additional responsibility to ALL their readers and citizens) to cover the important events in their areas - and while the specific events may NOT look 'important' to those myopic few who are too close to the event or looking through their own bias', such as the Herald has done several times. It is well past time someone pointed out the error of their ways and show them howto do it correctly! (YES, I'm calling on the Herald to repent of their lazy ways and do their job the way it should be done, and the way ""We the People"" deserve!)   HENCE,the need for a community newspaper for American Fork, one for Pleasant Grove and one for Lehi (the American Fork Star, the Grove Creek/Battle Creek Star, and the Pioneer Star, specifically). And, we want all those who want their community to be covered better, the way they deserve to be covered, and as they should be covered, to help us get this going by the Fall of 2017.

Non-violent protests are often infiltrated by criminal opportunists and highly organized gangs and other violent entities. When a non-violent protest is infiltrated, it significantly diminishes empathetic public support.Second Sight is intended to discover, track and predict civil unrest and violence. It's an early warning system for non-violent protesters, local businesses, law enforcement, and government organizations to use toward maintaining safety and stability. Upon achieving our funding objectives, we intend to complete software development and bring Second Sight to market. We plan to offer licenses to business owners, law enforcement organizations, political organizations, governments, and financial institutions so that all have access and visibility into civil instability and the likelihood of violent behaviors. ","There are many risks to completing and delivering Second Sight to the market, the first being adequate funding.  The company's founder has invested $120,000 into software development, patenting, trademarking, business and financial plans, and marketing; however, the company remains at risk as the software requires 30 to 45 days for completion and quality testing.  The best case scenario is that funding objectives are accomplished and the product is delivered to market.",https://www.kickstarter.com/projects/1833679519/saig-second-sight?ref=discovery_category_newest,1833679519/saig-second-sight,"Second Sight is a pioneering sentiment-analysis system that has been designed to advise decision-makers about trending social behaviors, particularly those that lead to civil unrest and violence. Second Sight also discovers, tracks, and forecasts violent criminal organizations and terrorists’ activities, placing the power of prediction and control in the hands of decision-makers at every level.  Second Sight empowers you to view sentiment analysis of global social media as well as other vital data points ranging from violent organizations to virus outbreaks, natural disasters, and crime.To describe how Second Sight can help, let’s use a scenario.  Let’s say a citizen lives in Southern Florida and without warning, a hurricane hits their home and everything they owned has been destroyed.  Who knows if they can afford to rebuild or whether they are forced to relocate.Let’s redo that scenario in which the US National Weather Service sends out a warning the day before the hurricane, or even 12 or 6 hours before the hurricane makes landfall.  Suddenly, that citizen has time to board up the windows, collect emergency supplies and evacuate if necessary.Now, apply that scenario to the small business owners in Baltimore during the recent riots.  If the business owners had been warned the day before the riots escalated into violence, they could have locked away or moved expensive merchandise, moved business and personal vehicles, boarded up windows, and evacuated to a safer part of the city until the violence subsided.  Certainly, they could close up business and board everything up during the peaceful times of the protest, but, using the weather analogy, that is like boarding up the windows for a thunderstorm—why bother.With early warning about impending violence, instead of 200+ businesses destroyed and looted, 100 or maybe 150 businesses survive the violence with minimal damage.  That is what Second Sight bring to the table.","There are many risks to completing and delivering Second Sight to the market, the first being adequate funding.

The residential and commercial market version of the sensor, the “FL-1000” can be installed on the main feed of a building before the shutoff valve and then can be setup on the local WIFI network.The FL-1000 leak and freeze protection sensor can be easily installed in the main water feed line of any residential or commercial property before the main shutoff valve. The device can be easily configured on to the local WIFI network with any smart device.  The user interface allows the user to configure at what temperature the sensor alarm triggers to protect against freezing.  In “Auto” leak detection mode, the user can configure the sensor to automatically detect leaks any time of the day. In “Manual” leak detection mode, it also allows the user to do a manual leak test on their property. The sensor will automatically send an email and or a text under an alarm condition to wherever it is designated to be sent. This device can be interfaced or integrated into any home automation or smart home system. The FL-1000 user interface allows the user to test for leaks at any time.  Enter emails to forward leak detection and freeze warning alarms. The user can enter a temperature set point value to trigger an alarm or warning when the water temperature reaches the set point.

This made it easy for firefighters and rescue people to target their rescue efforts to the most vulnerable people. Unfortunately, this also put up a target for undesirables to exploit the weak. This became a problem and people stopped using the signs. Hence, the Beam Ready BR-1000H.Install a Beam Ready BR-1000H In the window of any child, elderly, or disabled person:The BR-1000 is triggered by any smoke detector alarm audio within 30 feet. The device will illuminate a multicolored high intensity flashing LED in the window of the individual.The BR-1000 will also shoot a high intensity laser beam out the window that will cut through any smoke and illuminate the room that requires attention first. This will give the fireman and rescue teams a direct path to the person’s room.You Tube Video BR-1000HThe Beam Ready BR-1000H is designed with a high intensity flashing multi-color LED that illuminates in the window of the child or a person who needs the attention and help the most.The Beam Ready BR-1000H is a smart home device with onboard WIFI.

https://www.kickstarter.com/projects/orchardaudio/crispin-high-performance-stereo-amplifier?ref=discovery_category_newest,orchardaudio/crispin-high-performance-stereo-amplifier,"The main purpose of this project is to start-up my company, Orchard Audio LLC, and to launch its first product - CRISPIN.CRISPIN is a high performance stereo audio amplifier, which features low-feedback, low-impedance true-balanced output, high bandwidth and most importantly, sound quality.  The result is a better-sounding amplifier at a fraction of the cost of its competitors. To realize CRISPIN’s highest potential, Orchard Audio partnered with Digital Amplifier Company (www.CherryAmp.com) to utilize their Maraschino Module using Cherry Amplifier Technology®.  As the first company to bring the Maraschino technology to the market, CRISPIN further sets itself apart from the crowd as a future-proof, forward-thinking and sonically optimized contender.In a world of module based amplifiers, the Maraschino Module using Cherry Amplifier Technology® sets CRISPIN apart as a future-proof, forward-thinking, sonically optimized contender.  Other module based amplifiers on the market use tremendous amounts of negative feedback to correct for output error.  The result is ringing and high-frequency hash much like the mega-feedback Class-AB amps of the 1980s. CRISPIN offers amazing bench measurements without massive feedback or phase compensation networks. The Maraschino difference is simply better sonics. The harshness associated with other Class-D amps has been eliminated.Digital Amplifier Company is extremely selective of their partners and their amplification technology is well respected and known in the industry. With this product you can get access to Cherry Amplifier Technology®at a reduced cost.The Audio Beatnik had the following to say after previewing CRISPIN: ""There is a top-to-bottom balance that makes the amp addicting."" and ""Well, this unit must have been implemented very well; it had a very open, clear, transparent, and alive sound.""See the full article here.The funds from this project will be used to make the first production units of CRISPIN, as well as to purchase some lab and testing equipment to continue growing the business and come out with more cool products.",Prototypes have already been built and tested.The risks are relatively low and mainly associated with lining up manufacturing for the production units. I have a few companies lined up to manufacture the PCB's and am in the process of getting final quotes. I will personally assemble the first batch of units to guarantee quality.Another risk is lead time of certain components which can delay manufacturing. This is something that has been looked at and mitigated as much as possible.,https://www.kickstarter.com/projects/orchardaudio/bosctm-hifi-monoblock-audio-amplifier?ref=discovery_category_newest,orchardaudio/bosctm-hifi-monoblock-audio-amplifier,"Anyone can notice the difference in quality, but not everyone will appreciate it. We design our products for those who appreciate excellence in their listening experience. Every detail goes into making BOSC™ the best compact and affordable amplifier to create the feel of live music with every listening experience.Use with any compatible existing speaker to amplify sound beyond your wildest audio dreams. You’ll hear a true difference. BOSC will fill your living room, bedroom or any room with enormous, live sound. BOSC is designed down to the smallest detail to provide the most realistic listening experience.BOSC's small size allows it to be placed next to or behind the speaker eliminating long and costly speaker cables while increasing sound quality.You won’t find a better GaN amplifier for the price. BOSC was specifically engineered by audio experts. The monoblock is a versatile piece of equipment that you will be your new favorite piece of professional audio equipment. Whether you are a home enthusiast or need BOSC for work. Extremely impressive and easy to use, the BOSC will become a staple in your home or business.Great For:Typically, emerging technologies cost a premium. BOSC uses the latest in GaN technology but does not break the bank.Buyers will struggle to find other GaN amplifier for less than $10,000 per pair...until now.BOSC™ comes at a substantially lower price, making it the most affordable option on the market by far. Designed and manufactured in the USA, BOSC™’s small package comes with no compromise on power and performance.The amplifier is DC coupled for response down to 0 Hz and has no bass phase shift. It offers high sound quality with ultra-low distortion and a high damping factor for crystal-clear sound and precise speaker control. Because it’s so compact, the speaker can be placed in a variety of spaces, including small bedrooms or apartments with limited space. With BOSC™‘s high power efficiency, the amp will consume little electricity while in use.This is achieved by using out of the box thinking and packaging techniques that are easy to manufacture. The performance to cost ratio is amazing and you truly get more bang for your buck. The small size is so compact but does not sacrifice on performance or power compared to its direct competitors and larger equipment. BOSC will be your new favorite and most used piece of audio equipment.All testing performed using a state of the art Audio Precision APx525 audio analyzer.In summary, the amplifier will have a completely black background on which the music will be presented and will sound great, whether listing at low volumes or tearing the roof of your house.Jack Roberts""I found them very dynamic, very musical, and beautifully detailed in the top end. The tone was better than in many transistor amps. The same could be said about emotional involvement. Listenability was very good with a relaxed and detailed sound. The soundstage and imaging were also very good.""Read the full review here:https://theaudiobeatnik.com/orchard-audio-bosc-monoblock-amps-follow-up-review/Adam LaBarge""I wanted to stop my heart so I could hear the music better. I was being sucked in, pushed out, and unable to focus on anything else but the music. There were all the little bird-like chimes, dancing between clicks and pings and bongs of xylophone harmonics with dry reed raspy sounds zooming in and out, floating on top of deep rolling strings and organ-like bass. I didn’t want to miss a moment of it.""Read the full review here:https://theaudiobeatnik.com/reviewing-the-orchard-audio-bosc-monoblocks/Ultra-high fidelity, plug and play, ready to go, high resolution music streamer. Control music using your phone, tablet or computer. Studio-quality sound can be enjoyed in a home environment. PecanPi Streamer's high precision and high resolution gives you the best sound experience for any audio playback. Enjoy pure music without any coloration from the electronics. Hear the music exactly the way it was heard in the studio, and exactly the way the artists intended. Even normal compressed (mp3) music files will sound much better.Can be connected to any existing stereo amplifier, AV receiver, or powered audio system, as well as headphones.The streamer will be available with the following software options:Specifications for XLR Output:Specifications for RCA Output:Specifications for Headphone Amplifier:General Specifications:Can I Use BOSC with My Current Speakers?Absolutely. BOSC comes in two gain levelsEither version of the amp will work with all speaker impedances, but you have to ensure not to exceed 200W.Will This Fit All My Speakers?BOSC will work with speakers of any size.How long are the wires? Will they reach behind my TV/Record player?The length of the speaker cable is up to you. The cable from the power supply to BOSC is 1.2m (4ft) long. The AC power cord is 1.83m (6ft).How is GaN technology better?Gallium Nitride transistors are better for Class-D output stages than MOSFETs, increasing the slew rate, reducing the ringing with fast input signals when loaded into reactive speakers, with faster overload recovery time - which is what defines amplifiers that sound better.How is the box so small?GaN technology allows for denser and more compact packaging compared to previous-generation technologies. This enables BOSC to be small. The AC/DC power supply is also external to the amplifier making it even smaller.Can I get just one?Yes, please contact us to learn how.I would like to approximate shipping costs, how large will the box be and weight?A pair (2) of BOSC amps with power supplies and adapters will ship in a 10"" x 10"" x 6"" (25.4cm x 25.4cm x 15.3cm) box and weight approximately 12lb (5.44kg).","Orchard Audio has experience in the audio and engineering field, the product designs and prototype design was done in-house and created the first functioning prototypes of both the BOSC and the PecanPi streamer. Leo personally has experience with creating audio products first hand and developing the Orchard Audio brand. BOSC utilizes the GaN technology for less switching and conductance losses throughout the amp."

All musicians out there are challenged to contribute, then upload a quick video of themselves playing music! Here's Parker doing the first one:We love music (who doesn’t? It’s a little like saying “I sure do find water refreshing!”). And we really love music videos—they’re a fun and compelling, alternative way to experience a song, and to experience a musician. Music video takes the boundless artistic opportunities available to a group and gives it another creative dimension to explore.We especially love independent music—all that music being made outside of the relatively minuscule circle of known bands and solo artists.But we’re tired of independent music not getting the respect it deserves. Some of the biggest sites in the world are outright dismissive of independent music:YouTube has threatened to delete independent music videos, andWikipedia trains volunteers to spot independent groups and delete their pages.Music videos are by far the most-watched type of video on YouTube, and so, logically, millions of those videos must be coming from independent artists. So why the hate?We’re building a music video network dedicated, now and forever, to independent music video. Yes, it’s a wrong we want to make right, but it’s also a humongous entertainment opportunity.SOLFEGE will be a new kind of television network made up oftwo parts:Users will be able to go back and forth between the SOLFEGEfeed and hub platforms as their whim dictates. Maybe you’re watching the feedand you fall in love with an awesome video. Just click on it, watch the videoagain if you like, and then check out other videos that that artist hasuploaded—as well as tons of related videos uploaded by other artists.Theterm “independent music” is thrown around a lot, with a wide spectrum of shadingsand meanings. What do we mean by “independent” you might ask? It’s simple—ifyou are able to give us permission to run your video, then you’re independentas far as we’re concerned. You might be on your own; have a label just for yourgroup; or be part of a small label with several other artists. As long as youhave the freedom to give us permission to run your video on our network, then you’re“independent” and we’re good to go. If someone has the power to tell you that youcan’t put your video on our network, hopefully you can convince him/herotherwise. We’ll be waiting.SOLFEGEis going to generate profits through advertising and sponsorships, which are partlyhow Pandora and Spotify (and traditional TV networks) make money. Every month,once we have paid our bills and made sure we have enough money in the bank tostay open, the balance will be divided up and sent to artists based on thenumber of views their videos garnered in the previous month. Videos with moreviews will make more money. One of our most important tasks leading up tolaunch will be figuring out how much we can give artists each month and at thesame time insure that we can keep the lights on going forward. But let usrepeat: We want to give back to artists as much money as we possibly can (notlike other online networks, who spend countless hours and dollars figuring outhow LITTLE they can give back to their creative partners).The dual purpose of our network is to provide a visualmedium where independent musicians can connect with an audience; and, at thesame time, share in the financial rewards generated by that connection—allwithin a music-videos-only format. We want SOLFEGE to stay just like that, andnot to be forced to move to other types of programming. That’s why we’recrowd-funding this network to get it off the ground: we want to play musicvideos forever, and not be forced by a board of directors to chase illusoryshort-term gains. We’re playing a long game here: we firmly believe that musicvideos provide an ideal media place for artists and audiences to congregate,and we want to build a network that will be known for that singularpurpose—always.","We’ve been working on SOLFEGE for a long time now, but there are several key aspects of the network that cannot begin until there’s money in the bank. Once undertaken, there is the chance that we could experience delays in one or more of these areas, but that’s a risk of us not meeting our launch goal of 1/1/15, and not a risk of us not launching at all:LAUNCH VIDEOS: We aim to have 1,000 music videos up on our site when we launch. We believe that we’ll be able to gather up these first 1,000 videos rapidly. After all, we’re reaching out to an untapped pool of videos that we feel numbers in the millions. That said, bringing in that first group of videos might take longer than we think; as we go about accomplishing this task, we’ll be communicating to a musical community whose members may or may not have yet heard of us. The good news is that music videos and musicians are all over the Internet and easy to find. And SOLFEGE represents a unique opportunity for its creative partners. Artists whose videos are brought into SOLFEGE will tell other artists; in fact, many musicians are in more than one band. All these factors bode well for the speed with which our first 1,000 videos will come in the door.BTW—you can help! If you make music, or your friend makes music, or you just found a really cool video, send it or them our way. We’ll get in touch with the artist and take it from there.PLATFORM: The technology needed to make this network a reality already exists; we’re just going to leverage it and make it our own. After all, the technical details behind our website are not what will make it special—it’s going to be the music and videos created by independent artists. We also intend to keep our visual design simple. Again, the music videos on SOLFEGE will be the focus, and not the page they’re sitting on. That said, online builds can take longer than anticipated, and the same goes for design. We firmly believe we can hit our launch goal of 1/1/15, but it’s critical for our platform to be bulletproof. As the old saying goes, “You only have one chance to make a first impression.”AUDIENCE EXPERIENCE: Even though the online video revolution is well underway, connection quality for individuals can still vary wildly. This could result in some audience members not having an optimal viewing experience of one or both parts of SOLFEGE. We'll do our best to make sure that our content is accessible to as many people as possible, even with wildly varying data plans and internet speeds. Even then, some viewers might still have inadequate connections and machines to enjoy our programming. Regardless, we feel that the network will be fully experienced by the vast majority of our potential audience at launch.To build SOLFEGE, and in particular to successfully deliver on the three areas mentioned above, we will enlist top technical and production teams to help us deliver the SOLFEGE music video network to a waiting world. Your contribution will make that possible.

That said, online builds can take longer than anticipated, and the same goes for design. We firmly believe we can hit our launch goal of 9/1/15, but it’s critical for our platform to be bulletproof. As the old saying goes, “You only have one chance to make a first impression.”AUDIENCE EXPERIENCE: Even though the online video revolution is well underway, connection quality for individuals can still vary. This could result in some audience members not having an optimal viewing experience of one or both parts of SOLFEGE. We'll do our best to make sure that our content is accessible to as many people as possible, even with wildly varying data plans and internet speeds. Even then, some viewers might still have inadequate connections and machines to truly enjoy our programming. Regardless, we feel that the network will be fully experienced by the vast majority of our potential audience at launch.To build SOLFEGE, and in particular to successfully deliver on the three areas mentioned above, we will enlist top technical and production teams to help us deliver the SOLFEGE music video network to a waiting world. Your contribution will make that possible. Thanks, in advance, for making SOLFEGE a reality."

https://www.kickstarter.com/projects/iix/nonus?ref=discovery_category_newest,iix/nonus,"At One of Nine Designs, we are passionate about giving our customers an exclusive opportunity to join a watch society that offers its members one-off timepieces, that personify unique minimalistic design with everyday functionality.The brainchild of Daniel Masuku, One of Nine Designs came about after growing up with an admiration of watches and spending numerous years working within the retail industry. The exposure to top tier watch brands and fashion developed into a passion for style and quality products. As the idea progressed, Daniel understood that the most well-established watch brands were so much more than a simple accessory. Their designs were flawless, timeless, and often passed down from generation to generation, but the price point limited easy entry.Eager to be part of such a society, One of Nine Designs positions itself as an exclusive timepiece at a more affordable price point. One that will be a treasured mainstay in your collection, with a design and build quality that can be used for a lifetime.Only 999 timepieces in each finish will be made available to the public, with the first launch edition timepieces in each finish currently on offer exclusively on Kickstarter.THREE DEGREES OF SEPARATIONAs a company, we are defined and bound by one ethos with three degrees of separation that differentiate us from the rest:Redefining the normTimeless designForever chasing perfectionBy adhering to this ethos, it enables us to go against the grain and set our own standards of watch design. We strive to create timepieces that will become the staple choice for any future collector who appreciates unique designs and expects nothing but the best from their timepiece.LaunchThe Nonus is our first design crafted to bring together function and form, all encased in high grade, lightweight titanium.Sporting a Swiss made Eterna Calibre 3909A automatic movement, designed in Australia and made in Switzerland, the Nonus is derived from the nonagon shape, combining the use of an unorthodox yet perfectly symmetrical design, to redefine what an acceptable dress watch form should be.Limited to only 999 timepieces in each finish, the Nonus is initially offered in the following finishes:GresioCerulean BlueAlbumCASE SPECIFICATIONSConstruction: 3 piece Material: TitaniumDiameter: 40 mm Lug to Lug length: 47mmThickness: 12.20mm Glass: SapphireLuminescent: Swiss Super-Luminova Hand design: Light BridgeWaterproof rating: 100 metres / 10 ATM Weight: 99 gramsBracelet / BandAt One Of Nine Designs, we strive to create a sense of uniqueness with the components we use to create our timepieces. This is displayed in our watch case design, and we have followed that same philosophy with our IX Bracelet.Inspired by the jubilee bracelet, we have worked on creating a bracelet that bears the same aesthetic and appeal while increasing the comfort for the wearer and streamlining the overall look to complement our Nonus timepiece.By reducing the overall height of the pieces used in the traditional 5-piece construction of a jubilee bracelet, we have managed to achieve a reduction in the links catching onto material, skin and hair. Should a scratch appear on the surface of the bracelet, this redesign allows owners to easily smooth out any imperfections.To ensure the lightweight and durable appeal of the Nonus, the IX Bracelet is also constructed out of high-grade titanium.Bracelet: Quick release IX Bracelet with butterfly clasp.Kickstarter exclusive offer: Additionally all backers who support this project receive an extra genuine leather band with a deployant clasp, only offered for launch edition timepieces.MOVEMENT SPECIFICATIONSOrigin: SwitzerlandMovement Type: AutomaticMovement Model: Eterna 3909AFrequency: 4HzPower reserve: 65 hours (manufacturer specifications)Vibrations per hour: 28’000Jewels: 30More DetailsDelivery and TimelineOnce our campaign ends we will immediately start production of all first edition Nonus timepieces and we anticipate that we will commence delivery of all our timepieces by the end of April 2020.

During that same time I started to ink my notebooks with pictures to remember my lessons. I was in more and more need of this. Later on over the years when I was in college I got to a point that sometimes it was difficult to start parsing all into hand made scrabbles so I can remember stuff. As I enrolled for Software Engineering I thought that I needed to write code to just copy and paste the words, without having to draw many pictures representing lines and lines of text.Well the code never ever happened, I kept this with me for more than 11 years.It was not until about a year ago that I hired somebody to get this done. But I was given a lousy product. I spent about $500. So I started to look at the code my self and started to change it. I later notice that nothing of what I paid for I wasable to use. I kept on going and designing my application.What I have now?The application does a word by word changeinto an image. Most of words have an equivalent with a picture. The picture must have logic to what the word means. A simple example, ""apple"" should display a picture of an apple. But there are some other more complicated, for example the challenge of representing with an image the word ""hypocrite"". During this challenge I had downloaded many pictures and a lot of those had to be photoshopped. It's been a lot of work, even though that it seems simple.Well I got to a point that after many hours of work I was able to see the fruit of my desire that I had kept for years. But then I found a problem. The application was too slow and found myself trashing all PHP code and doing it again using JavaScript. It was like starting from zero again.Anyway now the application is working and not only that but also I built the google and iphone app version of it.But why am I here?Because I believe that this simple idea can be transformed even more.

Now is the time for me to step up and give back for all that I've watched over time.I want this restaurant to reflect as much of the local spirit as I can, be it through local products from local farms. vendors, properties. I want to bring back the community sense to our times.I want to set aside a portion of my time, money, and resources from this project to reinvest in the local community anyway I can that will benefit the ones that less than I.I've been unemployed, I've been homeless, I've been to the edge of despair and back. I want to make a difference in a unique way that I can using the talents I've discovered for over a quarter a century.","I am focusing specifically on turnkey restaurant opportunities only. Ones that are already open and successfully running, but for one reason or another the current owners wish to move on.I intend to take over an already running successful property, and slowly over time introduce my version until I reach my goal. All the while understand and respecting where that particular restaurant came from, what it's clientele is, moving towards achieving my dream. A friend once told me ""if you do it right the first time, you'll never have to do it again"". I've taken my time, I've explored the rewards and pitfalls. I've worked in restaurants that have failed, so I've witness firsthand what and what not to do. We learn from our mistakes, it's how we get better.",https://www.kickstarter.com/projects/1728037613/the-bourbon-room?ref=discovery_category_newest,1728037613/the-bourbon-room,"Spirits Bistro is several ideas under one roof, diversity and multiple revenue streams as its strength. The building itself is a historically registered two-story restaurant with a current 33 seat downstairs bar, and an 80 seat upstairs main dining room.One of the reasons I've enjoyed my time in hospitality is the diversity of the guests I've had the pleasure of serving and getting to know. As someone who lived in several states growing up as a kid, it is always enjoyable to meet people from all walks of life where we can share a conversation about familiar places and times.The unique opportunity this location offers lends its hand perfectly to my past, as well as the future. The great part about being in among four hotels is that the investor, no matter how small or large the contribution, is not limited by distance. You don't have to be from the area to reap the rewards. From anywhere in the world, there are many ways to take advantage of an investment in my dream. If you've ever been to the Portsmouth/Boston/Portland seacoast area in the past and thinking of a return; if you are contemplating a future visit in the future; or know anyone in the area that you think would appreciate a gift of your investment in the form of Gift Card, or permission to partake in your House Account, this would make a great unique opportunity.As for the equally unique property, there are multiple ways to explore the possibilities. The specific breakdown thinking is as follows:Spirits Bistro: The upstairs dining room will be fluid, with a New England influenced eclectic locally sourced menu, utilizing the New England craft spirits bar program. The Bourbon Room: Where Bourbon Street meets Bourbon County. A bourbon and craft spirits-centric bar with a lighter fare New Orleans Cajun/creole menu. I've a desire to return to my Crescent City Bistro days, and using New Orleans Dickie Brennan's Bourbon House as influence in the downstairs bar area.The Outdoor Deck:A cigar-centric dining and cocktail area. Again, feeding off a former restaurant, the Orchard Street Chop Shop, hosting a Thursday Night is ""For Cigar Lovers"". With 4 cigar dinners, one Thursday each in June, July, August, and September - bourbon, rum, scotch, and beer - and being able to utilize the deck outdoors for those same 4 months, as well as push as much we can in April, May and October utilizing whatever means.On the Go: Utilizing the menu with to-go potential. Also taking advantage of the 4 hotels within 2 blocks radius, two of which do not have actual restaurants, and another 2 being built as I type.Local: A local focused theme. utilizing the local distilleries, breweries, wineries, farms, products to host tastings, events, dinners, etc. With the resources available to us, you literally could host a weekly event of a large array of rotating subjects. Keeping in the public eye with new and creative ways is the best way of developing a reputation and following.  ","Familiarity: I've been working on this project in various forms for over 3 years now with 2 restaurants. I've developed 2 websites, www.thebourbonroomnh.com & www.spiritstastingroom.com, as well as corresponding Facebook pages, cultivating a small following ready to see this come to fruition.Location: Parking is always a battle in any of Portsmouth, but the location is smack in the middle of two parking garages 2 blocks in either direction, as well as within 2 blocks walking distance 4 hotels with in excess of 500 rooms to advertise to, not to mention the local residents and businesses.Experience: I've been dedicated to the hospitality business for 28 years. I've been working in and studying the Portsmouth area for 17 years. I've been studying and developing the Bourbon discipline for over 5 years now. I've managed a restaurant that specialized in this cuisine for over a year. My familiarity and comfort is unquestionable.Future: I see this is my version of retirement. I am not seeing this a means towards retirement. I've been working my entire career for this opportunity, and doing nothing but this for the rest of my life, as long as I can do it."

However the name of the Music Festival can be different.If money were no object the Las Vegas community would have had world class classical music events year around. The top notch performers and conductors would have been visiting the Sin City for other unearthly, out of body experiences. But then it wouldn't be called the Sin City. It would have a different nickname - Classical Hub or Musician's Paradise. Something more meaningful, long lasting, often cathartic experience.The goal of this proposal is to create something along those lines, which has never been done before in this town. This Entertainment Capital of the World has any and all kinds of amusements a human can think of but a First Class Classical Music Festival. The Festival which could include the richest examples of the different time periods, styles and genres. Each and every time the Festival could evolve and adjust to the always growing need for Classical Music experiences.And here's the best part of it. As a major donor (hopefully the sole donor) you, or your company, could put your name on the Festival. Think of it as you buying your own Classical Music Festival in the Entertainment Capital of the World. All of the eager audience members and the absolutely best in their field of expertise participants will be talking, spreading the word about your act of generosity. Classical Music almoste never brings profit and/or fame.

So if the funds will be secured by February 2016, we will have four months to organize everything and secure all the participants.",https://www.kickstarter.com/projects/828876848/cause-classical-music-festival?ref=discovery_category_newest,828876848/cause-classical-music-festival,"We would like to partner up with a CAUSE and create a celebration of arts through the music performances, which could be live streamed worldwide.In an ideal world the Las Vegas community could have a world class CLASSICAL MUSIC FESTIVAL, where top-notch performers and conductors could visit the Sin City for other unearthly, out of body experiences.This Musical creation could help expand the cultural attractiveness of the city and bring people's awareness about the wonderful work a charitable organization does.Here's how it would work:1. We would advertise our performances through our newly created Web Site as well as through other publications around the world.2. Tickets for the physical and virtual experiences of this concert series could be purchased through our website, virtual concert ticket holders would be able to watch the concert in real time online via streaming video from the comfort of their abode.3. The proceeds from the ticket sales will go to a CAUSE. There will be a choice of charities people could vote to support - the one charity with the most votes will receive the raised funds.Each year this CAUSE CLASSICAL MUSIC FESTIVAL will support a different charity.4. Once the upfront costs are secured we can proceed with the hiring of the musicians, scheduling the rehearsals, creating a program and a dedicated Web Site, advertising, renting a facility, etc. (please refer to the attached spreadsheet).The goal of this proposal is to create a physical and virtual fundraising concert that(to my knowledge)has never been done before in this city or anywhere else. It would be our honor and privilege to help raise awareness and funds for a CAUSE.This Entertainment Capital of the World has any and all kinds of amusements a human can think of but a First Class Classical Music Festival. Such a Festival would include the richest examples of the different time periods, styles and genres. Each and every time the Festival could evolve and adjust to the always growing need for Classical Music experiences.To help promote your values, raising funds for a charitable organization while performing many great musical compositions is a grand and priceless idea.With your help we can make it true! Classical Music almost never brings fame and/or fortune. We are in this field because through our performances we believe we can change people, enrich their emotional state and make their lives better in the long run.","I've never done a project on this scale before. However I've been a part of similar Festivals in the past and am aware of the possible challenges. My knowledge of the music scene, repertoire and, most importantly, my desire to raise awareness and bring funds to help the charities who help people in need can overcome any and all potential charities. As long as I'll raise money to start the project, nothing's impossible."
https://www.kickstarter.com/projects/chrissamples/find-fido-network?ref=discovery_category_newest,chrissamples/find-fido-network,"About 1.2 million dogs, and 5.4 million cats are struck and killed on US roadways every year. Of 7.6 million pets taken to US shelters annually about 2.7 million are ""put down"". One key reason these pets are ""put down"" is overcrowding of the shelters. That's over 9 million dogs and cats that are killed EVERY YEAR.The Find Fido Network will lower these numbers by creating a community that will reward drivers for recovering lost pets and returning them to their families. Our patent pending network will allow pet parents to put a reward directly on the collar of their cat or dog. Parents will manage their pet's profile in real time and even adjust the reward amount based on available Rescue Partners. They will be able to manually report their pet missing, or use a trigger sent by a ""smart collar"" automatically when the pet leaves the safe area set by the pet parent.Once the Find Fido Network has sent the message that the pet has run away, the available reward and approximate location of the animal will be forwarded as a ""ride fare"" to a network of freelance Rescue Partners who will compete to retrieve the animal on a first come, first paid basis.This system will create an environment where participating ""ride share"" freelancers can increase their earning potential by literally racing to save lost pets. The pets can be returned directly to the pet parents or a predetermined safe drop-off location (such as a pet shelter, humane society, or vet). This arrangement will not additionally strain the shelters but will, in fact, relieve some of the strain on them by guaranteeing the pets will be picked up in a timely manner since the pet owners will know to pick them up.Since our goal is to save as many four-legged lives as possible, our network will support the use of smart collar technology in order to facilitate the safe recovery of pets. In order to make the network available to as many users as possible, we will partner with various smart collar manufacturers that are currently available on the market during phase one of the Find Fido Network launch. When used in conjunction with our network these collars, which can alert the Pet Parent when their pet escapes, will also alert our rescue network and improve the likelihood of safe recovery.In order to truly create a comprehensive and streamlined solution, we will produce our own collars during the second phase of Find Fido Network launch. Our collar design will promote seamless compatibility with the network and will include features that we believe are currently missing from other providers’ products. During this phase we will also release improvements to network features tested during phase one.Pet Parents will manage their pets' profiles. Pet Parents will be able to update pets’ pictures, personality traits, tips to get the pet to respond, etc. Pet Parents will also be able to set rewards for safe recovery of lost pets and will be able to track rescue efforts in the event of escape.The second type of (human) user on our network will be the Rescue Partner. Rescue Partners will be like dog-catching bounty hunters. Our network will allow Pet Parents to set custom reward amounts directly to their pets' profiles so that Rescue Partners can be rewarded when they win the race to save the furry family members in their time of need. When smart collars are added to the equation, much of the guess work and valuable time is reduced. The Rescue Partner can simply go straight to the lost pets and retrieve them. Depending on the specific pet, and hints as to what they respond to best, this can make retrieving the animal almost as easy as picking up a human ride-share fare. The main difference is that saving a beloved pet's life can be much more rewarding.The third type of (human) user on our network is the administrator of the pick-up drop off location. Initially, these users will be existing services for lost/endangered pets (humane societies, shelters, participating vets and boarding facilities). These users will provide a safe place for the recovered pet to reunite with their human once they are available. Pet Parents will be automatically notified by our network before the pet even arrives. As the network grows, pet foster locations are planned to help support the pickup/drop off location user type. The Pet Parent will also have the option of negotiating a custom pickup location and time directly with a Rescue Partner.We have worked closely with a software development firm in Atlanta, GA to estimate the cost of design and development of the network. According to this estimate, to develop the project locally in the US would cost between $345,077 and $431,346. In order to make this project a reality, we will seek to use offshore software development for much of the effort, lowering the cost to an estimated $47,000 - 105,000.","1. Challenge: Ensuring that lost pet recoveries are made in the safest possible way.Solution:•	Our Rescue Partners will be vetted, trained, and submit to Find Fido location tracking during their participation on our network. This training will be updated as more data becomes available for best practices across the network.•	We will ensure that they know the safest and most effective techniques for retrieving lost cats and dogs and we will be able to see how their recoveries are being made using the GPS from both their mobile device and the animal’s collar. We do not recommend chasing lost and scared animals. It is better to establish a calm interaction and try to lure the animal once the Rescue Partner is in the area. If the animal is chased by the Rescue Partner, we will be able to tell from the Find Fido data.•	Rescue Partners who do not follow the recommended procedures may be removed from the network. Each Rescue Partner will also be subject to reviews and ratings of their performance by both pet parents and the Find Fido team.2. Challenge: Competing with existing lost pet solutions.Solutions:•	We are trying to reach as many families with our network as possible. We would rather partner with existing hardware and network solutions than compete. We do plan to develop our own in-house tracking collars, but our main goal is to establish the overall network solution, make it compatible with every willing hardware solution on the market, and save as many lost pets as possible.•	Our network platform is patent pending. Every aspect of the network hardware, method of machine-to-machine communication, rating and review, and the overall flow of the network that solves this problem is covered in our intellectual claims filed with the US Patent Office. 3. Challenge: Ensuring that each individual dog and cat’s personality is considered when the Rescue Partner is attempting recovery.Solution:•	Pet Parents will be able to create individual Pet Profiles. The profiles will include pictures of the animal, preferences, nicknames, favorite treats, whether they like other dogs/cats, any history of aggression, and signs that the animal is happy, nervous, or scared.•	A history of past recovery efforts will also be available, as provided by Rescue Partners. This feature aims to provide more insight on the habits of the pet while they are lost, as well as previously spotted locations. 	4. Challenge: As a paid service, competing with free services and groups that assist in the recovery of lost pets.Solution:•	Many free services only provide a platform to advertise lost and found pets. We intend to provide a service that will facilitate the proactive rescue efforts for lost pets.•	Some services that are free earn revenues by selling customers’ personal data. We believe that personal data should remain private and do not want to exploit Pet Parents during a time of need when they are worried about their fury friend’s lives. The fees we charge will keep customer information private.•	We want to partner with as many existing communities as possible to increase awareness of lost/found pets.5. Challenge: Pet parent profiles contain sensitive information, such as name and home address where the pet may be returned. Pet profiles contain details about the pet and list a monetary reward for safe recovery. Safety and privacy may be a concern.Solution:•	Sharing pet parent’s information is elective. Find Fido does not recommend sharing your home address, so we have designed the network to allow for third party drop-off locations. If a drop-off location is not available (outside of business hours), or based on the pet parent’s preference, Find Fido recommends meeting in a monitored public location (such as a police station) rather than revealing your personal address.•	Pet profiles are completely private until the pet is lost. If/when the pet is determined to be lost, the relevant information will be shared only with registered/vetted users (rescue partners) in order to give the network of users the best chance to safely recover the pet. Once the pet is recovered, the information will become private again. 6. Challenge: Keeping the Find Fido network scam free.Solution: The Find Fido network design makes it very difficult to scam Pet Parents for reward money or to market anything to them by taking the following precautions:•	The reward amount and pet location are only made visible when the pet has left their designate safe area.•	Only approved Rescue Partners are given this information unless the Pet Parent expressly chooses to share the information with more people. Risks to sharing this information are automatically made clear to the Pet Parent.•	The reward is automatically transferred to the Rescue Partner once the pet has been verified as returned to a drop off location approved either by the Pet Parent or the Find Fido network.

This aircraft was used for counter espionage in it's early days and last used by NASA as a Meteorologic platform studying weather around the world. The aircraft will be paint back to the original B-57 Bomber color scheme; midnight gloss black with US Air Force gold lettering. It will be housed inside of the Museum, safeguarded and protected from the outside elements. Please help us restore this awesome piece of history for future generations and in memory of the men who flew her. Thank you, Rob Burroughs","The biggest challenge has been for the Museum to take possession of this aircraft. We now own the Canberra and the challenges now are: preparing the final building foundation and structure to house this aircraft.  The Canberra weighs 26 thousand pounds and is 65 feet long by 65 feet wide.  We will need to remove both Rolls Royce engines, remove both wings at the fuselage and transport the aircraft components from the airfield to its final resting place in the Museum, then reassembled and painted in place.  This portion of the Museum will  be built around the Canberra after the restoration process has been completed. We have engineers and qualified technicians prepared to under take this endeavor, but it will be costly.  There are very few Canberra B-57's left in the continental US.  So this is a once in a life opportunity to save this 63 year old awesome piece of history.  If we don't receive the funds we are asking for at this time, the project will be extremely expensive in the future, because our project engineers are older than the aircraft and they possess the knowledge and skill to perform these duties.  With out this funding the project will take many more years to complete. The total risk would be to let the aircraft decay beyond salvage and for this historical aircraft to be lost forever.  This aircraft is being placed inside of the Museums Building kick start project."

It was only last year when I realized that there is an absolute need for control over finding people who have drones, to do work for those who need a drone. Furthermore; for those that need a drone, but don't understand them or know how they operate.* Think of it as The UBER for finding a drone when you need something done for you, but your in a different place or different part of the world.Who needs thisYour a Real Estate Agent, you are beginning to see that a drone aerial shot can make or break a potential sale. Yet, you have no idea how to operate one, which one to buy nor the time to figure it all out.Your a car buyer from another city or country and you want to make sure the car is really where it is suppose to be.There are endless reasons to have a Droner fly over a place for you, and even more reasons why you can't do it yourself.All of our log on maps are client real time and very much interactive. You will select and area, find a Droner online to work. Then enter your information on where you need the work done. Instantly the Droner will respond with a price. If you accept, they will perform the work in a timely matter that day. Most of the jobs will charge $100 or less. Far cheaper than buying a drone, taking your time away to find and figure one out.Your funding will allow for the final implementation stage to make Drones Eye a realty for the world to use. Drones are new to the world, the need to make it simpler for us to use is as old as it gets. Now with your help, it is a matter of clicking on an easy to navigate App, clicking your needs; and you receive the live video you were looking for. It really will be that simple.

Now, you had a choice and a place to actually get a better deal and select the options you wanted..Why cant this kind of instant shopping around happen with a ride-share app.Excuse me, it just did with this app.So here is how we have designed the app. Imagine, your downtown and you know you can't drive, or just trying to get home from work.

Every ride share company that has a driver near you. Every taxi and Limo driver that is logged onto the system and working, will show up on your screen. Yes, for real. Not only that, there info, pic and the price they have agreed to you will show as well.You can see everything so you can make a faster and smarter choice. Heck, now you won't need to wait because you will have the power of knowledge and will know where every ride share driver is within 2 kilometers of you.This had never been done before and it came to me while i was trying order an Uber and was late for an appointment. There were no Uber drivers around me. I could see the guy parked in front of where I was standing was a rideshare driver. I asked him who he rode for. He said LYFT, but I didnt have that app. So I waited for something to pop up. No more, be a part of changing rideshare forever.Your funding will be used for final development of the app and time needed to bring it to the general public.Please believe that I have the experience in business and expertise in business development to make this a realty.",Rideshare was not a common way to travel just 5 years ago. For the most part it has only become popular in major cities because of mass advertising. With it has come its problems and how cities are to deal with them. It is the Taxi companies who end up taking the biggest hit. With the YallRide app it all becomes open source for all. Even taxi drivers now have their fair shot at the fares.

I have been working with a product design firm to make this project a reality. I am committed to realizing this vision.I have a set of three tools I am seeking to have prototyped, The working name for my set of products is Focused Fox. These tools are wearables, which support elementary-aged students with special needs. The special needs issues include, ADHD, Autism, Oppositional Defiant Disorder, Learning Disabilities and other disabilities, as well.The first one is an ear piece that delivers auditory cues, the second one is a wrist piece that delivers both tactile cues and visual cues, and the third one is a table piece that delivers both visual cues and auditory cues. The table piece has additional capabilities, as well. It has a desk top with icons: visual cues, ADHD goals, general goals, social skills training, non-verbal cues training, affirmations, encouragement, self-monitoring, research and parent resources.There is an app to accompany Focused Fox that can be downloaded by the parent or educator in order to manipulate the table piece; mom, dad or the educator can turn the table piece on from the app. If the parent knows the class will be doing math from 2:00-2:30, the parent can turn on the table piece from his or her phone and manipulate it to set specific goals for their son or daughter.The educator could have a set of my tools, Focused Fox, in their classroom to support special needs students. Several students could be helped concurrently through utilizing these 3 tools. My products, once prototyped, are something concrete that could be employed in the classroom to aid students with special needs.I am personally excited about having these products prototyped, because there is nothing like them on the market. They are unique and they have the potential to become extremely popular. I know in my heart that students would benefit from Focused Fox. I have had very positive feedback from parents and educators, which has encouraged me to continue moving forward with this project. Just this morning I had a message on Facebook from a parent who indicated she would love to have a set of these tools for her son, who has Asperger's.","I am seeking funding specifically to have my concepts prototyped. I want to be clear that the funds I am seeking are to be directly applied to the prototyping of my products. I have sketches and detailed plans of my ideas, now, I need to have the prototypes fabricated. The firm I have been in contact with has given me estimates on the costs of manufacturing prototypes. It could be that the estimates do not actually cover the costs of prototyping. If this is the case, I will find ways to cut costs, such as selecting more affordable materials, or fewer features on the products.

Die smartwatch oder das Fitnessband wird mit einem Sensor ausgestattet. Auch aktive smartcards, Kugelschreiber oder andere gadgets kommen in Frage. Diese Sensoren senden jeden einzelnen Strahlen-Impuls über Bluetooth an das Smartphone des Trägers. Die Sievimet-App des Smartphones sammelt diese Impulse in Intervallen von Minuten - Stunden - Tagen - Monaten und Jahren. Sie berechnet den resultierenden Sievertwert, um die aufgenommene Dosis der Träger-Person anzuzeigen. So kann die Person beobachten und steuern, wie viel Sievert er/sie im Laufe der Zeit aufgenommen hat. Ganz ähnlich wie die Schritte, die die Fitness-App ohnehin schon zeigt. Wenn die Person feststellt, dass sie bisher nicht genügend Strahlung erhalten hat, kann sie durch Ortswechsel - z.B. in die Alpen, die Rockies, nach Tibet oder auf einem Flug, beim Skilaufen usw. - nach intensiver Strahlung suchen. Oder die Person kann sich in eines der Strahlungsbäder begeben, z. B. nach Bad Gastein, Österreich. Eine zu hohe Exposition ist in Europa und den meisten Ländern der Welt sehr unwahrscheinlich. Doch auch dann würde die App warnen: ""Du hast nun genug Sievert - geh woanders hin"".Experten sagen, dass wir in Deutschland überall zu wenig Strahlung haben. Hier liegt der Wert typischerweise weit unter dem optimalen Wert von etwa 100 mSv pro Jahr. Auch dieser Wert ist nicht generell als der beste bestätigt. Wir brauchen aber genügend Strahlung, damit unsere Zellen sich besser regenerieren. Darum ist es so wichtig, dass jede und jeder selbst seine Exposition kontrolliert. Damit können Ärzte und Versicherer zu einem echten Überblick kommen und Empfehlungen aussprechen.In diesem Projekt sind die wichtigen Phasen wie folgt:1. Finden eines kleinen Sensors zum Einbau in fitnessbänder, smartwatches, Stifte oder dergleichen2. Entwicklung der Applikation. Sie ist nicht kompliziert. Spezifikationen liegen schon vor - siehe http://sievimet.jomi1.com3. das Marketing, vor allem bei den Herstellern , den Krankenkassen und beim jungen PublikumFolgend eine Kurzfassung in Englisch - here a short resume in English, full English is at http://sievimet.jomi1.comSievimet will be an app, that shows the individual exposure to nuclear radioactivity of the bearer. The fitness band or watch must be equipped with a sensor that transmits every single becquerel impulse to the smartphone via bluetooth. The smartphone app accumulates those impulses in intervals of minutes - hours - days - months, and year. It calculates the resulting Sievert in order to show the exposure of the individual bearing the sensor. so the bearer can watch and control the amount of Sievert which she/he is exposed to over time. When the person finds, there is not enough radiation received hitherto, she/he can seek intensive radiation by change of location - e.g. in the Alps on a flight, sking etc. Or the person can go to one of the radiation baths e. g. Bad Gastein, Austria. The other case, having too much exposure is very unlikely in Europe and most countries of the world. In Germany typically the level is way below the optimal level of about 100 mSv per year. ","The main  challenge  is to find sufficient buyers for the app. Marketing is a key issue. Probably health insurers should be very interested in the app, because the optimal exposure will keep people in better health. And today the optimum is rarely reached in most countries. With attractive pricing, many digital natives and young aficionados will love the app. It is just one more parameter in the health data suite.Another challenge will be to find the best sensor, small enough to fit into the smart watch or fitness band. Currently the smallest sensors are in pen size dosimeters marketed by various vendors in the internet. We have to find out who provides such. The we will cooperate with them to refine the sensors to the needs of the watch and fitness tape manufacturers - and with our app."

Many people are put off flying at this first hurdle.But the daft thing is - flight simulators these days have become so realistic, both in the physical flight characteristics and the scenery in which we fly that all commercial companies and a few Gliding and general aviation clubs now use them as part of a pilots training program - both basic and advanced. Today, we can teach someone how to fly before they ever get their feet off the ground - but the even dafter thing is, we STILL build our simulators with non-disabled people in mind. We still put people through purgatory just to get into the simulator when there is absolutely no need.So what if we could make it easier for people with physical impairments to get into and out of a simulator? What if we could improve the in-flight communication with deaf pupils? What if we could teach people the basics of flight without the hassle of getting in and out of the aircraft? How many more people could be encouraged to take up the sport for real and enrich their lives in a way that so far seems to many to be out of reach?Immersive technology has come on in leaps and bounds in the last two years - to the point where an entire 3D cockpit can be projected onto the screens and “ wrapped around” the pupil pilots.The pupil will step into a 3 mtr x 2 mtr box and be immediately transported to any place in the world. Using photo realistic scenery, they will fly high above the hills of the stunning Peak District National Park, or soar up the north face of the mighty EigerThe innovation challenge is to take the technology, and fit it all into a transportable enclosure that permits rapid and safe wheelchair access, relay pictorial instruction to deaf people during flight whilst at the same time allowing the pupil to handle the physical joystick that controls an aircraft in flight.Once completed, we will be able to take the simulator to Support Groups, Schools, Colleges, Open Days, Gliding and other General Aviation Clubs who specialise in Disabled Flying etc at minimal cost .In fact - the running costs for the first 12 months are built into our KickStarter Project. We aim to make the simulator free at the point of delivery except for transportation costs.We will be taking the experience to the people rather than expecting the people to come to the experience.All of the research and development processes (including the trials and tribulations) will be documented and made available to disability support groups worldwide.STRETCH GOALIf we are fortunate enough to be oversubscribed, we intend to develop a full 180º wrap around PC Monitor. One of the problems with standard PC monitors is that the bezel's get in the way and spoil the realism. This is why all the high end simulators use either front or rear projectors with images seamlessly stitched together. We believe that a close proximity 180º wrap around bezel-less monitor will be of great value to the 1000's of home-use flight simmers worldwide","The challenges are mainly engineering rather than technological but we will be working closely with another company well experienced in building sim controls to produce a set of controls that can be folded flat to allow straight-in wheelchair access from the back of the trailer. Once the wheelchair is in place, the controls are then raised to their operating position and locked in place.The trailer will be custom built to house all the controls, projectors, wheelchairs and one or two spectators.",https://www.kickstarter.com/projects/223108387/the-remembering?ref=discovery_category_newest,223108387/the-remembering,"Back in 2006, I choreographed ""And You and I"" to fireworks for a competition in Esher, UK. I came third!! The light and sound crews all said I should have won but my choice of music wasn't ""family friendly"" At the time I thought - ""well the answer is simple, gather an audience that has the same musical tastes as me and create an event for aficionados""The recent sad news of the passing of Chris Squire reminded me - 9 years on - that this was still an unfulfilled dream. Time to make it happen.The Remembering is just that .... A gathering of the clans if you will... A time to reminisce of the great nights we've all enjoyed with the band, to chew the fat, recall our fondest memories and then to sit back and watch the most amazing Son et Lumiere choreographed to our favourite YES tracks.It would be nice to think we could turn it into an annual RitualSo just close your eyes, play your favourite YES tracks in your head - imagine the famous Roger Dean images being projected onto the facade of a stately home or castle or a stunning water screen 100 metres wide - complimented with the most amazing laser/light show and stunningly awesome pyrotechnics.... Can you see it in your minds eye. You've got it right there ... this will be The Remembering.The Musical programmeThe programme is not yet set in stone but I am currently leaning towards ""And You And I"", ""Close To The Edge"" followed by ""Gates Of Delerium"" incorporating ""Soon The Light"" and if we are over-subscribed, the encore will be ""Roundabout"" (well good pyro is very expensive) - but if you subscribe to my project, you can influence the final lineup - just let me know your favourite tracks.Throughout the day (gates open at 3:00pm) In the Relaxation Marquees. **Definite**Themed Marquees featuring music and videos of top bands from the era, Pink Floyd, Led Zeppelin (specially for Carolyne), Genesis and more. **TBC**An exhibition of Roger Dean original artwork provided by our friends from Trading Boundaries6:30 - 7:00 Steve Carver Global Stars aerobatics display7:00 - 8:15 ** Definite **Support Acts onMainStage8:30 - 9:30 Main Band Performance **Band to be announced**9:45 - 10:45 The main event.

They are one of the UK's leading Fireworks display companies specialising in Pyro-Musicals. They have won many coveted awards both in the UK and abroad including the British Fireworks Championships and the British Musical Fireworks Championships. They also design and manufacture ""Fire-By-Wire"" a superb computerised firing system essential for accurate synchronisation of fireworks to music. Great to have them on board.Me. See my biog. I am the dreamer - the visualiser. The glue that sticks it all together.","Copyright and LicensingThe rules regarding public performance of recorded works and the licensing thereof are well known and we don't foresee any problems there. The use of Roger Dean's iconic imagery will have to be negotiated but the contingency plan is that we will have to create our own event imagery.The event management team are used to organising live outdoor events and the venue we have chosen is already licensed for large outdoor concerts and events. In the UK, we have a very short window of opportunity for an event such as this. The inclusion of Pyrotechnics means the event has to be finished by 11:00pm at the latest and have the best possible chance of good dry warm weather - so August 13th or 20th it is.This popular venue gets booked up very quickly. So we are in a hurry - hence the 30 day window for the Kickstarter project. Don't leave it until the last minute - tell all your friends as soon as possible."

Born and raised in Prichard, Alabama, when I was little, I watched my mother prepare meals for me and my siblings. Sometimes I’d sit in my room and imagine myself in the kitchen of my own restaurant, cooking for a lot of people. The food was dishes I mimic after my mother. Everybody loved my mother’s cooking. The restaurant would be smoky, but everyone was eating everything on their plates. Some of the more affluent men would smoke fat cigars and have big full bellies. And outside on the front patio, petite sophisticated ladies would sit outside sipping sophisticated cocktails. I told my mother about my imaginary restaurant and one day, she allowed me to help her with dinner. She gave me potatoes to peel but scolded me because I was cutting to much of the meat of the potato. Today, I am very careful about how much peel I take off as a result. She let me mix the ingredients for the potato salad. My mother told everyone that I’d made it; some ate it, and some added seasoning, which I’d forgot to add. Although that mishap occurred, the one thing I realized was that food has to taste good. Today, my goal is wow and surprise our customers palates by introducing them to some of my family dishes, as well as my own creations. Over the years my culinary skills and techniques have perfected.In 2015, I began my journey to Lovers of the Leaf Restaurant & Cigar Lounge. I visited the Dominican Republic, Nicaragua, and Cuba because I wanted to learn more about cigars because having a cigar lounge attached to the restaurant for those who wanted to indulge in their favorite cigar, would have a place to relax. I worked 7 years in the restaurant business as co-manager at my brother’s Cajun-style cuisine restaurant. It was a successful business; however, his wife had a very difficult pregnancy and he had to close; and I moved away and joined the U.S. Army.At Lovers of the Leaf’s Restaurant, our menu will change every three months; as well as when lessons, and new techniques are learned. Learning in the restaurant business is an on-going process, and my thirst for knowledge in the industry grows each time I cross the threshold into my building.The idea that food is a community event that brings people together, is a concept I’ve lived my entire house. My mother prepared Thanksgiving and Christmas dinner, and the entire neighborhood would stop by for a plate. That’s what we, my team and I, want to bring to my community here in Stafford, Virginia; a sense of family; of community.The BeginningOur food will be topics of conversations. It will be bold, complex, southern, trendy, fresh, and unlike anything our customers have experienced. There will be several dishes our customers can only get at Lovers of the Leaf; like our vegetarian green eggs, The Owner’s Specialty “The Crabbur,” our fried jalapeno deviled eggs, duck fries, jerk duck wings, chicken & waffles, and many more items.Staying true to the community, I want the environment and food we serve our customers to make our customers feel relaxed, like they’re at home.The restaurant will also feature a bar and bar menu that will include staples like chicken wings, stuffed baked potatoes, fish tacos, and more. Our bartenders come with trendy talents and delicious crafted cocktails. Financially, the bar will likely be our biggest revenue source, and the place where people will want to gather with friends. The customers in the adjoining cigar lounge will have the opportunity to order from the restaurant and the bar. There will be a special menu for our aficionados that will include a cheese tray, roasted duck, pork belly skewers, and more.The restaurant atmosphere is painted in neutral colors for a calming more relaxed atmosphere; and the cigar lounge will also be decorated in earth tones.We will be open for lunch and dinner, and serve brunch on Sundays, at the request of the Stafford County Economic Development Interim Director. Our restaurant and lounge will raise the standards and be the place where people want to work. As a veteran, our goal is to have an inclusive workplace, and will employ both veterans and non-veterans.Lovers of the Leaf Restaurant & Cigar Lounge is located in Celebrate Virginia North Shopping Center in Stafford, VA, and minutes from Fredericksburg, VA. The total space is a combined 6100sq ft., the cigar lounge is 2100sq ft, and the restaurant is 4000sq ft. The restaurant will seat 100, and the cigar lounge 60. We will have at least 24 seats outside on our front patio for restaurant guests, and approximately 12 seats on the side of the cigar lounge for our cigar customers.Why We Need The MoneyThe fact of the matter is, we cannot bring this to fruition without raising more money. As the owner and committed to this project, I’ve invested $80,000 from my 401k to begin the construction process.I was blessed to find a fully equipped restaurant, requiring minimal equipment. Because the previous renters left the restaurant in shambles, we’re redesigning the dining area, and building out the adjoining cigar lounge. The cigar lounge requires a state-of-the-art smoke filtration system to ensure our cigar aficionados aren’t disturbed by a smoke-filled room. Having this system will ensure repeat customers. We also need to purchase three POS systems, stock the bar, and walk-in humidor with some of the best cigar brands on the market and pay for the remainder of the construction. We’re still in need of a few more leather chairs for the cigar lounge and want to replace the tables in the dining area of the restaurant. For us to open our doors, we need to pay our staff of 11, purchase a food inventory, and marketing materials.Every business that opens its doors needs to have a buffer of operating costs for at least three months in reserve. This will give us a chance to check and gauge our rhythm for cost reduction. Without a buffer of capital, we will be at the mercy of any unexpected instance.This is Where We Need You KickstarterWe need to raise as much as we possibly can, and with help from you, the Backers, we can move forward and closer to finishing construction and opening Lovers of the Leaf Restaurant & Cigar Lounge.Our goal is to make Lovers of the Leaf Restaurant & Cigar Lounge a permanent fixture in the community with scalability to build in other communities. Our customers are families, singles, couples, tourists, business men and women alike.","Potential Risks and ChallengesIt’s known that the restaurant business is dangerous, hard, and risky. One of the biggest obstacles we’ve overcome was securing county permits our first time around. We’re so very proud of that. Although there are some great restaurants in the surrounding area, the concept of Lovers of the Leaf Restaurant & Cigar Lounge is the first of its kind, and our menu is uniquely different. Our forthcoming restaurant is already being discussed on community web blogs, and social media. One of our biggest challenges will be to maintain efficiency of our systems without sacrificing our quality."

The mechanism of the moving parts and other items are customized CNC parts and laser cut steel.Most of the parts (about 95%) are 100% made customized to meet the functionality of the Dynamics 3D printer and it is not buy off-the-shelf parts or 3D printed parts which make this printer extremely robust, unique and also costly to manufacture, but with your massive support, we can made it happen and only at kickstarter.com, we can achieve this prices for you.Dynamics 3D printer consisted an approximately of 580 parts (Including Screws and Nuts)And it is Fully Assembled, Calibrated and Tested for you.The 3D printed objects below are contributed by individual.","To make a 3D printer that utilize every aspect of the advantages and shrink it smaller yet retain a huge print volume and enhanced performance is extremely challenging. This challenges are overcome by countless hours of careful planning and design before rigging up the first prototype by using acrylic sheets.When the initial few concepts is working, we move on to fabricating the metal body and CNC parts. At this stage on June 2016, it is only the 9th prototype machine out of the 19th prototype(Final prototype as seen in this page) that we had made altogether.Every space must be utilized hence all parts are CNC customized and Laser cut that made this 3D printer very unique with it own signature functionally and design.A machine with approximately 580 parts to assembled, calibrated and tested for you is time consuming but we are confidence and with our knowledge and experience in manufacturing processes we will be able to navigate around the obstacles. Beside this, while designing Dynamics 3D printer, we have take into consideration of how the assembly process will be and most of the parts are snap on and screw on, thus it will be quick and an efficient process.We will keep our backers updated and inform any issues we encounter or good progress as we more forward."

After the creator, Angelo Piccinini, immigrated from Italy in the 1940’s he went into the food service business with an eye on one day owning an Italian restaurant. Years later he had created many well known restaurants in San Francisco and Palo Alto California.The flavors from this recipe are one in a million. The profile is so complex and includes zesty lemon, fresh parsley, extra virgin olive oil, with a touch of hot pepper on the finish. I would compare its intricacy to an aged FrenchBordeaux. The passion forfood motivated Angelo to perfect the dressings that customers stop by the restaurant just to get it. The dressing continued to evolve into what is now served to Stanford Professors and techies of Silicon Valley.The health aspect of the recipe comes from the extra virgin cold press olive oil as the base. This kind of oil is one of the best mono-unsaturated fats to have in a diet. After the taste has gone the after effects of fueling the bodies metabolism last far into the day. It makes salads a desirable course again!","The scaleability of a food production company is a tough part of the business. Entering into the bottled dressing market has massive barriers to entry. One of which is the state certified production line process that most products go through. This level of production offers many benefits for customers as quality control is conducted at many stages in production. First and foremost Osteria LLC has its customers safety and satisfaction at the forefront of its mission. That is why the first step for us is to integrate and guarantee the quality control sampling and object detection scanners into the initial small batch production. The expansion stages for the company involve first small batch production, then temporary local production outsourcing which leads to the owning and operation of the production line mentioned above. With support from people like you our first stage can be accomplished leading strong momentum for the future to come.",https://www.kickstarter.com/projects/350497593/trueat-animated-nutrition-education?ref=discovery_category_newest,350497593/trueat-animated-nutrition-education,"The subject of nutrition is in need of some help.

The animation will be used as a tool to show people why nutrition is important and then to direct anyone who wants to live a better life to our app truEat.Our app has redesigned the nutrition system away from counting calories towards acquiring nutrients. TruEat simplifies nutrition and we want this tool in as many peoples hands as possible because we know it will make happier people. The system is designed to create an environment of abundance in the body which has the effect of removing the feeling of hunger and promotes a general feeling of well being.Our vision for the future only lets people get to their passion if that is a sporting activity or a mentally demanding activity, the biochemistry of the body is as important in both.

It’s a strange little system we find ourselves in with them.  Many, many people around the world are hoarders of books, but I want to help you realize that the hoarding of books is the unnecessary hoarding of resources.  In a time that we have notes at the bottom of emails requesting that the recipient consider the environment before printing the email, why are so many of us using books like they are single use, almost disposable items?We are in an age of increased and evolving awareness of environmental impacts of our actions, and we are making day to day decisions based on things like sustainability, so why have we not considered our use of books in this way?  We can do better.You hear about a great book that you want to read, your excited, your curious, you just want to get it as soon as you can and get to reading it.You would go down to the local book shop to get it but they’re a bit expensive and don’t really have the best range, so may not have this particular book, and besides, book shops are the way of the past.So you go online.  You hit your preferred website, find the book, go to the checkout, and then wait.  You will probably get an email soon saying that your book has been shipped, but sometimes this email takes quite a while to arrive because they have to actually manufacture the book, but sooner or later your email comes telling you when to expect the book, and sure enough your brand new book will be delivered.Full of excitement, you read the newly delivered book, then once its done you simply, habitually, well almost ritualistically add the book to your collection on your bookshelf.  There it stays.What if instead of hiding these books away in private never (or extremely rarely) to be read again, you opened your book shelf up for the world to browse, and even purchase from?  Wouldn’t you prefer to receive a small amount of cash back for your book and move it on for someone else to enjoy, saving the need for another copy of the book to be manufactured?  I know I would.What about your search for your next book?  Log on to sharedbookshelf.com, punch the name of your next book into the search bar, and see the many copies of the book that are sitting redundant in personal collections just waiting to be appreciated all over again.  Look through the list, find the best priced copy, find the one nearest you, and just buy it.  Its that simple.What more incentive do you need to use this brilliantly simple system?Design and development of website - $70,000Equipment - $3,000Marketing - $15,000Fees and tax - $18,722TOTAL FUNDING GOAL - $106,722Stretch goalAdditional website enhancements - $20,000Additional marketing investments, which will build the sharedbookshelf.com community at an increased rate, by building the database of books faster, ensuring that transaction and membership fee revenue provides sharedbookshelf.com with long term security - $60,000TOTAL STRETCH GOAL - $186,722sharedbookshelf.com Purpose:To facilitate the connection of a community of people that enjoy reading books, and are interested in the low cost exchange of books between readers, allowing each book to be used by many different readers, rather than being single use items.  Rationale:In many cases, books are purchased for personal use, they are read once, then stored on a bookshelf indefinitely, often to never be read again.  With the sharedbookshelf.com model, the hoarding of books is recognised as a hoarding of resources.In an age of increased focus on recycling, sustainable resources, and considering the environment before printing emails, one method of reducing our burden on the environment that has not been considered is the amount of books getting printed on a constant basis. By opening up your personal book shelves to be published at sheredbookshelf.com, people can search for specific books through the many registered book shelves, and purchase your near new book for a fraction of the price of ordering a new book, and without the need to consume the resources to print more new books.Pricing:Users set their own prices for each book in their shelf, but they are encouraged to keep their prices low. Prices are kept low to differentiate sharedbookshelf.com from regular used book sales, and to encourage people to use the site.Low prices are no loss to sellers, because the majority of the users will own a collection of books, and in this collection is the equity that becomes their currency to buy are sell books on sharedbookshelf.com.Sell low, buy low, equates to no loss.Postage charges are paid by the purchaser.  All book shelves have a location listed next to them (region or city).  When a user is searching for a particular book, they will see a list of each of the bookshelves that contain their searched book, and they can then purchase the one closest to them to keep the postage costs down.sharedbookshelf.comRevenue generation:sharedbookshelf.com charges a fee to the purchaser on every transaction, either a set percentage of the sale price, or a flat per transaction rate.  TBC.To avoid the transaction fee, repeat users will take up the option to join sharedbookshelf.com as a member for a monthly fee.Despite the evolution of technologies such as e-books and audiobooks, Australian and global book sales remain strong, and even increasing in some areas.  The intention is to develop a loyal community of users who want to share books in this way, and therefore gain subscribed members  as most of our users, making the membership fees the primary revenue stream.Marketing:There are a couple of different angles that sharedbookshelf.com could be marketed from.1.	Sustainability.  We live in a time of ever increasing focus on the sustainable use of resources, and environment conscious decisions in many aspects of life.  It is a very common occurrence to see a note at the bottom of emails that requests the recipient to consider the environment before printing the email.  It therefore makes sense to consider the fact that so many books around the world are only ever read once then stored indefinitely on a shelf somewhere.  sharedbookshelf.com could be marketed toward the environment conscious readers that want to read all the latest and greatest books, but do not want a copy of it to be manufactured just for them to read once.  2.	Cost effectiveness.  For the many people around the world that have been consuming books in the regular manner (buy, read once, then store on a bookshelf), they will have quite a supply of books in their home.  By opening up their own book shelf to be published on sharedbookshelf.com, the book collections will be the equity that will allow users to buy and sell on sharedbookshelf.com with very minimal financial burden.  Sellers are encouraged to keep prices low to attract more readers into the sharedbookshelf.com community, which increases the number and variety of books available, meaning shareedbookshelf.com users should be able to find any book they need on a bookshelf within the sharedbookshelf.com community. How to use sharedbookshelf.com:Sellers:1.	Go to the sharedbookshelf.com website.2.	Register to “Publish your bookshelf”.

Go to the sharedbookshelf.com website.2.	Search for the particular book that you want.3.	A list of all the book shelves that include your searched book will appear, which you can browse for the best priced book as well as the one that is on the shelf closest to you, to keep postage costs low.4.	If you are not a registered sharedbookshelf.com user, you can make the purchase as a visitor.5.	Make the payment to sharedbookshelf.com for the sale price, transaction fee, and postage.6.	You will receive an email from sharedbookshelf.com to say that the seller has been paid and instructed to post the book.7.	Repeat users may also recognize after a few searches that there are particular book shelves that share their interests and tastes in books, and in this case users are also able to search for a particular bookshelf rather than a book, then browse the bookshelf itself.8.	Once a user realizes sharedbookshelf.com has every book that they search for, and at the equivalent cost of postage only (considering that they keep selling their books back out, rather than hoarding their purchases), they will join as a member for a monthly fee, which eliminates the transaction fee.  ","The challenge in the sharedbookshelf.com model is engaging enough of the right people initially to build the database of books that will bring people to our website.When we have a lot of users who have registered their own bookshelves, and we have a large database of books for people to search from, a lot of people will come to us to find their books.But until we build up this initial base of registered bookshelves, people don't really have a reason to come to our site.In the beginning we will need the people more than they need us, but as time goes on and our data base builds, people will be attracted to us for our massive selection of available books, and while they are on our site they will want to be a part of it, and publish their own bookshelf too.I get the impression from a lot of people that I have spoken to, that people will like the concept of sharedbookshelf.com, and will therefore be willing to be early adopters of it, but it will be a matter of getting the brand, and the idea behind it out into the public view, and for the right people to see.Significant strategic planning will go into the early marketing of the website, and it will be focused on areas of the population that will be likely to want to spread the word and be able to influence others to join.Once we build our database of books to a certain size, the users themselves will be one of our most powerful marketing tools, which again emphasizes the importance of getting the marketing right early.",https://www.kickstarter.com/projects/1988737654/share-your-car-let-it-make-you-money-and-save-othe?ref=discovery_category_newest,1988737654/share-your-car-let-it-make-you-money-and-save-othe,"A few months ago I decided to treat myself to a new car.It was the first time I had allowed myself a new one for quite a while, so I went into the bank, got the loan, and now I have an awesome new car (and not so awesome new debt).I love the car, its great, but a few months in, the loan repayments are killing me.So who wants to share my new car with me, and pass a few dollars my way in return to help with the payments?  I initially thought this to myself in an unrealistic, kind of silly way. But when I thought about it more, I realized that it is not silly at all, in fact it makes a lot of sense.Like the majority of car owners, I don’t use my car all the time.  It sits in my driveway all night, then I get up and drive it to work, where it then sits in the carpark for 8 or 9 hours, then back home, and repeat 5 days a week.I usually use it a lot more on weekends, but when I go on holidays for weeks at a time, that’s another story, it sits there doing nothing the whole time – and costing me money in repayments.With the majority of people in the same situation with their car, and different variations of times that cars are and are not being used by their owners, there are millions of unused cars just sitting dormant all around the world, waiting for their owners to realize they can share theirs cars, and provide real benefit to both the sharer and the sharee. We will provide a platform for people to register their vehicles on the Car Sharing Platform, which they can then easily log onto at any time to update the status of their car as “available”.On the opposite side of the deal, people who do not own a car at all, or may not be in their home city and therefore in need of a car, can simply search for available cars close to their current location, and quickly and easily find one that suits them.Criteria that may influence the decisions people will make when choosing a car include the location of the car relevant to where the person needs it, they types of cars that are in the area, the price category of the cars in the area, the length of the period of time that particular cars are listed as available for, and any other special requirements that they may have such as automatic transmission and a child seat.Cars will be listed in three categories, which will be broadly defined by the car type, and guided by market value of specific types.  Cars are pooled into these three categories to keep the pricing system simple, so people looking for a car can simply refine their search for a Category 1, 2, or 3 to suit their budget and needs, ensuring that the process is quick and easy.Though car hire companies obviously do exist, they are not considered to be direct competition, as we will operate under a very different business model.  We will generally be cheaper than a traditional hire car, depending on category (and exactly what you compare against), but our major point of deference to the market will be the volume of cars that we have listed as available at any time.  The way that our fleet of cars will be so geographically dispersed that there will be cars available to you at any time no matter where you are, will be a real strength of the business model, which will ensure its sustainability as a service that people will come to rely on as part of their normal daily life.Another advantage that will differentiate us from the market will be the flexibility of our service to also provide vehicles for shorter periods, such as if you only need a car for 2, 3 or 4 hours for example.We will provide a more flexible and modern way of obtaining cars to use when you need them, where you need them, bringing the community together to use the existing resources that are sitting in driveways and garages all around the world, rather than going through the more formal and expensive car hire model.Funding goal - $165,232The majority of this budget is allocated to website and app development, with marketing being the other big early investment requirement, which may be increased with every dollar that we exceed our goal by.The remainder of the budget is made up mostly of business and brand development related costs, as well as the required insurance policies.","Insurance.Companies insuring the cars that people are sharing with our community of users may have a problem with them sharing their cars with people that they do not know.  If this happens to become an issue, we will work through it with the relevant stakeholders and provide the means to supplement insurance policies, as well as being adequately insured ourselves.Trust.This business model may be seen as flawed by some, as there may be a perceived trust issue to overcome in order for people to share their cars with total strangers.  We will build a community of car sharing people that want this service to work, as it can be so beneficial to both parties, sharers and sharees alike.Relationships will be developed and nurtured via processes such as ratings and reviews of both parties, as well as mediums such as blogs and social media that will encourage maximizing the use of the car sharing service in a respectful manner."

Video gaming has always been a huge passion of mine, ever since I first played on the Sega Megadrive as a child. And I have been interested in the gaming hardware almost as long, especially the portable consoles.When I bought a PSP in 2008, I could for the first time add some emulators to a portable console. So now I could play all the classic games again, that I haven't played for a long time. The only small issue I had with playing emulated games on the PSP, was with the screen. It was quite small and in wrong aspect ratio, which resulted in black borders. Since then I allways wanted to build my own portable console, and take care of those issues myself. So finally, in the late 2018 I had the knowledge and an idea on how to begin with that project.HardwareWith a 3D-printer, Raspberry Pi 3, iPad mini 3 display and some other parts and circuit boards, I was able to build this prototype of the portable retro game console that I wanted. The goal was to create a portable console with a big display, that was both functional and aesthetically pleasing.I chose the Raspberry Pi 3 because of several reasons. It has great software support and it's compatible with many different emulators. It's small and thin. Priceworthy. And has low power consumption, but still powerful enough to emulate most systems.I use a 7.9-inch LG display, the same model you find in an iPad mini 3. I found many other displays with the size and aspect ratio I wanted. But I chose the LG, even though it was more expensive, because it was brighter and had much better colour rendition than the other displays.To improve the audio quality on the Raspberry Pi, I included an USB DAC(16 Bit, 48 kHz). I also had to include an amplifier board to power the speakers. For the buttons and the d-pad I use soft tactile switches, in order to get the same feel most game controllers have.DesignMy design inspirations I got from many different sources, not only gaming hardware. I tried to make it as small and thin as I could, but still keep it comfortable to hold for many hours of gaming.On the top there are two buttons, one is for adjusting the screen brightness, and the other is for shuting down the system. There is also a power switch, to completely power off the console. The 3.5 mm headphone jack and the micro-USB port for charging the battery, is located on the bottom. The power LED on the front indicates low, charging and charged battery. There is also the rest of the buttons, the d-pad and the volume knob. Above the volume knob there is a hotkey button. You use that, with different combinations with other buttons, to do things like save, load, reset, and quit to main menu. In order to avoid high temperatures in the console, I have installed a small, silent fan on the back. It brings air through the intake, then past the heat sink on the Raspberry Pi and out again.To get access to the replaceable Li-Po battery and microSD card, you only have to remove the back cover. There's no screws, you just slide it downward to open it. And I designed the cover and the area around it in a way, to better conceal the joints.At the moment, I don't have any final product name for it. But if this campaign succeeds I will have one ready before any shipping. Until then, I'm going to call it PRGC.The PRGCThe end result is a Raspberry Pi-based console, made for retro game emulation. The PRGC can emulate, seamlessly in full speed, classic consoles like Sega Megadrive, Super Nintendo, Game Boy Advance, PlayStation and many more.You can store over 6000 games on the included memory card. Simply add your games from your computer, without any cables. Just upload through Wi-Fi via your web browser. Depending on the screen brightness, the console provides approximately 3 to 6 hours of game playing per charge.Specifications:Dimension comparison:PRGC:Wii U GamePad:Game systemsThe PRGC is capable of emulating some of the most classic game systems:Why I need your helpA long time have passed since I started this project and now I have a final prototype. But in order to bring the PRGC to realization and make all of this doable, I'll need your help.I need to order the parts and components in big volumes to keep down the production costs, to make the console more affordable. All the buttons, the d-pad and the case I have to make in an injection mould. So I can mass-produce them and also in a higher quality. And injection moulds are quite expensive. I also have to make custom circuit boards to reduce the amount of wires, to save space and to save time on the assembly of the consoles. During the most time consuming stages, like assembly and shipping logistics. I want to put together a small team of 3 to 5 people to help me out with that.I don't have this kind of budget, and that's where you come in. I have self-funded this project till now.

https://www.kickstarter.com/projects/185723720/gilt-magazine?ref=discovery_category_newest,185723720/gilt-magazine,"Currently available on the website page www.giltmagazine.it, but we want to go further and now we are going to explain you the reason.Why Gilt?Gilt stems from the founder’s idea of creating a publishing product that highlights, for the first time, that not only men but also women can buy luxury products and, at the same time, work in the luxury field. There has always been the view that a woman could live off and that luxury was only for men. Having gained more and more the same power as men in the work environment and therefore the same economic status, women can now get access to  far more exclusive world.Their needs, however, are different from the men’s ones. In other words, women are not interested in cars, yachts, watches, but in something which is far more female. Therefore, Gilt gives the opportunity to have an immediate and present overview of what the luxury world is nowadays for women, including specific want ads. Moreover, Gilt creates a strong synergy by connecting people who are searching job in this field or want to make themselves known as up-and-coming.The new idea of marketplace: what will it be exactly?Speaking of up-and-coming, Gilt was born also with the intention of creating a marketplace, currently in progress, that will give the opportunity to fashion, product and interior designers of selling their products or prototypes through our pages. They won’t have to spend money for the creation of a digital selling system because we will handle everything. What progress has Gilt made so far?Nowadays Gilt has already created a very strong network of contacts within the fashion and luxury fields. After 70 digital covers, Gilt wants to become a printed media and wants to produce also an English version, that will be managed by an English team.Team’s membersNowadays the team, based in Italy, is made up of 20 contributors, a journalist manager, a marketing manager, a pr, a fashion editor and many people working in the sector, such as stylists, make-up artists etc.Videos : we started to realize little short movie like this. With your help we could done more. Very elegants and classy In 2018 we would like to realize the first two free-press printed issues, the first one during Milan’s fashion week in February 2018, and the second one for Milan’s 2018 design week  of which will be distributed over 1000 copies. During Milan’s design week we would also like to organize our first official launch event that will involve at least 1000 people. In addition to the event, we would like also to have our personal stand during the entire week.  In order to realize our project, we have to start working on it from October/November and we need a very large budget. There won’t be  risks for the bakers because our project has already started and we know that with an appropriate budget we can only improve, without setbacks. Bakers will always be updated with all our events thanks to a newsletter that we will create specifically for them, so they will be informed on our developments.The processing for the first printed issue can start from November, but we need to reach the fixed budget. In general, you need at least 3 months to prouce a printed issue. The launch event during the fashion week needs to be planned and organized in December. Christmas and New Year’s greetings event will also be very important.","There won’t be  risks for the bakers because our project has already started and we know that with an appropriate budget we can only improve, without setbacks.

Several years ago, working for a digital communication agency, I saw the possibility of making a change in my career and starting the adventure with an exclusively mine project. Gilt Magazine was born from the desire to change the luxury magazines market and to propose contents that are closely linked to the female world.Gilt is a reality that connects mainly the female world to luxury, but also incorporates areas of cinema, luxury travel and offers advice from influencers from around the world. Women have always been pushed into the background in this sector, and Gilt proposes a revaluation of the female luxury sector through content exclusively designed for them! We know that women needs are very different from those of men.Gilt embraces more sectors of luxury, from fashion, to the interior to end in cinema and luxury travel.But Gilt is not just a magazine, it is a community of people interested in learning about the latest fashion and luxury trends and allows new designers to emerge thanks to an innovative marketplace that enhances the products of young interior  designers and fashion designers. There are many interactive and engagement-creating parts within the publishing project, but surely the most interesting evolution we have thought about and that we want to bring to the market is this: a very powerful sales channel for some specific figures related to the world of fashion and interior design and product design, two sectors that Gilt particularly cares about.The strength of Gilt is also the knowledge of the luxury and fashion sector that allowed us, despite our limited financial resources, to interview national and international figures, such as Claudia Gerini (Italian actress), to establish partnerships with important brands like Salvatore Ferragamo, Prada.Have you ever thought how many difficulties can arise when starting your own business in the luxury sector?The ruthless competition, the copy of ideas and an absurd effort to avoid collapsing immediately. Gilt marketplace solves this problem by creating a network that with its marketing helps young designers to bring out their ideas, but above all, through a selection, allows potential customers to choose between unique products on the market, high quality and of contained price.Your help for us is precious. Donating even a few dollars will allow us to see our idea implement more and more until we reach what we have thought in the launch phase, ie a service accessible for free and a truly innovative marketplace!For all the backers, based on the amount donated, we offer customizable and trendy products.","What are the risks of the market?There is a possibility that our magazines will not be sold due to low demand. To reduce this risk we already have a partnership with a commercial and advertising agency that will help to place our fantastic magazines to our customers.What is the innovation of the marketplace?Currently, there are no marketplaces dedicated to luxury and young designers. We will offer a totally new service that will eliminate all the problems of start-up of these products (which are really many!)"

Think about if you had a house a fire or a medical emergency you would want them to come to your care as soon as possible. What if there funding issues interfered with them showing up when you needed them most. That's why it is my mission to help local volunteer fire and ambulance companies in our area through the purchase of fresh wholesome food prepared for lunch, dinner, and baked goods; healthier than your average restaurant. Our goal is to continually donate 20% of our proceeds to our local Volunteer fire and ambulance companies in Tompkins County New York. We will collect donations from patrons which will go directly to the funding for volunteer companies. Our plan also involves spreading awareness of what your local volunteer companies provide to your community and what it takes for the companies to extend the assistance they provide to their community.This is so vital in our area because that is all we have in the surrounding area is volunteer departments; there are no paid companies to cover the area. The volunteer departments always need funding assistance for equipment, training, expenses, etc.The funding raised from Kickstarter will only be used for the expense of opening The Red House. The local volunteer fire and ambulance companies will begin receiving a portion of the proceeds when the business has begun to show a profit. The Red House has a pay it forward concept. I really love this concept as well as complete excitement in having the possibilty to make this dream of paying it forward to a non-profit organization which involves such selflessly dedicated individuals a reality.To give an idea of how large the amount the donations can increase with the support I know the community will provide you will see below a range of profits and the twenty percent donation totals which are most certainly possible. I will conduct a business which patrons want to return regularly, receive constant support from the community, pay it forward to the community wherever possible, serve a popular variety of fantastic fresh tasting food, ensure a restaurant atmosphere patrons can't wait to visit again, and a work environment employees love. The donations have the benefit of reducing the amount of funding state, town, and villages are required to provide. This in turn will reduce the amount of state, village, and town taxes the people are required to pay.The Red House Profit.       20% Donation$ 100,000.                    $ 20,000$ 150,000.                    $ 30,000$ 200,000.                    $ 40,000$ 500,000.                    $100,000$ 750,000.                    $150,000$1,000,000.                   $200,000Seeing my local community has several volunteer departments the individuals who live here are most likely either a volunteer themselves or the family or friend of a volunteer. The Red House would get much support; especially due to my plan of informing the community regularly of how they are helping their volunteer departments. The more aware the community is on how important their help is the more they will want to help.Having been a volunteer for 4 years I understand completely how valuable the donations are in these departments in having what they need to operate effectively and efficiently. There is only a certain amount of funding states, counties, villages, and towns can provide this is where the donations come in. Take one moment to think and ponder this scenario (ficticous scenario to explainfunding these departments rely on): most people in the local communities are not aware of the funding or where the funding comes from to keep their local volunteer department operating, therefore the donations from the community diminish and the departments try their best to do their jobs without the proper equipment. I don't know about you, but I would want them to show up with the proper equipment if my house was on fire, I was in a motor vehicle accident, or having a serious medical condition.I have created a website which provides further information on The Red House such as the logo, the mission statement, and a sample menu. The URL is posted below.http://theredhouse.simdif.comI also think it would be awesome if this ideatook off and people started opening up a restaurant with the same pay it forward concept in their communities; the donations can go to any cause a community needs to fund and the name can correspond with the cause.All you have to do is watch the news and you realize quickly we need to start coming together to improve our communities. There used to be a time when communities were close and strong, children could play outside safely, and you could leave your doors unlocked. Small towns and villages used to be significantly safer than cities; that has been changing for some time now. I would love if communities could get back to that. I strongly feel the more people who become involved in helping their community the closer to achieving the communities we desire so badly. I hope that you feel the same and take the time to pledge, any pledges are appreciated no matter the amount. I feel this concept of restaurant could assist in moving communities in the correct direction of improving and becoming strong as a nation.Thank you for taking the time to look at my Kickstarter campaign and website.Sample Menu (changes may be needed prior to printing)","My background is very diverse and provided me with a wealth of knowledge. I have a Bachelor of Science in Criminal Justice (3.96 gpa) as well as an Executive Masters in Business Administration with a focus on Management (3.7 gpa). I have ten years experience in the restaurant business. I volunteered for four years as an interior certified firefighter/rescue, ambulance driver, and basic emergency medical technician. In 2007 I completed the Correction Officer Academy with honors and enjoyed working as a correction officer until I moved from Virginia to my hometown in New York due to health issues with my older brother.Dryden, New York is desperate for additional restaurants. Our area is flooded with Volunteer fire and ambulance departments; so the support would be huge. These volunteer departments always need assistance with funding for equipment, new fire trucks, training, supplies, new ambulances, etc. Because a large portion of funding they depend on comes from donations I have a strong passion to assist with the very needed funding they require to continue providing the invaluable service to the community.  All the volunteers are exceptional people who's hearts and souls are dedicated to voluntarily offering their time and skill every day to the residents in their local community. It would be a dream come true for me to have the resources to assist with their funding and ensure they have the necessary funding to operate effectly. This is vital because they help individuals in their highest need and save lives every day. These remarkable people respond to emergency calls any time of the day or night and a majority of the volunteers have been dedicated for most of their lives. So I would be honored and grateful if you please help me help them.I am fully capable of making The Red House a success. I have a  background in the restaurant business, a Masters in Business which focused on Management, and the heart, soul, and passion in paying it forward to such wonderfully, selfless, dedicated individuals. I can see The Red House open and a success. I have a passion for cooking and making people happy while they eat good food. The employees would love coming to work. They would always be treated with respect and told regularly that the restaurant would not be a success without them. I believe the best management style involves creating an environment which has respect, feeling of being needed, open communication, and value. Creating an environment your employees love will result in a successful business. Most bosses forget without your employees you are nothing; you can not do it all alone.I have applied for a business start-up loan through the Small Business Administration. I completed the pre-qualification phase and received an excellent chance to receive a loan. The Small Business Administration is willing to back me in order to increase my chances of becoming funded by a lender. I applied for $50,000 which is half the expense of opening The Red House. The other half of the funding is my Kickstarter fundraising campaign of $50,000; which I would be eternally grateful if this campain gets funded.The funds raised on Kickstarter will be used for any additional equipment the business loan doesn't cover, non perishable supplies, perishable food supplies, first month utilities and internet as well as phone service. I will purchase insurance through the Cotterrill Insurance Agency in Dryden, NY. This agency resides in the same town as The Red House when it is opened. The owner of the insurance agency and his son and daughter have all been members of the Dryden Fire Department for many years. The same department I volunteered at for four years. The restaurant will do business as much as possible with other local businesses. This is intended to help our local communities future. I plan on purchasing a great deal of our perishable food supplies from local farmers. I want this pay it forward concept to include the local farmers due to the importance of farming. This will help ensure we only use organic, no antibiotic products. Any food menu items left at the end of the business day will be donated to a local organization which helps the less fortunate.",https://www.kickstarter.com/projects/250503/the-red-house-homemade-to-go?ref=discovery_category_newest,250503/the-red-house-homemade-to-go,"The Red HouseWelcome to my campaign; thank you for taking the time to visit and read about my concept of paying it forward.I am excited about this campaign and know it will be successful.I want to give you a sincere thank you for your precious time!You hear of all different types of organizations helping various causes; but take a minute to think how often do you see help for your local volunteers that you depend on greatly.

My name is William casner, I have been in the culinary field for eight years now and have always wanted to open my own restaurant and put my skills to the true test. Why have I waited eight years to try and get my own restaurant you may ask and I am glad you did. I used to be teased and made fun of for wanting to be a chef, family members and friends would tell me ""that is a stupid idea you can't do it"" well I hope to prove them wrong open a successful restaurant and prove to myself that I should never doubt myself. As with everything there are risks and with those risks facing thwm and overcoming them you gain rewards. I hope that you will help me make my dream a reality.Thank you.","Opening a restaurant the risk is you may put money into it and at first not be successful thats when you fix the menu and the ambiance of the restaurant by listening to what your customers have to say, most people now days do not listen to the feed back of their patrons. To fix the problems that I may face, I will listen to the feedback of my patrons to adjust the restaurant and make everyone happy. Another problem I may face are employees who may not want to do certain jobs; To stop this from being a problem a rule book for both chef's and waiters/ waitresses will be placed in both the front of the restaurant and back of the restaurant in plain view of all employees.",https://www.kickstarter.com/projects/1525273843/wills-family-dining?ref=discovery_category_newest,1525273843/wills-family-dining,"I have been in the culinary industry since 2008, and have always wanted to open my own restaurant. Now I am putting more effort into it to provide for my Fiancé and our daughter. I want to provide a place where people come to enjoy a good meal with a great atmosphere with their family and friends. There will be specials that will fit the seasons each one will be themed accordingly to make certain it fits the month or season. The menu will be very diversified and I want to strive to make it so those with gluten allergies have a range of choices not the usually two or three items; Everyone has to eat sadly not everyone can eat everything, this is something we hear a lot in the industry and it is something I'd like to improve upon, possibly with a separate menu that is entirely gluten free. Between my experience and the experience I have seen from others I believe we can achieve something great I hope that together we can make this idea a reality. ","In all business ventures there are risks and rewards it all depends on the effort you put into them. Opening a restaurant the risks are that your employees may not always be decent or very cleanly, to prevent this there will be an Material Safety Data Sheet placed in the kitchen for the cooks and it will be followed to the letter; there will also be yellow cutting boards only for chicken, blue cutting boards for fish, red cutting boards for beef and green cutting boards for vegetables as to keep all food safe from cross contamination; These cutting boards will each be stored and cleaned separately from one another. Challenges will be refining the menu as not everyone is going to be very happy with everything on the menu, to fix and refine the menu in the first few months there will be suggestion cards on each table for the guests to say what they thought of each item, if an item gets fifteen bad reviews it will be removed and if an item gets twenty good reviews it will stay; I believe this will help combat some negativity, as with all restaurants there is always going to be some negativity and unfortunately cannot be stopped completely, but we will do our best. Employees who serve customers will be expected to treat customers with the utmost respect, if they do not there will be actions taken to correct the behavior this will rely on a three strike rule , if the behavior continues and we hear the same complaint a third time the employee will be asked to leave."

Firstly I would like to say that this version of Batman isn't racist that was a lot of people's issues with the last version. Charles Wayne is a retired veteran of both the War for Texas Independence and the Mexican-American War. When the Civil War comes around he doesn't want to fight. He would like to spend his remaining years with his wife and children. When he gets a telegram from his brother that his mother had passed away he must leave the Nebraska Territory and ride to New York to attained her funeral. When he returns home he finds his house burnt to the ground and sets out the stop atrocities like this from happening and since the war was caused by slavery he will fight to see its down fall.To Answer most of your question this is an interview I did with teamhellions and was also featured on geekunleashed before it was closed down till October. http://teamhellions.com/2015/04/14/interview-with-david-ames-creator-of-the-batman-legacy-kickstarter/Thank you for you timeSincerely,David Ames",The two main issues I see coming up is A. Not getting the backers I need. B.

The player will travel on Route 666, also known as Hell. The aim of the game is to escape Hell, along the way you will be faced with enemies which you will have to deal with or run away, once again the choice is yours.Currently the game is in Beta phase and has been created for Windows, and is available as a reward for a donation of £50 or more.The reason for this Kickstarter Project is to gain funding to bring the game to mobile users across a variety of platforms, with the intention to improve mobile users gaming and mobile RPG's. I genuinely believe this game will change the mobile gaming world for role playing games.If you have any questions please feel free to email me.","The obstacles we face are:-- Getting the game onto the mobile gaming platforms before other such games take our place- Not getting the correct team on board for the building phase, which we will look at in great deal to make sure we get the right people.- Advertising needs to be done correctly",https://www.kickstarter.com/projects/graphicnovelfilm1/the-inquisitor?ref=discovery_category_newest,graphicnovelfilm1/the-inquisitor,"What is The Inquisitor?The Inquisitor project is a new planned horror film set in the Napoleonic era. The new horror movie features an original script and is based on a graphic novel created by Richard Kelly. We have chosen Spain as the location for the production of the project giving the advantages of film production incentives in Spain. If we can be given the chance to produce this film with your help we will pledge to reward all supporters and an invite to follow and be involved in the production process of The Inquisitor. So what’s the story?Gypsies Alfred Pallino and his two daughters, Gina and Maria, with friend Teresa Dalini travel from camp to the next town to hear the church sermon of the Archbishop Francesco, during the Napoleonic war. As Alfred Pallino leaves the three girls in charge of the cart and in selling their wares,  they are kidnapped and taken to the cell of the church.Once in the cell,  they become aware of a female prisoner in the cell next to them. This prisoner escapes by killing a guard and frees them all. The three girls run through dark corridors to find a way of escaping the church and avoid Helene. Helene kills many more in a blood thirsty rampage through the church and the Archbishop Francesco orders the guards to find her.As the girls try to escape both Helene and the guards, what will happen when all three parties catch up with each other and the body count rises? Where will the film be set?The film will be set in Spain given that the tax breaks for film investments in the country are highly beneficial to the project. Spain is notorious for its new horror movies, and the Inquisitor will be no different. This low budget independent horror movie will combine production techniques seen in other independent horror movies, which often perform very well in the market, with this original story idea.Production Plan?The filming will take place in a small village in Spain and the majority of production will take place in an ancient church. The cast is small:Theresa Dalini- teenage girlMaria Pallino – teenage girlGina Pallino -  sisterAlfred Pallino- FatherPablo – ShepherdLorenzo – Pablo’s fatherBeggarsBrother Paulo (monk)Archbishop FrancescoBrother SimonHelene- Female prisonerGuard commanderGuardsA female customerAfter the initial production, we will distribute the film into cinemas across Europe and the USA. Now that we have got you as an investor in the film, we hope to be given the chance to submit the film for awards and screenings at film festivals all around the world. The film will be released as a DVD as well as online digital streaming and download options. Who are we?Richard Kelly, a creative writer and graphic novelist. I am passionate about creating new and different stories. I have published a number of graphic novels and have worked on independent film projects such as The Beast, Lycanthropy and Ghouls.What will be done with the money?We’ll use the money for production and distribution costs. Filming will take place on location, the cast is yet to be confirmed. Will this film get made?Not without you! You, the person reading this right now, every penny will count in order to realise this film. It’s a unique and different story line, bringing in aspects of horror and independent film to produce a new and exciting project. Any backer will have involvement in this project and the money we raise here will be fundamental in the production and post production costs of this project. Any backer means we have a ready made audience for the film, and hopefully the word will spread about this new horror movie coming soon.Want more information?Follow on Twitter: @sagitarius215","The biggest challenge is getting the film fully funded and distributed. The 250K will be a great start for this project. It will help towards production costs such as the actors, equipment, editing, locations and costumes. We know there is nothing like this out there, graphic novel films are usually big budget hollywood blockbusters, something like this has never been seen before. If we can’t get the funding for this film, we won’t be able to fulfill some of the reward items. The film making is a long process and we are not sure of which challenges and bumps we may face but the goal is clear. Make an enjoyable film for you to enjoy and feel proud to be a part of. How many people out there can say they were an investor or backer in an independent horror movie?"

Y seguramente nadie lo visita (los productores no pueden hacer click en cada link que el talento les manda).En Phasto, el productor publica el casting y tú aplicas desde el mismo sitio, donde tendrás tu currículum, demo reel y material fotográfico. Así tienes más oportunidades de ser descubierto.En pocas palabras, Phasto es mejor que tener un sitio web personal.Como Productorpuedes publicar un casting y el talento aplica directamente desde la página, así tendrás acceso a un mundo de artistas que no están entre tus conocidos, aumentando tus posibilidades de trabajar con personas muy talentosas que no sabías que existían.En Phasto simplificamos la tarea del Productor y el Director de Casting para que tengan acceso a todo el talento en un par de clicks.Como Estudiantetambién tendrás acceso a todo el talento que existe en el sitio, sólo tienes que publicar un casting y listo, el personal que necesites aplicará para tu proyecto.Phasto es un sitio que la comunidad creativa necesita. Kickstarter es la mejor manera de conseguir fondos para construir herramientas para las comunidades creativas como nosotros.Como productor, actor y director independiente, he tenido problemas para encontrar el talento que necesito para mis proyectos y fuera de lanzar un ""facebookazo"" (donde no sé ni quién es quien, o de dónde salió el talento, o vaya, si el talento siquiera es talento), existen pocas opciones y casi siempre se limitan a conocidos.Por eso decidí crear Phasto, y aunque el sitio está activo, no cumple con las caraterísticas necesarias para conectar efectivamente a productores y talento.Aquí es donde está el problema, yo no soy diseñador ni desarrollador web, por lo que tengo que contratar esos servicios con profesionales.El costo del desarrollo de un sitio web tan limpio, complejo y funcional como tenemos planeado, es muy elevado.Queremos un sitio que no deje nada que desear y que permita las conexiones entre creativos, sin problemas.Para esto hay que cubrir gastos de alojamiento del sito, diseño, dominio, desarrollo web, interfaces responsivas para móviles, bases de datos, interfaces intuitivas, muchas y muchas horas de código, personalizaciones, actualizaciones, mantenimiento del sitio, desarrollo de contenidos, sorpresas para miembros y varios otros gastos.Esto requiere mucho tiempo y esfuerzo por parte de los desarrolladores para que todo funcione de manera efectiva.

Por eso fue que decidimos formar parte de este mundo.Desafortunadamente, las circunstancias no siempre son las mejores para el desarrollo de grandes historias. Esa es la razón por la que decidimos construir este proyecto, para no depender de factores externos y poder explotar al máximo los recursos que tenemos en nuestras manos.A todos nos gusta el género thriller y creemos que podemos contarte una historia que te mantenga al borde del asiento por una hora entera.Hacer una película no es tarea fácil, así como tampoco filmarla en un solo plano secuencia, por lo que estaremos ensayando durante todo este tiempo para minimizar los errores el día de la filmación, ya que vamos a transmitirla en vivo.¡Correcto! El plan es transmitir en vivo el “detrás de cámaras” durante el rodaje de la película.La película se filmará y transmitiremos el “detrás de cámaras” al mismo tiempo. Principalmente por Instagram en la cuenta @KineCine.¡Una película jamás se ha hecho en estas condiciones, nos emociona mucho este proyecto!Tú verás todo lo que sucede en tiempo real. Y sólo tendrás que sintonizarte a uno de los canales de nuestras redes sociales (Instagram, Youtube, Facebook) para poder disfrutar de la realización de la película.La historia sucede en un solo plano secuencia (no haremos cortes), por lo que si algo se atora, tendremos que resolverlo sobre la marcha, manteniendo la ficción.Esta película no es un proyecto amateur, todos los involucrados sabemos lo que hacemos, pero aún así, este filme nos impone un gran reto por el nivel de dificultad que representa.Todo lo anterior no significa que lo que se verá en redes será la calidad final.Sí, tú verás cómo la hicimos, pero la película final se grabará en la cámara que tendrá el director en las manos y esa sí será la versión final.Esa versión será la que proyectaremos en el cine y si compras esa recompensa, podrás disfrutarla con nosotros y también sabrás lo que pasó detrás de cámaras mientras la estábamos filmando, porque viste la transmisión en las redes sociales.Artur es un tipo que tiene una vida normal en la superficie, pero oculta secretos que nadie de su círculo conoce.La infidelidad en la que Artur se involucra junto con las mujeres que lo rodean, cambiará para siempre el curso de la historia de sus vidas. Sus amigos se convertirán en enemigos y cuando él piensa que está a salvo, todo tendrá un giro inesperado cuando la traición le obsequiará un respiro de alivio.En esta historia nada es lo que parece, las verdades se convierten en engaños y la falsa sensación de seguridad que todos conocemos, se verá destruida cuando fuerzas inesperadas colisionan en la realidad.La película se filmará el 26 de agosto a las 18:00 hrs. tiempo de la Ciudad de México.Al mismo tiempo tendremos un equipo técnico transmitiendo la realización de la película en vivo por redes sociales (Youtube, Facebook e Instagram).Llevamos un buen tiempo listos con el guión, asegurando locaciones, armando el crew, ensayando y planeando todo. El dinero recaudado aquí, será utilizado inmediatamente en el proyecto.Hacer una película requiere dinero, hay muchos costos que aunque minimizados por los proveedores, no dejan de existir.Queremos contarte una historia de la manera más realista posible y para lograrlo, hay muchos elementos que tomar en cuenta que no son tan perceptibles a simple vista, pero que contribuyen a la realización de una película, como el vestuario, la utilería, los alimentos, el sonido, el equipo de filmación, la pre y post producción, etc.Para lograr hacer una película totalmente independiente y contarla sin compromisos, necesitamos el recurso económico que estamos solicitando.Piénsalo así; los presupuestos en las películas de formato comercial comienzan alrededor de los 10 millones de pesos (micro presupuesto) y las más caras rozan los 100 millones. Nosotros requerimos mucho menospor el formato de nuestra película.Además, esta plataforma nos permite ofrecer recompensas que en otro caso no se obtienen tan fácilmente.Estamos ansiosos de compartir tiempo contigo, invitarte a los eventos y llevarte tu paquete de la película a tu casa, si es que eliges esa recompensa.Nosotros seremos el cohete y tú el combustible, sé parte de esta historia, involúcrate, sólo hay una oportunidad de participar en un proyecto como este.Si no puedes ayudarnos comprando una recompensa, no te preocupes, también puedes apoyarnos compartiendo esta campaña con tus amigos y familiares. Nunca sabes quién puede agradecerte que los hayas conectado con nosotros. ¡Seguro que nosotros sí estaremos muy felices de que nos ayudes!","El reto más grande al que nos enfrentamos es la indiferencia del público. Este proyecto está hecho con el corazón, cada uno de nosotros está haciendo su mejor esfuerzo para hacer de esta película algo de lo cual sentirnos orgullosos como artistas mexicanos.Si tú no nos fallas, nosotros tampoco te fallaremos. Hagamos de este proyecto una realidad.Contamos con tu apoyo para poder realizar esta película.¡Muchas gracias!"

https://www.kickstarter.com/projects/facethemusic/face-the-music?ref=discovery_category_newest,facethemusic/face-the-music,"www.letsfacethemusic.comPlease open the website to view our exciting video and read about how this project started and the talented people involved!Face The Music is an exciting brand new music and dance show. It's packed full of some of the most iconic tracks of the past seven decades from Buddy Holley to Bruno Mars, Madonna is in Vogue and Michael is moonwalking.It tells the story of one of the first professional DJ's who started his career in the 1970's with a portable record player who provided the music at his friends parties through to the present time, except now it's at top venues for corporate and celebtity events both is the UK and abroad.The show plans to tour the UK in Sptember 2019 with future tours in Europe.","Music and dance theatre productions have historically been risk reward enterprises.  If successful the rewards can be huge but if a show fails investors can lose some or all of their investment.   For example, cash in a bank generates less than 1% interest but the cash is safe.   But if investors are willing to accept some degree of risk the rewards can be much greater.The objective is to minimise risk and maximise reward.To minimise the risk the founder of the business has invested the capital needed to produce a promotional video which gives potential investors a snapshot of what the complete show will look like in a theatre performance.This allows investors to look at the video and be in a position to make an informed choice.   It's just like a trailer for a movie in the cinema, you are less likely to see a film just by reading about it, you watch the trailer first.   If you like the trailer you go and see the movie.  It minimises the chance of being disappointed.   If you like the video trailer of our show you are more likely to invest than not.",https://www.kickstarter.com/projects/facethemusic/face-the-music-0?ref=discovery_category_newest,facethemusic/face-the-music-0,"www.letsfacethemusic.comMy name is Michael Fabb……….I’ve always had a passion for music and dance and after seeing Michael Flatley’s Lord of the Dance it sparked off something in my mind. The show was terrific, the Irish dancing was mesmerising but something was missing……... ... the MUSIC! This was 2 hours of Irish fiddle music but none of it stuck in the memory!Superb spectacle but more of a dance show than a music and dance show. What I wanted was a show that had you dancing in the aisles. I went to see Simple Minds recently and spent most of the show standing up Dancing along with 800 other people!!…….In most shows you come out humming some of the tunes but not this time. A couple of days later I was listening to the radio and heard Michael Jackson singing Billie Jean……….and that was the light bulb moment!.......I imagined a group of dancers flooding he stage and moving in contemporary dance rhythm to the music of a whole host of world famous pop stars with their hits displayed on a large video screen backdrop…...The seed was sown!So I went to see more shows, Michael Jackson’s very own Thriller…….Motown - the story of Berry Gordy, founder of the Motown label and stars such as Diana Ross, Marvin Gaye and Stevie Wonder……Jersey Boys, the story of Franki Valli and the Four Seasons, The Kinks Sunday Afternoon. All great shows but focussed on one individual artist or band and more about their story than their music.I wanted music and dance in equal measure but my show also needed it’s own story.......... Fortunately I found it with the first person I made contact with, a professional DJ who started his career in the late 1970’s and now runs a globe-trotting mobile discotheque show performing for the rich and famous, stars of stage and screen and global corporate giants. It is the story of the ups and downs of a career DJ, his story will make you laugh, make you cry but most of all will make you want to jump up and DANCE!Fast forward to 2019 and we have our promotional video for Face the Music, four minutes of pulsating pop, a snapshot of what the full two hour 16 track show will look like. To see more, click on our promotional video or go to our website www.letsfacethemusic.com to see the video and the professional team behind the show.","As with all financial investments, there is a risk that you could lose some or all of your money.  Theatre productions are regarded as high risk/high reward investments which mean that the risk of failure is higher than normal but the reward if successful will be much higher than average.   To put this into context some West End shows close before recouping the initial investment whilst some of the more successful shows run for many years with corresponding higher rewards for initial investors.For Face The Music, the risks are having insufficient funds to complete the production or not being sufficiently successful as a touring music and dance theatre show."

The movie is a feature-lengthhorror set in modern times. We haven't filmed anything yet. Because of the expense. That's why we are using Kickstarterto help us out.The film is about.A family buys a new cabin in southernOhio only to find out it's still being watched by someone else. A dark and tall figure that is bent on killing them for no reason. Or is there a reason? Action packed and twists at every turn. Takes you back to the slasher films of the 1980s.We currently have a full crew including main actors.,"Some of the risks are the filming itself.

It has been designed for demanding graphic artists and all creatives expecting greater possibilities and customisation in a minimalistic structure and form.THE PRODUCT:ANIMAIONIC is a docking station for two graphic cards and four SSD drives with a built-in SD card reader – all enclosed in a small and high quality, aluminium box visually matching a Mac Mini design. It has been created exclusively for the purpose of expanding the Mac Mini, taking this great little machine to a much higher level, transforming it into a compact yet powerful macOS workstation.Apple Mac Mini is an excellent desktop computer which runs macOS system. Using 6-core processor it can be sufficient even for serious work. It gives the customisation possibilities by allowing to expand RAM memory and to choose a monitor of preference. The thing is, that Mac Mini features Intel integrated graphic chip and limited storage which cannot be upgraded. It is fine for office work, internet browsing and basic graphic work but it is not good enough for more demanding tasks... this is why we have created the ANIMAIONIC.THE RESULT:ANIMAIONIC gives the graphic artists the freedom of choice, comfort and above all speed, as it accelerates the work of all graphic applications. The charts below show the efficiency comparsion of the ANIMAIONIC to the Mac Mini alone, as well as to the iMac Pro and the Mac Pro.THE MEANS: graphic cardsANIMAIONIC adds to a Mac Mini two PCIe extension slots for all compatible graphic cards supported by the newest Catalina macOS system. Additional graphic cards allow to speed-up modern professional applications - saving time and money.ANIMAIONIC meets the expectations of many applications already using the graphic cards as accelerators of image, video and 3D graphics processing.Not only Apple, but also other companies leading in creative industry (such as Adobe, Maxon, Redshift, Otoy, Blackmagic, MD, Affinity, Pixelmator, Red Digital Cinema, Foundry, Unity, SideFX, Epic Games) continuously work on optimising their applications to engage the graphic cards.THE MEANS: SSD drivesANIMAIONIC provides the Mac Mini with extra four M.2 disk drive slots to increase the Mac Mini mass storage space.Using all four NVME SSD drives can amount up to 8TB additional data space.THE EXTRA:ANIMAIONIC has a built-in SD card reader on the front – always handy for uploading photos and videos.The ANIMAIONIC uses a small, efficient and quiet power supply, suitable for powerful graphic cards and SSD drives.

But once they graduate from high school, it is not a test score but a love for dance, music and performing that drives them to continue their studies. Those who aspire to be exceptional dancers, singers, and musicians are often faced with fierce competition - competition that makes many reconsider a future in the performing arts business.

A Kitchen that not just centered around appliances but includes the time and attention on what people really spend time doing in the kitchen and making that experience incredible and fun. My vision It's about simplifying how humans interact with the kitchen. I have been at this effort for two years now.By investing in me you're bringing a technology company to life that it is dedicated to inventing and innovating technology products for the kitchen.How The Product came about:I always disliked doing the dishes. I don't know what it was about it until I realized that I did not like the redundant steps of washing the dishes and then coming back to put them in the cabinet and waiting. I never liked the mess of the water under the plastic board that would create bacteria and unhealthy conditions. As I started observing people doing the dishes I realized that this whole process can become smarter and more efficient. I started putting together pieces of this multi-step process until I came to the right product. A dish drying rack that is also a cabinet and that also allows dishes to drain while they are stored. There are a few more things we want to add such as transparent sliding doors on the cabinet for further protection and a fan mounted on top to push water down the sink faster so you can enjoy dried dishes quicker. This is a very elegant solution that also works great for shared kitchen, hotels, hostels, apartment and houses.It's about a  product designed for you the Human not for half of the technicians wanted to be so that he could easily fit in your kitchen or become part of an industry standard but rather about how it affects and assists everyday people.The product:I know this is the right time for this product. This is the right product for people. It's not just a drying rack it's also a cabinet and a food prep station. it's also the birth of a new kitchen technology company that understands people and understands human needs to a very compassionate approach. It's about simplifying peoples life life. It's about saving time. It's about an elegant solution to a time consuming problem. it's a product born out of frustration with cleaning dishes.To Bring it to LifeI've never tried to go out there and ask a Venture Capital firm to back this project and that's why I putting on kickstarter. It is the birth of a Smart Home Company and as a company we will invent this product and continue to invent other parts of the kitchen that require a complete rethinking. That's what we are about.ExecutionFunds will be used to buy a 3D printer and start prototyping with a full-time industrial designer on payroll. The funds will also cover production of 300 to 500 units that will be sold directly to the consumer through our website.I hope you can help me bring this product to life as it really deserves a place in every home.

White Supremacist Wade Michael Page, methodically moved around the ground floor of the Gurdwara, where he shot and killed four innocent people in addition to the two he had already killed outside the Temple. During this rampage, he also critically wounded three others at the 17,000-square foot Sikh Temple in Oak Creek,Wisconsin. The first responding police officer Lieutenant Brian Murphy who tried to aid a victim, was ambushed by the gunman and shot fifteen times by the shooter Wade Michael Page, despite being shot fifteen times, the officer survived the shooting. The gunman’s rampage ended when the second responding police officer arrived at the location and shot and injured the gunman in the stomach, he died of a self-inflicted gunshot wound to the head.HISTORY OF HATE-CRIMES AGAINST SIKHSIn the aftermath of 9/11, more than 600 incidents of hate crimes against sikhs were reported. Sikh Americans since 9/11 have borne the brunt of violent hate crimes, unfortunately, the lack of understanding has led to serious consequences, including discriminatory policies, bigoted stereotypes, traumatic school bullying and violent hate crimes. This movie about Oak Creek Gurdwara Temple Shooting is made to educate majority of Americans who have no knowledge of Sikhs or Sikhism. Even though Sikhism is a different religion from Islam, Americans either confuse Sikhs and Muslims, or don’t know much about sikhism in general. For a Sikh, wearing a turban asserts a public commitment to maintaining the values and ethics of the tradition, including service, compassion, honesty and equality. This movie promotes awareness about Sikhism by trying to distance the religious community from any associations with terrorism.The rise in hate crimes against Sikh community is America is credited to lack of knowledge of the religion. This movie will help the Sikh community by educating Americans in a way that is both relatable and effective.","My responsibility as a Writer/ Director of the Short Film 6 Minutes.., is to be true to the story, sikh temple tragedy should be treated as a National Tragedy rather than a tragedy among the sikh american community.  My personal connection to this story is that I was at the Oak creek Temple just three weeks before the attack. I was there with a friend as a volunteer in the kitchen, where free food is served to all the devotees that visit Temple.

When I heard about his suicide I was devastated, it was the most heartbreaking incident I have ever experienced. Sadly, I had lost touch with him in the recent times and now I’m consumed with self-loathing, guilt and misery. I’m devastated thinking how lonely and desperate he must have felt to die in such a horrific way. I can’t understand why he did it, all he wanted from his family was to be loved and accepted for who he was, I wish he had reached out to me for help, he was a true friend and I miss him dearly.This story is really important and needs to be told to show how the society and culture perceives homosexuality and restricts people from living their life of choice.

As a filmmaker my deepest motivation is to create an eye opening experience for the audiences, there is nothing more satisfying to me than to bring my imagination to life, create compelling characters, to show their vulnerabilities, emotions, flaws etc. With this movie “A Moment To Remember” I’m hoping to promote awareness and tolerance towards the LGBT community living in India."

My proposal is to study whether or not this deficit in perception, is measurable, when compared to the lack of deficit in perception of inanimate objects. If the hypothesis is correct, this could be the first and only way to definitively diagnose Autism, as currently it is only able to be diagnosed by mere observation and estimation. Also, if it is correct, and the deficits are easily measured, this could lead to not only diagnosis, but also a best estimated severity level depending on the level of sensory deficit when observing other humans, if the amount of sensory deficit is in fact tied directly to the severity level of the Autistic subject. In other words, if the hypothesis is correct, the ability to perceive others should get worse as the subject's severity is higher. This would explain why severely autistic individuals don't usually recognize or speak to other humans at all, while less severe individuals only have trouble recognizing certain aspects of humans, usually the finer details. The test will need to be vast and numerous as well as the subjects both autistic and neurotypical to assure there are no statistical anomalies. Tests could range from, ""At what distance are subjects(whether autistic or not) unable to recognize facial expressions vs pictorial representations?"" ""At what decibel level are subjects(whether autistic or not)no longer able to comprehend speech vs basic tones?"", ""At what amount of pressure is the subject able to recognize human touch vs inanimate touch?"", etc. If there is in fact, adiscrepancybetween the autistic subjects and the neurotypical subjects, then this proves that Autism causes sensory deficits specifically related toperceivingother humans, and it can be measured in order to diagnose one as Autistic and maybe even the severity level of said subject.",The hardest part of this proposal will be coming up with a large enough variety of tests to prove the sensory deficit across all levels of perception.,https://www.kickstarter.com/projects/quarantent/hippheritage-initiative-for-plant-preservation?ref=discovery_category_newest,quarantent/hippheritage-initiative-for-plant-preservation,"  I am looking to start an organisation that is solely focused on preserving heritage plants and making them easily available to the public.

The intent of the organisation would be the preservation of heritage plants, most likely the one's that are at highest risk of becoming endangered, heritage plants that are hard to find, etc. And then to make these heritage plants easily available to the public for purchase to help further the preservation and also the proliferation of said heritage plants. In doing so we will help to further the ability to maintain heritage plants that might otherwise be lost in the pursuit of science.",I believe the largest challenges we will face is creating preservation facilities in which to house the preserved plants.

If you have not viewed the short project video above, please do so now; It best demonstrates Bicycle Laser Tag. The long version of the video, ""New Bicycle Laser Tag"" is on Youtube or you may view it on my Facebook page under Edward Burns. Playing the game is simple. Chase behind and get in range of your opponents red receiver, then press your trigger button to shoot. When your opponents red receiver flashes and beeps it represents that your target has been acquired - a hit! When any player is hit ten times the red light will strobe and an audible alarm will sound, informing everyone that the player is out of thegame. The player who out maneuvers their opponents and survives from being hit ten times, wins the game. If more than two bicycles are equipped with the Bicycle Laser Tag System more than two players may play. Note: Experienced players don't touch their foot to the ground and they play within an area not much bigger than a skate park.The goal is not only to produce superior function and design, but to be the first to introduce Bicycle Laser Tag to your community.

If you have not viewed the short project video above, please do so now; It best demonstrates Bicycle Laser Tag. The long version of the video, ""New Bicycle Laser Tag"" is on Youtube or you may view it on my Facebook page under Edward Burns.Playing the game is simple. Chase behind to get in range of your opponents red receiver, then press your trigger button to shoot. When your opponents red receiver flashes and beeps it represents that your target has been acquired - a hit! When any player is hit ten times the red light will strobe and an audible alarm will sound, informing everyone that the player is out of the game. The player who out-maneuvers their opponents and survives from being hit ten timeswins the game.If more than two bicycles are equipped with the Bicycle Laser Tag System more than two players may play. Note: Experienced players don't touch their foot to the ground and they play within an area no bigger than a skate park.The goal is not only to produce superior function and designbut to be the first to introduce Bicycle Laser Tag to your community.

It involves a literary and cinematic sequel to a famous and critically acclaimed work of literature: I plan to star as a lead role.to acquire Creative control and copy right/movie rights---which I would sign on over to a movie studio or production company if they cast me as one of the lead main character roles with comparable earnings for this movie, to commence production of this film in the near future, and for the script of the movie to be based directly from the author's book.DOUGLAS ADAMS'---THE RESTAURANT AT THE END OF THE UNIVERSELiterary synopsis (since the movie will be based on the book):OverviewHaving survived, or so it seems, the exigencies of space travel at the mercy of that definitive volume, The Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy, Arthur Dent now seeks a decent cup of tea…Ford Prefect is after a good gin and tonic (or jynnan tonnyx, depending on what planet you've encountered)…and Zaphod Beeblebrox wants a good meal. So what do the intrepid travelers discover in this second volume installment of the epic quest? That while Reality is frequently inaccurate, the Hitchhiker's Guide is definitive. That the major problem of time travel is one of grammar, requiring at least 1,001 tense formations. That the history of every major Galactic civilization tends to pass through three phases, characterized by the questions: How can we eat? Why do we eat? And finally, Where shall we have lunch? What could be more enlightening than to travel with them? So bring your towel, settle down and listen, and, above all - don't panic!This sequel to The Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy finds Arthur Dent, reluctant space adventurer, joining Zaphod Beeblebrox--two-headed former president of the galaxy--Zaphod's dead great-grandfather, sexy cadet Trillian, and paranoid Marvin in the search for the ruler of the Universe.""Ladies and gentlemen,"" he said, ""The Universe as we know it has now been in existence for over one hundred and seventy thousand million billion years and will be ending in a little over half an hour. So, welcome one and all to Milliways, the Restaurant at the End of the Universe!""----The Restaurant at the End of the UniverseMilliways, also known as The Restaurant at the End of the Universe, can only be visited practically by time travel, as it exists at the end of time and matter. Marvin the Paranoid Android is one character who manages to reach Milliways without the use of time travel, merely by being very patient. One of the restaurant's major attractions is that diners can watch the entire universe end in a Gnab Gib from the windows of the restaurant as they eat. The terminal moment is followed bydessert. Reservations are easily obtained, since they can be booked once the patron returns to his or her original time after their meal, and the restaurant's bill can be paid by depositing a penny in any bank account of the present time: by the end of the universe, the compound interest on that penny over the course of time after 170 quintillion years (short scale) will be enough to pay the extremely high bill. Near-instant transportation to the restaurant can be achieved in certain rarefied circumstances, such as being next to an exploding hyperspatial field generator on the planet where Milliways will eventually be built several billion years after the explosion occurs. Among the items on the menu are various cuts of meat from the very obliging Amiglion Major Cow and the somewhat less obliging vegetables in a green salad. While water and Aldebaran liqueurs are in stock, tea is not. Because of the special number of impossibilities surrounding all aspects of Milliways, their advertising firm penned the following slogan: ""If you've done six impossible things this morning, why not round it off with breakfast at Milliways—the Restaurant at the End of the Universe!"" Believing ""six impossible things before breakfast"" is a quote from the White Queen in Lewis Carroll's Through the Looking-Glass. In the book form of the series, the visit to Milliways takes place in the novel The Restaurant at the End of the Universe. In the different versions of the story, Milliways is built on the ruins of either Magrathea or of Frogstar World B. In Fit the Twenty-Sixth of the radio series, when many of the main characters meet at Milliways, Thor the thunder god asks that champagne be sent to Trillian, and in the process reveals that Arthur Dent and company are seated at Table 42, almost without a doubt an allusion to The Answer to Life, the Universe, and Everything. At the end of the 2005 movie The Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy there is a gag about ""The Restaurant at the End of the Universe"" not being at the temporal end, but at the ""other end"" in terms of location. In the novel The Restaurant at the End of the Universe, a similar venue is referenced that does exist at the beginning of the universe called ""The Big Bang Burger Bar"". According to The Salmon of Doubt, Douglas Adams came up with the idea while listening to Procol Harum's Grand Hotel.---IMBD's5 Reasons The Hitchhiker’s Guide To The Galaxy Needs A Sequel (J.D. Westfall)The 2005 film adaption of Douglas Adams’ beloved novel was the very definition of modest success. Despite pleasing the majoritof fans, it got mixed critical reviews and decent box office returns. However, the film was not enough of a success for anyone to commission a sequel, citing primarily the fact the movie had not earned enough money.Nonetheless, many people still demand a movie based off the original novel’s sequel, The Restaurant at the End of the Universe. In fact, there are many different reasons we need a sequel based off the book. Let’s review a few of these, shall we? 5. It Can Learn From Past MistakesThe original film (abbreviated H2G2) had some tepid reviews, but not really anything outright negative. It would be an easy matter for the producers and writers of a sequel to learn from these reviews, find what went wrong the first time around, and fix it in the sequel.For instance, the main complaint leveled against it is the fact that it was ‘Americanized’, that it had lost some of the British charm and quirkiness that made the novel and other earlier versions so interesting and unique. The reason why?The screenplay was being written by original H2G2 writer Douglas Adams, but he died before completion. Who was brought in to finish and rewrite the screenplay? Karey Kirkpatrick, an American.So look through the bad reviews and write a sequel that can circumvent those, and for goodness sakes, keep the Britishness!4. It Did Earn A ProfitOkay, not quite that successful. But look at the numbers. Accordig to BoxOfficeMojo, its production budget was $50 million (though some sources place it at $45 million), and its worldwide gross was over $100 million. So the expenses were clearly covered, even when you factor in what would’ve been spent on advertising (which the studios rarely specify how much was spent, though it’s never more than the production budget itself).Plus, plenty of sequels get greenlit with worse returns than that. Still, some studios would like a guarantee of better returns, but a sequel may be able to offer that, particularly because….3. The Cast Are Bigger Stars NowA lot has happened since 2005. Sam Rockwell has become the king of independent cinema. Zooey Deschanel has starred in some of the biggest comedy hits of the decade, and taken up starring in a popular sitcom. Mos Def has done… uh, not a whole lot. And Martin Freeman scored the role of John Watson in BBC’s Sherlock, which gets over 10 million views per episode. Oh, and he also played the lead in a little film called The Hobbit. You may have heard of it. It earned over $1 billion at the box office.Eight years ago they were minor stars, and now they’re among the most in-demand actors in their various fields (aside from Mos Def, but he’s primarily a musician anyway). Not only that, all these actors have spoken fondly of their experience with H2G2 and have repeatedly said they’d love to do a sequel.Huge stars, wanting in on the sequel… sounds like a good box office guarantee to me.2. It Was Made By First TimersThe original film was made by production duo Hammer & Tongs (director Garth Jennings and producer Nick Goldsmith). If you look at their credits to date, you’ll see one movie since this one, and none before it. So, the director is a first timer, and one of the producers was a first timer. Surely there were more experienced people involved, right? Well, another of the producers was Robbie Stamp, whose only other credit was producing a video game. Then Douglas Adams was a producer, despite the fact he was dead.Then there’s the executive producer, whose only credit before this was for The Pacifier. I’m amazed this movie turned out as well as it did.Anyway, the point is with this amateur-ish ragtag group, they still pulled off a successful, high-budget film. If a sequel were to be commissioned, they would at least have some film experience this time around. Or, a different route could be taken and hire a more professional crew to do it. Either way, it could work out really well.1. There’s A Great Demand For British ExportsThink back to 2005. How many British exports was America clamoring for? Think about it….None, was there? Just the Americanized version of Ricky Gervais’ The Office, and even then no Americans cared about the original version. But nowadays? Let’s see…Doctor Who is bigger than ever, the season 2 finale of Sherlock has us Yankees banging our heads in misery and wonder, Downton Abbey has hit nearly 8 million views when it gets shown on America’s PBS station, the last James Bond movie took in a staggering $304 million in the U.S. alone! It doesn’t matter what it is, America wants British entertainment!So why not The Restaurant At the End of the Universe?

https://www.kickstarter.com/projects/swanntrailer/swann-the-trailer?ref=discovery_category_newest,swanntrailer/swann-the-trailer,"SynopsisSwann follows the story of a brash small town girl on an adolescent journey to find meaning in life. At sunrise, at the beautiful Rio Grande Gorge Bridge in the New Mexico desert, she crosses paths with Elizabeth Wolff, a newly retired woman determined to start her own adventurous life after a lifetime working as a number cruncher for the government. This mismatched pair drive off on a 24-hour life-changing odyssey into the desert. When Elizabeth’s car runs out of gas, they stumble across Martin Falls, a gun-toting priest undergoing a crisis of faith and his teenage son Simon, who’s in the process of growing up and away from the only home he has ever known -the desert. Simon and Swann, drawn to one another and to the thrill of an adventure, drive off into the night to visit the ancient cliffs and caves that dot the desert sky. Against a starry backdrop of breathtaking beauty, Swann is finally speechless, dropping the sarcasm that has been her armor, accepting that she has finally found something in life which really means something to her. As this beautiful night comes to an end, Swann is suddenly faced with unexplainable violence, and the possibility of losing everything that she has come to love.Director’s statementSwann is a little story with a big heart. A story about evolving, letting go and making a change. Based on a play developed at The Cleveland Play House by acclaimed playwright Sandra Perlman, Swann is a character-driven, quick-witted love story that demonstrates the power of love, connection and community in the face of life’s inevitable questions.There’s a lot of wit and humor coming from this story, mainly from Swann’s sarcastic way of looking at life and her outrageously know-it-all way of expressing herself - at times reminding us of Juno from the movie with the same title. Swann takes her completely honest views of life and makes us smile or even laugh at her rants while she fearlessly challenges everything that gets in the way on her quest to find the answers she needs. This is what keeps the story’s edgy.Shooting locationAbout the creatorsDaniel Börjesson -Writer, Director,ProducerSwedish born DANIEL BÖRJESSON is an experienced award-winning director noted for his compelling work of visual storytelling.

This is what keeps the story’s edgy.Shooting location - New MexicoAbout the creatorsDaniel Börjesson - Director, Producer, Co-writerSwedish born DANIEL BÖRJESSON is an experienced award-winning director noted for his compelling work of visual storytelling.

Star ratings did not correlate to human emotions, and we would like to fix this problem so we could all feel happier about our online shopping.We were also interested in opinions of other people, as we thought that our experience could be biased, so we conductedresearch on 250 individuals.We validated this problem with random Americans, and almost 60% (144 individuals) validated our assumption.Then we asked them if our idea made sense, and every second person was in favor of our ideaSo with your help we would love to build Dena.With your help we need to; further improve the codes, get help from a user experience designer, front and back-end developer, improve the database, and launch Dena in beta version.We hope you would support us in this fun and challenging endeavor.","Development, especially coding part could be not timely or requires constant and unnecessary changes. As a counter measure we are looking forward to working closely with the development team, and prepare design mock up and increase communication. Other than purely technical risks that are mostly related to development are not expected. The biggest risk could be delay of the launch date by max of three weeks, which would have no significant financial or material, or legal impact.The biggest risk towards realization of this idea, was idea validation, which was already completed through market research, and testing of hypothesis over the validity of star related product rating.

https://www.kickstarter.com/projects/drwickedbeer/dr-wicked-colored-concept-beer?ref=discovery_category_newest,drwickedbeer/dr-wicked-colored-concept-beer,"Dr. Wicked is a collection of four colored beers, created by the fugitive mad man with the same name. Each one contains a unique characteristic, along with its own style, color and percentage of alcohol. Based on the DNA of excepcional test subjects, these beers were created to unleash the monster inside you. Are you ready for it?The first and most light of the beers, Dorian Gray is a blue colored beer with 4.5% of alcohol. It´s a Pilsner with collagen in it´s mixture, which will keep you young as long as you keep drinking it.Careful, for Dragwlya is a red colored beer with a 5% of alcohol. This Irish Red is imbued with a secret that will transform it´s color and texture when exposed to UV-A light. Care for a sip?This black colored beer has a 6% of alcohol, but don´t let it fool you, in it there is a Dark Lager mixed with deep and thick darkness.Beware and walk away while you can. This green colored beer has in its mixture a 10% amount of alcohol. Dare to try the force of this Imperial Ipa and experiment the transformation.While all beers need four essential ingredients, which are malt, yeast, hop and water, most of them need to be in an amber colored bottle, due to the light, which can alter the flavor of the beer. However, thanks to our high quality ingredients, our beers have light resistance, which allow them to be in a transparent bottle. Also, the colorant used in the mixture is alimentary degree and the best in the market.As a special launch edition and thank you gift, we printed a unique label, made 100% of wood, ornate with two layers of golden foil, accompanied with a handle and back label.Thanks to the label, we took the crafted concept a bit to far. You can see it in the next video, which shows the process of preparing the label for its addition to the bottle.Meanwhile, our post-kickstarter label will have the same design but, instead of being wood, this one will be printed in paper. You can see it in the next picture.As for the bottle, we still have plenty of them. The size of it allows us to put 355 millimeters of each beer.A few months back, Julio, Jesus and Magaly were working in designing a beer for a client of theirs. When they got the bottle, they started thinking and, after some hours, they got nothing. To have some ideas, they went to a bar after work. While seeing all the crafted beers available, they realized two things: most of the bottles are amber color. Therefore, all beers looks the same, except the label. It´s a label war!The next day, while working on the beer of their client, they got an idea for themselves: a colored beer with transparent bottle, where the label was so awesome that immediately defeated all the crafted beer labels, and fortunately, we got there.Now, a few months later, we manage to get a beer test lot of 70 litters each one, which helped us define the styles and flavor of the beers. Thanks to that, the bottles and the labels, we were able to do presentations on some of the local bars of Monterrey, where we got a huge positive response from our audience.The people were amazed with the concept and the taste and we are proud of Dr. Wicked. However, now that we introduce it to a few individuals of the world, we need to produce it in mass, to give everyone the chance of enjoy this fun and crazy concept of colored beer.And that´s where you come in! With your support, we can start a mass production of Dr. Wicked and take this beer to all the world! Be part of our movement and let´s introduce these beers to everyone!Everyone can help, and we have rewards for everyone! These four posters are in our first reward tiers and you can get them in PDF or printed in high quality paper. It´s your choice! Also, we will send you our Technical Sheets in PDF with more information about our beers, in any of the reward tier you pledge. We have more ideas for rewards, but we will be talking about them during the campaign.Also, our rewards from $500 pesos to above have a four formulas package, with all the branding in an amazing box. We have two options, the limited edition label or the post-kickstarter edition label. If you are a collector, we suggest you hurry and go for our wood label. They are limited! Here´s a full shot.Now, we must clarify: due to Kickstarter policies, we can´t give alcohol as a reward. Nevertheless, you will receive the bottles, the label, even colored liquid inside of it, but no beer. If we can´t give you our product properly, we will give you the most close of it.We obtained the styles and the flavor we were looking for. However, we will need new labels, more bottles and pay the cost of a beer mass production, which includes the work and the ingredients of the quality needed. Our goal will allow us to fulfill all the assets we need and start producing Dr. Wicked.We thank you for your support!","As we mention in a previous section, due to Kickstarter policies, we aren´t allowed to send alcohol as a reward.

We wanted our final costumer to give us some feedback, we wanted to know what do they like or dislike from Dr. Wicked craft beer so we can renovate our formula so the final product can be one of the best of its kind.FOCUS GROUPSSome of the comments we receive in the product survey:""The concept is amazing!! i love it!

Woman - 31A ONE OF A KIND CRAFT BEER, BUT VERY REAL JUST LIKE YOU.We want to continue with the production and take Dr. Wicked to everyone in this world, there are so many people around the globe that could like to taste a conceptual craft beer like this. This proyect is very important to us because it represents a challenge where we are going to test our skills from advertisers and graphic designers because we are changing a product that people know from some many years.Our craft beer is being created with all the effort and heart, we are investing a lot of time and affection to be a beer that you can be proud to show it to your friends, that you can give it on some special date, and why not! help you close deals! Being Dr. Wicked a support for that deal that you want to conclude.At this time craft beer is growing, in the year 2016 there was a growth of 56% and have opened 144 brewers craft in Mexico.DR. WICKED BRANDAs the project progressed, we went through stages of design change, the label and bottle were evolving. We always thought of projecting something like a drink in a bottle that had a style of old syrup or potion, but we ran into the difficulty of finding something like that in Mexico, from the moment we wanted a transparent bottle and things got complicated, because for a beer is always an amber bottle.On the other hand,we wanted a label in wood, we believed that this was impossible but visiting our printing supplier, at that time they were receiving a test paper which was wood, what a luck right? The supplier made an exception with us, since that paper was not for sale, but they fell in love with our project, then they agreed to print us on that tight roll of paper, they were so moved by the concept that they decided to stick our label to The Annual Beer Label competition by HP (Hewlett Packard) (we still do not know the results).So we opted to take a limited edition with our wood label, which also had its craft process to be able to place it in the bottles. It was not easy but Dr. Wicked's team make it possible.We have devoted a lot of energy, effort, and time to this project, it is not a hobby and it is not something that was born overnight, we have done research to achieve a product of excellent quality with very creative that we are sure people will love. Four styles of beer were created to give consumers the opportunity to identify with one and really enjoy it when they have it in their hands.We want to show that in Monterrey Mexico we have quality products and that we also know how to be creative and conceptual.We need your help!Now we are at a point where we need the support to continue producing this craft beer, we seek to raise $ 258,800 MXN and we want to achieve it in 40 days, which will be used to achieve the following goals:How can I be part and help?This has not been an easy path, we have had moments of despair and many times we have been through the mind to have to pass this project to the drawer waiting again an opportunity and that probably (as almost always happens) is forgotten, but we do not do it because we can not stop believing in us.Invested hours, effort and all our income are not enough to make this product as big as we visualize it.With each contribution, you make us closer to achieving our goal, and you can be credited with special rewards that Dr. Wicked has prepared for you, whether it be a poster, a shirt, a cold beer, and... we can even put your signature on one of our beers. You really will not regret it, our rewards are great!","Due to Kickstarter policies, we aren´t allowed to send alcohol as a reward.

https://www.kickstarter.com/projects/thedevilsrevenge/the-devils-double-sequel?ref=discovery_category_newest,thedevilsrevenge/the-devils-double-sequel,"If this is the first you have heard of Latif Yahia, then please see below for more details about this project.We are aiming for The Devils Revenge to be the largest crowd funded project of Hollywood standards to hit your screens. The Devils Revenge is based on the bestselling autobiography published in 2006 by one of the world’s most interesting characters, Latif Yahia. Now if you haven’t heard of Latif Yahia, then I am sure you have heard of Saddam Hussein and possibly his notorious son Uday Hussein.Uday Hussein gives fictional characters such as Tony Montana a run for their money, as an Iraqi playboy known for his sadistic antics terrorizing the Iraqi people while his father was in power. Because of the numerous attempts on Uddays life he required a fidai (bullet catcher), someone to be a double for him in situations where someone might try to kill him (which if you’re Uday is quite likely to be very often)Uday had attended one of Baghdad’s finest schools with a more than suitable candidate for the position, the son of a wealthy Iraqi businessman, Latif Yahia.Even in school together, pupils would remark on the uncanny similarities between Uday & Latif but it wasn’t until years later when Latif was serving on the frontline in the Iran-Iraq war that he was brought to Uday to be offered his new job…As the Double for the Devil.Even if you haven’t read “The Devils Double” or seen the thrilling blockbuster starring Dominic Cooper & directed by Bond Director Lee Tamahori you can imagine what a life serving as the most hated man in Iraq would entail. However, the story gets even more interesting after Latif flees Iraq with the help of the American CIA. This is where The Devils Revenge will begin filming. The Devils Double does not end on the same lines as the book, much to the displeasure of Latif’s avid readers and supporters and since the release of the film Latif Yahia has gained all the rights back to his books and wishes to produce the sequel to The Devils Double himself and call it The Devils Revenge.Through the agency hired for “The Devils Revenge” the movie has now raised a huge £6,508,424 & we are a tiny £791,575 in comparison away from the project being ready for production. This money is deposited in an account in a banking institution and not one cent can be touched until all money has been raised. Nobody has access to the funds until the full amount is raised and then it is tied up in contracts for the production.  Dominic Cooper is lined up to reprise his role as Latif/Uday, with some well known Directors & producers in talks to sign up for the production process. We want you to join our team, don’t just help us finance it, be part of it. Unlike many other movies, we are offering you the opportunity to be in the movie. If you don’t wish to be in the movie, you can have the opportunity to be on set, meet the cast or spend some time with the Author. Now you can imagine why we want to raise the rest of the funding for The Devils Revenge to come from independent investors, donators and fans. The people who wish to support this cause are the people who stand for a world where truth is an almost forgotten word and who wish to see movies and depictions of real life events and not see the movies the governments of the world want you to see in order to subconsciously brainwash people into thinking that their wrong actions are right or can be justified like we see in American Sniper.This movie, as in the book it’s based on “The Black Hole” will give the viewer an insight into the way the world stands now both politically and economically especially with the creation of different terrorist groups in the middle east such as ISIL and how American pretends to fight them whilst having creating them and continuing to finance & support them.By supporting this project you will be apart of a new world order, people who will be remembered as supporting a cause with shows the truth of how the world runs politically and what is the consequences for people who stand up for their rights and for the rights of other people.THE BLACK HOLE Book by: Latif Yahia Chapter 1 , A European WelcomeI think it’s also important to make investors, donators, supporters, fans & especially critics to be aware of the fact that Latif never told his story for any personal gain or profit. His story was told for his personal safety & also to make the world aware of the truth. He was advised to eliminate many parts of his books that would incriminate that guilty due to the fact that they would try to assassinate him which has happened multiple times but he has been quoted as saying that he would rather be assassinated than be as cowardice as to cover up the crimes of the guilty. The proceeds of “The Devils Double” & “The Black Hole” were donated to charity and he did not make a dime from the movie based on his life story, in fact he lost money in the battle to regain his rights.The movie will not only be a film of Hollywood standards to be crowd funded by it’s viewers but it will also be a stylish, thrilling tale of a political cat & mouse chase where it’s one man against the Intelligence services worldwide and some insight into how they work and how they react to not getting what they want. The movie will have you feeling personally involved and imagining what you would do if you happened to be in the shoes of Latif Yahia, would you turn on the people of your country and work with an intelligence service hated worldwide or would you do what you think is right and stand up for your rights and for the rights of everyone else.As you are reading this you are possibly thinking of the way the world stands now, ISIS/ISIL are the most terrifying thing to come out of the Iraq Invasion, Russia and America are at each others throats over the conflict in Syria whilst millions of refuges from Iraq, Syria, Libya, Somalia flee from their war torn countries to seek safety in Europe and other countries in the Western World. Everybody is now wondering if the Iraqi Invasion escalated these events, people are beginning too see the huge flaws and consequences of invading Arab countries to install “Democracy” that never develops. Latif Yahia faces ongoing suffering from the events shown in The Devils Double, and the events to be shown in The Devils Revenge. He has been diagnosed with the long-term illness Multiple Sclerosis and he remains stateless 24 years after leaving Iraq. Not only this but he is currently dealing with the mysterious disappearance of his wife and child. After leading a life filled with torment, Latif Yahia wishes to see his life’s work portrayed exactly as it happened and in his own words.Dear Friends,Most of you will have seen the movie of my time in Iraq when I was forced to become the fidai (bullet-catcher) of Uday Saddam Hussein. That movie was based on my first book, 'The Devil's Double'.Whilst that movie was very popular on it's release all over the world, my memories of it are tainted by arguments with the producers over the way my story was told.After a legal dispute, I now own all the film rights.Not only for that first book but also for my second entitled 'The Black Hole' which continues my life-story after I left Iraq.It has been described as a true-life Jason Bourne 'cat and mouse' adventure through Europe as I struggled to find a peaceful life and avoid pressures and threats from Uday, the CIA and European secret services.A screenplay has been written which is very true to the book provisionally called 'The Devil's Revenge'.But I do not want the story altered by producers or influenced by government agencies.I have therefore decided to try and produce the film by myself.Millions of people around the world enjoyed 'The Devil's Double' and, if you would like to see a sequel then this is your chance to help make it happen.Many projects are now 'crowd-funded' and I ask if you could donate £10  (or more if you can afford it) to help get this project into production.If you can help, you will be kept informed of progress and your name will be included in the credits.This is an exciting opportunity for me and, I hope, for you.It will result in a movie that will make the world sit up and take note of how international politics and governments work and how badly they treat individuals.I thank you.Latif YahiaAuthor / Producer - See more at: www.thedevilsrevenge.comWe are asking you to donate towards our cause, any donation will be appreciated and not forgotten.

When the Gardai make their oath they swear to uphold the Constitution and serve the nation. Why they would not help me to locate my wife and child proves they are behind the kidnapping of my child, I only wanted my right…nothing more.Living in this new world it’s very hard to find people who lead their lives with Dignity & Respect for themselves and for others no matter what their nationality may be. The Gardai are now mere money collectors for the state and not law enforcers who uphold the Constitution. They have turned the majority of Irish people into machines who just accept the rules of Corruption, brown envelopes (who has the money, has the power) even though the Gardai have a set of laws to follow they continuously abuse their power against people if they take it personally. There can not be one set of laws for the Gardai and another for the people of Ireland. They can fabricate any evidence to use against you, buy off your Solicitor or Barrister, bring you to court for no reason basically they can do whatever they want to the people as they have nobody to control them. Stories like mine are not uncommon they are just not reported by the media or uploaded and shared on the internet as people are too afraid of the Gardai and have little information as to what their rights actually are.",This project is 100% risk free because of the vast amount of Investors and donators so far.

Or click here to watch it!Update 1/7/12: We now have a website dedicated specifically to this project and Tiny Texas Roadhouses! There's all kinds of new information on it! Check it out here!  Update 1/6/12: We will be teaming up with Todd Ludzinsky of Caravan Services (a company based out of New Braunfels, Texas that specializes in restoring vintage campers) to make this project be the best of its kind! WOOHOO!   Calling all Airstream Enthusiasts!  All Tiny House Enthusiasts!  And anyone who has ever lived in a house!Yes…We are doing it… Proving there is a way to build a Tiny Texas Roadhouse out of 99% Pure Salvage and have it be aerodynamic, toxin free, made with all American parts and labor, and built to last for decades more with high energy efficiency and low maintenance. No American Icon is more deserving of our attention because of what we represent then the Airstream trailer, so we have decided to do something many people are wanting to do, but we will do it the ""Tiny Texas Way"" with materials from an old Texas house. Throughout the remodeling process we will be creating a full-length and comprehensive video tutorial series AND documentary which will be posted online for the whole world to have access to when we are finished.  If you haven't heard of Tiny Texas Houses or Brad Kittel, then you my friend, are not in ""The Know.""  Visit our website (www.tinytexashouses.com) to get in ""The Know"" and come back to this page…that way, as you read on casually, your heart will begin to skip beats…you mind will start to race…you'll start smiling uncontrollably…and you'll be just as excited to see this project come to life as we are!  Seeing our previous work will also help you visually understand and anticipate just how beautiful and unique this creation could be. This is what we have...Message from Brad Kittel - Tiny Texas Houses is going to get into the Roadhouse Art business by proving once again that we can do it with 99% Pure Salvage. So what better way then to start with an Airstream, one of the American Icons of class, structure, style, and the energy saving benefits of a truly aerodynamic design. This is not a box to haul into the wind and call a house, but a sleek skin within which we can create a unique refuge and sanctuary. The intent is to create another example of what I can do with a 99% Pure Salvage building materials ethos using antique beaded wood, tin ceilings, roofing tiles, architectural ornaments, lighting, and so much that we have found in old houses and things that we have salvaged over the years.I want everyone to see how to do the same in a safe, toxin free way as we film the whole experience, compile a still shot documentary of the details involved, the before, during, after shots that everyone loves because they make it easy to copy. I will narrate some episodes through the complicated stuff, have direction on plumbing and electric for the novice, and hopefully be thorough enough so everyone can be empowered to do-it-yourself. I am not trying to teach people how to create a perfect result, but one that is artistic, functional, could last for decades or more, and can provide a healthy sanctuary for anyone to call home. This is my effort to once again give as much information out as possible to make this option available to everyone who wants to do it themselves. These old shells can be bought for $500-$3,000 all over the country and moved where they are needed. I can not build a bottom or skin as good, or as light as this, and there is no reason to reinvent the wheel when so many exist just waiting for good samaritans to come along and save them. Please help me make this possible so that they can all be brought back on line again and play a part in the Pure Salvage Living Renaissance I have spent 30 years trying to bring to life.  Thank you for all your support!  Brad Kittel If this project gets the funding it needs, we could have it built and completed as soon as mid January. We do want to express that although we are proficient at building our Tiny Texas Houses, remodeling an Airstream is an entire new endeavor and we will be learning and problem solving along the way! The tutorial videos will be released after the project has been completed, with the documentary coming last, after the completion party! As soon as the Airstream is finished we will be hosting a ceremonial ""Maiden Voyage"" celebration, commemorating the completion of the project. Everyone that contributes receives an invitation. Those attending the ceremony will have a chance to win over 50 door prizes such as:Also, as a contributor you can schedule to stay overnight inside the Airstream once it is completed. All contributors get full access to the blog, tutorial videos, and documentary AT THE LOWEST contribution of $25.00! That's full access to all the knowledge you would need to remodel one of these yourself. We are going to try and be as comprehensible as possible with our tutorials and, of course, Tiny Texas is always around for consultations.Everyone that contributes gets to be a member of the blog and website (www.tinytexasroadhouse.com) during the construction.You will get to participate in the development and ideas of the airstream as the project moves along. We hope to create a community where everyone gets to pitch in ideas and be involved in this project! The Highest contribution will get to personally name this very first Tiny Texas Roadhouse, which is sure to go to down in history! But that's not all....check out our full incentive list to see just how sweet our project benefits really are.===========================================================We here at Tiny Texas Houses have watched Kickstarter with avid interest for sometime now. We've seen how blessed and fortunate projects have been, meeting their goal and going above and beyond it from contributions. This is why we want to list the things we will do if funding continues even after our goal is met! The more money that is raised for this project the wilder and ""greener"" we will get with our creation. Additional funding will bring about things like an advanced composting toilet or space age waste system, solar panels, appliances, water and air filtration system and much much more.  Brad Kittel, mastermind and owner or Tiny Texas Houses, is a very ambitious and nothing short of eccentric man. He, along with the Tiny Texas Houses Team, have many visions and projects in mind. Brad owns a large amount of property and a large amount of ""tools"" (man slang for toys) that we have in our mind the idea to create a unique and one-of-a-kind Airstream Makeover Course at our Tiny Texas Houses facilities. If funding continues into higher levels we will be bringing not only this airstream project to life but other evolutionary ideas that could forever change the Texas landscape and perhaps even…the WORLD! -$45,000: Our goal is met! We remodel the airstream and release the tutorial videos and documentary online for everyone! For a limited period of time after we finish this project, contributors will even get the chance to stay a night in the Airstream. We will have a marvelous ceremony with great door prizes at Tiny Texas Houses. If the project is a hit, we will add custom remodeling of Airstreams into our business, possibly even doing the work for others on their Airstreams that they wish to bring back to life.-$60,000: Tiny Texas Houses will release a 12 month calendar with photos from our airstream project and opening ceremony celebration. We may also include photos of YOURS AND OTHERS Airstream Remodel projects (It depends upon how many photos we can get on a calendar). Everybody who donates $100.00 or more gets all their original incentives plus one calendar! -$75,000: Tiny Texas Houses releases a full colored coffee table ""picture book"" with photos of our project and ceremony! The book will also include a written portion of the steps and tricks to using salvaged materials on your very own Airstream! Everybody who donates $250.00 or more gets all their original incentives plus one book! -$100,000: Tiny Texas Houses will create a hands-on, crash course in Airstream Remodeling which we will host from our facility. We will purchase another airstream to remodel, bring it in, and give a 4-7 day long building seminar on how to remodel it using salvaged wood. If it is successful, we will continue hosting these educational hands-on classes throughout the year and beyond! Everybody who donates $500.00 or more gets all the original incentives AND gets to attend this entire seminar for ABSOLUTELY FREE (food and lodging not included). Check out some of the seminars we've hosted already at our Youtube channel (www.youtube.com/puresalvageliving) -$150,000: Tiny Texas Houses will use the money to install water and electrical systems on our 50 acre estate and open up a Vintage RV Camping Village with over 20 spaces! Rest assured this will be a most unique and exquisite facility with the ""Tiny Texas"" flare and inspiration we put into all our projects. Brad and company have been itching to turn his large property into a mix of Tiny House Villages….this will be the beginning of a very special place to visit once infrastructure is properly put into place. Everybody that donates $1,000.00 or more gets all their original incentives PLUS a FREE three night stay in the village once it is developed in your personal RV or one of our Tiny Texas Houses' creations.-$300,000: Salvage Faire construction gets underway. (NEW VIDEO HERE) Brad and the Tiny Texas Team have a large portion of property in which they want to install infrastructure and create Texas' first authentic, Pure Salvage Flea Market called ""Salvage Faire."" Vintage RV's and Tiny Texas Roadhouses will be part of the vendor spaces that will be on site. This is a HUGE PROJECT that we've merely not had the funds to finance the endeavor with…but believe us…WE HAVE THE VISION….Everybody that donates $500.00 or more gets first choice at renting a ""Salvage Booth"" out at Salvage Faire and be a part of the opening weekend.Also: At this mark, the highest contributor will have the option of having their personal airstream remodeled during the first ""Tiny Texas House Airstream Remodel Seminar.""-$500,000 and beyond….Tiny Texas Houses will establish the VERY FIRST ""School for Airstream Renovation"" at our 20,000 sq. ft warehouse in Gonzales, Texas. Having these kind of funds will enable us to develop this facility into a full fledged three bay Airstream Remodeling Facility, where we can teach hands-on salvage and renovation techniques to the public complete with a full curriculum and certification system through Tiny Texas Houses! Check out the photos of our warehouse space and facility at (www.tinytexashouses.com).Oh the things Brad Kittel and the Tiny Texas team can do with the proper funding…We have many, many dreams…and if these dreams begin to become a reality….well… we'll have to start sharing these dreams with you! Thank you for your support, we look forward to making this project come to life and provide everyone with the educational resources to do-it-yourself!  - Brad Kittel and the Tiny Texas Team","We've made over 80 Tiny Texas Houses of all shapes, sizes, and colors so we've grown quite efficient at building them. That said…We're confident that by reaching our goal we can absolutely make this happen, and hopefully in a  short amount of time.Once the Airstream has been completed and we host a super amazing and wild opening ceremony party we will begin taking names and dates for overnight stays…We realize that this could be a well endowed and funded project…and there could be a large amount of people who want to stay in the airstream and feel its majesty for a night. We will do our best to coordinate and work with everyone that contributes to our cause and fulfill our end of the bargain! We intend on keeping in touch with everyone as best we can! The ""To Infinity and Beyond"" projects will be a bit more time consuming to organize, create, and distribute. Expect at least a 3-6 months post opening ceremony party to see any calendars or books arrive in the mail. If the funding arrives though…rest assured these projects will GET UNDER WAY.Everyone that contributes $50.00 and up gets priority booking to schedule an overnight stay in the Airstream, with the higher contributions getting highest priority. We will do our best to accommodate everyone in a timely manner. That said, once reservations are made your incentive is considered used, and cannot be changed. If you are unable to fill your reservations you will have to contact us to set up a future date.",https://www.kickstarter.com/projects/318443601/tiny-texas-houses-building-plans?ref=discovery_category_newest,318443601/tiny-texas-houses-building-plans,"9 years ago I began pioneering the 95% Pure Salvage Building techniques that have been perfected over the years in the form of Tiny Texas Houses.  They are now built using Space Magic, a term I coined for making spaces seem much bigger than they are through illusions of a sort few others in the tiny house industry seem to understand.  I originally committed to build 100 examples and have over 80 completed, putting me far in the lead for having built the most Tiny Houses in the world, but more importantly, the only organic tiny houses using these unique methods I've developed. My houses use the Venturi effects to cool themselves, have high efficiency insulation and enable someone to live on or off grid with comfort, or with minimal energy consumption if on the grid. They are free of the toxins that now fill most housing built in the world today. The book explains how the chemicals from so many of the cheap new building materials cause or contribute to cancer, Fibro-Myalgia, Lupus, migraines, and many other immune system disorders that I have case after case to prove.  Now it is time to create the building plans so others can also build organic sustainable tiny houses too. The intention is to get them out to all the groups that help people for FREE! Yes! To the groups that help the people that need empowerment and housing the most will get it sent to them for free. Some of the many houses I have created already can be seen inside and out in photoblogs onhttp://tinytexashouses.com/. My goal now is to create 30 building plans, the book on how to modify the plans to fit your pieces and parts of salvage you may find, such as windows and doors, how to get the salvaged materials for little more than human energy, and numerous examples in color picture form, of other houses besides the 30 in the plans. I call this concept thePure Salvage Living Renaissanceand hope to see it spread around the world.  We already have a following that extends to nearly every country that has the internet. The book will also have a variety of stair & ladderplans, different kitchen and bath layouts, so you can use one building plan, but swap out floor plans and elements inside.  If possible, we will create translations for other countries where needed if the demand is there based on the contributions.They need to reach the people who need empowerment most, thus they will be Free, including the shipping at $15 a box, to the groups that help the elderly, the homeless, the handicapped, the disadvantaged. This is why I am finally asking for help after creating enough prototypes that I have paid for myself with the money I made in my younger days and customers along the way.I am not good enough at drafting and drawing to do this myself so I must pay for it. I plan to hire the qualified people it will take to put this vast array of creative designs and ideas for making space feel bigger into a format that others can use to create their Tiny Organic Houses. I will do it both digitally and on paper to get them out to the entire world in more than one language. This is not about just the building plans, but also a special book to tell how to get the salvage materials, and how to adapt them so as to build with the parts you might find in your salvage hunting that will not be the same size. This will be essential for your success that it go with 30 sets of my best Tiny Texas House designs for odds are, you can not duplicate everything in the same sizes. I already have help lined up in the UK, and will find more here, but I am intent on tapping people people with talent and skills to create the plans from around the world if possible so as to get the creative building juices flowing around the world. I do not want to take advantage of those who will do the work but spread the resources to the creative minds, passionate spirits, and those with the desire to help change the way we build houses on our planet.  The house designs will incorporate sustainable materials mixed with 5% new materials such as insulation, wiring, plumbing lines, nails, screws, and as few new items as possible. The idea is that the standard can be reached if you want to, but less salvage is also possible such that at least the goal is attainable this way.The plans will be available as inexpensively as we can get them out to everyone once published, which this project's contributions will make possible by offsetting the upfront costs. For those that contribute, you will not be able to buy them anywhere for less after they are created so support us NOW please and get a great reward plus the good feeling of helping so many who can not help themselves. I ask for help in hopes of providing these to the homeless, handicapped, disadvantaged, and groups helping those in need at no cost and keeping the cost to others affordable. No one offers such plans now for what your contribution will buy you. I will also design and build at least one house designed for the handicapped access so that we can include that in the plan sets if we are successful with this campaign. I will do that with seminars that offer contributors who want to come and learn through building seminars and thus contributors can also learn how to build if they can come here for them. I suspect most know someone who needs that type of house and will be inspired to help. I am hoping the following for Tiny Texas Houses that reaches around the world will support this venture by sharing to awaken others to the possibilities if they can not contribute themselves to help assure its success. Perhaps with this step, I may finally open the door for many who do not even know this option exists. Then they can build a toxin free homes for their children, parents, or family. We can promote the Pure Salvage Living Renaissance to prove sustainable houses can be built without destroying the last of the natural resources left on our dear Mother Earth. I believe the low prices for the plans will be what it will takes to spread the concept of Pure Salvage Building around the world at hyper-speed.The book is already mostly written outlining two important areas for this to happen. It will tell how to adapt your plans for the windows and doors you find, or some of the other optional materials choices that what might have been used on the house the plans are based on. With over 80 houses built, three more under way, and 17 left to finish the set of 100 examples of Tiny Texas Houses, I have ideas still to be implemented so they are still getting better as I go. The book will also tell you much aboutwhat to look for when doing a salvage job, how to identify problems that might be dangerous, and of treasures that might be hidden in a Salvage Mine.  There will be pictures of houses we have torn down as well as those we have built in full color. If we have money left I will continue with a series of books that will help families to create businesses for doing this together.As I turn 60 this year I am determined to find a way to free myself from the 90 hour weeks as a manager so as to be able to go do speaking tours, help set up Pure Salvage Outposts as Co-ops, as well as to write other books on the subject. It seems none have developed the knowledge base or experience that i have in my 35 years of salvage remodeling and building who are willing to do this. My lifetime that started with digging in dumpsters at 6 years old may be of benefit to the world and thus, retirement may be at least another decade away. Far too many people have sent emails to let me know their need is greater than my desire to finally take a break.Imagine all the inventory that could be saved in the near Ghost Towns of the industrial age like Detroit, Cincinnati, and so many others outside the once population filled midwest.  Farms that are no longer viable without the children that worked for free, now being sold off to corporations that tear down and throw the barns, houses, and outbuildings into the dump rather than salvage them, create jobs, housing, and a future for the rural community that is also dying on the vine.  The big risk is not the cost of doing it if we get the money, but of not doing it if we do not have the means this crowd funding can create.With 42,000,000 people out of work in America, an equal number on food stamps, the trillion dollars in salvage out there could fund Salvage mining, Salvage building, and much of that could all evolve from these plans and the books that follow.  Towns should thrive using less utilities, no new infra-structure and thus they can survive with less taxes, allowing for tinier houses instead of requiring 700 sf minimums to build.  Houses being portable means they can go with the elders as their level of care needs grow.  This concept is  is potentially full of solutions.  If one has to move far away or passes on, the kids can unbolt the porch floor, fold down the porch roof, pick the portable tiny houses up, and move them to where they want to live.  I will overcome the few challenges I have had keeping us from doing this with the money by using the crowd funding. The time has come at last to ask for help, something I have found difficult in my life to the point of eating out of dumpsters in my 20's after getting a college degree and learning it was not a good thing to put on my applications for up until then, I have worked since I was 12 years old and been able to survive, get through college, and live on my own when I left 3 days after graduating high school.  I thank you for sharing, for contributing if you can, and for your interest in sustainable building in this Tiny Texas House form, or any other you choose.Please join me in turning a life of salvage mining, salvage building, and salvage hunting into the solutions that so many seem to need in these troubled times. As the new ice age and downsizing shrink housing needs, Tiny Houses made from the salvage of big houses built over the last century will provide healthy solutions that makes millionaires out of many who had no other options before I founded this path I call the Pure Salvage Living Renaissance.","We do not have a lot of risks as I simply need to stay alive so that I can tell the kids that can draft, draw, edit the books, and help manifest the written account of what I have spent these last couple decades learning how to do.  I am in great health I believe, so it is simply a matter of putting on paper the drawing to show how I build a tiny house out of salvage that will travel down the road on a trailer if you want, at 65 miles an hour without damaging it.  I want to find the right people to draw up the plans, edit the book, and make this possible, pay them fairly, and be sure it is done to the top standards possible.   I will be able to go at this task, with the trove of pictures I have that demonstrate without a thousand words, the many houses built, thus the book showing them inside and out, as well as how to adapt your parts to these floor plans and designs.  This is the hardest task ahead once the cost for doing it, my biggest challenge to date is taken care of to pay the people, get them printed and ready for digital distribution, and send them out around the world, to all the organizations that are working to help the elderly, empower the homeless, assist the handicapped, and disadvantaged.  I plan to do get the book and all the plans to each for Free, no cost for shipping or the materials.  That way we can accelerate the speed at which awareness of the toxic houses, the alternative path that salvage offers, and the solutions without them spending a dime.  Any profits from selling the materials will be plowed back into this as well.  The risk is that I will not be able to get enough of these out there in other languages, and to so many as 42,000,000 people in this country alone are out of work and on food stamps or assistance from a government that is broke.    While I have a tiny house to live in on site, the project will require that I can provide a place to stay here for some of the people that can do the drawings and create the plans, give them enough income so they can eat, and to take care of their needs while they help manifest this and get the printing done at a price that will enable us to put it out to the world as cheaply as possible  I want to be able to also provide this to those in real need free, if we get enough funding.  I do not need to get paid personally to do this, but I realize the talented kids paying student loans, and older guys supporting families that might get us some old fashioned hand drawn illustrations.    Money does not buy happiness, giving does, but people still need to survive.You can see the houses I have already built on the photoblogs for Tiny Texas Houses.  That was full of massive risks.  You can see I have done all of the salvage mining with its many risks and challenges.  What I have not done is create building plans an a book to show others how to do it too. My history of creating this option so far without help, is far more challenging than the creation of the building plans, instructional  books, and videos that we can use so that others can do this all around the world.  If I thought there was someone else out there as qualified to do this as i am, someone else willing to take on these risks and challenges, I might just let them do it.  Unfortunately, no one else seems to have the desire, experience, fortitude, and proven willingness to work the 80+ hours a week it takes, or to give up what it will take, to make the Pure Salvage Living Renaissance a part of our culture around the globe again.  I hope the challenge of funding it will be taken care of with the help of a few thousand friends that have been following me for the last few decades."

https://www.kickstarter.com/projects/lawnmower/almost-autonomous-snowblower?ref=discovery_category_newest,lawnmower/almost-autonomous-snowblower,"I appreciate Kickstarter, and all of its members, I am hoping I can interest most of you in my latest project. I have already funded a project called the ""Almost Autonomous Lawnmower"" I have a private backer for that. The Almost Autonomous Snowblower is based on the same principal as the Lawnmower. Please feel free to look it up, to see how it works.This project I have mostly built and am currently looking for some backers for it. I have the mechanical part of it built. The AASB moves forward, backwards and turns. I am in the process of getting the blower working, as well as the on board webcam, and putting a cool cover over the batteries. Then the next big thing will be testing it. Currently there is no snow in Iowa. May have to go to Alaska. LOL.My funding will help get the parts and testing. I am also looking for a business minded person to help me through the process of producing, marketing and sales of this product. This too will cost money. I want you to know, I don't take this lightly. I am new at this, but make no mistakes about it, I am serious about this and will at all costs, bring this to life.Thank you,John Loghry","There are a few risks with this project. The first one is this has never been done before. No one has developed a completely battery operated snowblower, in a time where people believe you need gas to have enough power. I have a 1/2 HP, 24 volt DC motor to turn just the blower part. I have investigated what is needed to throw this snow, and I believe this should do it. As I said in my other post, this has not been tested yet. I am currently trying to work with a local  cold storage company to allow a snow making machine to blow snow in there so, I can test it. My other option is just to go to Colorado or some where else. I  am confident it will work though. The only other concern is safety, I will also put sensors on it to locate people or animals that are too close. Thank you for looking.John Loghry",https://www.kickstarter.com/projects/lawnmower/a-robotic-lawnmower-and-robotic-snowblower?ref=discovery_category_newest,lawnmower/a-robotic-lawnmower-and-robotic-snowblower,,"Throughout this process of building and testing of these devices, there are inherit issues. Of course safety is always one of the top issues when you don""t have complete control over something. This has been addressed by proximity switches, I am currently testing other sensors that may be better. But, believe me, when I say, safety of these products are always top of our agenda.  The other potential issue I currently have is the range of the streaming video. Currently it is the range of your router, which usually is 20 to 100 feet or so, depending type and placement of your router. I am in the process of building an app which would allow you to operate and stream video over longer distances, including other states. This would be done over your smartphone, tablet or even your computer. I am hoping to make some redesigns of the products if possible. only because I don""t think they look all that eye appealing, however this won""t be a major factor, just something on my wish list. I would love to get these going as quickly as possible, I have this setup for 30 days. I am ready to roll with this the minute I get funded, we will begin building these once I have funding completed. We are real exited to do this, because we believe these products are one of a kind and will help everyone with these dreaded chores.The last thing I wanted to talk about is pretty simple, why am I asking you for a pledge, the truth is, I have done all of this up to now, out of my own pocket, because I truly believe in this, but now, with winter bills etc, I am not able to finish at this time. I still need to have the app developed for the IOS and android phones. This will run $25 K, then the regular start up costs also. I appreciate your time reading this.       The Team at ""Down Time Technologies""  can""t thank you enough."

Words we don’t know look like random lines and shapes. Alphabets are the building blocks of phonetic languages.In English, we build words from letters, each of which indicate different sounds. In Chinese, we build words from characters that each have their own concept or meaning.The Chinese language can be intimidating. Stroke by Stroke is a brand-new app aimed to make learning Chinese easier by focusing on the written form.Our target audience includes kids from ages 8 to 14, and any Chinese learning beginners, and we will eventually introduce Stroke by Stroke to educational organisations as well, in order to allow more students to benefit from the app.Aiming to be an educational tool for the future, Stroke By Stroke will include features that allow learners to follow closely the sequence of each stroke used to compose a character, as well as the meaning and pin yin of the characters.When they succeed to learn certain amounts of characters, they can level up to learn vocabularies and even starting building sentences!Similar to learning English calligraphy, the app will demonstrate the outline of the characters. Next, the app will demonstrate the sequence of each stroke, in solid colour.After viewing the demonstration, learners will be asked to write on the screen according to what they’ve just been shown. If they get it right, more info such as its pronunciation and definition will display automatically.By learning how to write Chinese radicals, the components of Chinese characters, and reinforcing this by practicing the stroke order, we can break down new characters and remember their meanings much more easily.Stroke by Stroke is highly visual, and this way of learning has proven to be incredibly effective. In adopting a building block technique, the more you learn, the easier it gets! It’s also lots of fun, with attractive graphics and an easy-to-use interface that both kids and adults alike will love!Offering bite-sized lessons, Stroke-by-Stroke has innovative features that support learners and make regular learning more accessible, and above all, enjoyable.With the extra benefit of the app being portable, young learners can keep up their learning on the go—whether on the school bus, in the playground or when travelling with their parents—and they’ll be on their way to discovering and exploring the fascinating world of Chinese characters.","Our team is deeply committed to develop this app to be the best Chinese character learning app on the market.

Marconi always used Australia as a test place as it was so far away so it's befitting to see Marconi switch on a radio station dedicated to her father from Sydney, Australia.Velvet Deluxe will run out of Sydney, Australia directly into London and retransmitted on Digital Radio over London 24 hours a day. Join us as London and Australia play host to another amazing leap in broadcasting using the power of sound. There is no substitute for the music of Velvet Deluxe – The Home of Luxury Listening. https://tunein.com/radio/Velvet-Deluxe-s150126/Hi that is me Benjamin Starr in the picture below inside the Marconi Radio Rover a special Outside Radio Broadcasting Truck I developed for radio stations to host shows remotely outside their radio station.As a young boy I feel in love with radio and always had the dream to build a radio station that can have an influence on the world we live in using the power of sound and a station that is capable of broadcasting to the world.I've worked in radio my whole life and taught radio for 17 years but always have been inventing and pushing the boundaries of traditional broadcasting. I created The Marconi Radio Rover a bespoke Outside Radio Broadcast Truck some years ago. This is the ultimate broadcast radio studio on wheels and is used by stations to take radio to the people with the talent.Soyears ago I was in Italy and the most amazing opportunity happened in Rome. I was on a tour of Vatican Radio and the next thing I know I was asked to be a guest atMarconi's private Radio Museum in the backyard of the Vatican to see the original station built by my idol Marconi the Father of Radio.When I was saying goodbye to the radio technicians one of them gave me a number to call. It was the phone number for Princess Elettra Marconi the only surviving daughter of Marconi. I called her when I got back to Australia and this was the start of a friendship and the beginning of a TV documentary we produced called ELETTRA.I've always wanted to add value to our world by creating entertainment and a radio station dedicated to Marconi. I designed Velvet Deluxe to be an emotional radio station to inspire radio audiences along with unique branding associations.Velvet Deluxe proudly raises the curtain to headline the finest acts ever recorded taking you on a magical musical escape celebrating yesterdays celebrity star acts with the crooners and musical artists of today in an environment that is cool, classy and sophisticated.Velvet Deluxe combines the production values of yesteryear and dovetails this with today’s digital production practices creating a boutique listening environment showcasing the highest production standards to create a luxury listening experience like no other.https://www.facebook.com/VelvetDeluxeRadio/Velvet Deluxe celebrates the life, the people and the musical genius of artists including Barbara Streisand, George Michael, Nat King Cole, Matt Dusk, Andy Williams, Michael Buble, Rod Stewart, Ella Fitzgerald along with artists like Roy Orbison, Celine Dion, Shirley Bassey, Monica Mancini and Dean Martin.The musical theatre of Velvet Deluxe has great pleasure in welcoming you to the greatest musical escape on earth featuring timeless classics, world class artists and songs that captivate and fill your senses.Launching 2018 in LondonVelvet Deluxe - The Home of Luxury Listening.",The major risk surprisingly is not the technology its gaining an audience and sponsors. A commercial station like this needs to launch in London on Digital Radio and then find an audience and as this happens viable sponsorship partners to keep the station afloat. The hard work of programming has been done and now we need to launch the station into the marketplace. We know we have a large On Line audience in the UK and the market their is Digital Radio ready and already consuming hence why we need to launch in London. Velvet Deluxe is already On Line and has been so for the past 5 years as we tested the station. Running from our secure data centre this station with the flick of a switch will broadcast direct into London using the power of fibre optic Internet Technology. The announcing team is located around the world and record their shows directly into our Sydney servers ready for broadcast LIVE into London. The research has been done the risks and challenges of getting on the air in London with the regulator bodies is well underway. The challenges we are facing is Marketing the station and setting up a sales team to sell our station to our clients. The hardest part of setting up the station and running a 24 hours program is done and we are now focussed on the market and sales for Velvet Deluxe to become a viable stand along radio station in London.
https://www.kickstarter.com/projects/2130661265/turbina-jaime?ref=discovery_category_newest,2130661265/turbina-jaime,"      TURBINA JAIMEHace 5 años inventé/patenté un cambio de velocidades fugaz, cambia 20 velocidades en menos de un segundo, obteniendo el par motor al instante, en cada momento (http://invenes.oepm.es/InvenesWeb/detalle?referencia=P201200959). De momento el prototipo que he fabricado cambia 4 en menos de un segundo ( http://gelve.es/banco-de-pruebas/ ). Con este cambio adaptado al molino persa inventado hace 1500 años conseguimos recoger el 100% de la energía que ejerce el viento para volcar un tráiler ( http://gelve.es/la-fuerza-del-viento/ ). El cambio hace que la turbina cambie a la velocidad precisa en cada momento ya que las ráfagas de viento cambian constantemente, ejemplo: si el viento sopla a 10 km/h la turbina trabajara con la 1ª velocidad, si de golpe viene una ráfaga de viento de 200 km/h el cambio cambiara a la 20ª velocidad en menos de un segundo, reduciendo las RPM de las palas y trasladando toda la energía al eje final, obteniendo el par motor al instante, el eje final trasladara la energía a un compresor de alta presión.RESUMENEstoy creando una turbina/aerogenerador (molino de viento) que frenara el cambio climático, nuevo en el mercado por el cambio de velocidades. Una turbina realmente eficaz, producirá tanta electricidad que con ella podremos fabricar hidrógeno, hidrógeno, el combustible que sustituirá a los combustibles fósiles.La ventaja de esta turbina es que genera más del doble de electricidad que un aerogenerador común, ya que en los aerogeneradores actuales a los 100km/h los tienen que parar, ademas las hélices de un aerogenerador trabajan a pocas RPM, en consecuencia la mayor parte del viento se cuela entre sus palas. El viento que atraviesa un aerogenerador equivale a 500 caballos de potencia, de los 500 caballos solo 100 chocan con las palas, 400 caballos atraviesan el aerogenerador sin tocarlo, 400 caballos (el 80%) de energía desaprovechada. Este nuevo aerogenerador absorbe los 500 caballos de potencia, al igual que el barco de vela aprovecha el 100% de la fuerza de empuje del viento. También este tiene la ventaja que recoge y guarda el 95% de la energía que el viento proyecta sobre él, sobretodo por las noches, ya que por las noches el consumo eléctrico de la población es mínimo. Si la población no consume electricidad, este guarda la energía por medio de aire comprimido a 350 bares, pudiendo generar electricidad con ella durante una semana o más, dependiendo del tamaño de los calderines. Esta turbina/molino aguanta  rachas de viento de mas de 200km/h recogiendo toda su energía y almacenándola, sin baterías.La turbina Pelton es un tipo de turbina que se utiliza en las hidroeléctricas, trabaja igual que el molino/turbina Persa, inventado hace 1500 años, solo que a la Pelton le empuja el agua y hace girar un eje y a la Persa le empuja el viento y hace girar un eje, el problema que tiene la Persa es que el viento no sopla siempre con la misma fuerza. Jaime Navas Ribas le a adaptado un cambio de velocidades fugaz a la turbina Persa, hace que se adapte a los cambios bruscos del viento. Sin el cambio, el molino persa, con vientos fuertes se revolucionaria mucho y el viento pasaría de largo, el cambio hace que por muchas variaciones que tenga el viento, sople fuerte o débil, las palas siempre giran a 40RPM o 50RPM, absorbiendo toda la energía que ejerce el viento sobre las palas.El cambio traslada las revoluciones al compresor de aire de alta presión (en una bicicleta o coche el cambio traslada las revoluciones a las ruedas), esto quiere decir que si el viento sopla mas fuerte el compresor ira mas revolucionado ( www.gelve.es ).INTRODUCCIÓNPromotor del proyectoJaime Navas Ribas, GELVE S.L., Generadores Eléctricos a Vela (Unipersonal)Forma jurídica Sociedad  Limitada Unipersonal SLU.A mí, Jaime Navas Ribas, el promotor del proyecto me otorgaron dos diplomas en el salón de la innovación (INNOVA) el 4, 5 y 6 de mayo del 2017 ( http://gelve.es/diplomas/ ).El Club de Inventores Españoles os ofrecerá mas información al respecto de este evento.En este enlace de la OEPM (Oficina Española de Patentes y Marcas) verificaran la patente a mi nombre  http://invenes.oepm.es/InvenesWeb/detalle?referencia=P201200959 .PLANTEAMIENTO DE LA NECESIDAD A LA QUE RESPONDE EL PROYECTO“La energía eólica en el planeta tiene un enorme potencial, se podría obtener 20 veces más energía de lo que el mundo necesita”Las fortalezas de este proyecto entre otros es el producto:            -Produce más del 200% de electricidad, recogiendo la energía de vientos de 200 km/h.(los actuales aerogeneradores los tienen que parar cuando los vientos superan los 100 km/h, el 80% del viento se cuela entre sus palas).   -Almacena la energía (sin baterías) para producir electricidad cuando la necesitemos.(los actuales aerogeneradores inyectan la electricidad que producen directamente a la red, si lo hacen a las 03:00 de la madrugada la mayoría de la electricidad se pierde ya que a esa hora el consumo es mínimo. Si tenemos la energía almacenada por medio de aire comprimido para producir electricidad cuando quisiéramos acabaríamos con la especulación en la misma).   -100% reciclable, fabricado en un 98% de acero y polietileno, materiales 100% reciclables.(Los actuales aerogeneradores están fabricados de fibra de carbono o fibra de vidrio, materiales difícilmente reciclables y estas fibras microscópicas producen un riesgo potencial para la salud).   -Las aves estarán a salvo, el giro de las palas es frontal, lento y constante, de 40RPM a 50RPM.(Estos molinos de viento pueden evitar la muerte de 18 millones de aves solo en España)   -Gracias a su estructura, su precio y a que son reciclables, se pueden colocar por miles en alta                mar, montar uno encima del otro, etc.(los actuales aerogeneradores tienen un coste de 1.000.000€ y colocarlos en el mar es muy complicado y muy costoso, este con las mismas dimensiones tendría un coste de 400.000€ y colocarlos en alta mar, por mucha profundidad que hubiera, con hacerlos flotantes y amarrarlos unos a los otros, los podríamos colocar por miles en alta mar).Todo esto es un bien social, esta orientado a la comunidad, al planeta y a los seres vivos que viven en el.OBJETIVOSGracias a todo lo anterior podemos conseguir mucha electricidad, tanta que con ella podemos:·Cerrar muchas centrales nucleares.·Fabricar hidrógeno para los vehículos (por el tubo de escape de un vehículo de hidrógeno sale agua que se puede beber), menos consumo de combustibles fósiles.·Menos CO2 en la atmósfera, los combustibles fósiles no solo son cancerígenos y afectan al cambio climático, también tiene repercusión en lo que comemos. Cuando llueve se limpia toda la contaminación del aire que es arrastrada a los ríos y al mar, los peces beben ese agua contaminada... ya conocéis la cadena alimenticia.·Desalar agua (la escasez de agua seria un mito).MÉTODOSEl tamaño de la primera turbina que se construirá dependerá de la recaudación, en principio tendrá 2,30m de ancho x 6m de alto x 6m de largo, y tendrá 12 velocidades, pero estas medidas se pueden multiplicar por 10 y con 20 velocidades. De momento voy encargando el material según mi capital, con el material voy tomando las medidas exactas, voy haciendo los planos y con los planos encargando piezas al torno (http://gelve.es/construccion-la-turbina/ ).A este paso puedo tardar años en tener un producto acabado, el planeta y sus habitantes no pueden esperar.Lo recaudado es para fabricar una turbina/molino giratoria (con una corona/piñón de 2 metros de diámetro) y fuerte, capaz de aguantar vientos de 200 KM/H.Empezare fabricando el cambio de velocidades, seguiré con el esqueleto de la maquina, montaje de la transmisión, el compresor de alta presión, motor neumático, generador eléctrico, etc.Mis principales proveedores del material a usar: LORK (Industrias distribuidoras de polietileno), Aceros Llobregat (acero y mas metales) y FESTO (Productos neumáticos).FINANCIAMIENTO A FUTUROLos usuarios de esta turbina estarán en principio en lugares aislados como: sector hostelero, casas campestres, rurales... Teniendo en cuenta que posteriormente estará destinado al sector eléctrico sobretodo a empresas que obtienen la electricidad 100% renovable: Som Energía, Gestervova, GoiEner, Zener, Enerplus, Nosa Enerxía, Seneo, etc.El elemento más relevante sin duda es la patente, ya que tiene la prioridad de ser la única en el Mundo. La patente es Nacional, tengo la exclusiva de ser el único fabricante y comercializador de este producto en España, el resto del mundo puede fabricarlo a su antojo, la idea es enseñarlo al mundo y que el mundo lo fabrique en grandes cantidades, osea menos carbón, osea menos CO2 expandido por el planeta. Y otro elemento relevante es la fabricación en serie, obteniendo en consecuencia que el producto acabe teniendo un precio razonableEste proyecto debería de interesar a todo el mundo, pero los que realmente se interesaran son los ecologistas, y mis mejores promotores serán Greenpeace, Ecologistas en Acción y todos los ecologistas.","No tengo ningún proyecto mas en proyección, este es mi único proyecto en la actualidad.No tengo problemas con las patentes ya que yo Jaime Navas Ribas he inventado/patentado el cambio de velocidades fugaz, un cambio de velocidades que cambiara 20 velocidades o mas en menos de un segundo. Cambio de velocidades que le he adaptado al molino/turbina persa, el cual la patente a prescrito ya que se invento hace 1500 años.Al molino persa le he hecho una mejora, una mejora significativa, con ella la turbina/molino persa recoge el 100% de la energía.Los permisos no son problemáticos, no mas que los permisos de una atracción de feria. Por lo demás podría tener contratiempos a la hora de recibir el material, contratiempos pero no problemas.",https://www.kickstarter.com/projects/2130661265/el-aerogenerador-del-futuro?ref=discovery_category_newest,2130661265/el-aerogenerador-del-futuro,"Wind turbine driven by candlesThe Gelve wind turbine is designed to adapt to wind gusts and take full advantage of its pushing force. Thanks to a fleeting gearbox, all the energy that the wind uses to knock down a truck, or all the energy that the wind uses to turn the blades of the Gelve wind turbine, is transferred to the high pressure compressor, revolutionizing it more if the wind blows harder The stored pressure air will be used to manufacture electricity at peak times. All this mechanism lowers the revolutions of the blades of the wind turbine, keeping them from 40 rpm to 50 rpm. All this mechanism is designed, so that the wind collides with the blades of the wind turbine and does not cross it. All this mechanism is designed so that the wind pushes with all its forces against the blades of the wind turbine, blow at 10 km / h or in tenths of a second pass to180 km / h. The change of speeds adapted to the wind turbine has been tested, and successfully. The mission of this machine is to generate abundant renewable electricity, and with it also manufacture hydrogen, hydrogen is a harmless fuel for the planet. The mission of this machine is to abruptly stop climate change. The methods used to date are clearly insufficient to replace fossil fuels, if we do not want to fill the planet with nuclear power plants, we have to look for other more efficient methods. R&D and innovation, who can best develop this wind turbine, who has invented it. The butterfly effect, what we do now will change the future. Help this project reach its goal.Aerogenerador accionado por velas.El aerogenerador Gelve está pensado para adaptarse a las ráfagas del viento y aprovechar toda su fuerza de empuje. Gracias a un cambio de velocidades fugaz, toda la energía que el viento utiliza para de volcar un camión, o toda la energía que el viento utiliza para hacer girar las palas del aerogenerador Gelve, se traslada al compresor de alta presión, revolucionandolo más si el viento sopla con más fuerza. El aire a presión almacenado se utilizará para fabricar electricidad en las horas punta. Todo este mecanismo baja las revoluciones de las palas, manteniéndolas de 40 rpm a 50 rpm. Todo este mecanismo está pensado para que el viento choque contra las palas y no pase de largo. Todo este mecanismo está pensado para que el viento empuje con todas sus fuerzas contra las palas, sople a 10 km/h o en décimas de segundo pase a 180 km/h. El cambio de velocidades adaptado al aerogenerador a sido probado, y con éxito. La misión de esta máquina es generar abundante electricidad renovable, y con ella además fabricar hidrógeno, el hidrógeno es un combustible inocuo para el planeta. La misión de esta máquina es frenar bruscamente el cambio climático. Los métodos utilizados hasta la fecha son claramente insuficientes para sustituir los combustibles fósiles, si no queremos llenar el planeta de centrales nucleares, tenemos que buscar otros métodos más eficientes. I+D+I, quién mejor puede desarrollar este aerogenerador, que quién lo a inventado. El efecto mariposa, lo que hagamos ahora cambiará el futuro.

Model GT4000: terrestrial wind turbine, will produce electricity with the accumulated pressure air at 350 bar and will inject the grid when there is demand for electricity. Model GTH4000: terrestrial wind turbine, will produce electricity with the accumulated pressure air at 350 bar, electricity will inject it into the grid or manufacture hydrogen with it. Model GM4300: maritime wind turbine, will produce electricity with the accumulated pressure air at 350 bars and inject it into the grid when there is demand for electricity. Model GMH4300: maritime wind turbine, will produce electricity with the accumulated pressure air at 350 bars, electricity will inject it into the grid or manufacture hydrogen with it. In principle we will start with the production of the GT4000 model. This machine compared to conventional wind turbines is 5 times more efficient, 10 times quieter, 98% recyclable and also birds are safe from death by collision. And all this is thanks to the wind turbine blades always rotate from 40rpm to 50rpm regardless of whether the wind blows at 10km per hour or 180km per hour. The blades of the wind turbine always rotate from 40rpm to 50rpm thanks to the fleeting gearbox invented / patented by Jaime Navas Ribas. A gearbox capable of changing 20 speeds in less than a second. A mechatronic system controls the revolutions of the primary axis, giving the precise orders to the gearbox. With this gearbox is achieved that the wind turbine blades, which pushes the wind never revolutionize more than 50rpm. This means that the wind literally hits the blades of the wind turbine and does not pass by, transferring all the energy to the high pressure compressor, which will be more revolutionized if the wind blows stronger (accumulating the air tanks (energy) more quickly), or less if it blows less intensely. That pressurized air is then used (usually during peak hours) to produce electricity with a pneumatic motor and an electric generator. In the models GTH4000 and GMH4300, when the boilers are accumulated to the maximum and the electrical demand is zero, the air will be released producing electricity and with this hydrogen.Los fondos se destinarán a la fabricación en serie de cuatro modelos nuevos de aerogeneradores eólicos, modelos: GT4000, GTH4000, GM4300 Y GMH4300, en adelante las denominaremos máquinas. Máquinas 5 veces más eficientes a los aeorgeneradores convencionales, además, toda la energía que recogen la almacenan por medio de aire comprimido a 350 bares para producir electricidad en las horas punta. Modelo GT4000: aerogenerador terrestre, producirá electricidad con el aire a presión almacenado a 350 bares y la inyectará la red cuando haya demanda de electricidad. Modelo GTH4000: aerogenerador terrestre, producirá electricidad con el aire a presión almacenado a 350 bares, la electricidad la inyectará a la red o fabricará hidrógeno con ella. Modelo GM4300: aerogenerador marítimo, producirá electricidad con el aire a presión almacenado a 350 bares y la inyectará a la red cuando haya demanda de electricidad. Modelo GMH4300: aerogenerador marítimo, producirá electricidad con el aire a presión almacenado a 350 bares, la electricidad la inyectará a la red o fabricará hidrógeno con ella. En principio comenzaremos con la producción del modelo GT4000. Esta máquina frente a los aerogeneradores convencionales es 5 veces más eficiente, 10 veces más silenciosa, reciclable en un 98% y ademas las aves están a salvo de muerte por colisión. Y todo esto es gracias a que sus palas giran siempre de 40rpm a 50rpm independientemente de que el viento sople a 10 km/h como a 180 km/h. Las palas giran siempre de 40rpm a 50rpm es gracias a un cambio de velocidades fugaz inventado/patentado por Jaime Navas Ribas. Un cambio de velocidades capaz de cambiar 20 velocidades en menos de un segundo. Un sistema mecatrónico controla las revoluciones del eje primario, dando las órdenes precisas al cambio de velocidades. Con este cambio se consigue que las palas, a las que empuja el viento nunca se revolucionen mas de 50rpm. Con esto se consigue que el viento choque literalmente contra las palas y no pase de largo, trasladando toda la energía al compresor de alta presión, que se revolucionará más si el viento sopla mas fuerte (cargando los tanques de aire (energía) con más rapidez), o menos si sopla con menos intensidad. Ese aire a presión se utiliza luego (normalmente en horas punta) para producir electricidad con un motor neumático y un generador eléctrico. En los modelos GTH4000 y GMH4300, en el momento que los calderines están cargados al máximo y la demanda eléctrica es nula, se soltara el aire produciendo electricidad y con esta hidrógeno.¡Porque GELVE es 5 veces más eficiente que un aerogenerador convencional!https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tlW7ejMrmiUIt all started in Santa Coloma de Farnés, Girona, Spain. The wind would blow over 70km / h. Having unloaded a trailer, I Jaime Navas Ribas prepared me to close the doors of the semitrailer, I started with the first, the door measured 120 cm x 260 cm, I could not close it, I said to myself: how can it be, if I am capable to drag a pallet truck with 1300kg? How can it be that I can not close the door? There I started to spin around, there's a lot of wasted energy, I told myself, but how to pick it up? If the wind always blows with the same force with a speed multiplier it would be fixed, the problem is that the wind does not always blow with the same intensity. I kept thinking about it and I came to the conclusion that I needed a super fast gear change, but in the market it did not exist, and I kept thinking about it. Imagine a change with 6 pinions of triggers that opened and separated between them, but it was not fast enough and could not hold the whole load. So I kept spinning until ... Eureka !, I came to find the solution, I invented the fleeting gearbox, capable of changing all the speeds needed (5, 10, 20, 40) in tenths of a second , passing through each and every one of them, able to withstand all the load and getting the torque instantaneously, fleetingly.Todo comenzó en Santa Coloma de Farnés, Girona, España. El viento soplaría sobre los 70km/h. Habiendo descargado un tráiler, yo Jaime Navas Ribas me disponía a cerrar las puertas del semiremolque, empecé por la primera, la puerta medía 120 cm x 260 cm, no tuve narices a cerrarla, me dije a mí mismo: cómo puede ser, si soy capaz de arrastrar una transpaleta con 1300kg, cómo puede ser que no pueda cerrar la puerta. Ahí empecé a darle vueltas, aquí hay mucha energía desperdiciada, me dije, ¿pero cómo recogerla? Sí el viento soplase siempre con la misma fuerza con un multiplicador de velocidades estaría arreglado, el problema es que el viento no sopla siempre con la misma intensidad. Seguí dándole vueltas y llegué a la conclusión que necesitaba un cambio de velocidades super rápido, pero en el mercado no existía, y seguí dándole vueltas. Imagine un cambio con 6 piñones de gatillos que se abrían y se separaban entre ellos, pero no era lo suficientemente veloz y no aguantaría toda la carga. Así que seguí dándole vueltas hasta que... ¡Eureka!, llegue a dar con la solución, inventé el cambio de velocidades fugaz, capaz de cambiar todas las velocidades que se necesiten (5, 10, 20, 40) en décimas de segundo, pasando por todas y cada una de ellas, capaz de aguantar toda la carga y obteniendo el par motor instantáneamente, fugazmente.Pruebas con el prototipo en Malgrat de Mar, Barcelona. El viento no superaba los 40km/h.Tests with the prototype. It is appreciated that when the wind blows stronger the change acts and transfers all the energy to the compressor, revolutionizing more, at the same time the blades of the wind turbine rotate at the same speed, blow the wind with more intensity or less.Pruebas con el prototipo. Se aprecia como cuando el viento sopla más fuerte actúa el cambio y traslada toda la energía al compresor revolucionándose más, al mismo tiempo las palas giran a la misma velocidad, sople el viento con más intensidad o menos.In the first patent the wind machine was intended for pumping water, ideal for pumping storage plants that generate electricity. The gearbox collects all the energy of the wind and moves it to the tertiary axis, revolutionizing itself considerably, so many revolutions that an electric generator can not stand them. If the wind blows with little force, the tertiary shaft rotates at a few revolutions and the generator does not produce electricity, in the opposite direction if a wind gust of 180km / h comes suddenly the tertiary shaft rotates at so many revolutions that the electric generator does not support, but a water pump yes.In the second patent, the chains to the gearbox were eliminated by engaging the pinions directly. In addition, in the second patent to the machine is fitted a high-pressure compressor that perfectly supports the constant and abrupt changes of revolutions (like the water pump), and accumulates all the energy by means of compressed air to more than 350 bars to produce electricity at the time it is needed, usually at peak times. Also in the second patent the machine produces hydrogen with the electricity it generates, ideal for the GTH4000 and GMH4300 models. The model GMH4300 will be machines with an area of ​​12 square meters, floating, installed on the high seas and producing hydrogen. The ships will go to these installations on the high seas to supply hydrogen, or load hydrogen to be used later on the mainland. The model GTH4000 will be machines with an area of ​​12 square meters and producing hydrogen.Jaime Navas Ribas, is a strong advocate of the environment, with the desire to curb climate change as soon as possible. We are looking for a planet in which the human being can survive, but we will never find one as beautiful as this one, so perfect, with so much life, with so much history ... Let's take care of it.En la primera patente la máquina eólica estaba destinada al bombeo de agua, ideal para las centrales de bombeo inverso. El cambio de velocidades recoge toda la energía del viento y la traslada al eje terciario revolucionándose considerablemente, tantas revoluciones que un generador eléctrico no las aguanta. Si el viento sopla con poca fuerza el eje terciario gira a pocas revoluciones y el generador no produce electricidad, en sentido contrario si de golpe viene una ráfaga de viento de 180km/h el eje terciario gira a tantas revoluciones que el generador no las aguanta, pero una bomba de agua sí.En la segunda patente le eliminaron las cadenas al cambio engranando los piñones directamente. Además, en la segunda patente a la máquina se le adapta un compresor de alta presión que aguanta perfectamente los cambios constantes y bruscos de revoluciones (al igual que la bomba de agua), y almacena toda la energía por medio de aire comprimido a más de 350 bares para producir electricidad en el momento que se necesite, normalmente en las horas punta. Además en la segunda patente la máquina produce hidrógeno con la electricidad que genera, ideal para el modelo GTH4000 y GMH4300. El modelo GMH4300 serán máquinas con una superficie de 12 metros cuadrados, flotantes, instaladas en alta mar y productoras de hidrógeno. Los barcos acudirán a estas instalaciones en alta mar para repostar, o cargar hidrógeno para utilizarse después en tierra firme. El modelo GTH4000 serán máquinas con una superficie de 12 metros cuadrados y productoras de hidrógeno.Jaime Navas Ribas, es un firme defensor del medio ambiente, con el deseo de frenar el cambio climático lo antes posible. Estamos buscando un planeta en el cual el ser humano pueda subsistir, pero nunca encontraremos uno tan hermoso como este, tan perfecto, con tanta vida, con tanta historia...

That's right ladies and gentlemen help us and once funded you'll realize it's okay to complain about the job you hate so much, stay home and watch our show instead!How to watch?Well folks that's simple we are putting our first season of Brobots on youtube until some money grubbing network offers us a billion dollar check but until then we are going to enjoy making the cartoon for your amusement! :DWhat's the $9000 for?Well even though I wish I was a billionaire and I had everything I wanted, to make this animated gold you so desperately desire we need new equipment, we have a dusty apple 2 my friend john wants to animate but the poor guy doesn't understand basic math so we just let him believe, on a more serious note john could be animating on something that isn't from the stone ages and will actually run the necessary programs to make real animation.Could we do it without you?Nah! If this doesn't work I plan on gaining 1000 pounds and joining a support group.Are you still reading?Well if you are then hopefully that means we've entertained you long enough to send a flock of carrier pigeons to pickpocket you and your friends.Speaking of birds!Re-tweet, share, click like, email this to your beloved grandma, do whatever you have to to get the animation going to cure your illness of not having good shows to watch!!! And hurry cause you don't look so good!Just in case we need stretch goalsIf we reach.......10,000 - The main character squirrel gets poked in the eye every episode11,000 - We throw in a dinosaur that thaws out in the arctic and solves global warming12,000 - We make snow white and the seven dwarfs beat Gary and the Brobots up in the street on the way back from the grocery store13,000 - The Sky rains pies from space to protect their race from the cooking channel14,000 - We get a way cooler computer.....you know one of those more powerful macs that are always in the apple store but you never see anyone actually buy15,000 - We send the money into a bank account to fund season 216,000 - Wow you want season 2 to happen even faster well we hired another animator17,000 - Wow wow now we have a writer as well200,000 - I get a car and have it custom painted to advertise for Brobots cause you loved it so much",Current Obstacles- funding- equipment costs- advertisingI will tackle these like a pro football player and they'll get outta my way!,https://www.kickstarter.com/projects/1526396753/void-an-animated-mini-series?ref=discovery_category_newest,1526396753/void-an-animated-mini-series,"THE CARTOON....well one of them: This is Void! A cartoon about a boy, George, wakes up one day and gets sucked into an infinite abyss. While traveling through the void George meets Lumin, a quirky glowing counterpart, who decides to help George try to get out of the void...even though he's never been able to do it himself.My goal: To start an animation company that will rival others in wonderful visual experiences! To give a quality of all animation that is better than the standard, to push the limits of animation, and create new ideas and ways of doing things that will astonish the world. After a bit more research and lot's of planning I'd like to work full time on animation and art. Each episode will cost 10,000-25,000 to make. Since 2013 I've been working on this cartoon and I think it's time I go all in. I have scripts, voice actors on standby, and the equipment to animate all of it. Now all I need is time and money, which will give me enough funding for the first season of my show (10 episodes) and animate full time. The money will also help speed up the animation process by adding animators to the project. In addition to all of that I also have created a plan to create a self sustained funding that will allow me to keep animating full time. Ideally this will hopefully give me the ability to not have to ask for donations again and get the start to my animation company I’ve been looking for. If funded it's more than possible to both get this cartoon and my business going and get it to the world!Q and A  Q: How many animators are there?  A: Just me (Bryan) and until we get funding we can’t hire the others  Q: Do you have scripts prepared?  A: We have season one of two cartoons ready to roll...keep in mind it’s just been me writing as well  Q: How many cartoons are planned so far?  A: 5 full length cartoons, 1 movie, and 5 mini series  Q: How will you be investing  A: I will be using half the money to fund cartoon operations, 1/4 will go to investments to start a portfolio with a 5% growth rate annually, and the last 1/4 will go to working on future projects while in operation  Q: $450,000 is a lot of money why so much?  A: While my main goal is to animate my first cartoon, it’s also to get my business running, while in school I studied starting a business and up until now I’ve self funded until today.  Q: Why not keep self funding your cartoon?  A: The answer is cost and time, animating the cartoon and working a regular job takes time. While it’s possible to get started this way, finishing it will be a different story.  Q: How successful will you’re cartoons be?  A: I’ve been perfecting the stories since 2013 I can confidently say that as soon as they are out in the world they will go toe to toe with the big studios  Q: Where will the cartoons be?  A: Full length for now will be on YouTube in the beginning but we’re working on getting a website set up as well  Q: Do you have a business plan  A: We do and by we I mean I do I will be posting some work for our cartoon on here and Instagram as to generate buzz about the project! So come back or follow us for any updates and remember if you donate anything given helps us get closer to our goal so thank you!","So far my challenges are time, money, and help. With the money from this kickstarter I'll be able to get a start in animation, give myself more time to dedicate to the project, and more importantly I'll be able to get more people to help me. I have been working on my stories for a long time and I think given what's going on in the world it's time to share them."

Please help us get this shoot published!Hi! My name is Travis, and I'm a wedding photographer. I started out about six years ago with my mom's Canon 30D and a 70-200 zoom lens. Then I worked at Applebees until I saved up enough money to buy my own camera, a Canon 5D II and a L 50mm 1.2 lens. That's when things started getting serious. Since then I've had the pleasure to travel all over the country shooting weddings, everywhere from LA to Seattle, to Wisconsin to New York. But now I want to take it to the next level. As I've become more familiar with the photography world, done apprenticeships and met some world famous photographers, I was introduced to the world of medium format film photography. Not 'film' like a movie or video, I mean like the kind that your parents had rolls of, stored in the refrigerator, and had to get developed. My wife, Stephanie, and I would consistently and coincidentally be going through our Instagrams and the photos that were our favorites would always be composed on film! So one day, Stephanie told me to buy a film camera, and so that's what I did! I got a Contax 645 with Zeiss glass. Mmmmmmmmmm, the images that camera puts out are delicious. Kodak film is where it's at. Richard Photo Lab is the genius behind the processing, and I am indebted to Jose Villa and Jonathan Canlas for writing books that told me what camera to buy.For the first time ever in my career as a photographer, I'm actually proud of my work. Medium format film is the perfect medium for me, and I want to share it with the world! Unfortunately, not many people--brides specifically--don't know that hiring a photographer who uses old-school film is even an option! Let alone the benefits that film has to offer over digital. Film photography for weddings is a very niche market, which is why I'm doing this campaign.I was honored when Amber Events agreed to collaborate with me on a photo-shoot. We had a project! Then, things got really exciting when the celebrated designer Claire Pettibone agreed to get in on the action. From there, we were joined by Trumpet & Horn, Fantasy Frostings, Archive Rentals, Copper Willow, and many more! The results were magical. I was on pins and needles waiting for my film to be developed after the shoot, but when I got it back, I was blown away.The goal of this Kickstarter is to secure a spread in Flutter Magazine. They're arguably the most elegant and artistic bridal magazine out there, and if Artemis (that's what I decided to name the shoot) was featured in it, that would mean not only that all the creatives who worked so hard on the shoot would get national recognition in one of the most beautiful publications available, but brides all over the country would get introduced to the world of medium-format film photography! Wouldn't that be a dream!? The world would be a very arty place :)So thank you so much for your support, and I can't wait to snap those selfies!","The editorial is done, and the publishers approve. We just need your help!",https://www.kickstarter.com/projects/1186970994/ending-climate-change-one-vegan-at-a-time?ref=discovery_category_newest,1186970994/ending-climate-change-one-vegan-at-a-time,"I want to start a Vegan drive-through chain. Here's why.I turned vegetarian about 10 years ago when I first saw the documentary ""Supersize Me"". That was the first time I was exposed to the realities of how animals are treated in the food industry, and the effect that animal products, especially fast-food animal products, had on the human body. So I went vegetarian, and was comfortable doing that for a while. That is, until I saw the documentary ""Cowspiracy"". All my adult life, I had always heard about how fossil fuels are what drive global warming, deforestation, ocean acidification, etc. I mean, I care a lot about the environment, especially animals. But not only that, I care about being a good steward of the planet that future generations of humans and animals will hopefully live in. So it came as a huge shock to me to find out that I had been lied to about what exactly is the main cause of climate change. All this talk about fossil fuels, and it turns out that livestock production--one industry--is responsible for more greenhouse gas emissions than all of transportation--cars, trucks, trains, ships, air, etc.--COMBINED! My whole life I was told to get an electric car, to use power saving lightbulbs, and to conserve energy, when none of that even addresses the main cause of the thing that's destroying our planet. Livestock production--meat and dairy--is the world's single greatest problem. It is absolutely no exaggeration to say that if everyone in the world went Vegan, climate change would stop. Period. When I found that out, I went vegan that very same day, and I've been a vegan evangelist ever since. The problem is, most people aren't like me. Most people aren't willing to make a life change unless there's almost an unnoticeable effect. For me, I try to live by the philosophy of being the change I want to see in the world. So when I found out that I was contributing to the biggest problem this planet is facing, in the biggest way possible, I stopped.Here's an infographic that explains how livestock production is the biggest problem in the world:So I learned about this horrible reality, and went vegan as a result. I thought that if everyone just learned the facts like I did, then they would change too! Boy was I wrong. Through all my efforts, only four people that I know became vegan, and one became vegetarian. What I realized is that I'm not a follower, and neither are vegans. The problem is, most people are followers. Which is why I came up with the idea of starting a vegan fast-food chain. My goal is not to make people have healthier diets. My goal is to make a fast-food chain that's as widespread and accessible as McDonalds, but that only sells vegan food. People don't want to give up animal products in their food. What I want to show them is that they don't have to ""give up"" their favorite food. When I first went vegan, I tried store-bought vegan cheese. Disgusting. Then I tried home-made vegan cheese recipes. It's like eating snot. I didn't turn vegan for health reasons. I just wanted to help save the planet. So I made a vegan cheese that's super oily and delicious. Voila! I started making it all the time, and bringing it to parties and to restaurants. I would share it with my friends. I'd order Pizza Hut with no cheese, and put mine on top, and some of my friends liked THAT cheese EVEN MORE than the Pizza Hut pizza. Then came Christmas, and I made a vegan cheese dip, and served it without any of my family knowing it was vegan. Everyone loved it, and asked me how to make it. That's when I realized that the problem with a lot of vegan food is that it's too healthy. I mean I know that by default, a vegan diet is going to be healthier than an omnivorous one. But you can make vegan imitations of things, and make them just as good/unhealthy as their non-vegan counterparts. Americans love their unhealthy fast-food in all of its deep-fried, cheesy goodness. Why not make the food that's just as good, but not wreak havoc on the world at the same time? That's the goal of my restaurant idea. I want to serve greasy pizza (and also deliver it!), mozzarella sticks, onion rings, carnitas, doughnuts, tri-tip, bacon, and every other comfort food you can think of. My hope is that this will make it easier for people to go vegan. Most people want to protect the environment. Bernie Sanders made that one of the pillars of his campaign, and he almost won the presidency. People just don't want to give up pizza and mozzarella sticks. Well, if they had the opportunity to do both AND SAVE MONEY (because vegan food is cheaper, contrary to popular belief), then I think they'd jump on board.","I anticipate that there will be the same kind of hold ups that are typical with building a new restaurant. There's all kinds of city and health codes, etc. Fortunately, since vegan food isn't nearly as perishable, the health codes shouldn't be a problem. I have experts on my team who have successful restaurant chains already, who can help me through the process."

We wanted to find a way for ordinary people here and in countries around the world to quickly and inexpensively create buildings that would meet their needs and be strong and durable, yet not deplete scarce natural resources. If we could do that, the benefits would be enormous.Our approach was to modify the humble concrete block. Years of experimentation and testing gradually resulted in the fundamental changes in the material, shape and design that have given the LokBlok system the features we wanted:With LokBlok, communities can use their own resources to rebuild infrastructure after a disaster. People in developing countries can similarly build new communities. Even private individuals can soon obtain the blocks from authorized resellers for their home improvement projects.On December 8th 2006, we applied for an US Patent for our design and system.  On November 11th 2007 we entered a PCT application that allows us entry into International  countries where we want to file an application and obtain a patent from their country. We had to file numerous responses to the US Patent office to satisfy their investigation. Almost five years and thousands of dollars later, on February 8th 2011, we received our US Patent Certification number 7, 882,674.The $500,000 raised will be allocated as followed:Keep in mind we used aggressive figures for most of the supplies when originally quoted. We will be as frugal as possible when negotiating the final cost of supplies needed.Below are pictures of our original mold and prototypes. We used a 2 man crew and wanted to see how far they get in 30 minutes. Granted this was the first attempt with our original prototypes, and didn't involve adding rebar or surface coating. We already have signed off on our final production unit designs. The money raised will go toward the molds and inventory for our final LokBlok unit designs.Please view our website for more information. www.lokblok.comPrototype of half block on assembly line. Working on right mixture.",Going through the prototype process we learned that the 3 month time frame to make the mold(s) is sometimes 5 months. The first two batches off the assembly line are to get the correct mixture of sand to mortar and cement since we have a unique design needing the right concentration of mixtures. The block machine needs 6 hours of maintenance which could cause a delay in production.  We have protocols in place to limit these challenges if they arise. We also give an extra 6 month date of delivery and completion to combat any delays from our production line. We have so far delivered a head of scheduled.

We intend to leverage existing music assets into new market opportunities.  The Podbum App is one such opportunity. Our target market are the 18-34 year olds who like to listen and download songs using social media Apps.  The Podbum App is the primary platform by which we intend to grow our user base and convert users to paying customers.SubscriptionsOur other line of effort is targeted at Artists seeking to create and distribute their musical works using the Podbum App platform. The platform includes the Podbum App and the Podbum branded artist store. Artists can also use the Podbum Community on Facebook to connect and share experiences with friends and fans.CompetitorsWhile consumers will pay for magazine subscriptions, cloud storage and music streaming services, the opportunity for artists to engage directly with fans using the Podbum platform stands on a class by itself. Companies compete on price, availability, song collection, design of user experience. Some of the companies’ currently operating music ""Apps"" in the space includes: •	Google Play. While Google Play can leverage the resources of its parent Google, it lacks a deep catalog of independent artist oriented genres. The Podbum App strives in delivering obscure recordings from the original artists. This fact will be a differentiating factor for fans looking for fresh original content without the big record company impersonal approach.•	Slacker. The Podbum platform is easier to use compared to the not so friendly Slacker.•	Spotify. Slacker much like Google Play lack deep catalogs. Spotify is specifically restricted by number of songs in its package.•	Beat Music. Only available in the United States. The Podbum App will be available in over 50 countries as we continue to expand our business.To sum, we will not compete on price. We will offer customers valued original music content by the original artists by leveraging the Podbum platform.Podbum will focus on what we coin the ""Gen Centric App Consumers"" and Artists seeking to expand the reach of their music properties. According to a recent study conducted by columbiadigital.net, over 1.2B consumers  have downloaded and installed an App and is expected to grow to 44B installations by 2017.  According to the medium colombiadigital.net it is predicted that by the end of the 2013 downloads of applications through smart phones will reach 56 billion, 89% will correspond to Android, 34% iOS, 4% Windows Phone and 3% Blackberry iOS.  Referring to tablets, it is forecast 14 billion downloads, which 75% will be from iPad, 21% from Android, 2% from Amazon Kindle and 2% from Windows device. Based on these estimates, in the period 2012-2017  the number of users that use mobile applications will grow at an annual rate of the 29.8%.We intend to not only provide curation of original music genre by the original artists, we will allow consumers to purchase merchandise from the Podbum Store.Market NeedsPersonal Story from DJ 1phThe Podbum App generated publicity with the World Cup 2014 games. I wrote and recorded a song about Soccer and released it on the Podbum App in less than a week. This increased my believe in the power of artist to fan platform that is Podum App. Our target market are the Gen App Centric consumers who use Apps to listen and discover new music from artists the world over. To make this work, I also needed a store where the digital goods and merchandise can be sold. So, I decided to open an online store tied in to the Podbum App.Strategy and ImplementationMarketing Plan OverviewTo the extent we are focusing on the Gen App Centric, we will reach  them where the hangout on Social Media: Twitter, Facebook, Instagram and Tumblr. We have links to our pages on these social media platforms. The intent is to generate leads. To date, we have 1,100+ likes on Facebook and over 30,000 impression growing weekly! We expect to generate 150 leads a month through marketing efforts on social media and radio ads.Positioning The Podbum platform and App allows artists to record and distribute their recordings from home studio direct to fans.  It also provides a platform for listeners to discover and buy music, videos and merchandise direct from the original artists in addition to deep catalogs from Hangout Recordings.PricingPodbum business model will generate revenues through App downloads at .99 cents per download. Artist and company packages, song sales and advertising. Artist will be provided bundled packages ranging in price from $500 for 12 months subscription; which, includes $1,500 one-time licensing fee for access to the platform – App, Store and Social Media reach! Our operating costs include hosting fees and store processing fees on sales. We currently offer promotions on new Podbum releases on the podbum store. As artists sign up to leverage the store, artists can set their own prices for songs, videos and merchandise.Podbum recently gained the support of Google Launchpad and was selected at Appcircus happening at Google San Francisco Offices later in August 2015."

And the comedy foundation ties together the acts of this man so perfectly that one will not want to put the book down.There are no wasted words in this volume. Where others fill pages with quantity, this book is pure quality. So much so that most desire to see the expertly developed characters come to life on screen.And this is where the Kickstarter campaign comes in. We need to raise funds to make a well adapted, directed and produced feature. Then take the independently produced film on the indie circuit. Of, course, this will not be cheap or easy. But we are banking on the power of the sheer weight of the story and characters that we believe, possibly, at some point, a major company may step in and decide to take it to new heights.The fact that this book was written is epic in nature. It, simply, was never meant to be. And it was only the result of pure coincidence concerning a prank call I made to a ""Push out the pusher"" telethon. The telethon interfered with the nightly programming at a time when I only had one channel. The telethon was staffed with local law enforcement officers and several high ranking state officials. It really was a big deal. But I decided to go to a local convenience stores pay phone, which, in my opinion, was wire tapped,(because many out of town drug dealers were known to use those phones), and make a funny prank call.I called and a proper sounding official answered. Then I asked, ""If you let me sing my song I will make a contribution?"" And the guy agreed.So I proceed to sing ""I'm the rat, I'm the rat, I'm the rat, I'm the rat, I'm the rayyyt!"" And then I hung up.But the very next day I saw a huge rat smashed in the middle of the street. And huge rats like that are uncommon in my area. In my opinionthe dead rat was a message sent by an indignant high ranking official who may have been embarrassed on the live coverage.And having access to intelligence, the pay phone number and surveillance, in my opinion, I felt it didn't take them long to figure out it was me that made the call.But they couldn't arrest me because I broke no laws. However, the innocent, and what I believe to have been a lab rat, paid with its life. And when I saw it I ran and got my Mustek 3 megapixel digicam, which was the first digicam I owned and only one I had. A quick thinker, I got chalk from the building and drew an outline around the dead animal as though it were a murder victim. And, clever as I am, I drew the words ""The Rat"" around it. Then I took pictures and video.I brainstormed a funny story idea as I took photos. And soon I was taking a writing course from The Institute of Children's Literature. However this isn't a children's book.After I finished it I wrote a theme song, which is included separately at the end of the book.Now a lot of people when they see the chalk outline think it resembles Mickey Mouse ears. But this is not true as the book cover does not show the full outline. The grainy video, however, does show the entire outline........clearly showing no such silhouette.Anyway, people really liked the story. So much so that I know it would be a success if made properly into a film or even an animated movie. So I need the backing in order to make this a reality.And there are some nice backer rewards we have for you. Check it out!!The audio in the video isthe personal opinion of Julian F. Vaughn and rawopinions concerning his suspicions about thesituation thatresulted inhim writing the fictional tale.","Fulfilling backer rewards will be no problem.  The filming and production of the movie is the tricky part.  It is heavily advocated that you must have a great script, proper execution and knowledge of the market in general in order to make a independent film successful.But with the funds left after filling backer rewards should be enough to get the job done, at least in animated format, if that is what it comes down to.And as far as the other project I am running, it doesn't appear that it will get funded.  Even if it does, the backer rewards for THE RAT will be simple to fill and easy to get to the backers.There is nothing too technical and I do not have to rely on smaller companies to make the rewards.  This will eliminate any problems and orders should be filled well before the deadline."

Initial flock size will be 2500 birds however the facility supports a full capacity of approximately 40,000.I tried a Kickstarter before that ended in an epic failure (Who hasn't!?).  Maybe the idea wasn't as appealing as I thought or maybe I wasn't as clever and witty as I had hoped!  (probably the latter!) A great opportunity has come up and after the events of the last couple years we are unable to take advantage of it.  So I figured screw it, why not try Kickstarter again?No failed attempt at witty titles, memes, or tongue in cheek videos.  Just put it out there and see what happens.  Actually I'm going to put a couple ideas out there and see which one works, let the universe decide the next project (maybe it's time to step away from the chickens?)!The last two years have had the highest of highs and the lowest of lows, sweet success and bitter failure.  Such extremes it truly blows the mind, well beyond anything I could have imagined.(Almost!) Everyone loves eggs, (and chickens)!  Chickens have reached a point in commercial ag where they are little more than egg production equipment, but even chickens deserve to be treated like the living creatures they are.  Our vision is to acquire an existing poultry farm and convert it into a cage free organic layer farm to help supply New England with fresh affordable wholesome eggs.  We plan to follow organic, and UEP guidelines for the basics and make sure our birds are healthy, happy, and delivering some of the best eggs in New England.We have already located the property, the funding covers purchase of the property, setup, and operational costs for 6 - 8 months.  No small amount but if anyone can pull it off it would be on Kickstarter!  Thanks for looking, considering, or even reading all that, your support is appreciated!  Feel free to ask any questions!","The biggest challenge is to raise the funding needed to get started, this isn't exactly the hottest new tech or cool new movie of the year.  The second biggest challenge will be managing the funding to ensure success and a driving reason for adding the finance committee as a safeguard.There will also be challenges with dealing with any regulatory agencies and animal welfare groups which was a driving force for adding the animal welfare committee at the beginning so we can balance healthy happy animals, biosecurity, and business so everyone is happy and safe!"

For this reason, it can be applied in visual and arts, music... engineering, etc. Even, for purposes of physical rehabilitation and related to the interaction between man and technology.The possibilities are so many, that it only depends on you. Using it is as easy as loading a web page with the application of a piano that you can play with your conventional keyboard, but what if instead of using the keys on your keyboard, you could use something more fun, like bananas, or apples or even several people? Now do the same but with an online game like PacMan that you can control with arrows that you have drawn with pencil on paper!Meow Meow includes everything you need to make it work: a Meow Meow Card and 10 alligator cables and a USB cable.Meow Meow uses capacitance sensors to detect when a connection has been made, even with materials that are not as conductive, such as sheets of paper, play dough or people. Meow Meow can act like a keyboard or a mouse and includes ten input connections on the front, which can be attached via alligator-tipped cables or any other electrical conductor you can think of. It also has another ten input connections on the back, four for SPI, two for I2C, two serial ports and two for I2S, you can access all these ports through jumpers or by means of expansion cards (which we will call Backpacks) .Imagine that you connect an apple to the Meow Meow and then connect the board to the computer. Connect an apple to one of the Meow Meow input connections and then connect the card to a USB port on your computer, your Meow Meow card will be recognized as an ordinary keyboard (or mouse). Now, when you touch the apple, the computer will detect as if it were an oppressed key. Meow Meow works with all operating systems, programs and web pages, since it emulates a normal keyboard.It is really for everyone: artists, children, educators, engineers, designers, inventors, creators and more.It can work with any material that conducts a little electricity. Here we tell you some examples that the assistants of our workshops have used: Ketchup, pencil graphite, finger paint, lemons, and many more!Other materials that works very well are: plants, coins, cutlery, everything that is wet, most of the food, aluminum foil, water and hundreds of things that we have not yet tried, but that you can try and share.The kit contains:The Meow Meow is an ideal resource to be used in education, since it allows children, young and not so young, to apply their knowledge to generate creative and ingenious projects. From playing video games, going through digital music with very rare objects from the real world, to programming interactions with LEDs, motors and even small robots. Users can venture into areas such as Science, Technology, Engineering, Art and Mathematics (STEAM) by encouraging creativity and solving small mathematical or logical problems. In addition, it can serve to venture into areas such as electronics, programming and robotics, since it is very easy to connect motors, screens and programs that allow interaction depending on what the student decides to do. Thanks to the maker movement, today Meow Meow users can explore, learn and create in an easy and fun way.Meow Meow supports being programmed through the Microsoft MakeCode platform, which allows people of all ages and environments to program the Meow Meow to add new sensors and actuators connected to their pins. The interface allows you to experiment in real time with loops, events and complex programming behaviors. We have tested the application with children of all ages (and adults as well) to make it the smoothest introduction to electronic circuit programming.Makecode for Meow Meow versión beta: http://makercode.electroniccats.com/It is ideal for those who are programming and want to move to the next level and / or for those who have more advanced knowledge in this topic. Meow Meow is fully compatible with the Arduino software platform and all its available libraries for adding sensors and actuators to the board. It is easy to integrate using the Arduino Board Manager with a compatible preloaded bootloader.All hardware and software will be fully open, available to study and modify in accordance with the Certification OSHWA MX0003.Repository and manual:https://github.com/ElectronicCats/MeowMeow/wikiBy now, we focus on the Meow Meow to get it out as quickly as possible, but we have planned a complete line of  integrated accessories called backpacks. These, will give the Meow Meow even more capabilities, such as:A communication module to allow multiple Meow Meow to communicate with each other directly.A bluetooth communication module and battery so you can connect it to your computer without having a USB cable.Meow Meow is an extensible platform that allows you to create and add your own accessories with a 3D printer and hardware designed by yourself to be free hardware.Events where we will beAndres SabasPassionate about electronics and open hardware, Andres likes to share what he makes on Hackster.io and Instructables.

https://www.kickstarter.com/projects/138595062/the-baby?ref=discovery_category_newest,138595062/the-baby,"How are you? My name is Emily Kathleen. I am the writer and producer of the horror film THE BABY, a Mumblecore based film. We have a letter of intent from 7th heaven star Adam Lavorgna. Thank you for taking this time to look at my film business plan. We are pleased to tell the story of Nik and Marcy. The brother an sister, who became serial killer's after the hand of child abuse from their Mother. This film is very dear to me, as child abuse has been something I have dealt with personally first hand in my own life. Most people ask me,""how did you turn out so normal? Are not all people who were abused as a child become a serial killer?"" This is why I created the film, to show the audience that just because you’re abused, does not mean you become a killer. That all actions are a choice. That being good to others in life is a choice.The budget for the film is 2 million dollars and we will shoot in Vegas in the spring of 2016. We will release the film on Halloween 2016 in theaters. The audience age ranges are 15 to 35 years old in the USA and overseas. We are also looking into possible online distribution from Netflix and Hulu TV. As well as Lifetime and ABC Family networks. We have contact at these companies and many other distribution companies for the films. (List provided on request.)  This film will keep you on your toes and make you question what you truly know about evil. Please take a look at my business plan below and admire my hard work as a writer and producer of this feature film. Thank you for your time and for being open to fund this film. Blessings,Emily Kathleen Executive Producer of Emily Kathleen Productions","""Executive summary""The film THE BABY is a cross over film of HALLOWEEN and the TV show called THE FOLLOWING. Both deal hand in hand with the making or serial killers in some way or another. Mike Mysers character in Halloween wants nothing more than to kill for revenge for his messed up childhood. He hunts down his family who he believes is the cause of the pain he feels inside for his messed up life. The budget for the film was $300,000 and the box office brought in over $70 million dollars. I would say that is a huge profit. The serial killers in the TV show THE FOLLOWING all are serial killers who have had hard lives. The show shows the audience what it is truly like for the life of a killer. For me watching the show I care more about the serial killers and want to help them, then the good guys. That is powerful. The show has millions of viewers worldwide. It is also going on it’s 4th season strong. THE BABY unlike the movie Halloween or the show The Following deals with the same ethics these do. Meaning that we as the audience will fall in love with Nik and Marcy the brother and sister serial killers. We want to see them happy, and not in so much pain. We will long to have stopped the child abuse that lead to them raping and killing people. The budget is 2 million dollars and horror is a hot following for audiences nationwide.",https://www.kickstarter.com/projects/138595062/the-baby-horror-thriller?ref=discovery_category_newest,138595062/the-baby-horror-thriller,"Dear Kickstarter Viewer-I am Emily Kathleen writer and producer of this film. I have with two ""Letter's of Intent."" One from award winning cinematographer ""Andrew Russo"" from the feature film ""Masterless"" and the other from actor  ""Adam LaVorgna "" who was in the Emmy award winning TV show titled ""7th Heaven."" Adam's Manager Beverly has signed his loi as well.  Both of them approve highly of my screenplays and writing skills. We also have a list of  directors who are in consideration of the project as well. We are currently in negotiations with award winning directors to attach to the film as we speak.**ABOVE WE SHOT A MUMBLECORE VIDEO STYLE OF THE BABY FOR CONCEPT PROOF- Note the final film will be shot on a red camera with the above cast and a surprise A LISTcelebrity star!**The final film shot on a red camera in Vegas and will be shown to my contacts at NETFLIX and STARZdistribution who are excited to see the final film!Here is a bit about my story of how I came up with this film.  I am survivor of of child abuse for 20 years at the hand of my Mother who has munchausen proxy. She poisoned my food at 12 with drugs making me a drug addict for almost 10 years. As well as having anorexia and bulimia for over ten years as well. By the grace of God and my higher power I am alive and well and have been clean from drugs for 7 years and free from my eating disorders for 4 years. For me when I fall I get back up and work harder to get to my dreams.  The idea of the film is to show how no matter what you have gone through in life everything you do good or bad is a choice. To add all of my films in some way or another shine a light on child abuse. I truly believe in order for us to see and learn to understand the light in life we must go through and understand the darkness as well. My films will show the world how powerful child abuse is. We will with my films make the world help stop child abuse from stopping and happening to another child.                   ""TREATMENT""Log line- ""Most people wonder what, when, where and why people become a serial killer. Through the torture of Nik and Marcy's latest victim Hannah and her baby we soon see and learn to understand the pure makings of evil.""Enter Hannah, a single Mom getting divorced to her husband Josiah. She has just come back from a nasty meeting with him over her daughter. She looks to find Amy, the babysitter. While she was gone, Nik and Marcy came to find Hannah, but kill Amy instead. While Hannah enters, she gets drugged. During Hannah's torture ,she is yet to know if her baby is alive or not. Nik and Marcy have built up anger for Hannah, due to her abuse against them in Jr high school. After days of torture, Hannah learns to find the truth of why she is being hurt. She begs for forgiveness, but Marcy and Nik are too far gone to care. The baby, will make you understand why people choose to become a serial killer. This film, makes you see how just because you were abused, does not mean you have the right to kill anyone. We will soon see both sides of a kill, from the inside out,from the victim to the killer.Thank you for the support!Blessings,Emily Kathleen :)","""Birth of the film""For me writing the film THE BABY wasn't as hard as you would image. As a writer I am trained to remain true to what has happened to me in my personal life. While looking at the truth I combine the imagination of circumstances to what has happened to me and what I wish did. A true writer writes what they know and what they wish they knew. Here is a bit of the back story in making the screenplay. I have been on my own since I was 16 years old. Moved every 3 to 6 months since then. Its as if I was running from my past abusers. As a child I did suffer a great deal of child abuse leaving me numb to feel anything for a great while. The depression and PTSD from the abuse alone is hard to get into. While living in one of my month to month lease rent a rooms from Craiglist I lived with this couple named NIK and MARCY. Hence the names of the lead characters in the film. They opened up their home to me, the first day of meeting them they seemed so normal, overly nice. Which is a key red flag of any serial killer. During my two month stay with them they began to act as if they would kill me. At night I would hear Marcy and Nik yelling at each other over who had to ""watch"" me next. I didn't understand this since they are my landlords and roommates. I didn't need anyone to watch me. One night I got home at 3 am from a film shoot with my company. I went into the kitchen and Nik was standing in it. He glared right at me and screamed, for no reason. I ran into my room and locked the door. The next morning I called Marcy the other land lady and told her about Nik. I demanded a refund of my rent money as I needed to leave. She then laughed at me in a un human voice and said “You are never getting out”. That next night Marcy and Nik sat me down, to explain how hard they had it in life. I then moved out right after. I didn’t care about a refund. I too have had a hard life and that is no reason to hurt or abuse people. They acted with no remorse for their actions. As if being abused was an excuse to not have a heart?This then lead to my wonder of people who have been abused as a child as I was. Nik and Marcy had told me that very night they were abused as a child.  I choose  as a person use the pain I was forced to face to make the world a happier place. Nik and Marcy choose to make it a terrible place for all they met and making people think all abused children become evil.I then looked at serial killer and the stories of them. Ted Bundy and all other serial killers I researched were abused by their family, who was suppose to love them. They had a very similar story to my childhood. This lead to me believe that killing is a choice. Becoming a serial killer can be helped, we choose to let our emotions and memories lead us, not the other way around. For Nik and Marcy they never got to see what I see and many others feel the same as they do. Therefore all of the pain from child abuse and choosing to kill or not is a choice.  Not some bullshit excuse to blame being torchered as a kid. As humans we lack the understanding to try to understand people like Nik and Marcy. They were in pain, but don't know how to handle it. All we see is who serial killers do to us. Writing the film THE BABY gives the audience first hand look and understanding into what is never explained to the world we live in. This film will raise the question is killing a choice or something we can’t control? Nice thought? Don’t you think?"

Wir wollen eine kleine Welt erschaffen aus verschiedene Kulturen und Nationalitäten.Die Gäste sollen sich wie in ihrem Wohnzimmer fühlen, es soll ein Platz voller Frieden und Harmonie sein. Hier wollen wir das die Gäste ihre Informationen austauschen und ihren inneren frieden zu erschaffen. Das Restaurant hat eine komplette offene Küche, man kann mit dem Koch reden und ihm sagen was man genau möchte und das Essen wird in Kühltheken präsentiert. Wir haben ebenfalls auch noch eine Konditorei / Café und eine Saftbar im Restaurant.Da wir sehr auch die Gesundheit des Menschen Achtgeben bereiten wir nur Frische und Gesunde Gerichte zu und nichts das dem Körper in irgendeiner weise schaden kann.In das Restaurant wurden bereits 300.000€ investiert, wir benötigen das Geld um den Trockenbau zu beenden und alle Geräte zu besorgen.Wie schon erwähnt ist bei uns die Küche offen genauso in der Konditorei und im Saftbereich, man kann sich immer mit dem Koch oder mit dem Konditor unterhalten. Wenn man etwas von er Karte nicht möchte kann man sich auch sein Gericht selbst zusammen stellen. Wir bieten Gegrilltes Fleischspeise.Es werden aber auch noch andere Gerichte zubereitet wie z.B. Pizza, Burger und Nudelgerichte, aber alles in der art der Persischen Küche.Zur Konditorei,es wird alles frisch und Vorort zubereitet es wird Hauptsächlich Persisches Gebäck wie z.B. verschiedene Windbeutel Sorten oder verschiedene Kuchen Sorten zubereitet und es gibt noch viel Gebäck, die Keksen ähneln oder Gebäck aus Blätterteig.Zur Saftbar gibt es nicht viel zu sagen außer das ebenfalls alle Säfte frisch Vorort zubereitet werden.Die Säfte werden nach Wunsch oder nach Menü zubereitet. Die Säfte werden aus Obst oder Gemüse zubereitet und wir bieten ebenfalls noch Aperitif Getränke an.Es werden aber nicht nur Persische Spezialitäten angeboten sondern auch die Gerichte anderer Nationen und Kulturen.","Es kann nichts passieren da dieses Konzept in Deutschland einmalig ist,und eventuell auch in Europa. Da schon 300.000 € in das Projekt investiert wurden benötigen wir das Geld nur zu Vollendung des Restaurants.",https://www.kickstarter.com/projects/1837362046/yahu-restaurant?ref=discovery_category_newest,1837362046/yahu-restaurant,"Im Erdgeschoss befindet sich das Herzstück des Konzeptes. Der offene Theken- und Zubereitungsbereich erstreckt sich über 12 Meter und hält eine Vielfalt an orientalischen Speisen bereit. Neben Salaten und vorbereiteten Gerichten präsentiert sich dem Kunden unter Anderem ein Holzofengrill und Pizzaofen für frisch zubereitete Gerichte. Die Auswahl wird vielfältig sein und reicht von Fleischgerichten bis hin zu veganen Speiseangeboten.Auf der gleichen Ebene befinden sich ein „FastFood“ Corner für eilige Mittagsgäste sowie ein Verkaufsstand mit orientalischen Köstlichkeiten. Ein weiteres Highlight des Konzepts ist der Verzicht auf das Ausschenken von Alkoholika. Allerdings wurde hierfür ein Ersatz von nicht unbeträchtlichem Genuss entworfen. Ein Gemisch aus Essig und verschiedenen Ingredienzien steht dem Gast als Ersatz zu Verfügung. Hier wird es verschiedene Geschmacksrichtungen geben.Für ein gesundheitsbewusstes Leben steht die „Vitamin BAR“ zu Verfügung. Gemüse- und Obstsäften, die alle frisch gepresst sind, sorgen für einen gerechten Ausgleich.Die Zwischenebene wird als Ruhebereich ausgestaltet. Hier soll eine angelehnte Bibliothek entstehen, die dem Gast als Ruhepol dient. Großzügige Sessel und Sofas sind hier geplant. Der Bereich wird entsprechend gestaltet.Auf der 2. Ebene befindet sich der Restaurant-Bereich. Moderne Bestuhlung und Gestaltung sind hier maßgebend. Mittels der großen Glasfront entfällt ausreichend Tageslicht für das Ambiente auf die Fläche. Auf dieser Fläche entsteht die Konditorei. Frische Backwaren aus dem Ofen stehen hier den Gästen zur Verfügung. Die zukünftige Konditorei hält auch „ToGo“ Waren bereit.Die 3. Ebene, der sogenannte „RooTop“ ist das Highlight der Fläche. Auf mehr als 100qm unter dem Himmel dient diese Fläche als Multikonzept. Vorwiegend für das Tagesgeschäft sowie abends als Event-Location mit der installierten Bar. Die Dachfläche soll für zukünftige Veranstaltung bereitgestellt werden. Angedacht ist auch eine Vermietung der Fläche für Veranstaltungen.Abschließende BemerkungenNach langen Recherchen im Bereich eines gastronomischen Konzepts in Kaiserslautern, erachten wir dieses als umsetzbar mit Aussicht auf Erfolg. Der Bedarf der zugrunde liegenden Zielgruppe ist durchaus gegeben und das Konzept sucht in dieser Stadt seines gleichen.Die Baumaßnahmen sind mit einem enormen Aufwand verbunden, jedoch wurden bislang schon elementare Gewerke in die Wege geleitet und umgesetzt.","Es bestehen weder Risiken oder schwere Herausforderungen die uns an unserem Plan hindern könnten, da wir sorgfältige Recherchen durchgeführt  haben ist mit Sicherheit zusagen, das dass Geschäft ein erfolg wird."

The idea in 1999was to offer sporting goods that would stand on their ownmerits as leather garments if they should ever show up on the street as fashionaccessories. I wanted high qualitydesign imagery and finely finished pieces without any “sewing” or seams thatmight tear out with heavy use as sporting goods. Some ofthat work resulted in a flexible helmet-draping toprotect the athlete’s neckthat we called “Dragonskin” in the studio. Interest in Sabratact grew slowly among my martial arts friends here in SiliconValley but that riveted-leather fabric called out to be made into small luggagepieces. So we did that, launched the fashionbrand Bella Dolci and in 2002 I expanded operations into our own facility inthe Philippines. Those first pieces werewonderful, but luggage and saddle-leatherbriefcases for menare not so much in demandas couture purses are and those aremadeof softer leathersin brighter colors. So I did that next. As we brought thosenew handbags back into the USmarket I sold through designer boutiques in New York City, Los Angeles, LasVegas and San Francisco until Neiman Marcus wanted 300 pieces of one design in4 different leathers and we knew we were onto something.Iopened a flagship retail shop here in the Bay Area on Santana Row in 2004. Ourcustomersperceived thatthey’d discovered a factory-direct couture house on a highfashion street (as if they were in Milan or Paris) and we proved concept thatthere existed very real demand for Bella Dolci purses by selling a lot of handbags at couture price points . I also used the boutique as my wholesale showroom with buyers from all over thecountry coming to us instead of me flying out to see them. They paid cash instead of asking for credit or consignment.The real money was in New York. My $400 pieces were wholesaledfor$200 to those shops and they priced them over there at $900-$1200, coming backfor more sometimes before we could take pictures as they were buying a collection on the spotwhen I unpacked my cases from the Philippines here on Santana Row. It was clear that we were leaving money onthe table by not being close to the NYC fashion scene and the magazine editors.Soin 2007 we initiated the transition to our own boutique in New York and wepacked up the Santana Row shop as we scouted locations. Then 2008 hit, financing in the United Statesfor a new couture brand was suddenly not available, the fashion market slowed downhard and we found ourselves without a retail operation. This caused theBella Leather Bagsstudio in the Philippines to slow down too insofar as we hadsufficient stock-on-hand to fulfillthe much reduced market demand over here. Our guys built houses instead butwe all want to open the shop again to get back to designing handbags.Inthat bank financing relies on liquidable assets as collateral or access tothe balance sheet, cash flow and income statements, US lenders cannotprocess loan applications for our type of manufacturing when such operations and all ofthose materials would be located inside a foreign jurisdiction. However, a bank in the Philippines would beable to lend into ouractive factory over there to leverage something thatis up and running. Therefore, we wantto kickstart Bella Dolci with the Philippine legal entity Bella Leather Bagstaking the lead rather than the other way around. Our workers over there will take homemoremoney to support their families becauseit would now be their deal. AUS lender would not let us do that. APhilippine bank can’t stop us.Bella Leather Bags, the manufacturing business,will drive the Bella Dolci brand and I havealready converted ownership ofour Philippine company into a coop, majorityowned by all of our workers as full partners. When weopen the studioagain this year they will capture a much larger profit marginat the factory and pay themselves a middle class wage 4-5 times what they were making as we pioneered the brand together (I paid myself nothing). Indeed, this will allow them to hold onto moreof the wealth they create and expandBella Dolciup to global market numbers, whilemaintaining the integrity of what we do better than anyone else on Earth andbringing on many more partners to share in the upside of our sharedsuccess.Mostof the working capital for this sort of process is booked as “system inventory”including imported rawmaterials, work-in-processinventory on the factory floorand finishedgoods shippedintoboutiques in the US, Japan and Europe. Certainly large department storespay when they feellike it. We must extend them credit and carry those receivables.Note thatthere are no machines to buy because everything is done by hand. All financingshould be secured in one place and that implies a Philippine bank rather thanone in the US.Tokickstart a global brand into the couture fashionmarketwith only $500,000 is aggressive. Nevertheless, this plan is solid. Some of our handbags that arelessthan 10 years old are already showing up as “vintage” pieces and the BellaDolci brand has a life of its own. But the design studio stands idle. We proved concept years ago. This thing is for real.","When I started Bella Dolci we sold for a couple of years on consignment through designer boutiques owned by other people in major fashion districts all over America.  And we were amazed at the price points they enjoyed.  At our own handbag shop we allowed customers to enjoy factory direct prices as if they had discovered us on a high end European street next to the design studio.  Our wholesale customers paid half this factory direct ticket and they continued selling at much higher prices in New York and Beverly Hills.  I wanted to move a lot of purses, push the design process hard, see what sold best and keep my studio busy.  What was a $1200 purse in New York was priced under $400 to allow my Santana Row customers to buy 2 or 3 pieces and I would throw in a belt.  They were prepared to pay $2000-$3000 down the street at the Gucci store or across the street at Ferragamo.   And maybe they did that too.  The store manager at Donald Pliner would send his ladies down to me to buy bags to match the sexy shoes he’d just sold them.  We were in the thick of it as a couture player.  We never developed enough unit volume to start selling online.  And that has to change.   Our Kickstarter Backers will select their rewards on line.  This means I need a Web site that presents individual handbags one-at-a-time because everything we do is a one-of-a-kind.  Our hand-made process without any machine work has each piece cut out individually, from the highest quality imported skins, fit to perfection, assembled without any sewing and we just don’t do the same thing twice.  When our customers and backers select a purse then the piece they will see on the website is the only one that exists.  Just like the handbag or shoe they would try on at my store.  Or a painting in an art gallery.    In my boutique in front of the full-length mirror we discover what works best.  I need to come close to that experience “on line” for you and this is my greatest challenge.  I found that my ladies knew what they wanted.  What suited their style.  They often went straight to it when they walked though the door.  We want to make that same magic happen and I need you to be so happy with your Bella Dolci.",https://www.kickstarter.com/projects/718579484/sabratact?ref=discovery_category_newest,718579484/sabratact,"In 1984 I engineered and launched a martial team sportcalled Sabratact and I wrote an article at the request of my friend Gary Gygax. He published my treatment under the title: Score One for Sabratact inDragon Magazine, Issue 100 inAugust 1985 to announce my new sport to the world.Duringthe next several weeks a few thousand young people, mostly teenage boys, wroteto me wanting to know where to play Sabratact close to the places they lived literally all over the world and howto buy equipment. The numbers were shockingly large and for safety reasons it was critical that I only offer equipment that was fully fieldtested.With theamount of armor I was able to produce to my satisfactionin that regard my development teamstayed small. Expanding fromthe bottom up we reached the limits of our resources pretty fast. Sabratact was too large to beso small. Andwe were too small to be doing somethingthat big. Yet we carried on. Weshot some encouraging television “eveningmagazine” programs in Connecticut, Chicago and California that were aired during the last 30 years as my armordesigns evolved and more athletes became involved. Sabratactis nota hobby activity where older players spendhundreds of dollars to kit themselves out as we see with historicalreenactments. And it’s not a casual weekendgame with a toyfor most people to play once and then stop as with Paintball or Laser Tag.Sabratact is an actual sport that young athletes willstart playing from a young age, train as they grow to become really good atit andcontinue into adulthood. The battle-groups willbe large and thesporting goodsmust be well made, safe, designer-intensebutinexpensive enough for everyone.Sabratact is a contact martial team sport with weapons. This thing was simply too large a project to do poorly and I put it ontothe back burner instead of seriously disappointing, hurting anyone or giving it away topeople whomight not do it right. Whoever makes the money will control Sabratact. I always needed that to be me.Tomake this thing happen we must reach thousands of athletes simultaneously with a market presence that is legitimate andthe ability to servetheir demand no matter how fastthe sportexpands once we launch. Our equipment must bedesigned within the context ofthe highlyevolved edged-weapon imagery comingfrom Hollywood and the game industry. Ourproduction valuesneed to be up to thatmark or anything we do on television will fallflat. People should want to wear some ofour stuff out on the street tomake a fashion statementlike we see with other sports. Weneedsporting goodsthat arerugged, protectiveandno-nonsense but fashion forward in a classic military sense.Over 10 yearsago I started working hard on precisely that engineering problem. The results included leather fabrics within my armor designs thatimplied small leather luggage pieces too and this led usto launch Bella Dolci with manufacturing in our own design studio in the Philippines. That processgenerated a couture fashionbrand with a life of its own, softer smaller handbags for ladies and high end leather garments. We can now design and manufacture Sabratact equipment in our own leather goods factory and we can scale up to servereal market demand. So we return to the sport that started this thing.Sabratact targets are shallow, 3-inch stainless-steel cups bolted through brass grommets onto thebody armor of our fighters and mounted on the helmets of field officers. Four targets are on the front of the torsoarmor, including one heart target. Breaking targets on officersresults inbonus points. Adhesive membranes are stretchedover the open mouths of those cups and thetargets rupture reliablyifpenetrated by the tips of flexible Delrin-plastic weapons. The most basic ofthese are bundle-of-rod swords that playlike Fencing Sabers and deliver a “scatter” of sharp strikes. Play is divided into timed periods with heart-target causalities leaving the field between rounds and team scores totaled atthe end. Teams are composed of 5-fighter squads, platoons of 20, companies of 80 andbattalions with 320 athletes. Even larger contestsare projected after a few years of further development. Visual images areappropriate for television and Sabratact fields should be outdoors. This is a contact sport but players have noreason to knock each otheraround per se. The helmets need not protect athletes from full contact collisions like for Football or riding a motorcycle. Butheadgear must be able totake a good hit andbe impenetrable tokeep weapon strikes away from the face and neck. A fencing mask secured with a chinstrap and paddedto coverthethroat is minimal protection and quite necessary. Players might carry shields, must wear heavygloves and should have protective clothing on their arms, legs and under thebody armor.Sabratact is designed to be a competitive teamsport. Athletes will be young and old,large or small, men and women playing on the same field at the same time. Speed, skill, teamwork, finesse and endurancetrump raw athleticism or size. Reach in,break a target and get away clean. Done. This is safer than fencing because our weapons arenot metal. And it’s a team sport withoutthe need for ""ball skills"". Fighters play perfectlywell the first time out. But training countsfor a great deal too.No modern sport exists unless it is on the television. Fact of life. And if something is on TV then it’s for real. Funny how that works. So we need to create an episodic televisionpilot as an element of this launch.I also want to make certain that enough Sabratactgear is out there so people will find someone to play with rightaway. This Kickstarter campaign gives mesuch anopportunity to accomplish both goals at once.","We already have our own leather goods design and production facility in the Philippines capable of scaling up quickly to generate the amount of Sabratact armor needed insofar as we have been producing high fashion Bella Dolci handbags and garments over there for more than 10 years. The television pilot will include 64 five-athlete squads competing to form 16 twenty-fighter platoons under the leadership of the winning teams through single elimination contests with the losing fighters coming aboard, leading to 4 companies of eighty players each.  I think I can do this in a two or three hour format.  We will then go to a 1-hour weekly show and try to get picked up for 13 weeks at a time.I need at least 320 martial artists and other such athletes (including guest fighters from among our Backers) to shoot this pilot.  Working in the Philippines gives us access to a martial arts culture of stick-fighting (Escrima) that is actually a good fit for Sabratact.  We can cast and shoot perfectly well with local talent cast right on location. It also turns out that the television and film industry in the Philippines is concentrated in Cavite (our Province) and we've worked previously with those people.  This can definitely be done with high production values, suitable for US broadcasters and within a finite budget.  ESPN?  Maybe.  Certain sporting goods brands stand to gain if Sabratact takes off.  Equipment such as leather hockey gloves are an automatic.  Elbow and knee pads from the Rollerblade world.  Shin guards for soccer or martial arts.  Light shoulder pads for a number of sports.  Really high-end helmets also need to happen and we’ll do those ourselves.  But I expect others to enter the market under license.  I want Sabratact shields to be inflatable or made of foam like for Karate training or Football practice.I’ve been at this for 30 years and thought I had it ready to go from the bottom up any number of times.  But the sport needs to happen big time right from the start.  Kickstarter gives me that opportunity.  Sabratact is the missing sport that I needed when I got into my 20s.  There are many kids who would not play a full contact sport but who will be great at this.  It’s easy the first time out and a natural way to play.  Sabratact is safe, fun, great exercise, demands teamwork and you just laugh all the time.  Thanks."

I produce my music at Red 13 Studios in Framingham, MA.Children of Aleppo - My First Single (Released Currently)First they came for the refugees, and I did not speak out  — Because I was not a refugee.Then they came for their children, and I did not speak out — Because my children were safe at home.Then they came for the people of color, and I did not speak out — Because I was not a person of color.Then they came for the women, and I did not speak out  — Because I was not a woman.Then they came for me  —  and there was no one left to speak for me.Steel blue eyes, hostile, devoid of compassion — Derisive laughter as tired, brown faces cross the borderBlack, brown, gay & transgender, they too God’s own children—Once a melting pot in a nation so great!Stirring conversations, a meld of cultures — Where is that city, once shining upon a hill?The weak, the poor, the sick & the frail — No hospice so humble, to tend to their needsHushed & subdued, the spring is silent — The remaining few tread softly, hiding in the shadowsWhere there once was a speech of freedom & hope — Mothers cry, children separated“You will meet them again”, they say, as they are taken away — Many once gone, never to see loved ones againBehind cages the young stare lifelessly at the distance — Is it our reflection we see in those scared, hopeless eyes?Stern faces ask for a passport, once a yellow star on a coat—A sign of the wretched, today in converseAbout Children of AleppoChildren of Aleppo is developed in the Original Soundtrack/ Alternative/ World/ New Age genres. This is my very first single released before the album so I can understand the entire process of creating a song from start to finish.If you like this song, here are some other albums & artists you may also like:Lord of the Rings (Soundtrack), 300 (Movie Soundtrack), Message for the Queen (from the 300 Movie soundtrack),David Arkenstone, For the Win, Jónsi, Blackheart, Dead Can Dance, Sigur Rós, Peter Hollens, Jónsi & Alex, Two Steps from Hell, Enya, Game of Thrones (Soundtrack).I like to connect my music to some real world issue which helps people to understand my music from their perspective. Children of Aleppo is dedicated to child refugees all over the world.Read the Story behind the song: http://childrenofaleppo.orgListen to my Song on any music service:https://ffm.to/rp8vngg.ODLThis funding campaign is started because it would be impossible for me to fund all my music myself. Making music is very hard and involves a lot of artists - but the process is not done once the track is ready. Without proper marketing, no matter how good the song maybe, nobody knows it exists.I have some good traction for my single, and it is on three Spotify playlists currently (this shows that curators and Spotify A & R believe the song is of good enough quality to be a ""hit"")https://open.spotify.com/artist/2tFZj29S3RPLcVWvvCw5b7?si=MoqxfpqUTJa4HJq0CS0S6wNote: Children of Aleppo came out of the music developed for my album, however it sounds completely different and in a different genre, hence was released beforehand as a single.Minor Funding GoalComplete the marketing of this single which has good traction on Deezer & Spotify. The success of the first single will make it easier to market and sell the main album for which I am seeking the main funding. Usually, we market new songs atleast for 3 months after the release on Facebook, Deezer (Feature.fm) & Spotify.Major Funding GoalThe major goal of the funding is to finish the work on my main album which is going to be released soon. Just like Children of Aleppo is based on a significant real life issue, the album takes this to the next level. The poem for this album (just like the one for my single) is way more emotional and I have just been moved to tears after I finished writing it, and hearing my song from that perspective.The photo for the artwork went viral on a social media platform, and I have been able to get the permission to use it as my album artwork. That along with the poem will make this album electrifying to anyone who sees it (atleast it has that effect on me).I composed the music for this song from a poem written in a major book read by millions of people worldwide.I can't talk much about this because I need to get licenses for the lyrics from some major players - depending upon the license, that will decide how we name the album and market it.The studio folks say given the quality of the music; licensing should not be an issue.I picked this song because after composing it 5 years ago, it kept coming back to me over & over again and I could not stop myself from starting the work on it last December 2017.The music is designed as an Original Soundtrack & fits perfectly as a score for a major Hollywood Movie Franchise - it is interesting, and takes you through a whole set of emotions from fear, anxiety, sadness, loneliness, tragedy, determination... Everybody who has heard it says it is an experience - and it is very visual in its impact.We went through several singers before finalizing one very talented female voice for the lead. Her voice reminds me of Linda Ronstadt.There is strings, french horns, cello, piccolo flute, uilleann pipes & solo violin in the album - designed as one long piece, but cut into many sections. My favorite is theuilleann pipes section which is dedicated to someone very special - a hero.We have been working on this track since March and I have listened to the track a million times, on a million different speakers, headsets, improving it and adding layer upon layer. The last time we played it in the studio, everyone was standing up and looking at each other in disbelief.So, I need the funding to complete the album, it is almost there, but we could do better, with more funding. I would like to do a no-compromise mix, I would like to get some bagpipe chords for the uillean pipes section, and really not have to speed through the work at the very end when we are so close to finishing all this.Also, the funds are needed to properly market this song after release so people know it exists. The artwork for the single blew up Instagram in many countries - so many people liked it a lot - I just do not have the thousand dollars I need to market the song through Facebook, Feature.FM and Spotify when it releases.If I am able to market it properly, honestly - the last time I heard a song like this - it was ""My Heart will go on"" from Titanic. I don't like all the songs I've composed - but this one is special - which is why we worked on this one first. I need some funding to complete all the work.Any left over money will be used to fund smaller singles which traverse different genres like pop, country, etc. These songs were composed a long time ago, some of these songs were selected in music competitions. Many people I know who have heard these songs already like them - it really is just a matter of being able to produce these songs and release them.I need some help from the community for this. I hope I get it. Otherwise, this album maybe my first and last album - in any case, that is how I am doing it currently - giving it everything I've got.Thank You!","Well, I have already given you the link to my currently released song which is on all available online stores, so you know this is legit.As far as risk is concerned, it is minimal because one way or the other, I will release the album. Just note that currently it is a 8 minute long track which was developed as a single track, but we will be cutting it into sections because each one has lot of meaning, etc.I have yet to fully decide whether to cut it or not - I want everyone to hear the whole thing, so the cutting will be minimal - Maybe 2 tracks, or maybe 4 - with minimal gap in between.Aleppo is already out there, so I can send the digital files immediately as soon as I get the funds or however Kickstarter works. I expect the album to release in the next few months. Definitely before December - I have put June 2019 just as a worst case scenario, I do not expect it to take that long to release the album as we are already almost done with all the main instruments.Lot of mixing left, and as I've mentioned, ideally, I would like to take it slow like my guru A.R. Rahman and add some more layers just like he does in his music. Even without that, the track sounds amazing - but I keep trying to improve it further if I can.Many people have heard this song - young & old, liberal & republican, everyone likes it, everyone thinks it sounds like a real movie soundtrack. In fact, most people say this would be perfect in a movie.The only risk I see is that we are unable to get the license for the lyrics, but given the high quality of the production, and I've already spoken with the publishers, and they are willing to give the license provided I send them the final mix, etc. Seems unlikely, there will be a problem there - even if this happens, I have alternate lyrics we can use, the actual vocal is only a small part of the entire album, and its best parts are instrumental/ orchestral music. Because of the nature of the poem and the song, it could be sung in another language as well. So, we have this under control.",https://www.kickstarter.com/projects/jamesalexandermusic/tiananmen-album?ref=discovery_category_newest,jamesalexandermusic/tiananmen-album,"I am an American composer, singer-songwriter, music producer, musician & poet of Indian origin. I consider A.R Rahman as my musical guru. At an early age, I was deeply influenced by the music of ARR in films like Roja, Bombay, Duet, Rangeela and Taal. I started composing music in 8th grade and have written many songs in Hindi, English & Malayalam. Most of my compositions are in English, and they were composed from the years of 1992 – 2000. After a hiatus of 18 years in the software industry, I have come back to music in 2018 and this is my first major album. I produce my music at Red 13 Studios in Framingham, MA.Since that day in 7th grade sitting alone in my classroom in the afternoon, trying to compose my first song, it has been a dream for me to release an album of my own music. My dream died because I loved to write code, so I spent a long time as a programmer, before ""waking up"" in Dec 2017. I had always continued to compose music in between, but one particular song I composed from a poem in the Hunger Games book haunted me for years. Every few months, I would dream of hearing this song.Finally I decided to find a singer from Craigslist, and I was very, very fortunate to find a very, very gifted singer who had the perfect voice for my song. When she sent me the recording of my song in her voice, I just kept listening to it for days. It was simply amazing, and I decided/ was forced to search for a studio where I could record this song.After scouring the Internet, I finally settled on Red 13 Studios in Framingham, MA. I drove 40 miles from New Hampshire to the studio to meet the folks over there. I was very lucky to find an amazing producer in Shaun Lichtenstein. Shaun and me worked worked for months on this album. I have other songs, which I think are better, so I never thought at the beginning that this album would be my best. But, it has turned out to be that, even if it were my last album, I would be happy with the work in it, because I put everything into it.I have put my heart and soul in this album and take you through a journey in music. While producing this album and listening to ""Deep in the Meadow"" on loop over and over again, I realized that this is not a mere lullaby. It truly is a song which started the revolution in the Hunger Games book. But, I did not want this album to be about fiction, and after reading about Tiananmen again recently, and seeing the original photo which became the artwork for this album, I decided to dedicate this album to a real event in history against one of the most oppressive regimes in the world.A lot of artists have worked on this album. Some of them are students, some of them are professionals, all of them have put in their best.The album is built as an original soundtrack and includes cello, violin and Uilleann Pipes. We did a lot of work on music software, but a significant portion of the music is played on real instruments.Read the Story behind the album at: https://deepinthemeadow.comiTunes: https://itunes.apple.com/us/album/tiananmen-ep/1448311841Google Play Music: https://play.google.com/store/music/album/James_Alexander_Tiananmen?id=Butysqobra4jrymo2o7wgsbicvi&hl=enSpotify: https://open.spotify.com/artist/2tFZj29S3RPLcVWvvCw5b7This is my first album after the release of my first single Children of Aleppo.Producing a good album is not adequate. The word needs to get out. I want to see the whole world stand up and remember 1989 on the Tiananmen Anniversary.When are we going to tackle the serious issues of today? Is it to be left solely to young adults singing songs about smartphones, drugs and beer?Thisfunding campaign is started because it would be impossible for me to get the word out about my album. Without proper marketing, no matter how good the album is, nobody knows it exists. So I'm asking everyone to come together to help me fund the post production and marketing for thisalbum, including an official music video, so that on the 30th anniversary of Tiananmen, we can bring more focus to this important event.Tiananmen deserves its own website, anthem, where we can forever keep the flame of freedom burningin an eternal vigil until China is free.The funds will be used to market this album, make a music video, and make sure it gets the attention it deserves. Marketing is actually one of the most expensive parts of any music release. It is impossible for anybody with limited funds to market their album effectively. Any remaining funds will be used to fund my next albums/ singles all of which will tackle issues currently faced by theworld. Some upcoming ideas are for the #MeToo movement and North Korean refugees.The album will release on March 1st, 2019. It is currently available for pre-order. Note that at this time, none of the tracks available for donors will be available at that quality (higher bitrate, etc) from any online music stores or retailers.Because of licensing constraints, donors will only be able to receive the tracks AFTER March 1st, 2019.","The biggest risk to this album was obtaining the license for using the lyrics from the song ""Deep in the Meadow"" by Sting. After working diligently with the record companies for a entire year, we were able to get the license courtesy: Warner Chappell Music and Big Deal Music (very grateful to them). Needless to say, if our music was not amazing, we would never have been able to get the license. There are no risks because the album is published and available for pre-order now. You can see it on iTunes and Google Play Music now. It will also show up on Amazon Music after March 1st, 2019."

Will you support us? We’re developing the prototype that will redefine the way you interact with your wristwatch and the functionalities it will offer.Back to the Future – For Good Alright, since the 80s and even before we’ve been promised that technology—namely holographic technology—would soon offer us a lot more than what it actually did. Until now. We’re so proud to introduce you to Project Flow, the holographic smartwatch that will take you back to the exciting high-tech future that you dreamed you would enjoy!Spin Wave Technology That’s what we call the technology that we will use to create the wearable. Using powerful light projection, your device will be able to create a still hologram, that you can interact with that uses sensors throughout the device to detect gestures that help you from typing messages, making calls, sharing photos, or using the fitness mode.Social, Practical, Functional Connecting with your friends and family members will be easier than ever. Instead of being glued to your phone to receive notifications look at your watch that will give you a hologram notification.On the other hand, this device is so practical, that it will offer a universe of functional applications. Hospitals, emergency services like fire departments and police forces, and rescue workers will be able to rely on a 3D-enabled holographic technology available right from people’s wrists that will make all kinds of complex visual communication truly seamless and amazingly efficient. Travelers and fitness enthusiasts will also find a seriously improved user experience that will make their phones a powerful and convenient tool for different types of data usage (be it health and fitness-related or leisure-focused), communication and sharing that will make newer technologies look dated.Pair it with your Smartphone Your wearable will also feature a three-dimensional display capable smart wearable that will be able to notify you of alerts paired with your smartphone with the message projected over the watch face using a hologram. Imagine how advanced and convenient it will be? Well, will build it for you!Quick & Wireless Charging Another must-have feature is wireless charging. After a long day, all you need to do is to place it the device on your wireless charger for quick charging, and that’s it. It charges quickly just as an innovative technology of this nature requires.Personalize It and Make the Most of It You will also be able to personalize your watch so that you can truly make the most of it. Set up alarm notifications, such as Good morning, Good afternoon and Goodnight, along with other kinds of notifications, have the time displayed, and enjoy the device’s RGB LED color ring and emoji that will make it even cooler.The NFC Edge The device will also feature NFC (Near Field Communication) to allow you to pair it with other speakers or to use for shopping purposes.Other Specs· Built-in Microphone and Speaker· Built-in Camera· Heartbeat sensor· GPS & Bluetooth· Long battery lifeSmart & Green The future must be bright and green, which is also why we’re planning our device to be eco-friendly. We will manufacture our prototype using recycled materials to cut down on electronic waste. Yes, it will look luxurious, it will be smart and it will also be green!We need to raise $1,176,000 to fund the prototype of Project Flow and any other funds that we raise will be used in placing the first order for the large-scale production of our device.We’re hoping you become a part of our founding community, which is why we invite you to:● Choose one of the great rewards that we’re offering to secure your role in the history of the first holographic wristwatch● Share this campaign on social media to help us get the word out about Project Flow and the innovation in wristwatches it brings● Talk to your friends and family members about Project Flow—they may also want to support itProject TimelineSeptember 2018—Market ResearchOctober 2018—Project InitiatedNovember 2018—Product and Concept DesignDecember 2018—Initial Testing & ConclusionsJanuary 2019—Prototype Plan Reviewed & CompletedMay 2019—Kickstarter LaunchJune 2019—Manufacturing of the PrototypeTBD—Presentation of the Prototype to BackersHere is our T-Shirt Design!

This three-dimensional virtual object is called a hologram and it is not physically there, yet it looks as if it were floating in space or in the middle of a room. This technology was invented by Dennis Gabor in 1947, a British physicist when he used it in electron microscopy.The Trew Watch is essentially a holographic projector that builds upon this technology with what we call our three-dimensional display technology to create a holographic image in the form of a smartwatch.We’re developing the prototype that will redefine the way you interact with your wristwatch and the functionalities it will offer. Want to stay up to date with your friends and family but you’re busy at the moment? Get reminded to call them with your watch keeping your to-dos organized.This technology can also be used in a wide array of applications such as for hospitals, emergency services like fire departments and police forces, and rescue workers will be able to rely on a 3D-enabled holographic technology available right from people’s wrists that will make all kinds of complex visual communication truly seamless and amazingly efficient.Nora was created to be your personal companion who wants you to enjoy each day. Let's start with Good Morning. It’s warm and wants you to brave through whatever has to come despite what comes Nora will be there with you to assist you through it all.As apart of our make 100. We will send out 100 Nora 3D printed figurines! How special!Your wearable will also feature a three-dimensional display capable smart wearable that will be able to notify you of alerts paired with your smartphone with the message projected over the watch face using a hologram. Imagine how advanced and convenient it will be. Well, we are building it for you!The Trew Watch is the world's first holographic wearable projector. Using what we call spin wave technology that is used in the device to create a 3D hologram that you can interact with using the sensors that can detect gestures and in-air swipes that help you interact with your Trew Watch.Take your watch with you for days at a time we plan the battery to last at least 3 days with moderate use and quick wireless charging. As well as NFC for payments or GPS for navigation. Time telling will never be the same when you ask for the time of day.Why MyTrew:Remember when advertisements used to be more entertaining and less draining? Maybe some are, MyTrew is our app that utilizes our Advertisement Rating System to make ads fun again., or the Flow Score that is a comprehensive total score an ad can get for its viewers the higher its Flow Score then the higher the listing the ad receives and can be placed in the top ad list for the month. This is not just for businesses if you are an influencer your content can also be rated with this system to enter you in the top influencer of the month. We want you to welcome this project as apart of your daily life think of Nora as your companion that could plan your day ahead is totally focused on bringing you the best day yet that only way a hologram can. When you do make your account, we strongly suggest using a screen name instead of your real name.Why the Price?Our service is subscription based and during our Kickstarter campaign it will be $1/month for life for consumer accounts and $30/month for businesses. Our budget is set so that we will have enough to create the quality watch and hire more helpers to give you the best experience of MyTrew.Personalization matters most so why not make the best of it such as custom reminders for the time of day. Receive Good Morning and Goodnight notifications from our assistant Nora. The watch will feature RGB lights installed into the bezel of the watch as an alternative to constant holographic notifications.Our biggest risk is not fitting as many features into the device as we want and to make sure that everything works as intended before final presentation to you.Our Eco-friendly technology pledgeWe envision the future of sophisticated technology with our own products that are sustainable while maintaining our high-quality appeal. Therefore, we want to prioritize manufacturers that are committed to sustainable manufacturing for our product.Our project needs $1,163,400 to fund the prototype and for taxes and fees for the project, and app development. The remaning funds will be used for ordering large scale production of the final product. MyTrew has many features we want to build on and improve on. One of these features is our rating system for business submitted apps and commercials. A portion of our project goal funding will go to this.

Flemish Fries in Holland is like a quality label for a fresh product that meets the definition above.Flemish refers to Vlaanderen which is the northern (Dutch speaking) half of Belgium.

The southern part of Belgium speaks French and is closer to France.Do you know 'stoofvlees' or 'vol-au-vent'? Or 'frikandellen'? Want to taste 'bitterballen'? All will be shipped from Belgium to the States, including the machinery to make our excellent food items.We understand that the terms 'stoofvlees', 'vol-au-vent', 'frikandel' or 'bitterbal' may be completely new to most Americans, so please allow some explaination: 'Stoofvlees' is a traditional Belgian sweet-sour beef stew made with beer, seasoned with thyme, bay leaves and mustard. Accompanied with fries and mayonnaise, it doesn't only smell like heaven on earth, it is heaven on earth!  'Vol-au-vent' is a common main dish based on chicken, mushrooms, and little meat balls, accompanied with a light pastry. Highly recommended!  'Frikandel' is a deep-fried minced-meat hot sausage that can be made 'special' with onions, mayonnaise and ketchup. Served with fries, you get a fine Belgian dish that will make you come for more. And lastly, 'bitterballen' is a meat-based snack which comes great with mustard or ketchup. Very savoury! ... And many more dishes will be served, each tastful and great with fries!Make your choice:Get served!:and to top it all off:A selection of the finest belgian beers:","To make real Belgian fries and fried snacks, you need the proper equipment that can heat up to the required temperature, and the knowhow. Having had the proper schooling, we need to ship the brandnew Belgian equipment to the US and have the location adapted to the Belgian requirements. We already have the best supplier in Belgium on our side, and require a warehouse in the US for stocking, and regular shipping from the warehouse to the location."

That's why nowadays most of the young people know about them and are a part of it by playing, meeting other players around the world and having hours and hours of unlimited fun. So we created this idea of an all-in-one web site were players of all ages can found everything we love of our favourites games.1.-eSports world:This section of the website is designed for everything related to video game leagues, tournaments, world cups and qualifying games.2.-Community;Each person who enters the website may have a user to share with other users any content related to video games.3.-Live tournaments;This section of the website is designed for broadcast live leagues, tournaments or any qualifying matches that are taking place.4.-Latest updates and news;In this section any user can choose the game of their choice to see the latest news and updates to which they will come out or are working on it.5.-Our Tournaments;We are creating a versatile, fun and attractive website taking into account the different points of view of each player, we are also in the process of creating tournaments totally different from what is currently seen. The triathlon games in these tournaments will be done in 3 different games dynamically so that the team that wins in 2 different games wins. Example: A LOL, CSGO and CALL OF DUTY tournament, the team that wins LOL and CSGO wins the tournament.",The biggest challenge wil be to have servers that will support the amount of visitors we will have every day from around the globe.

Why would you go to so much effort? and why would you not quit?If you have never had a dream and purpose in your life - you will never understand why.What about Rupert Murdoch?

Its compact body houses a foldable keyboard, which is as large and convenient as that of a laptop. pomera starts immediately after being turned on and continues to run on batteries for many hours. It is useful on the go, in a meeting and other settings.With the first model having been released in Japan in 2008, pomera will celebrate its 10th anniversary in 2018. In 2008, people who were using laptops on the go or on business trips were unhappy about the heavy weight, large size, slow startup and short battery life. They would carry heavy laptops just to take notes. During meetings, they would surf websites, becoming distracted from work.  We wanted an easy-to-use tool just for entering text, which led us to develop pomera. Now it is used taking notes as well as for writing, such as novels.We have launched pomera on Kickstarter, because we want this unique tool to be used by people in the U.S. and Japan.The device allows you to change the language setting to English. User instructions in English are included in the package.We have developed a new tri-fold keyboard for pomera. It features generously sized keys of with a horizontal pitch of 17 mm and a vertical pitch of 15.5 mm.The keyboard also contains key feet. These feet are linked to opening and closing movements of the keyboard and are automatically extended when it is opened. This means that the keyboard is stable and ready for use with minimum effort.We have received a lot of requests for key layout from everyone.Therefore we are considering changing the key assignment from Japanese layout to US layout. (Keyboard printing content and software change)We put the key layout image, if you have any options please let us know.The device works continuously for approx. 20 hours on two AA alkaline or eneloop batteries. The batteries can be replaced easily and immediately when they have run out, allowing worry-free operation.A list of headings is displayed on the left side of the screen as you edit text on the right side. This allows you to make changes based on each heading or arrange the order, ensuring quick corrections and editing. This function is useful for text that is divided into chapters.You can also select ""Invert Black & White"" display.Check the line number at a glance, which is convenient for long text. The device can also display a grid in the background.The device offers eight different font sizes. Choose the most comfortable one. The device offers five line spacing options. Choose wide line spacing for eye-friendly text and narrow spacing to view many lines at once.Change the keyboard shortcuts using the Fn key.Customize shortcuts (Fn, Ctrl+Fn, Alt+Fn and Shift+Fn) as needed.*Not applicable for all keys.The date memo allows you to take notes on each date of the calendar.Use the calendar as a date book, write a daily to-do list, save reminders for anniversaries or write a diary. The calendar can be saved as a text file similar to many other files and can be edited on a computer.*The date memo allows input of up to 16,000 single-byte characters for each date.The device allows you to create tables in .csv format, which has broadened the use of pomera. Write a report or create an address book.*Only characters can be input into the table; it does not have a spreadsheet function.*Up to 1,000 single-byte characters can be input in one cell.Text created on pomera can be saved to its internal memory or an SD card. The saved data can be transferred to a computer via a microUSB cable or SD card.  Text created on pomera can be converted into QR codes. Use the pomera app to scan the code, which transfers the text data to an iPhone. The app also makes it easy to use the data for e-mail and in the cloud.Use of FlashAir, an SD card with wireless LAN function, enables the data stored on a card to be read via wireless LAN.KING JIM Co., Ltd. is a manufacturer of information organizational tools with a focus on files and electronic stationery goods.Under the management philosophy of ""Developing original products and creating a new culture to contribute to society,"" we aggressively strive to develop products beyond the existing framework of stationery goods, focusing on creating new products with dreams.Although pomera is a digital tool, it is beloved by users in Japan as an essential stationery item for creating text, which embodies our commitment. It has become a steady seller, celebrating its 10th anniversary in 2018.   We hope that pomera will be used by as many people in the U.S. as possible, allowing them feel the joy of creating text.We look forward to your support!","Before we launched this project at Kickstarter, we repeatedly created and evaluated prototypes with a reliable partner in our efforts to minimize risk.- We assemble this product by procuring parts from multiple external suppliers.

But, I couldn't give up because I strongly believed its value. So, I negotiated for commercializing KAKUMIRU if I could fund JPY10,000,000（≈US$90,000）on Makuake, the biggest crowdfunding platform in Japan. As a result, KAKUMIRU have successfully raised JPY 13,500,000 （≈US$122,000）on Makuake. We won the chance to KAKUMIRU commercialization in Japan!Like KAKUMIRU and our previous campaign Pomera DM30, we are creating “next-generation stationeries”. We want to introduce our unique and useful products to many more people. Therefore, we decided to challenge Kickstarter to spread our product overseas with strong passion.Media AppearancesKAKUMIRU had big responses in Japan. It was introduced in Engadget Japan, CNET Japan, GIZMODE Japan and other medias including news papers.KAKUMIRU was created from the experience we have all faced — forgetting to complete a task. This device acts as a digital scheduling assistant, reliably reminding you with handwritten memos.KAKUMIRU is as easy to use as a paper memo with the advantage of a built-in digital alarm that will keep you on task by reminding you what to do next.With its simple features, we aimed to create the next generation of stationery that anyone can use. It is a digital device that gives the feeling of writing with pen and paper.Also, because an alarm can be quickly set for each memo you write, you don’t need to worry about forgetting important plans, appointments, and reminders. The limitations of paper memo pads are no more with KAKUMIRU’s digital functions.KAKUMIRU features a digital paper display that is as easy to read as paper. Since the LCD screen can display memos even when the power is off, this is definitely not your usual digital memo pad.KAKUMIRU has five functions including memos, to-do lists, calendar, clock, and calculator.With so many functions in one compact device, decreasing workspace clutter and increasing productivity is effortless.1. Just like pen and paper, simply touch the stylus to the screen to start writing.KAKUMIRU works just like a real memo pad, so it doesn’t have a power button. Touch the screen with the stylus to turn it on. It also has an eraser for easily fixing mistakes.2. Set the alarm for memos that you're worried you might forget about.An alarm can be set for each memo to give you a reminder on a specific date and time. The alarm automatically displays your message and includes a silent mode for quiet work spaces.3. Rotate the screen display to your preferred orientation.You can set an alarm for memos or items in the to-do list in two ways:1. General alarm- alarm which activates on the set day and time2. Weekly repeating alarm- alarm which activates weekly on the set day and time.In addition to the general alarm, KAKUMIRU has the useful weekly repeating alarm function.For example in business scenes, you can use it as a reminder of weekly meeting at 9.a.m on every Monday or weekly report due date at 5 p.m. on every Friday.Also, even in private scenes, it is useful as the reminder of family dinner day or favorite TV show and so on. Alarm setting can be chosen in three ways: sound-on, sound-off, not-setEven if your office is quiet and you feel uncomfortable for alarm sound, it is no problem if you set an alarm as sound-off. KAKUMIRU will reminds you by very clear screen display by E ink ePaper.Selectable pen/eraser thickness Thickness of the pen and eraser can be chosen from 3 types(bold/ fine/ micro). Thickness can be changed just by tapping pen/eraser icon.Easy to check stored memo pagesYou are able to look back at memo pages in two ways: Normal view- one page at once: tap ◁/▷ to go previous/next page as flipping over notepad.Thumbnail view- four pages at once: very useful when you want to find a particular page.To-do items be always listed in order of priority When using sticky notes on to-do management, you may stick the most prioritized one at where catches your eye the best. Priority of tasks changes moment to moment. Why people love to use sticky notes on to-do management is because it is easy to take off and stick again and again.KAKUMIRU also allows you to freely change order of to-do items in the list like using sticky notes. Moreover, an alarm can be set on items to never let you forget important items, which sticky notes can not do.We believe KAKUMIRU will be one of the best to-do management tool!Memos and to-do items with an alarm are linked to a calendarWhen you set alarms on memos/to-do items, they are linked to the calendar. When you go to calendar, dates which have memos/to-do items with alarms are shown with icon (details as below).You can choose calendar starting on Sunday or MondayYou can customize your calendar starting day of a week so that it is easier to use.Memo Can be Export/ Import to PCMemos created using KAKUMIRU can be exported or imported by using a Micro SD card.When data storage of memo in the main unit reaches full, you can export data and delete it from the main unit. Also exporting function is useful to make a backup of your important memos.If you need memo which you delete from the main unit but have a backup of it, you can import it.The screen uses E Ink ePaper Display.E Ink ePaper uses the same pigment ink that is used in printing, which makes KAKUMIRU’s wide, high-contrast display as easy to read as real paper. E Ink also makes it possible to read memos even when the power is turned off.The reward for pledging over ¥12,000 is your choice of either the Sky Gray KAKUMIRU with Turquoise Stylus set or the Stone Gray KAKUMIRU with Turquoise Stylus set.* Product specifications are subject to change.The idea for KAKUMIRU came from sticky notes. It’s easier to write memos and to-do lists by hand, but it feels uncomfortable to do it on a smartphone or computer. I ended up sticking memos all around my desk and some would get lost. KAKUMIRU was created to solve this problem.I thought I could end many of my workplace frustrations by having one convenient digital device with many useful tools that you could also write in. For example, digital devices with LCD screens aren’t reliable for storing memos because the screens need to be occasionally turned off since they use a lot of power. I wanted KAKUMIRU to imitate what makes paper great for memos, which is that you can read them whenever you want. This is why it was designed to work without a power button.E Ink ePaper Display was the solution because it continually displays the last memo you looked at even when the power is turned off, unlike liquid crystal. This feature makes E Ink the closest alternative to paper.However, there are some disadvantages. The writing speed was originally slower than liquid crystal. We worked with the E-ink manufacturer to improve the response time and have now reached a speed that can be made available to the public.When I suggest this project to my company, I received negative feedback with comments such as ""What’s wrong with using real paper?"" and ""The price is too expensive, so nobody will buy it."" However, I haven’t given up because I feel that KAKUMIRU can improve my work life. I decided to try crowdfunding, so if this Kickstarter campaign doesn’t reach its goal, I will accept that it’s not possible to make my idea commercially available — this is our last chance!Of course, paper is useful, but there are many reasons to question if we should continue using it like eco-friendly reasons and the problems with sticky notes that first gave me the idea for KAKUMIRU.For anyone who thinks KAKUMIRU is a great idea, please consider supporting us to create the next generation of stationery technology.King Jim Co., Ltd. was established in 1927, and has grown from selling a variety of filing products to digital stationery.

After that is finished i should have the team and funding to go into production of building a full scaled size craft. Some risk i can see happening are. -Stress and self sabotage with employees.-Not receiving funding due to the dismal of others opinions and views of this project- Getting in contact with developers and engineers that know and work with anti gravity technology - time span and cost are uncertain - Materials are uncertain at this time - the risk will come and challenge will come when this start to become real

It will be a sci-fi adventure where you and your team explore a wast alien ship and uncovers it's secrets.This game will appeal to both gamebook enthusiasts as more traditional gamers - extending the gamebook format with digital effects and narration.Agamebookis a work of fiction that allows the reader to participate in the story by making effective choices. The narrative branches along various paths through the use of numbered paragraphs or pages.Experience a Truly Immersive Cartoon style Gamebook through unique Game ArtAs you explore the alien ship you will stumble upon some truly unique Sci-Fi environments illustrated with gorgeous 2D-artwork.Command Your Team Through the Alien Ship and Solve PuzzlesYou will guide your team as you solve puzzles and encounters that awaits you along the way. The team members have different skill sets that will allow you to solve some problems in different ways.Experience Turn-based Strategic 3D BattlesYou will battle alien lifeforms through exciting turn based 3D-battles. You will be able to augment your gear with alien parts you find on the ship.The game will be published on MAC/PC and on iPad/Android tablets.They Have WaitedAs an alien ships approaches and make landfall on earth - prophets are interpreting a signal from the ship as ""I am Messiah"". Linking the ship to the Second Coming of the Messiah. Proclaiming salvation to be at hand in a time when the earths resources are running scarce and the earth most need it.The Origin of LifeThe task force assembled to investigate the alien ship however makes frightening discoveries that links the ship to the origin of life - believing it to be some kind of ark that carries life across the universe to seed worlds. As the enter they ship they encounter a sign that reads ""Eden"" written in ancient script. But what are the aliens intention and are they really linked to creation? Or are they just sinister beings that collect lifeforms for their own entertainment?RevelationsWhat awaits them are not like anything they have ever seen before. It will be a thought provoking journey through alien environments - searching for the beings that control the alien ship and a secret far older than mankind.Daniel AnderssonI run Seen in a Dream Studio, which focus on creating great story driven products. i am an author and a developer who have currently written several books and programmed business intelligence and apps for ios and android. i have always liked creating stories. As a child pen and paper roleplaying was one of my favorite things to do. Creating stories is one of my passions and now I want to create a great story for you.Niklas ÖhrbergI am an industrial designer who like everything from painting to composing music, I guess a I'm a bit of a ""jack of all trades"" when it comes to ""creative"" stuff. Apart from working on this project I am also about to start my own design studio were I'll work as a consultant as well as develop products of my own. I also used play pen and paper roleplaying games, often together with Daniel and some other friends. Daniel uses words, I use shapes and pictures, we both tell stories!","The aim of this project is really to create a gamebook/3D game hybrid. Where we are inspired by traditional gamebooks, but using a cartoon style with lot of great and unique 2D-art, narrator-voice and effects. For battles we are shooting for a turn-based strategy game with inspiration from games like xcom. We think this blend will make for a game that is really fun to play and mix great gamebook storytelling with more modern parts. Making the story everything it can be will be a challenge, but we will rise to the cause.

The game will have joypad game controllers with touch screens. wristband hand controllers and cardboard VR headset.The ProblemWe think gaming is better without microtransactions and want a gaming platform that supports this idea that was at the heart of old school gaming: pay once and play the game. No microtransactions to break the gaming experience.Our SolutionAn affordable Android Gaming Console that will support the Nomo Store. An App Store that doesn't take apps with microtransactions or free games. A game must cost at least 1 U.S dollar. There are however support for Free to Start (begin to play and try the game). But there can only be one in-app-purchase per game and it must be to unlock the entire game. No other in-app purchases are allowed in the NoMo store.What about Ads?No ads during game play, no banner or popups. There will however be possible to display an ad at the startup of an app. But it can be shown only once and for no more than 4 seconds.So it will be impossible to play other games than those on the NoMo Store?Probably not, even iOS have the Cydia store for jail breaked devices and Android is much more open. But we will promote the NoMo Store and there will be no microtransactions or spamming ads for apps/games. We will use a bonus system with NoMo Points to support players who buy no microtransaction games. If you don't want that, you are probably better off buying something else.Promoting PlayersWe want to create a system where 5% of all income to the NoMo Store will be used to promote new games that dares to be different. We want to promote creativity and fun gameplay.HardwareThe NoMo Will be equipped like a powerful android tablet when it comes to processor and graphic power. It will have two hand-controllers equipped with touchscreen and two vr-headsets and controller wrist/hand-bands.What are We Asking?We are asking for 20,000,000 SEK /2350000 U.S. dollars. We know it's a lot, but we want to make this great (with a lot of users) and make sure it go into retail. We also want a affordable gaming system with touch screen and joypads on the game controller and support for cheap VR right out of the box. We want the good old days back, when gameplay and content mattered - but with modern technology. We want an affordable gaming system that are free of microtransactions. With games that can be played with both game controllers on the NoMo and on your phone while on the go. Most importantly of all, we want a platform that dares to say no to microtransactions and an abundance of annoying ads. We want to play great games and not pay for every stinking health potion, we hope you do too.What do I get?You get the NoMo Gaming Console, two controllers with joypad and touch screens, two cardboard VR and two wristband controllers for controlling the VR. You get access to the NoMo Store Games on the NoMo and on your Android Phone. We might extend NoMo game access to iOS as well if possible.PortabilityThe NoMo Store will be available on your android phone, but only to those that own the NoMo console. We want you too be able to play your games home on the NoMo and on the go on your phone.About UsWe are a gang of programmers/harware geeks, 3D artists and industrial designers connected through friendship and our small companies.","The risks with this project is to not get a good enough price on hardware components. We have therefore set a higher initial price on this Kickstarter to get started, but will try to reach our target price level over time. Kickstarter funders will be compensated for this.Another risk is that not enough player cares about trying to remove microtransactions and limit ads to get more gameplay."

Why New York, because New York is the contemporary art capital of world and its also has one the highest per capitia number of artists in the world. Into the unknown mystical realm of art freedom where artists and collectors from around come together I aim to insert myself create and collect donated art works and redistribute them amongst the population free of charge. There would of course be a fourfold benefit from the expedition, artists would benefit from exposure and from the ability to clear out works clogging up garages, basements and attics, galleries would benefit from increased media exposure as well as a massive surge in visitor numbers, the environment would benefit from the recycling of art works and the art community and hence society as a whole would benefit from the democratisation of art through ordinary people who have never owned original works of art before becoming owners and collectors.For the last 15 years I have strived to redefine the concept of art and have given away over 1000 works to charities and individuals around the world. In 2015 we have given away over 100 works of art in the United States and actively encouraged other to seek charities and individuals in need and donate works of art free of charge. In 2016 I aim to come to New York and launch the worlds largest ever distribution project for contemporary art.The dominance of the narrative over the visual presence in contemporary art practice results in the commoditisation of contemporary art practice which is a negative aspect that detracts ordinary people from owning from contemporary art. With our proposals we aim to liberate contemporary art practice by returning the control of its creation into the hands of the artists and connect them directly with ordinary people for a month with the aim of having contemporary art redefined by its visual and social presence and not by its narrative interpretation as a commodity.So the basic idea is to rent a city shop space to offload product and a warehouse to contain and process greater volumes of art by accepting donations from artists, collectors and galleries then recycle the art to ordinary people who don't normally collect or own art. It probably wouldn't appeal to high value art collectors but if seconds and samples could be collected from well know artists then maybe they might be interested in helping promote the events or even a chance to offload some art for a good cause.","$50,000 should be enough capital to launch a month operation in say Brooklyn or Queens or maybe even the New York city or Chelsea. Problems I could foresee would be a lack of interest from New York based artists or a lack of interest from locals wishing to partake in the free art program. Coming from Australia and living in New York for two months for the one month project , two extra weeks are allotted to help secure a venue as well as pack up and tying up loose ends including distribution of left over works. Another issue that would take to major amount of funds would be renting a viable venue a shop front at a busy transit intersection would be best but all offers would be considered to obtain best venue such as church/synagoe halls, buildings scheduled for demolition, ex-warehouse spaces, library space etc. In the end its a project that wont make anyone any money but it is a project with a message and a project that has the potential to gather attention and bring people to area so it can ideally be hosted both in a city shop front and a suburban warehouse and bring people into an underutilized area",https://www.kickstarter.com/projects/188327164/free-pop-art-for-new-york-billionaires?ref=discovery_category_newest,188327164/free-pop-art-for-new-york-billionaires,"New York billionaires are doing it tough and we aim to help support them in their altruistic endeavors that support the American working class.A recent survey published in Forbes magazine shows that foreign billionaires are catching up to wealth of the billionaires of New York. With our support we aim to help the struggling billionaires who altruistically support US workers by paying them minimum wages. With increased competition from Chinese and Indian billionaires, New York's billionaires are struggling to extract the billions of dollars in annual profit to live the lives that they have grown accustomed to and expect.Currently New York has only 79 billionaires with a combined net value of $365 billion, compared to Hong Kong's 68, Moscow's 60 and Beijing's 51 billionaires. What this project aims to do i to support New York's billionaires by providing 79 large and intense Pop Art works, one each for New York's billionaires. Each piece of Pop Art will be provided free of charge and obligation to New York's billionaires and will cost approximately $100,000-$250,000 to produce. Each piece will contain custom made gold threaded linen canvas and feature deconstructed .clothing and jewelry sourced from New York's finest designers with full market price paid for these goods and generous tips included.The Pop Art pieces will be expected to be the finest and most expensive canvas based art works ever made and will be expected to increase 10 to 25 in value over the first 10 years of their life in the private collections of New York's billionaires.To give the finished product to New York's billionaires the Four Seasons Hotel will be booked with the world's best wine and chef's flown in for the occasion. Whilst it is only a token gesture to thank New York's billionaires for all they do for the people New York the is expected to have a 2 year develop phase. Twenty year projection for life of the project we estimate that it will contribute $10.5 billion to the wealth New York's billionaire's through both increased industrial activity, tourism, merchandise and online revenue potentials.All funds donated to the project will be invested the finest private equity manager that Ne York can produce and placed in an offshore account for its protection form the US tax office.",The risk is that New York's billionaires my require appearances fees or not want to be a part of the art charity project through stubborn pride.

So why are we here on Kickstarter and not debuting this on a more traditional network or outlet?The Film world is unique and not easily understood from the outside. To tell this story right, you need to have first hand experience. Although, to tell this story for more than cable access production values you need a partner. It can have some complications such as what actors we may have, changing the tone of the Films, going into production freezes, having a delayed release.The most important reason to use Kickstarter is that we have genuinely passionate, supporters who love to film. Even though we don't have a building yet our supporters motivate us and push us to succeed. We decided that it will be more fun for our fans and supporters to get involved.HOW TO GET INVOLVEDI would like to direct your attention to the giant wall of rewards to the right with dollar amounts attached. The rewards are great, but more than that, every dollar you spend goes to creating the movie I'M COMING COME.If you can’t support us with dollars then your enthusiasm and support is equally valuable - tweet, Facebook, tumblr, Linkedin, Mypace,  Don’t be afraid to use morse code or smoke signals. Talk about it with friends and associates at work, shops, dog parks, and all secret or not-so-secret gatherings. Spreading the word about the campaign is just as important!

Hardware DeviceKey:+S.S.E.T.G.: - Self Sustaining Electrical Turbine Generator+R.E.M.: - Rare Earth MetalThis system works by allocating a percentage of the generated electricity between each spindle point, and firing a short, self-generated electrical charge to an accelerator magnet for turbine rotation. The system is enabled by a closed case, low friction, silicon lubricated ball bearing configuration. To gain initial momentum, or for post-hibernation purposes, a solar-panel is useful for momentum.------------------------------------------------------------Thesis: The S.S.T.G. is a scalable self sustaining turbine generator system that conducts electrical energy without the prerequisite of an expendable fuel source. The S.S.T.G. also has the capacity to double as a cylindrical accelerator, capable of being affixed to existing wheel and rotor technologies. Hypothesis: A percentage of electrical conduction is split by percentage to a temporary/main battery system. From there, an allocation of electricity conducted between each spindle is then used to amplify the power of the accelerator by using a pulse-width modulator (pwm). The pwm fires a percentage of stored electricity to the accelerator magnet to initiate spin, just like spark plugs work in a combustion engine. In theory, with low-resistance, silicone-lubricated closed case ball bearings, the energy required to initiate/accelerate turbine spin is a lower percentage than the electricity that is created - thus, the device generates more electricity than is required to increase power.  If the accelerator magnet is far enough from the turbine spindle, as to not affect the spindle by the innate accelerators magnetic field, the electricity conducted should amplify the accelerator to reach the spindle and begin/continue rotation. ------------------------------------------------------------Comparable Technology: The Perpetual Engine    The S.S.E.T.G., in many ways, vastly outperforms former generations and concepts. Instead of working as a gradual accelerator, susceptible to pitch, yaw, and roll variations, the S.S.E.T.G. creates it’s own momentum while providing an additional power output for electrical systems and subsystems.

Perpetual Motion is said to defy the first and/or second laws of thermodynamics, which it does, however; gravity is an innate, invisible energy source. Perpetual motion describes motion that continues indefinitely without any external source of energy. With gravity as an innate, invisible energy source, I believe I have found the missing key to this conundrum. “The Perpetual Motion Machine is flawed in it’s ineffective capacity to redistribute energy, with the prior assumption that the process can continue unassisted. The perpetual motion machine is an analog, seven component self sustaining electric turbine generator that operates on localized gravity signatures.”    -Robert Bonner","Well, you might electrocute yourselves if you build this, after you initialize the alignment conductor, it has a runaway-gun possibility that will melt before it slows down.

We paint with oils, acrylics, sculpt physical clay, and we illustrate throughout most of our careers. When I'm not doing work for Modifications or ABD, I like to digitally paint to relax.All of the digital paintings will be in a resolution of 300 DPI, ready for print, and the size will be dependent on the picture frame you want.  If you don't want a physical piece of framed art, I can create a custom desktop wallpaper for you, and any number of copies and resolutions you prefer. If you want to frame this yourself, I can provide you with the files required and prepare them for the scale you want. We don't always paint bacon, but when we do, we get hungry.Bacon is amazing, but it'll kill you dead in your socks. Shoes? Socks or shoes... Not sure, but Bacon deserves to be a capitalized noun. #CapitalizeB4Bacon? You're welcome, Murica'.My favorite thing to paint is animals, so I'd like to extend this out to the more serious and less hungry Kickstarters. Take, or send a picture of your Dog, Cat, Horse, wtf and I'll digitally paint it and try to capture the essence of their personality. I'll have it printed out, then ship it to you in an IKEA frame of your choice.","Well, illustrating so much Bacon without wanting to stuff myself with it is going to be hard, so I have to take that into consideration for sure.  I think its a job hazard though, so I'll be vigilant and keep myself resilient. Offsetting the Bacon frenzy might be hard, but by drawing dogs and cats and stuff, it'll work itself out because I have no interest in eating dogs or cats."

Many problems came up in the surface in last decade using that approach. Problems like what happen when the server machine that exist in the same building with the clients get destroyed (data corruption, power cuts,physical disaster) or what happen if the owner have a chain of shops and want the users keep playing using their credits in different branches, what happen if the server needs restart ( All clients should locked in clients and the users enforced to log out).  But, now it's time to move on into the next stage by creating new solutions for internet cafe that rocks! We planning to release the new web-based version very soon in summer of 2015 by using cloud services and our app is ready to work with coin acceptors. So, this creates a new way for the new businessman-investor to work.The new businessman can now buy gaming computers and put it in different places for example he can put 3 computers in a coffee shop, 2 in a public place, 5 somewhere else e.t.cHe can pay some money for renting that place and earn money automatic using our app in combination with our coin acceptors. He can have the whole access remotely from a web browser 24/7 even using his phone! Nothing constraints him anymore, he can build as money he wants.
