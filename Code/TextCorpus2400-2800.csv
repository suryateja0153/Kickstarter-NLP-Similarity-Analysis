In the Fall of 2011 I wrote my first 7 songs and was blessed enough to get them professionally recorded right away by a friend. So on January 2, 2012 I self-released my debut album ""Reflections of Reality"" and since then it has been an incredible journey. As people started to hear my songs the response was amazing. Not only did I seem to have a unique folk style people enjoyed, but my lyrics were really reaching them on a deep level.I explore topics involving spirituality, the power of intention, gaining perspective, etc... and it has been amazing seeing these principles play out throughout this project.But I knew that my folk songs were going to have a limited audience and had always loved electronic remixes. And since electronic music has such a spiritual effect it seemed like a perfect match. So I ended up creating a contest offering all of my songs and stems (isolated song tracks) for free to use for creating remixes for the contest and it received a great response.Then after the contest I contacted a number of the contestants from all over the world to see if there was an interest in a collaboration project and found that there was. So we spent the next several months working on this project resulting in 8 genre specific EPs (each by a specific producer) of the original acoustic album. Then I put together a 26 song double album consisting of certain remixes from the contest as well as songs created for the EPs. So theChords of Truth Remixed Projectis 57 remixes from 14 different producers and it is all available for free online.On a very limited independent budget : ) I have worked with many talented people to create the remixes, the album covers, collect all the files, get them mastered, set up the albums for distribution with CD Baby, initiate a professional press campaign, and ordered 100 copies of the Double album digipacks for mailing to press publication that require physical submissions. So I am almost there.What I need now is your help to press the 100 copies all 9 albums.What I am looking to do issend each producer 20+ copies of their EP for distributing in their area. Stocking CD Baby so that there is a physical product for sale on Amazon allowing the possibility of submitting to Pandora (and other Internet radio stations). And to have the EP selections available for fans at shows. There are so many differentstyles to choose and it really demonstrates one of my central themes of how a different perspective changes everything. Each version sounds like a completely different song. It's crazy : )Just 2 examples:Contest Winner:Same Song, DifferentRemix!A big part of this project from the beginning was that the music was going to be available for free. I am using every cent I can to create and promote this project, but I really need your help with the funds for this last piece. So any assistance you can give is much appreciated. Thanks for checking out my project,Jason Garriotte~Chords of Truthhttp://www.chordsoftruth.com","If the project is funded, then we're good to go : )",https://www.kickstarter.com/projects/chordsoftruth/chords-of-truth-music-video-w-the-chameleon-and-ma?ref=discovery_category_newest,chordsoftruth/chords-of-truth-music-video-w-the-chameleon-and-ma,"My name is Jason Garriotte (aka Chords of Truth) and last year I released my debut album. It consists of 7 acoustic folk songs that pretty much came out of nowhere, and is not something I ever really thought I would be able to do.There are just so many great songwriters out there and I have always felt like it would be near impossible for me to come up with anything original.But after playing my own versions of classic cover songs for over 10 years  I finally decided to see what I could come up with myself. And the songs just poured out. I had to rework them before they really came together, but before I knew it, I seemed to have created new songs that use simple language to help explain complex scientific and spiritual principles for improving our lives. If you're into concepts presented by Deepak Chopra, Wayne Dyer, Eckhart Tolle, The Secret, What the Bleep Do We Know? Then you will probably get into the lyrics of my songs. All of the things I like to think and talk about whenever I have the opportunity, came out in these songs.Then within a couple months, I recorded and released ""Reflections of Reality"" in January of 2012. I am not a professional musician. Up until a few years ago I was a full-time tennis coach and still am an IT/Marketing guy. So when this album was released, I had 0 fans except friends and family.Then after the release, I was seriously blown away by the response online both by music fans and by bloggers that called me a ""A Brilliant Lyricist"" and Technorati said I was ""An Acoustic Powerhouse"". It was totally surreal!Then through a series of events starting last spring, my original album of 7 songs has been transformed into a collection of 65 versions that span multiple genres and 10 albums.One of these new albums was with Cas Weinbren (aka The Chameleon). Cas took my original tracks and completely recomposed my songs into something we’re calling Acidfolk. For the track “The Power To Be Alive” he even teamed up with the rapper Man-u-iLL to deliver something really different. And we want to share this song with everybody. So here is why we need your help. Almost everyone that hears these tunes really enjoy them, and many people are actually blown away. Leading up to the release of this collaboration project it received an overwhelmingly positive response,  with several bloggers even making statements about having never heard anything like it. Which is crazy to think that is even possible these days, but that's what they were saying. So right now our biggest limitation is exposure.  I am just getting started as an Independent artist and we're giving the music away for free, so my funds are very limited and it has taken everything I could come up with to get to this point. In my opinion, the most effective way for people to hear these tunes moving forward is a powerful, professional video. This will not only promote this song, but also the album along with the entire project.Cas and I have connected with a couple of video producers that are excited about working with this song, but right now we just don't have the budget to get it done right. So that is where you come in.I am hoping to travel to the New York City area by mid June so we can shoot this music video and schedule a few local shows. Our goal is to get this video completed, uploaded, and promoted online as soon as possible to complement these efforts.I will be traveling around the US this summer performing, creating videos, and promoting the project as much as I can, but would like to start with this video if possible. And the only thing really holding us back is the funds. So right now you are actually in a position to help decide which short term direction my life goes.  And I am just rolling with whatever comes next, but would love the opportunity to make this music video if possible : )Everyone involved with this project agreed to give all of this music away for free. So for us it's about sharing the music and I hope that you want to be a part of helping this video become a reality by submitting your pledge.Thanks for checking out our project.Jason Garriotte~Chords of Truth","The biggest hurdle right now is the funding.  Please help us share our music with everyone through a powerful, professional video by supporting our project!"

https://www.kickstarter.com/projects/877773678/art-business?ref=discovery_category_newest,877773678/art-business,"          Welcome to Elyse Nelmark Artworks!          https://www.elysenelmarkartworks.comStarting an art business has been a long time coming. Since I was a little girl, I loved to draw and paint. So much so that one summer my mom enrolled me in a summer art class in Detroit, MI.I always treated art, however, as a hobby until I started dating the man who is now my husband. When he saw some of my artwork for the first time at my parents' house he was baffled I wasn't trying to pursue more with my artwork.I've always considered myself a teacher (I teach college writing and literature courses)--it is my trade and what I am good at in terms of a career. After seeing some of my artwork though, my future husband told me he now saw me as "" an artist in a teacher's clothes."" After having a baby and needing a year to adjust, I decided to take a year sabbatical from teaching and my husband encouraged me to work on artwork. I am now working towards launching an Etsy page and Squarespace site later this fall.My original goal was to have them up by the end of October but I need a little more time and money to get more artwork finished and to get prints/copies made so by the end of November-early December I hope to have both sites up and running.Both the Etsy site and Squarespace site will have oil and watercolor original paintings. I will also offer fine art prints of these paintings in various sizes.I hope to have some already framed original pieces/prints down the road depending on how much money I get through this Kickstarter. In addition, I will have some homemade cards available in the shop. There will also be a custom option if you have some ideas in mindfor custom artwork.Most of my pieces tell a story, are inspired by nature (particularly the ocean), and are inspired by cities (particularly Detroit since I am a Michigander and consider the city to be one of my favorite places to visit to this day).Many of the pieces that tell a story are inspired by people and emotions/experiences. This is the reason why I am including a custom option on both the sites--because if you want me to tell one of your stories in a painting, I would love to do so! in addition, I would love to create custom cards/stationary.I also plan to apply to have some of my artwork displayed for contests/galleries. This money will also go towards having some pieces made for those opportunities!Being a successful artist takes time and money. But I believe I can totally do it with your help. The internet, and web platforms like Etsy and Squarespace, have made being a professional and successful maker/artist a reality for so many people today. I would like to be one of those people with your help. I know I can do this, but like all successful businesses I need funding. My husband and some of my other family members have been my biggest investors and supporters. But my husband and I have a young son and are saving to buy our first house, so that is why I am here rallying support!I will always be a teaching/academic. But I am an artist too. And I can even be a more successful artist with your help.Also, if you want to invest and want a reward for your investment but are interested in another painting size/option, please message me! We can work something out!","I am realistic that sometimes my artwork will take more time than I realize, especially since we have a young son. However, I have a supportive husband who helps. In addition, when some of my artwork takes longer than anticipated, then I will always be honest with my customers/clients and make it up to them by giving them a discount on their order, shipping for free, etc. I also recognize my artwork will not be everyone's style. This is why social media will be huge. I plan to promote/advertise my artwork on Facebook, Instagram, and Pinterest daily as a means to reach those who might be interested in my artwork. In addition, if a gallery or contest does not accept my submission, then I will keep applying and working until I find one that does. When it comes to custom artwork, there is the risk a client might not be happy. If a client is not, I plan to offer me giving it another shot in terms of a new attempt. If it still does not work, then I will issue them a refund and keep what I created to sell to who might be interested. Finally, I fully recognize it will take time to make a profit. But I will keep painting and sketching and advertising until I get there. I am also interested in potentially pursuing a two year MFA program for studio art in a few years as a means to continue to paint and get better as an artist.",https://www.kickstarter.com/projects/877773678/art-project-stories-of-the-heart?ref=discovery_category_newest,877773678/art-project-stories-of-the-heart,"I am embarking on an art project where I plan to paint images of love. This project will not only help build on my business brand (Website up now and Etsy site in production), but will also help me create a collection of paintings that I hope will inspire people and that I hope people will be able to connect with and appreciate.I started an art business this fall. I am currently working on the Etsy site as well. As I embark on starting a business, I've been thinking about how I can build up my brand, as well as how I can share my artwork in a special way not only through my business, but in a larger way.One thing I love to paint is images of people in love. I started doing paintings like this when my husband was deployed. I poured my love I felt for my husband into sketches and artwork of us. I realized then that I want to offer painting images of people in love through my art business. When I created my webpage and started offering custom artwork where I can paint ""a story"" for customers, I started thinking about how I would like to do something really special with my art abilities that I could share beyond custom paintings on my website. So I started thinking about embarking on this project where I will be painting stories of love.For this project, I will be opening up my website and this Kickstarter to asking for photographs (appropriate and tasteful photos) of people in love--you and your spouse/partner, your family, you and child(children), women who are pregnant, etc. This is open to heterosexual couples as well as LGBTQ couples/families/people. You also can submit a photo of yourself---to encourage self love. What I hope is to, after receiving photographs and funding, select 10-20 photographs that will be turned into abstract art pieces. Mostly oil, but I may do a mix of oil and watercolor. The key though is to embark on this project, I need the financial support because this is a huge project that requires time, supplies, advertising, and support.The progress of this project will be posted on my webpage and become a permanent collection on my webpage. More than anything, what I hope to do is submit this collection to galleries and art contests in the United States to share with more people. Your investments/funding will go towards helping me embark on this project, advertising it, creating the paintings, and submitting to contests and galleries so this collection can be seen and appreciated by a larger audience.Photopgraps will be accepted through this Kickstarter as well as through my business gmail: elysenelmarkartworks@gmail.comI will be asking for photographs for the duration of the Kickstarter. The sleeting of photographs and the sketching/painting will begin Dec 1 (assuming this Kickstarter goes through). I wanted to start the painting around the holidays because sharing the progress of this project during the holidays I think will be really special. I will work with backers to give them a reward/painting of their choice and that fits their investment/donation and communicate when it will be shipped/delivered.As stated, the progress of this project will be regularly blogged about on my website starting Friday, November 17.Why am I starting this project: I think we need more love. Lately the news has been rather depressing. Lots of bad stuff happening. Granted, it could be argued bad stuff is always happening, but lately I have noticed from people I interact with and chat with on a daily basis a lot of negativity, cynicism, and sadness when it comes to the state of the world and what's going on around us. I feel though that maybe, by sharing this project, its progress, and working to share it with a wider audience (audiences), it might offer comfort, and remind so many of us that there is so much love out there--and that is something that connects us all no matter our race, creed, political affiliations, etc.The paintings I showcase on this Kickstarter I hope give my supporters and investors a sense of my painting style and abilities.I hope you will support this project.","I know that not everyone will like my style of painting, but advertising will be huge to reach those that do. Advertising will also be huge in terms of getting a wide range of people to submit their photographs to be painted.  I realize that it may take awhile to find a gallery or contest that will accept these paintings, but through advertising, photography, and hard work, I am confident I will find a gallery (or galleries) and contests seriously interested in showcasing this project. In addition, this project will have a permanent place on my website and I will sell prints of these pieces on my website. If the original are accepted by a gallery, they will be there."

https://www.kickstarter.com/projects/artsofpoetry/arts-of-poetry?ref=discovery_category_newest,artsofpoetry/arts-of-poetry,,"We are launching this project based on the advertising dollars we receive to print each issue. The printing costs for our launch issue which is going to be 16 pages will cost us $2000 for 5000 copies. If we can increase our funding or advertisers we will print 10000 copies for $4000.  We have distribution set at various colleges and schools as well as local businesses. The local businesses will sell the magazine for $3. We will get $1 for everyone they sell. Again the purpose is to pay for our printing costs outside of our advertisers. Most magazines are funded through subscriptions and advertisers.  Our challenge as a start up is to get advertisers in the first issues. Most companies need to see a track record before they advertise. The community stores willing to sell the magazines on co-signment is how we will recover our expenses at first.  I have experience in marketing and advertising and a great deal of connections with my local chambers. While this may be a start up magazine, my relationships of the years in other business connections will give us the in to get local advertisers. We also are connecting with local businesses to give gift cards such as paint supplies, writing tools, or even computer equipment as prizes for our winners. We are working with schools to possibly give waivers to classes for our winners. Ultimately the first year will be the hardest in the give aways we would like to award. The printing expense for the first year will be $2000 in October, and up to $7000 per quarter for January, April and July issue. Distribution costs will vary whether we have are able to get contracts with local grocers to host the magazines in their stores or if we have to pay for rent space in stands. Both options are available. We are seeking to pay a nominal fee to our poets and artists published in the magazine at approximately $20 per publications. This is only so that they can claim the title as a paid author or artist. $30,000 will carry us through the first year. The start up to launch is at least $3000 for the first issue printed mid October and prepare us for January 2019 issue. In order to ensure both October and January issue is launched and printing only 10,000 copies in January we would need a total of $7000. This amount will cover printing for Oct and January and distribution costs. No salaries are being paid during this time. If we are able to get interns to get advertisers, we are giving them a 20% commission. At this time we do not have any advertisers pledged. Advertisers would be the best way to raise funds but as stated earlier, they usually need to see a few issues to make a decision.",https://www.kickstarter.com/projects/artsofpoetry/arts-of-poetry-magazine?ref=discovery_category_newest,artsofpoetry/arts-of-poetry-magazine,"Arts of Poetry started October 2018 with a dream to assist up and coming artists and poets get the exposure they need. Our desire has been to be the vehicle to take their dreams to the next level. Whether they are young students or adults with a lost dream, we share their stories and talent with our readers and followers. Over the past year we have helped over 50 artists and poets. This 2020 our goal is to reach the masses at a level that will give our artists and poets an even exposure through an increase in our distribution. Everything we do for our artist and poets is free. Our 5 board members have given their support both in time and in finances. In order for us to give the support and assistance to our artists and poets we need financial assistance through your donations.You can see our FaceBook : artsofpoetrymagazine or website artsofpoetry.com","The risks in printing 20000 copies each quarter is that distribution is expensive. I have a team of volunteers who assist in distribution. I also am going to have a luncheon at various art locations and have the business owners come to the location luncheon and pick up their bundle of magazine for distribution in their stores. If we are able to raise $3500 we will print 10,000 copies this December for our January 2020 issue. If we raise $7000 we will print 20000 copies. The magazine is full color glossy paper and a beautiful magazine style. Our hope is that with the increase in distribution we will receive more sponsor advertisers who will become part of our dream to take artists and poets to success."

A well done horror film is like a rollercoaster ride, you are reletively safe but the thrill of the ride is still there and very entertaining when it's worth taking.So what makes 'The Neighbour' the sort of thrill ride you want to not just take but be a part of? Well to me the essence of a good horror film begins with believable characters that you can have empathy with and genuinely care about their plight. So in order to bring them to life I have them face situations that you or I might face, make decisions that you or I have to make. Once I have created the foundations then I can introduce the horror element(s), in this case a pair of dysfunctional siblings that may be involved in murder and much worse.I have chosen 35mm film to present this as it is the most beautiful way of showing the moods, colours and settings with which to allow my actors to work, and using a widescreen Cinemascope format will give me greater 'scope' to hide things within the frame ready to jump out at given moments.So with the camera, lenses, talent in front and behind the scenes and your help, together we can make a great film that is both entertaining and the thrill ride we enjoy so much.","Having taken decision to shoot on film the risks and challenges are many but so are the rewards. With any shoot, the pre planning and set ups are so important and I have created a shot list that I believe is workable within the timeframe and the best way to present this slice of horror, so I will never turn a camera over until all disciplines are ready and happy and that we have as much total control as we can get within the locations (studio work is much easier to control)",https://www.kickstarter.com/projects/340472329/the-neighbours?ref=discovery_category_newest,340472329/the-neighbours,"She is watching...She is waiting...She is next...This is the frightening tale of Rebecca Mason, alone, isolated, living in a run down apartment block. Her only other neighbours are a pair of dysfunctional sisters. But all is not what it seems, because strange things are happening at night. There is always noise coming from the sister's flat, either arguments or loud music in the form of a children's song repeated over and over; is it to drown out other sounds? Maybe the screams? Rebecca begins to suspect that there is a horrible secret behind the door of the sister's flat. But as she gets drawn deeper towards the truth she could find that finding the answer could lead to murder, or worse...Venom Pictures Ltd is very proud to present an all female cast in this claustrophobic, sweat-inducing white knuckle ride of a Horror film.We are very honoured to have an outstanding cast to bring this macabre tale to life including iconic Horror film star Lynn Lowry in the part of Sister. Lynn is a veteran of the Horror Film having starred in such classics of the genre as 'I Drink Your Blood', David Cronenberg's 'Shivers' George A Romero's 'The Crazies' as well as it's updated remake and Paul Shrader's 'Cat People'.Playing the part of Rebecca Mason is talented Kent actress Charlotte Mounter, who will bring a sensitive and thoughtful intelligence to the complex and ultimately tragic character.Rounding out our 'Triangle of Terror' is Sallyann Fellowes tackling the 'monstrous' Marie. Sallyann is meeting Marie head on with a no holds barred portrayal of animal-like tendencies but tempered with a pinch of pathos and topped off with a generous helping of pure power, Sallyann is grabbing the prospect of prosthetics, meat tenderisers and edible guts with a suitable amount of relish!!Sarah Langton will be playing Rebecca's happy-go-lucky, soon to be married best friend Dee, who's genuine helpfulness and love of her fellow man will lead her into a dark and devastating end.The film has been a pet project of Writer / Director Mark Vella for a couple of years, perfecting the script and casting the right people has been a long and hard task but he can truly say with confidence that this is 'one of the most exciting and talented group of actors ever to walk the path of horror, murder and cannibalism!'Accompanying the talented cast will be a wonderful crew made up of industry professionals with extensive experience to make this look and sound frighteningly good! Plus the added bonus of a Make-Up artist who's speciality is making EDIBLE GUTS!!!To fully realise this we have decided to shoot on 35mm film using a Moviecam SL and some Ultra Prime Lenses to achieve a deep, rich and beautiful looking film that will be pristine whether viewed on a smartphone or a big cinema screen.So our cooking pot will consist of a fine cast, creative crew, the finest equipment and some wonderful 'on camera' effects that , when mixed together, will be a dish that you will want to gobble up again and again and again!","Shooting 35mm film does have its problems but the results far outweigh this. A detailed, extremely well planned pre-production should help us cover most possible trip hazards and in the unlikely event of setbacks we are more than capable to rethink and adjust to make sure we are efficient and cost effective but never losing sight of the vision and ultimately the main goal which is to terrify and entertain you, the audience."

Along her royal journey she encounters comedic battles between family, friends, and the community that will allow her voice to be heard. Come join us as we begin to animate this story in a fun and creative way.BackgroundThe character's name was derived from Queen Esther in the Bible which became my inspiration. I always imagined to myself what her life looked like when she was little, and I wanted to define her story for 21st century kids.GoalThe purpose of this project is to offer diversity, a biblical background, and a modern view for a fun and lovable character. We are not affiliated with any of the major cartoon networks, but we would love to get our foot in the door when given the opportunity.We need funds to produce a short animation segment and manufacture our plush dolls. Our market will be the early childhood demographic with an emphasis on phonics and problem solving.We already have in place an award winning production company, and a plush toy maker that can produce our products. The only thing needed is the amount above to get started. If we do not reach our funding goal all of your money will be refunded. Thank you for taking the time to read our page and we pray you are blessed in return for your generosity.","I don't see any major risks and challenges that could arise from being successfully funded. Our goal was to make sure we have a plan in place before asking for funds. It was also important to calculate a time schedule to give ourselves enough time to complete the project, and deliver the goods in a timely manner. We believe in customer satisfaction and making sure our potential donors are pleased with our service.",https://www.kickstarter.com/projects/714148164/little-esther-cartoon-animation?ref=discovery_category_newest,714148164/little-esther-cartoon-animation,"An old proverb says, ""If at first you don't succeed try again."" We HeJack Enterprises are requesting funds to produce an animation cartoon featuring our main character Little Esther. Developing an animation project alone can be quite expensive with prices ranging from $7,000 - $20,000. Fortunately, we have found an animation company that is willing to do this project for less than the normal rate. They believe in our dream and want us to reach an attainable goal.Our goal is to offer diversity on television while promoting early literacy and social skills for children in a cartoon format. When we receive the amount requested, we will create a 15 minute episode that will eventually turn into a web series or television broadcast if the feedback is encouraging. The script is ready and the animation company is eager to begin.The author and creator is an award winning educator that would like to use her skills to help little ones be successful. We would certainly love to pay for the animation ourselves, but we just don't have the monetary resources to get started. Several incentives are available as a thank you for your generosity.","The only challenge we face right now is receiving the funds to start this project. Once the funds are received, the only risk we may face is making sure the animation is completed by the deadline. More than likely, our project will be completed on time since we've allotted time for mishaps."

Our main target will be Android smartphones. That project has a name: High Five App The Revolution. We are now making a trailer about the team and I am sure the app is going to be something special. The initial plan is finished and we have a very good rockband Dubioza Kolektiv ( 1.000.000 people saw their videoclip on Youtube ) who will work with us to get the best experience possible in the app. The band members are my friends, so they will also help with the promotion in July.We can not tell you much about the project yet since it is still in the early beginnings, only that 1 out of 20 Dutch citizens will buy this app. We have planned a second upgrade and a third one shortly after we release the app. That would be around December 2015.The age of our clients will be from 14 years to 54 years. So we know for sure that the game will be one of the most spoken things as soon it hits the app market.The teamWe are a very dedicated young team of game makers, consisting of programmers, game artists, marketing specialists, professional music artists, and we will bring something new to the world.

I studied International Business and ICT, and I would love to show the world some new things with these apps.There are quite a few sites that deal with the issue of Palestine and a lot of organizations that support Palestinians. I can publish apps, so our struggle may become better known. Apps to create a kind of unity.For these apps I plan to approach other artists such as Lowkey (UK) and Genocide (Australia) and so the apps will be quickly known worldwide. I know where the boys are rapping about, so I already know they will be happy to help Palestine. Of course we will donate some of the profit to support Palestine and especially the children of Gaza.","When the app is ready and we use some of the money for advertising, there should be no risks.

https://www.kickstarter.com/projects/352526218/spliff-interpreted-common-lisp-and-java?ref=discovery_category_newest,352526218/spliff-interpreted-common-lisp-and-java,"Spliff is a functional programming language that started life as a little language for a scientific calculator that somehow grew. What it's growing from is a Java prototyping environment in a Lisp format. What it looks like it wants to grow into is a complete OS-style ecosystem with all the benefits of Lisp and all the power of Java in a single language that runs where Java runs.Spliff combines the dynamic fun of Lisp with the depth of Java, merging them into an interpreted language that's so fast to work with, and so stable, it feels like programming on banana peels - without the falling down part. But there's still work to do, and that's why we're here on Kickstarter - because we need your help to make this potentially happy union work.At its core, Spliff is a bunch of stuff.  It's a Lisp style read-eval-print loop, also known as a “repl”.  The repl is similar to a terminal that accepts commands in Lisp format.  The repl currently accepts both Lisp and Java commands.  The Java method calls have the exact same form as in standard Java, because they're Java.  The call syntax is Lisp, so the Java is called in a functional style.  But because the syntax is functional, it's possible in Spliff to pass Java functions as arguments in the same style as in Common Lisp, while getting all the stability Common Lisp offers.Because the repl has an interpreter that evaluates the Java commands right away, and a bunch of Java is available (we're testing as fast as we can), it's possible to build user interfaces from the repl.  For some, that's really cool, especially since state can be saved between restarts, so you can start in the same place you left off.Since lots of people need to work in something that's more than another terminal, the plan for Spliff involves first building an environment that allows one to quickly create and test Java code in a functional, stable, idiom.Spliff is composed of two parts and two languages, with a third, experimental language in the works.The two component parts, which might normally be viewed as layers are:The first release of Spliff will be as much software as we can stuff into it (see section: The First Release of Spliff for more detail.) The minimum release is a stable Common Lisp implementation, with a set of Java SE interfaces. At minimum, Spliff 1.0 will be a powerful prototyping environment (using at least the GrowLight IDE) that will allow one to build Java code so quickly, that is so stable to run and test, it'll make you laugh.The first release of Spliff will expose Java SE. It's possible that Spliff can also be built on other releases of the JRE. But the first release has to be solid. So we're concentrating on the SE JRE.The plan for the language is to build two languages and the tools to work with them:The early release of Spliff will have the following parts, so people can get a feel for how to use it:The Spliff Compiler (designed)Having an interpreted language is fun for prototyping, but compiled apps perform. We have a compiler designed that looks pretty solid, but until the rubber hits the road? We're thinking the first release might not compile until we sink our teeth in.Spliff-L is coming allhas some areas that need attention.  Here's a short list:Because Spliff-L is written on the Java programming language, it can leverage existing Java code, making for a more stable language with faster code completion.Java is a huge language and we've worked hard to expose much of it as an interpreted language in a functional style.  The biggest needs we have for Spliff-J are:With two powerful languages together, there's opportunity to create idioms that may empower developers. One of the first constructed, were iterators called ascend and descend. Each function takes a Java function and a Java collection and calls the function on each member of the collection.(ascend #'test-function java-collection)Spliff-L is going to be a standard implementation of Common Lisp. Spliff-E is where experimental and/or new utility interfaces will live.In many ways, Spliff has properties similar to that of an operating system, but without the hardware and OS limitations. Since its running on Java, whatever runs on one platform and release on a given operating system will/should run without modification on another operating system.Some of the properties of Spliff that have us pretty excited are:Being able to edit a running application is a powerful concept. Because Spliff apps can bind to GrowLight, it's possible to allow users to also bind to GrowLight (or an Interface Builder App), and edit or add features to an existing program.It looks possible to provide ways for user modifications to become feature additions to a product offering in The Stash. This would allow users or third party developers to gain exposure and income by adding utility to existing products.We're lean, mean, and geeky.  That means we work hard, cheap, and are pretty easy, too.  We've worked on Spliff as time allows, but we'd like to shift gears and focus on the language full-time.  What we're asking for help with is some concentrated time to focus on some of areas of the language that will help to make Spliff more than a novelty or prototyping environment that exposes Java in a functional style.Our plan is intended to be lean, using your help wisely to:","The biggest risk to the Spliff project is that it's run by a very small team of developers - me!  While I'm committed to finishing the project, there's always the chance that something could affect the project schedules by causing delays simply due to normal life circumstances.That said, I'm 110% committed to Spliff for however long it takes and are excited to take it wherever I can.",https://www.kickstarter.com/projects/352526218/awesome-sauce-java?ref=discovery_category_newest,352526218/awesome-sauce-java,"Look for daily updates that highlight the rapid pace of development of Awesome Sauce Java...Have a nice day ☺Awesome Sauce Java is an implementation of interpreted Java that exposes the majority of the Java JDK.  The compiler is designed and partially implemented to make seamless load of compiled code quiet - without restart.  Much of the Java (8. SE JDK) language is available and working as-is.  Testing is progressing and many Java methods run against their instance classes without fail. There are many classes that need bridge classes built to make elements available, such as graphics classes, JavaFx, Listeners and Threads. The parser is stable, but immature.  It's going to take a 2-5 days to make rock-solid.  The eval code likewise needs a 2-3 days of review.  Many of the applications are works in progress, but will take a few weeks to construct, faster if the Awesome Sauce Builder (graphical interface builder) is as fast as the prototype.  The majority of the three months is going to be focused on building bridge classes and testing:  building test code and test applications.  Building bridge classes provides the mechanism to facilitate method dispatch from internal implementation methods to Awesome Sauce Java interpreted code.Many of the core apps and components are designed.  The compiler is designed and ready to build, as is the Awesome Sauce Doctor (self healing code.) If it sounds like a lot of work, it is.  But the language and tools make it possible to fly. The goal is to get these tools into your hands quickly, because they're hotIt will take 3 months to build the first version of Awesome Sauce Java. It might be a late beta version, but it will be feature complete, highly tested, stable, and well-documented.  What works will be known and documented, along withwhat doesn't.  The release will include a suite of test code, test apps, and enough demo applications - real, working applications - to not only test the system, but provide an extensive collection of Awesome Sauce Java code for the release.Will any parts of Java be missing?Sofar, no.  But, it's hard to know if there are areas that are going to be prohibitive to make work well.  Awesome Sauce Java is proving itself to be incredibly fast and dynamic, while validating that the Awesome Sauce Java to Java interfaces are stable.  A lot of design effort went into making the language leverage Java without modification, while improving stability.  There are very few exceptions thrown that aren't caught and managed, allowing the runtime to maintain significantly better uptime than Java applications.  Threads are always an area of concern.Will it work with JDBC?Yes. I had been testing the JDBC interfaces when a hard-drive crash caused me to lose the code.  It was working well and will get built and included for the first release.  I was also exploring client-server interactions via the GlassFish Server and will publish updates in the weekly newsletter regarding progress about these components and Awesome Sauce Java. What other cool features should I know about?Thee method calls can be localized. In fact, the goal of the system is to facilitate collaborative, real-time programming and in different languages, such that code written in a first language is displayed to co-collaborators in their native language as code is entered. The mechanism and Locale folders for the localized entries are already in place.  It's a matter of localizing method names to make it work at the code level.  The Editor is also going to encourage localizing as much of the display as possible.  It's hoped that the combination of a license that encourages sharing, in combination with an environment that reduces linguistic barriers, will make hive programming, and more expressive applications and tools, possible.The pairing of Awesome Sauce Builder and Awesome Sauce Editor operating and editing an application simultaneously may make it possible for non-tech and tech people to co-collaborate on app design and implementation simultaneously.  How these applications come together will be updated in the weekly Awesome Sauce Newsletter. A sketch of parallel processing applications is on the pile of work to do.  It starts with a dispatching application and a set of supporting apps, each of which is configured for a set of libraries/packages and assigned to a processor.What about modern features?  The language is highly flexible.  Concepts like concurrency and parallel processing have been considered.  They will be implemented in a future version of Awesome Sauce Java as a natural extension of the language.The first version is intended to be focused on a stable Java release, running on a stable Java, with code that looks like, and is, standard Java.  It's hoped that by providing a stable, interpreted Java that looks like Java, more people will be likely to take a look and explore.  The language internals are very clean and malleable.  A subsequent version could introduce a concurrent language as an extension or second language.Awesome Sauce Java looks like Lisp, with some Smalltalk.  What gives?Awesome Sauce Java includes a wealth of Common Lisp functions and features.  It might even contain a complete implementation of Common Lisp at the first release, or soon after.  It turns out that Lisp with Java provides exceptional expressive power.  Both languages are incorporated in their standard form to make it possible for people familiar with each to jump in and explore without having to learn a new language.  But Awesome Sauce Java is Java and it exposes Java in an interpreted form.  The Lisp part is a nice bonus, because Lisp offers a lot of opportunity to do things like AI, rules, runtime & realtime editing of applications, functions, methods, and classes.  Plus, it stabilizes Java to the point where Java mostly doesn't crash.  Hopefully, the first release won't crash at all.  Point is, Awesome Sauce Java is Java, because Java is stable and has a great release format, but Lisp is a super-secret bonus that can be ignored by Java programmers until they start to learn some of the idioms and realize it's a powerful language that plays nice with Java.  The combination of the two languages is where the magic happens, becoming a new language of its own.Applications and ToolsThe following tools are already works-in-process and will be released with Awesome Sauce Java 1.0.Awesome Sauce Interface BuilderQuickly lay out working applications. Reattach to running applications and make modifications without having to stop-and-start.  Generate code for stand-alone Java applications.Awesome Sauce EditorEdit and run Awesome Sauce Java code from within an environment made especially for the dynamic performance of the language.  Attach to running applications, execute commands, and start processes.Awesome Sauce TerminalConnect from your favorite editor to the Awesome Sauce Terminal and run commands, start processes, and develop applications.Task Manager & Demo AppsTrack tasks and activities in a full-featured Awesome Sauce Java application built for making it fast to keep track of information and things to do.  Plus, Awesome Sauce Java will be released with a set of demo applications, sample code, test suites, and any other widgets we can put in the package.Awesome Sauce FriendsThere are a gazillion third party Java libraries, is there any chance they can be included with, or imported into, Awesome Sauce Java?Yes.  It's possible that some of the major third party libraries, from Amazon, Google, Apache, and more, will be included with the first release of Awesome Sauce Java.  There's no technical reason not to include them.  The only limiting factor is testing time.  The first release has to be functional, stable, and tested, and that represents a lot of work.  If much of it can be automated, then it'll make it easier to take a look at third party libraries and begin to work with those whose licenses are friendly to the Awesome Sauce License.The at-least weekly Awesome Sauce NewsletterReleased as often as it makes sense, full of updates, status, and news.Future PlansIt's possible one, some, or all of the following applications and components will be in the first release, it's also possible they'll be released soon after.  All who donate to the Awesome Sauce Crowd Funding campaign will be eligible to receive any or all when they're ready.Awesome Sauce OSAn editable OS. Runs on all OS's. Can be it's own OS on a wide range of computer and mobile devices.Hot SauceFast UI. Very fast UI.  Built by a disabled man to simplify complexity, and wait'll you try it, it's Awesome Sauce with Hot Sauce!Awesome Sauce DoctorSelf-modifying, self-healing code. Rules-based. AI.  Designed and early prototype built.  Looks pretty exciting as it makes it possible to build a suite of code for a code-point/function that responds to error conditions, exceptions, or other conditions, allowing for the modification of code at runtime based on rules.  Could also be used for subscription, cron, update, and a wealth of code management-related functions.Awesome Sauce ShopThe store for Awesome Sauce Java applications, modules, tools, and more.Awesome Sauce TransformersHot swappable Function code, making it possible to extend the Awesome Sauce OS and applications with new features, bug fixes, and upgrades while they're running.Awesome Sauce Parallel Modules & ConcurrencyIt's possible to configure an Awesome Sauce build with various Java core libraries.  It's hoped that by building configurable apps and modules, that a system can be constructed that enables parallel or distributed processing, where a dispatch application (or set of) sends requests to specialized application configurations assigned to cores or processors in order to improve processing power.Awesome Sauce Java is Java, so all the threading of Java is available.  Threading is always a challenge, so the threading model and concurrency, as well as other modern features, will be explored once the first version is stable and/or released.

I have over 200 different sticker designs created, so anything I make over my funding goal will be used to print more designs.Each sticker will come with instructions to put it up somewhere or on something and take a photo. It can be inside, outside, on their dog, wherever they want! Then they will send that photo to me and I will compile a book of the best photos of each design. If their photo makes it in the book, I will include their name and location and send them a free copy of the book.This first phase is just to get the stickers printed and sent out, both to people who request them and to random address to mix things up.

With the level of creativity that was displayed at ""Murder House"" we know that we have a platform to launch a professional scale haunted attraction in Tampa, FL. I am showingMurder Housepublicly for a first time exclusive, displaying the quality of our performance. With proper funding and a great network of local workers, this incredible show can be brought to life on a professional scale.I believe that people enjoy being scared year round and think that there is a market for a haunted attraction like ""Murder House"" to stay open throughout the year on select nights. People see the quality of ""Murder House"" and give feedback mentioning that we scare moreeffectively than other similar competition in the area. The public has voiced their opinion and wants to experience a haunted attraction in small groups for a more frighting and intimate encounter.Murder Houseis an experience that people are asking for.The Story for Murder House is simple and all you have to do is head to our website: www.murderhousetampa.comfor the details of how there is a gritty and dark world to discover on the streets of Tampa Bay!","We have a limited space to scare our patrons who find the fortitude to donate to Tampa's Scariest Haunted Attraction! We have to maximize our potential on this property to increase the scariness and showcase as many cool prop displays as possible. Since I was able to fund the purchase of some of the most amazing scary props to start Murder House, the only thing I am left with is to obtain the funding needed to pay actors a minimum $50 a night wage salary. That pays for five hours of personal expression. Murder House needs to employ five of these high quality paid actors. This totals $250.00 a night for our 13 night work schedule. This account for $3,250.00 dollars is the minimum required pledges needed to fund the proper amount of scare actors. I would like to allow for an employee benefits and group activities fund for an additional $1,750.00 dollars bringing this expense to $5,000.00 dollars.Murder House needs you to help raise the money needed to pay quality scare actors and make this an experience that you will never forget.

https://www.kickstarter.com/projects/1152545659/youth-streaming-radio-station?ref=discovery_category_newest,1152545659/youth-streaming-radio-station,"We believe that the youth of every community is worth our time and investment. This radio station will be the tip of the iceberg when it comes to investing in our youth!Picture this!Youth groups and students will get to be guest DJ's on air. The youth going on air will pick a hot topic to discuss during their session. The ""small talk"" the happens on FM stations will happen here as well. It will just be very purposeful and in a manner that reaches the students. The students will learn how to record and produce the radio shows, prepare a music line up, do voice-overs for sponsorship mentions and event advertisement, create websites, build apps and so much more. This station is going to sound like a mainstream station with a Christian message. Awesome, rowdy music selected by the youth. No long talk shows, just normal programming filled in with purposeful ""small talk"" in between song groups. Sound bites catch attention, talk shows put them to sleep!After their show is recorded the student DJ's will get to hand out postcards with QR codes on them so their friends have easy access to the radio app and can listen to their time on the air! Who doesn't want to know the DJ? This will be a major tool to attract unbelieving friends to the station. Streaming radio means they can listen to it anywhere, anytime!We will be the center for all things ""youth"" in the community. We'll sponsor concerts and events all for the youth. We will host students from schools to announce their fun events, sports and anything that applies to them. We will be present at large events supporting the youth and spreading the word about our station. By involving the students in every aspect of this station they will have a sense of pride and ownership. They will also learn how to be servant leaders and team players in a positive environment. When they leave the station they will have a solid foundation for being a strong, positive employee in environments that aren't always positive.Once the station is running our next goal is to get a building! Half of the building will be the station offices and the other half will be a youth center! This youth center will give the youth a place to play their own music live as well as have a safe place to hang out. With a cafe, games, pool table, ping pong table, other activities and a stage to perform on, there will be plenty to do! Club nights will rock here!This station is an outstanding investment in our future! You are playing a huge part in helping the youth get on and stay on the right path. Thank you for sharing your resources with us as we put this great mission together!","One of the major challenges with this project has been funding. I have talked to numerous religious groups and they also have fundraising as a means of supporting their missions. Every single group and individual I have spoken to is very excited about our project and wants to be involved in the station. I have received some funding already, we just haven't hit our goal yet.  I'm actively meeting with potential backers weekly. Persistence is how I'm going to overcome this. Delays in our plan are all determinate upon financing. Our goal is to be on the air by May 1st, 2017. It's getting close! We have reviewed software and products and everything is ready to go as soon as we receive the funds to acquire it all. The planning has been 6 years in the making. We've done our homework!Our logo is in the final design stage. Once it is complete it will be submitted to a garment company to create the embroidery sample. Once donations have cleared the bank all garment and gifts will be ordered to size/color requested. Estimated delivery is accurate.",https://www.kickstarter.com/projects/1152545659/youth-radio-project-needs-equipment?ref=discovery_category_newest,1152545659/youth-radio-project-needs-equipment,"KPI is an amazing mentorship program that teaches the youth in the community how to produce streaming radio stations; from selecting music to editing shows, D.J.ing and everything in between. At the heart of this station is a small group of qualified adults who have a heart for seeing these kids thrive! These youth are given responsibility and ownership of the station they run as well as being involved in the planning. Their knowledge and abilities are valued here, everyday! This station also encourages local musicians by giving them a venue to showcase their talent.The station in Reno,Sparks, Nevada is ready to launch!!!!!!!.............with the exception of a computer system that can handle the workload. To be the amazing station we are determined to be we could not operate on under qualified equipment. The programs we must run take more then your average computer. When you support this group you are investing in an awesome group of young people who are learning how to be awesome employees, great contributors in their communities and have a passion for helping the next generation by becoming mentors themselves!You're going to get to see your money at work. You'll be able to download the free app on your android or iPhone and listen to the station anytime of day from anywhere in the world! You will be able to make requests and, if you desire, you too could be on the air someday! You can check the website for updates and amazing events and see pictures of the youth as they work.Video commercial will be posted in a few days","Our project is ready to roll outside of this computer system! Once this is solved we will spend a month testing and retesting everything so that when you hear us streaming it will be top notch! We have the programming lined up, office system in place and staff ready to roll! A few of the challenges we face are funding. We have some great avenues for self-funding in place. A few examples are a team that seeks  businesses to support us with donations through on air mentions. We also have a great membership program where individuals can support us on a monthly basis and receive great benefits! And of course, one-time donations can be received and are always welcome! As we gain in popularity this will be a much bigger source for our funding. We will also be hosting several events throughout the year that will be a big source of fundraising as well. To top it off a whole line of KPI clothing items will be available for purchase on the website and in the office for those awesome fans wanting to rock our gear! These are very similar to the items gifted in this campaign! You're going to love them and will be able to purchase more for family and friends soon!The community has expressed a great desire to be a part of this station and support the youth. We are looking forward to an awesome year as KPI grows and grows and grows!We were blessed with an amazing artist who loves our mission so much that she has designed our logo and is helping us brand KPI! It is a really cool logo that is going to look awesome on attire! You're going to want to get your hands on this gear! This will not delay the production or delivery of gifts at all. The lag time on gifts is listed because we will be sure to send sizes that fit, so we are ordering per request, not bulk. When donating to this Kickstarter campaign, please be sure to give us sizes for hoodies and jackets. We will reach out to you if you forget.This project has been in the works for 7 years to ensure that it is done properly. We are ready! Thank you for your participation in this awesome project!

Being in food service for the past 20 plus years, I wanted to bring something unique and interesting to Austin. I believe I have found that very thing in this business venture that I am interested in starting. Stir Fried Ice Cream or Ice Cream Rolls became my contribution to the Austin food culture. There are very few places in Austin that offer this type of treat, and even fewer that are mobile or available for events. This is where I will offer my services.The funds collected will be used primarily for the acquisition of the equipment and permits required to efficiently run such an endeavor and a trailer to store and operate from. The equipment needed will be the fry ice cream unit, A refrigeration unit, a concession hand wash with 3-compartment sink, and a generator to power it all. A small percentage of the funds will be used to purchase any other material needed, such as pans, lids, scoops, cleaning supplies, and any licencing required by the state and county.Once the funds are available, I estimate no more than 4 weeks until the concession trailer will be operational and open for business. I have already found all of the equipment in new and used conditions and have recorded the prices and dimensions for each item. I have also gathered the prices for the food items and projected food cost percentages that I expect to encounter upon start up.","As with any endeavor. the risks are what make the rewards great and the challenges are what make the journey worth while.I believe the hardest part of this adventure will be is becoming completely legal to operate in the counties that we will be contracting from. Luckily, I have over 20 years of food service experience and I am confident that we can overcome any pitfall that may arise.

Hosted in a supposed center for mystical energy in the high desert of San Diego, called Jacumba. This is where hippies go to retire and I could not think of a better place for a festival like this.The plan is to round up as many curbside and craigslist couches as we can in 8 months, then bring them all down to a lot in Jacumba, California. Get a couple stages set up and contract some rad underground artists to rock them sh*tz. If attendees bring their own curbside couch then they get a special discount on admission.We're pretty much starting from square one, we have some equipment for staging and music but we'll most likely have a lot to rent/buy. This is why we're starting small with 2 stages, maybe a DJ tent and acoustic cafe. We also got gas money we gotta contribute to our homie with the truck whose hauling all the couches. Not to mention merch costs, contracting artists, refreshments, and portapottie rental.If your broke and can't contribute but you support the cause of keeping couches off the hard streets shoot me an email with how you would like to help.

We've decided our destination will be Boulevard California (a high desert town southeast of San Diego, next to the Mexican border) and the surrounding areas of Jacumba and Bankhead Springs. This sparsely populated territory is a vast unexplored outdoor wonderland. We intend to share the true potential and untamed beauty of this area through content created during this expedition. To not only share the wonders of this overlooked piece of Southern California with fellow outdoor enthusiast but with local inhabitants as well. We hope to encourage and inspire residents of these obscure high desert communities to utilize, explore, and protect the natural lands they call home. The expedition will include hiking, trail running, bouldering, rock climbing, mountain biking, and camping, as well as highlights of local attractions (and finding some new ones while we're at it). We also intend to host a number of community outreach events during the development of this film to educate locals on how they can get involved in conservation, outdoor recreation, and the outdoor industry as a whole. Once the full video documentary is created it will first be premiered at community centers in these towns for free. We intend to give these struggling communities a new vision for the future in addition to making a pretty sweet film, all while having a blast outdoors.

All three boys were excited about going ontheir long and far away vacation together and also the chance to visit with their grandparents. They are much looking forward of experiencing another country's culture, what the kids their age are like. What food do they eat. How would they communicate with the people there? They heard the Filipino language before but they never had to understand it, or speak it to get their point across. These are just some of the questions going through their minds as theysat in their seats during their long flight to the Philippines.One thing for sure, the boys expected a fun filled vacation. And that is exactly what their grandparents had planned for them. They figured the boys came a long way and they needed a break from just finishing the school year. The Grandmother went as far as having a tree house built for the boys.The Grandmother had no idea that the ancient tree where the tree house was builtheld some mysterious power that could lead theboys to all sorts of trouble. Through the tree house the boys discovered a spectacular Island. The first thingthe boyssaw in the Island was a giant Sea Turtle on the beach. Shortly after they begin to explorethe enchanted Island,they were joined with other giant talking animals. All they could do was hope that they animals were friendly and not hostile.The boys definitely got more than what they bargain for during theirjourney when a category5 typhoon hit theProvence where their Grandparents lives. If the 175 mph winds wasn't scary enough, the raging river was risingfast,and thestrong current was threatening to sweep everything to sea.The boys were looking forward of telling their story about their vacation to their friends and classmates when they return home, but would they live long enough to tell their story.  ***The names of the boys who are the main characters in this book are named after my three older grandchildren Connor, Gage, and Cody. I dedicate this book to them including my granddaughters Aubrey, Avery, and Zoey.USE OF FUNDS:Funds raised through kickstarter will go towards Publishing the book. It will cover the cost for editing, custom book cover, interior design, Kindle conversion, and marketing. Part of the funds will be use for print and packing your rewards. If the fundraising reaches over goals it is my wish to get a copy of the book even to the $5 and $10 level.","Anything that is worthwhile comes with challenges and obstacles. But I’m a believer, resilient, and I work diligently in working out any challenges that comes my way.  The good news is I have finished writing the book, so as soon as I obtained the funding for this projects, it would not take long to make it available for Global distribution.  After doing some thorough research, I’ve decided to use Create Space for my Publishing.  Going through a reliable Self-Publishing company like Create Space will eliminate many challenges since they provide services from editing to marketing.P.S.  I have written two other books.  One is fiction titled “Marriage with Malice- this is about an international internet bride.  It is based on true story.  The other book is non-fiction titled “It’s Never Too Late”.  And currently working on another one. These books are not published yet.  However, they are my next project to publish.ABOUT ME:I’m a hard worker individual with big dreams who refused to give up.  I grew up and I was raised in a small rice farm in the Philippines.  My father and mother worked extremely hard in the farm so that they could afford to send their kids to school. Though, they have both passed on, they remained as my inspiration as I overcome all the heartaches and hardships I have encountered and will continue to encounter as I go along in this journey. I came to the United States when I was sixteen years old.  I left my country and my family to try to make something with my life.  I remember when I apply for my first job at McDonald when I first arrive to the United States; I didn’t speak English well enough to communicate so I did not get hired for the cashier position. But through perseverance, further education and determination, I’ve held jobs in the corporate world including a position as an Assistant Vice President for a major bank. So you see- I have it in me to make this project successful.",https://www.kickstarter.com/projects/726848520/extraordinary-summer?ref=discovery_category_newest,726848520/extraordinary-summer,"(Though some places and occurrences described in the book are real experience of the author, Extraordinary Summer is a fiction novel)Extraordinary Summer is about a daring quest of adventure of three young school age American boys into the most secluded part of the Philippines to meet their grandparents for the first time. After their 24-hours flight landed in Manila, the boys must travel another 22-hours by bus on the most treacherous highways of narrow bridges, steep mountains, unpaved roads, and an unimaginable obstacles that they have to overcome. To reach their final destination, they boys must travel by boat, the only means of transportation in this primitive part ofthe Philippines.When they finally arrived at their grandparent's house and enjoying their visit, the eye of category 5 typhoon threatened to spoil their vacation. Suddenly, the family is fighting for their survival as the eye of the storm makes its landfall. Not only the storm threatened their safety, but the boys are also worried for the safety of their mysterious animal friends whom they met when they discovered an enchanted island that holds a secret of its own. Connor, who is the oldest of the three boys does an exemplary job of sharing all their encounters throughout their journey that will have you turning page after page. He is like your tour guide through out their adventure, who explains the culture, the people, the magnificent view of white beaches, volcanoes, rice terraces, waterfalls, caves, the rich and the poor of this magnificent country in his own innocent way.This is one of the roadways in the Philippines. Don't let this stunning picturesque view fool you.This road leads into steep road and narrow bridges into the mountain. At one point the bus is on top of the mountain that makes you feel like you are in a roller coaster. depending on weather condition, one could experience flushed floods, rolling rocks from the mountain that could push the bus off the cliff.Many areas in the Philippines has no access to roadways. The only means to get around is by bangka boats.Some interesting facts about the Philippines:The Philippines is a south east Asian Country in the Western Pacific, comprising of more than 7,000 islands. Population of 100.7 million people back in 2005. Currency is Pesos. Official language is Tagalog and English. There are between 120 and 175 dialects (individual languages) spoken in the Philippines. The antibiotic Erythromycin was invented by a Filipino doctor, Dr. Abelardo Aguilar. He sent a sample to Eli Lilly Pharmaceutical company which they filed for the patent.","Extraordinary Summer is a completed work. When I first came up with the idea and begin writing, I was so excited about this project that it was hard to put down. It was so much fun coming up and developing the characters and the plots of the story. The one risk that threatened the success in getting this novel published, is that I won't reach the funding goal. Therefore, I will not have the funds to pay for professional editing and the production of the novel.  I urge you to open your heart and support my project, so that I can get this book to the hands of as many young adults and adults to read and enjoy.  Furthermore, I have written two finished fiction novels, 1 non fiction and I would really like to put them in production."

But why not have your shoe and wear it, too?Meet Shoelusions: high quality, artisanal shoe accessories. Shoelusions transform basic shoes to fabulous, on-trend objects of envy. Shoelusions can be used on boots, booties, pumps, flats, sandals, mules, clogs and more. A real breakthrough for women who have to wear orthotic, orthopedic or special work shoes, Shoelusions can help spice up these otherwise basic footwear. They are also easy on the wallet.These are the 8 initial designs:8.

If this project is successful, we will look to feature additional local and international artisans in future seasons. And speaking of the holster (and not trying to be political) our idea is for people to use it to hold whatever. We stuck some booze in it (#fireballismyammo) or a leather heart (#loveismyweaponofchoice). What will you stick in it?If you like what you see, please fund this project. These make great gifts for shoe lovers, and we are expecting to ship around 08 December.","The biggest risk for Shoelusions is production problems. We have 8 designs to start: 6 are made locally by skilled artisans and 2 are produced internationally. While we love promoting international artisans, these items pose the greatest delay risk due to longer lead times and unknown shipping delays, especially during busy holiday period. However the 6 locally-made items pose a different risk of scalability. If we experience a larger demand than anticipated, we will have to find more skilled artisans to help with production."

For Dave to take his show on the road he needs to purchase a trailer so he can tow the show around the country.The funds raised on Kickstarter will be usedto purchase and outfit the trailer to serve as a portable stage. Dave will employ local artists Jil of Aotearoa and Griz Edmonds to construct, paint and decorate it in the unique, funky style of the piano bar.Dave is offering gifts ranging from a personalized postcard sent from the inaugural tour, up to an all inclusive tour in New Zealand with Dave and the Piano Van.Dave has made Napier his home, gaining the support of local business people, arts organizations and city officials (including the Mayor) so that he can remain in New Zealand.

Prohibition made alcohol manufacturing and sales illegal, which led to bootlegging and underground Speakeasies. Jazz was a risk that Americans took, and it paid off like no one expected.Americans are again undergoing dramatic changes, and our mission is to promote and release music that will reflect the times like Jazz did 100 years ago. We are a Member-Benefit non-profit collective represented so far by cross-disciplinary artists, industry sponsors, studio/venue operators, and business professionals in California and Louisiana. New Orleans pianist, entertainer, & entrepreneur David Hull is leading the effort to cross promote Jazz & Americana between his home state of California, and his current home in Louisiana. (More on David Hull here: www.funknoise.com)Prohibition Records is inspired by the confluence of two events: First, the centennial of the Prohibition Era is approaching as America faces another century of change. We plan to create American music that reports on that change honestly, openly, and artistically.Second, we recognize a unique opportunity to perform Prohibition Era ""Reefer Songs"" in California as Proposition 64 goes into effect. The new law legalized recreational Cannabis in the state, and we're commemorating the occasion with Prohibition music from the last hundred years. We're negotiating with Cannabis dispensaries to develop distribution partnerships, project sponsorships, as well as drug and mental health education programs.In Fall of 2016, co-founders David Hull & Laurel Manfredi completed a six thousand mile research trip around America. Hull met with dozens of colleagues to discuss Prohibition Records on the tour, and now travels frequently between New Orleans and the San Francisco Bay Area developing the label. On December 26th 2016, Hull and his colleagues successfully promoted a fundraiser at Fresno's historic Tower Theatre. (Fresno Bee Newspaper Article, 12-23-16).

The album is in pre-production and is to be recorded throughout the Spring. Each track will feature an artist or band from New Orleans or California, and Hull is planning an album release tour featuring artists from the album. Taking stock of the resources at hand, all Prohibition Records needs is you! We plan to build and employ a support network for artists between New Orleans and California.

After crashing into a residential home the NASA Quantum Universe Voyager Probe (or QUVP for short) begins to open portals to fictional worlds. Famous and notorious characters are unleashed into our reality. As a struggle ensues over control of the NASA probe by these ficiticous characters, it soon escalates into a grander scale outside the home as the probe unleashes the most destructive forces in cinema history. The moral of this story is the most famous comic book lesson of all: With great power comes great responsibility.We're going to use the money we raise here to obtain the highly detailed Sideshow characters to add to our cast, and have stop motion professional puppet makers create the rest of the characters. Funds will also go to materials needed like green screens, additional lights, stop motion rigs used to animate the puppets, armatures, obtaining CGI models for our grand destruction that takes place at the end of the film, and miniature sets.Once animation is complete we will be compositing all the stop motion action into the ""real world"", at times we will add CGI effects or CGI ""characters"" such as the Tie Fighter, Tie defender, etc. seen in our video.We appreciate your help and interest!www.facebook.com/quantumalterations","Your contributions will bring in the necessary artists to create these beloved characters and help them come to life. We also need to obtain the materials needed to go into production like: additional green screens, puppets, building sets, stop motion armatures, 3D model builders, and camera rigs. With the success of this campaign we will be able to obtain all the materials needed to complete this ultra fun fan film.Our biggest challenge is spreading the word.

If you grew up loving giant monster movies, science fiction films, the 1980's, stop motion magic then these are some of the elements you will relive and enjoy in ""Quantum Alterations.""This fan film is currently in mid-production and we need the necessary funds to complete it. The short is entirely comprised and reliant on stop motion and visual effects through After Effects and Dragonframe.We have had Professional Stop Motion Effects Artists create some of our stop motion puppets: King Kong (the original 1933 version) and one of our protagonists: an adult Hermey from the classic Rankin/Bass classic Rudolph The Red Nose Reindeer.The funds will be used to continue hiring Stop Motion puppet builders to create and construct the needed characters to complete our story. We also need special stop motion camera rigs to create tracking shots, and special stop motion rigs that will be used to make some of our characters fly and jump in our scenes.","Upon a successful Kickstarter campaign and after all the proper equipment has been obtained and characters have been constructed by the stop motion artists we will begin to finish shooting the remaining scenes that will complete our film. Once the film enters post production all of the music is already in place, it will then go into the various stages of editing, once the film gets a final cut we will then color grade it and the audio mixed. The challenges are any delays that can come from the process of stop motion puppet construction to more than incepted time required for some of our most complex visual effects shots. The personal goals are to not be content with a visual effect shot that you could have done better in creating. We have had ONE 45 second shot that was so complex that it took two weeks to create, but in the end the resulting eye candy shot was well worth it.Through hard and focused work in only being content with the best possible results will this short fan film be truly appreciated. Our focus is telling our story with the right visuals and effects, and creating those characters that not only you are familiar with, but will be rooting for."

But in addition to that we find another problem that has not yet been given a definitive solution. And is that with the increasing use that we give our cell phones the battery becomes an obstacle, a barrier to take full advantage of the capabilities of our phones. Thinking of all those people who are looking for a solution to these problems we have thought of a more practical, efficient and comfortable solution to those already in the market.The project we have created ""SoulCase"" is the solution to this important challenge, since it combines the protection we need for our mobile with a protective cover, comfortable and resistant, extra charge of energy, using a solar panel that will allow us Charge our phone with a natural resource like sunlight, allowing us to increase its battery simply by exposing it to the sun or even in the light of an incandescent bulb, without the need to load other attachments, SoulCase reduces everything To use a case in our mobile. Simple as that.SoulCase is also a respite for our planet, using renewable, sustainable, clean energy. And is that as we take advantage of the growth of technology to make products increasingly efficient, effective and environmentally friendly.It is for us a real pleasure to present an innovative and ecological product that can solve what for the growing market of smartphones is an obstacle and thus to create a barrier to take full advantage of our mobile phone.Unfortunately we can not carry out this project alone, that's why we come to you, using this innovative platform. So that with your collaboration we can make this a reality and reach as many people as possible. It is certainly a great support that there is a platform like this to support young entrepreneurs and carry out projects that can mean a contribution to our planet and community.To our donors, we would like to thank you for your valuable help and we will make the delivery of a SoulCase case on December 2017, since when the goal is met and receive the contribution we must start with the manufacture of the First units. And in that period of time they can receive their SoulCase in their homes. And a special gift.What is SoulCase? :SoulCase is an IPhonecase that has the ability to protect our mobile devices, while recharging the battery using only solar energy, is lightweight, compact, stylish and eco-friendly. It is developed taking into account and taking care of all the details, such as design, functionality, efficiency, protection, security. That is to say that all the parameters were calculated so that it works in harmony, without affecting in any sense our mobile or ourselves. Using the most modern technology to provide a project of the highest quality.How do I use my SoulCase?It is very simple, we place our soulCase like any other case of the market. Only SoulCase has the Apple TM lighting fixture attached to it, once our SoulCase is placed, all we have to do is Connectand enjoy!How does SoulCase work?SoulCase is a durable case that protects our mobile phone like any other, the key is that it carries a solar panel with a circuit created by us to convert solar energy into photovoltaic energy and thus to give power to our mobile, current Is just the right one for our mobile and it does not entail any inconvenience to use it.

Bill has made 5 music videos already. To view them on YouTube go here https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCHyWa5Hftzz3gbbRH0XLpsgThe idea is this. To be in with achance to get a music video made by professional animatorBill Greenhead, sendyour track linkto Bills Twitter account @Stiktoonz. Bill will listen to the trackand will pick one once he has reachedthe budget.This isn't a competition. The track Bill will choose will be onehe feels generates the most interesting visual language in his head.Something he feels will look visually interesting and be fun ordramatic to watch.If we raise more than £3750 Bill could spend more time on the project, even hiring a studio or artists to help make it look even more lush ordo more than one music video.You can also add a link to your trackif you donate. But make sure you own the rights to the track and allof the band members are in agreement with what you are doing.Once you agree you want to have yourtrack animated Bill will pitch an idea, if you don't like it. He'llgo on to another persons track.You must have all rights to have thetrack made into a video. Bill must have rights to show the video onYouTube and make some money from having adverts on that track.I hope that's clear.Bill Greenhead has been a professional animator for over 30 years. To view his portfolio go here.Any questions post them here.Bill isveryhappy to answer them.",I can't see any problems arising. I have a wealth of experience. I have made 5 music videos now and have been working in art for over 30 years.,https://www.kickstarter.com/projects/stiktoonz/christmas-music-video?ref=discovery_category_newest,stiktoonz/christmas-music-video,"The Idea.To make an AnimatedChristmas music video for Onions!WHO BILL IS:Bill Greenhead is a professional animator and Illustrator. Born in England he has drawn since he was 5 years old. Writing his own comics at 9. He has been a professional artist for over 30 years. Now he is keen to self generate work to help fellow artists who cannot afford his type of professional service. In this case animation expertise. He has completed 5 music videos which can be seen on his You Tube channel here.Who Onions are:Onions are a Manchester based trio comprising of Martin, Jim and Chris. Weaving mutual influences such as Talking Heads, Hefner, Sparks and 60's girl groups together to create a sound described as ""muscular twee"". Typically, the songs are a cynical and self deprecating take on sex, history or whatever rhymes at the given moment (But mostly about sex) After gigging extensively and an unprecedented amount of airplay throughout their unsigned 10 year career, debut album Pleasure Blast sold out in it's first week with help from a live BBC6 Music session.Onions have now returned fresh as daisies from a windowless studio after a six month hiatus with the release of the Here Comes the Rage EP on 25th August 2014, a sold out launch party at Manchester’s Deaf Institute and another session on Marc Riley’s 6 Music show and a second album scheduled for the new year.So it's quite simple. I need a budget of £3,750 to make a Christmas music video for this track. If we raise more money I will plough it all into the visuals, hiring extra animators to make it look even more special. Let's get this song to Christmas No 1!",There is very little that can go wrong with this project. We have the team ready to work on it. We just need your backing.

This is a theme driven book about Angels Mermaids and Goddesses. A year ago I worked on a photo-shoot that was so captivating and inspirational I had to figure a way to put it into book form. Dealing in beauty I wanted to have a theme that is so open I could literally do anything creative with it. What does a Angel look like? Can an angel be plus size? How about what if all Angels are plus size. I want my images to tell a story. At the end of this project I want the viewer to feel so refreshed they feel the need to share and view this book regularly.  One of my main missions for this book is to not overwhelm the viewer with overdone Photoshop and effects. During my testing process I had to create boring digital wings and work within very basic and limited locations. With Kickstarter this will change. Lets bring Mermaids to life! Let me use my imagination to show you my thoughts on what an Angel could look like. Goddesses one of my favorite’s women who show strength and power with an equal amount of sex appeal. I plan on keeping this project very close to me. Using freelance designers models and artist I will create a unique world made in my vision and my style.All the Angels will be plus sized models. I wanted to do Plus size angels because it just makes sense. There is nothing more beautiful than an Angel right ? Goddesses are strong powerful women. All of the books images will support everything you know a Goddess to be.Mermaids have to be my favorite part of this adventure. Some of the most difficult shoots but rewarded with some of the most classic images.Everything in these photo's are custom made. The love of my life builds the mermaid fins from scratch. Allot of creativity will go into the growth of this book. We did these sample shoots with a very low budget. I am exited see what we can accomplish with proper funding.Thank you so much and I am looking forward to building this amazing book. Also for more samples please visit my main photography page at www.jaboyphotography.comLow Budget SamplesI did these shots with little to no budget. Just a dollar and a dream :)The Aaron Fryson Book Specs:  Over 150 Photographs: color and black & white pictures.

The project should take 12 months to shoot and 3 months to produce and prepare for printing. A big challenge with this project is travel and design. The main reason I wanted to go for funding is I want the locations to be powerful! something mind blowing gorgeous. Picking the plus size models can be an obstacle. I want the Angels to look bigger sometimes its hard finding models that are ok with their bodies being displayed without edits.

Hashtag it #GodlovesnudityGod loves nudity. What a controversial — well not so controversial statement. In my career I have stayed away from nudity. I wanted to enter the, lets say nude world with a different approach. I wanted to bring my fashion style of shooting applying those skills to my nude work. I decided on this title based off my family and religious friends. Why is there such a shock value with tasteful nudes? Women didn't come out the womb wearing Prada. I love fashion but I also love the uniqueness of each body! Its easy to be lazy when doing nude work that is also a reason I wanted take on such a difficult craft.  Connecting the reality of nude and the beauty of nature. Have you ever wondered why a nude pregnancy photograph is deemed beautiful and a nude picture of a woman in playboy is socially unacceptable? I believe its all in how the artwork is displayed. I want to strip the sexual side of nudity and put together a collection of unique artwork. My goal is not to offend.

It was their way or no way.Hesuffers from ADHD, ODD, Agoraphobia, depression, ETC... He has learned from hisjourney of adolescents going through gangs, theft, drugs... He even lived onthe streets as his home and family were no longer respected. He did comeback,after some long hard thinking on how he would like to live life.I'ma proud mom, I listened, and learned that my son has passions for Hard StyleBase Music, he Loves:·Shuffling·HandStyle Free Dancing·PhatPants specially ordered from Arizona (Custom Made)·Workingout·Stuntingwith his bike.Ittook him two years to find his passions, of coursemammadoesn't makea ton of money toput a Gym into the house, so we just started out withthe Gym you can hang in your Door Frame.

I give my son gratitude for teaching me the life lesson thatsociety isn't always right, to follow your dreams, and just be YOU!Let'sjust say, he's one of the most peaceful, respectful, and fun kid to havearound! So, let's just say, my son has found his way, and is now encouragingothers to find who they truly are. If we had society allow us to learn what weare passionate about vs. being judged on the weakness of our interests, theemployment hiring would look a lot more differently, people would be learningabout their dream jobs, vs, other jobs the society pushes on us that we may ormay not like.

A healing centre available like doctors offices and liquor stores! ♡♡♡hope this touches your heart like we're intending it would. Battling with some not so fun health issues that prevent me from enjoying life that many take advantage for. Due to the irregularities of my good days and bad, it's hard to promise an employer full time hours, so, time to be creative again and see what I can do :) Where there's a will, there's a way and this is my contribution to the world! Let's make this happen!Our drive to help other people has not diminished through our struggles. We like get things going that would keep our hearts ticking knowing that we have made a difference in the world.Why Are We Doing This?Our crowd funding project is created to help kickstart a book that we're collectively working together to manifest. We have found a number of others who want to share their story and will be submitting theirs. We look forward to having excellent support from around the world to help us make this reality happen.There are quite a few topics we would like to touch base on from this book. The book will be a combination of real life stories, with people having experienced realizations and then how they overcome the obstacles. Ultimately, our goal is to have this available for all around the world to read.This book is full of stories from women and men who overcome their most unimaginable experiences. These experiences include; domestic violence including isolation even mental manipulation!With permission, parents may submit their children's stories too. Every writer shows their inner courage, conquering the fears they once carried, or still do, but have learned different coping mechanisms such as Metaphysical healing techniques from around the world.Doing this project is something that I am capable of doing from home.  As per doctors orders, stay inside where I can be in control of temperature and stress levels. Being a different person. Gotta love it lol.  Spring, but mostly Summer, is when I can mostly be out and be free and enjoy the fresh air.The world has been unbalanced for so long and people don't know where to turn. We hope this book will help heal people as they read these awesomely delivered true stories.There will also be an interactive part of this book where our readers have been given a project that might take five minutes. The ideology behind this will last a memorable lifetime This gift of ours is for ALL our readers in the world :) Learning this, will help you let go of issues that don't belong in your life... :)****Issue Boxes - Everyone should at least have one!

Must purchase the book to find out this secret!When the funds have been raised to market our book Once it's ready for publishing, some publishers will be able to send an advancement of a certain amount so we don't have to stress over survival. We like to think clearly while we collectively get all this together so let's make this happen.We're hoping to have our book published by December 2015With all of your help, we hope this is only the beginning of a dream for hundreds of like-minded individuals. We hope this dream will hopefully inspire others to get their stories out there. So much hidden talent we see! We need all the support from everyone around the world. So Let's make healing this world we habitat on, a priority. Iff you'd like to be in our journey it with us, along with select others. Our dream is to build healing centres across Canada and making them easily accessible. It's easy to go to places for example now; clinics, pharmacy's, hospitals and more. With more healing in the world, there'll be less sick people. Who knows, maybe a few movies might be created out of this amazing Kickstarter project!. We could only dream and will keep opening doors along the way ☺___________________________________________________________________Sample Story by Carolyn Angel MessengerHOW DREAMS ARE MANIFESTING:  I wrote some things in my Journal September 2014. I want to share this with the healing centre vision, that I know one day will manifest. One day, being starting in the year 2016. There are healing centres few and far between out there. Just think on how much money people spend on their travel expenses alone? Why not have a healing centre in a place that's easily accessible. We're hoping the government will approve this and allow this to be covered with our provincial and private benefits.Lets change the world in a way that allows Natural Paths, Witches, Monks, Wise Men, Medicine Men, White Witches, Pagan teachers, Veagan diet specialists, a few good doctors to be able to actually heal people with love,even a Dula!  On site, there will be medical equipment available including MRI's, Cat Scans, Ultrasound, X-rays, blood testing, etc. Possibly have a well maintained hotel for guests who travel to come.  All these happier people in the end result would equal less health issues if you think of it.Manifesting My Dreams in 2015 that was written in My Journal in September 2014. I started writing down my visions and dreams for this healing centre of sorts. I wanted to name it ""The Temple Of Joy,"" however the name was gifted to a very special person in our local community who made this happen.""You want to find out, what else is out there other than these man made religions, rules and beliefs? You'll find society is not making any sense, nor are the ways you are treated by someone out there.Not many people are like you and I. You'll find most find most take advantage of your kindness, generosity and good heart.A government approved healing centre, that is covered by your benefits, would be available and you'll have access tothe following that will help any ailment you present; including, mental or physical recovery or rehabilitation, the ability to heal from domestic abuse and receive spiritual healing from elders and learning about Reiki and your chakra and knowledge of the energies our bodies carry. Getting healing messages from the mediums that have messages to give you, sometimes it's enough to change your life. As long as your open-minded you'll hear a few messages that have an in-depth meaning for you. If you're suffering from addictions of any kind, and you would would want to receive help, we will then provide for you addictions counselling plus training in all other magicalhealing rhelms. With this, you'lllearn how positive mental attitude can change your life for the better and appreciate a moment for what it is.If you want to learn this, we will have teachers from all aspects of healing from around the world. ""My mission and goal is to teach others there are a lot more things in the universe that's much more fun to learn!MISSION:We provide services for those who are seeking and changing their life-styles. These Training Services IN ADDITION Will be provided for YOU!:We also provide services for those who are in the process of changing jobs and would like to offer skills training that will help includingAt the Healing Centre, all of this would be for both men and women:What we're hoping this would look like:In the middle of our healing centre, there is an in an enclosed space with a rain forest you can walk through; tropical trees, butterflies and birds and waterfalls!! Almost of like the Muttart Conservatory in Edmonton, Alberta Canada.  Just a peaceful, serenity environment! Where you feel at peace.Each treatment room will be equipped with open ceilings that open up in good weather, a hammock, and a single waterfall every five feet, all which is solar powered.There will be a plan constructed to contract a solar mine to see if this could be a project they would like to invest in. Along-side, we will have Himalayan Salt lamps including a whole room made of them. With their permission of course. Just like the one I experienced when I visited a company called Chakra Wellness in Leduc Alberta, which is a great place to go! This is my inspiration to make this happen in our centre.Self confidence will skyrocket, and there will be a whole new person introduced back into the world.  Helping one person at a time. This is actually going to happen!Other segments of the book will even touch base onreal life stories about bullying:The world doesn't understand yet what the biggest secret is. Meanwhile people don't realize, it's allaboutthe intent you wish to carry forward to people you give energy to every day. Make sure your intentions are good! I know people who do others wrong, don't get very far in life. They're still stuck in yesterday. They don't know how to let go. But everyone learns at different times in their life,just gotta be patient.Love, light and blessings!""Modern Day Gypsies!""Edited By: Loressa Gale","Our book is typed mostly already, it just has to be put together.  We have  well over 100,000 words and 43 pages of Times New Roman type size 11.  So there's a lot of true stories typed, so we hope to see this be one of the top sellers.We found in our journey, many people are looking for answers the typical society doesn't have for them.  Our wish is to help others get the answers they are looking for.  We can provide an environment where they would not fear judgement; but empowering themselves to learn more about their life from other views and perspectives the world has to offer in healing.We have plenty of support from our community and friends.  Those of which we've opened up the opportunity to put their stories in as well.  We already have more than 5 stories.  Everyone has a deadline of August 11th so we can see who is serious about helping us make this come true.Being that it's recession, we have to learn to be creative and continue to survive no matter what the economy is like.  This dream shall come true too! Thank you all for your support.Carolyn"

The FCC awarded these permits based upon our commitment to serve our community with educational and community based programming. Our organization, our town and our greater community are very excited to have this chance to build our own community radio station. There is a lot to be done in order to build a radio station! We will be calling on many of our friends, supporters and volunteers to help fill many of our needs to build the station. But we also need some cold, hard, cash. That cash is for our broadcast equipment. The studio will be equipped with an FCC approved 300 watt FM transmitter, a mixing console, commercial grade music playback equipment including a dedicated PC based music server with automation capabilities. There are also studio mics and cables, stands and other various hardware you need to broadcast. Also....an automated emergency broadcast system for the station. This is the equipment that automatically broadcast emergency information about weather, evacuations, etc.The cost for our broadcast equipment package is just under $6,000.  That doesn't include our actual studio building, antenna mast or peripherals. So with that in mind, we are going to ask our Kickstarter supporters to fund that $6,000 for our studio equipment. We will have about $2,500 in material cost to make the rewards we are offering so that puts our goal at $8,500 to cover cost and raise our goal for buying the studio equipment. We are counting on your support!One of the first opportunities we saw with our Kickstarter campaign was the chance to build our indie music broadcast library. WHMR - LP 96.5 FM will feature an independent, direct license broadcast format for our entertainment programming. Rather than broadcast music from a traditional music catalog like BMI or ASCAP, we would like to build our own private catalog of independent music while building support for our station. So we have three levels of submission for our indie artist that want to be on WHMR - LP 96.5 FM:$1 - That gets your original song into our indie broadcast library.$5 - That gets your CD or album into our indie broadcast library.$10 - That gets your entire original music catalog in our library.We will need a lot of original music to build our library for broadcast, so send us a dollar or ten and get your stuff on WHMR - LP 96.5 FM. (Keep in mind, we are working on an internet simulcast of WHMR - LP 96.5 FM as well, with a very large national organization that will make WHMR - LP 96.5 FM available nationwide... even global!)For those of you not making your own music, you can still get on the air on our first broadcast. $3 - That gets you a shout out on our first day of broadcast.Stickers.We love 'em. Get a case of 'em and get yourself stickered up.$4 - That gets you a sticker with the TERA logo, designed by yours truly.If you have ever followed TERA on Kickstarter or elsewhere, you know that we specialize in handmade crafts. This project is no exception. We have some new and trendy designs in bracelets, including the ""Hope"" hooks. $12 - Gets you one of our one size fits all, adjustable bracelets.How about a first generation WHMR - LP 96.5 FM ball cap or tee shirt? $22 - Gets you either the cap or tee shirt with logo.We have put together an absolutely awesome pocket survival kit for this project. We brainstormed and came up with the things you would need most, but other ""survival"" kits just don't have. Super glue anyone?$29 - Gets you our compact, pocket survival kit.The ""head to toe"" package includes ball cap, tee shirt, hook bracelet and a sticker. $50 - Gets you the ""head to toe"" package.Ever have one of ""those"" days? One of ""those"" lives, maybe? Check out the useless machine. Another one of our fine crafts we turn out of the TERA shop.  You can't win!$65 - Gets you a useless machine.How about a little ""payola""? If it's good enough for Nashville, it's good enough for us! We're offering up the first four song slots on WHMR - LP 96.5 FM to the folks that cough up the cash. We will reserve the right to reject anything that does not meet our broadcast standards, so don't send us profanity and such, but if you think your best deserves to be one of the first, jump in.$100 - Gets you 4th song broadcast.$150 - Gets you 3rd song broadcast.$200- Gets you 2nd song broadcast.$250 - You get the 1st play ever on WHMR - LP 96.5 FMSo that's it for now. If we reach our goal we are holding some more cool rewards in reserve. So spread the news, tell a friend, let's get WHMR - LP 96.5 FM on the air!","Taking on a radio station project is risky business,  no doubt.  There are any number of unforeseen challenges and risk that may arise.  What we do know however,  is that TERA and TERAs leadership has proven very effective at completing the projects we take on in our community.  So whatever challenges arise,  TERA has the experience and leadership to see projects through.",https://www.kickstarter.com/projects/1702013052/gypsy-wind-a-travel-food-and-fun-video-series?ref=discovery_category_newest,1702013052/gypsy-wind-a-travel-food-and-fun-video-series,"""Gypsy Wind"" is a music, food and fun travel video series with Jon and Yulia. We have an exciting year ahead of us that includes a cross country drive in a Volkswagen Beetle, a winter stay in Hawaii and a few months sailing the Carolina Coast. We both enjoy traveling, music, fun and good food, so we want to share some of our favorites with a web series that allows people to follow us along. I began publishing web video journals a few years ago during an extended cruising trip on the coast of the Carolinas. I enjoyed it and the folks who watched the videos seemed to get a kick out of it, so I continued publishing travel videos as I criss - crossed the United States over the next couple years. ""The Sketchy Motel Tour"" and ""The All-American Mexican Taco Truck Tour"" were a couple of my favorite video journals, along with underwater snorkeling videos from Hawaii. We will be using some of my own songs as a soundtrack for the series. Having recorded seven albums of original music, a new soundtrack compilation just seems to fit right in with this project. So there will be a whole new record to go along with the video series. Wild caught, local produced and harvested foods are a big part of what we enjoy. We pick our own wild morel mushrooms, catch our own fish, we pick our own plums and cherries and make our own wine. If there is a source to take our own food, we do. Digging clams, throwing a cast net for shrimp and catching crabs are favorites back in Carolina. Yulia has a great eye for pictures too, so we are making a cook book featuring our wild caught, fresh local and harvested goodies, along with the pictures of where the stuff came from and how it was prepared. We want to take things up a notch from publishing two or three minute video journals and make longer episodes and installments on a regular schedule. This means we will be bringing together multiple clips, using different cameras, adding music and intros, etc. In other words, we need some better video editing and publishing tools, along with a couple different cameras. That is where you come in.We are offering up some goodies we created, featuring our Gypsy Wind logo, to help finance the video equipment we need to produce the series. If we reach our goal, we will be using the funding to purchase the following:1. A new laptop PC dedicated to video production and publishing2. Two new ion pro action cameras. (I have two, Yulia needs two. One for dry use, one for underwater)3. One new digital video camera with quality zoom and audio features4. One new digital still camera4. A rugged travel case for the equipmentThis project is not for funding any travel or any other expenses. We will be traveling and taking pictures and videos, regardless of the success of our Kickstarter. The Kickstarter is only to see if we can offer enough goodies and merchandise to fund the equipment needed to produce a video series along the way. So, if this sounds like something you would enjoy watching, get on board and sign up for some of the cool goodies and merchandise we are offering. If we reach our funding goal, we have some other ideas to make the project even better and more fun. Yulia and I both appreciate your support of the project and we are looking forward to sharing our music, travel, fun and food with you! ","This project doesn't present a lot of risk.  Our travel schedule is already established and privately funded so we aren't depending on the funding here for anything other than some better equipment to log our travels with.  I think the biggest challenge will be putting the new record together.  The schedule is a bit tight,  but the material is already there and the equipment and talent to make the soundtrack is already established,  so we should be able to get it together if the project reaches it's goal.  I have published seven albums before, so.....All in - all,  this isn't a difficult project,  iI am well experienced with recording and publishing both music and video.  It's more fun than risk and challenge !"

Abigail is attractive, intelligent and successful.Her husband Matt is a well respected businessman, charming and popular.For all intents and purposes, this is a couple who seem to have it all. Successful careers, beautiful home – great marriage.But what is the secret they are hiding - the one that Abigail is desperate to keep to herself? All over the world, men and women are being abused by their spouses, or partners. Much has been written and filmed, showing the physical side of abuse but our 30 minute film aims to highlight the psychological and emotional damage. Being psychological, there are no visible bruises or scars - but does that make it any less damaging?How do we drecognise emotional abuse ?Why do so many women accept it and even defend their abuser? We take a look into Abigail's life as she struggles to cope with her husbands` behaviour and watch as she suddenly decides that she must stand up to him. But she wasn`t expecting the level of violence that Matt is displays and which soon escalates to a shocking climax.A Perfect Life is currently in the final stages of pre-production. Our main cast is in place, locations have been sourced and we have all the crew we need to make the film. Follow us on Facebook to keep up to date with our progress in our run up to filming. We are all raring to go, but this is where we need your help.....We are looking for funding in order to shoot the best film we can. All the money will go directly into the film, enabling us to hire the best equipment to achieve our desired effect and pay our wonderful cast and crew.Anything you can spare to pledge will help us a great deal in enabling us realise this project. If you're unable to spare any cash you can still help us by sharing our page to everyone you know - and maybe those you don`t know! Thank you. A close friend of mine has been in a protection programme for many years, such is the seriousness of the threats to her safety.She was instrumental in my decision to make this film and I thank her for her honesty and bravery.  Should we get to make A Perfect Life, you will hear from my friend as she talks about domestic abuse and it`s devastating effects.We would love to see `A Perfect Life` make it onto television – and that is our ultimate goal.After speaking with several charities who dedicate themselves to helping the victims of domestic abuse, we want to highlight the facts that abuse comes in all shapes and forms. Starting with the emotional side - the insults, constant put downs, bullying, controlling.  To the physical violence and the constant threat that women feel when living within an abusive relationship. It`s often hard to accept that you are in an abusive relationship, but we want women who watch our film and be aware of what constitutes abuse. The charity `Standing Together Against Domestic Violence`, have expressed an interest in using A Perfect Life for training purposes.We would be delighted to make a difference in this way and look forward to exploring this once our film is completed.Please don`t think that `A Perfect Life` will be grim or depressing.Although Abigail is in a bad relationship, this doesn`t define who she is.Away from Matt she is happy, confident and loves to laugh.  It`s when she is by his side that we see a person drained of vitality and self worth.Sharon has been acting for many years and is delighted to be playing Abigail.Brian:  David McCLelland. David has appeared in many productions and has several credits on both Coronation Street and Emmerdale under his belt.

With this in mind, we spoke with several charities who offer support to the victims of domestic abuse and with their help and advice we are confident that we can deliver a powerful, thought provoking film.We have been working on this project for some time and our main cast and crew are in place and raring to go.

Bill doesn`t want to leave his home.Upon arrival, Bill immediately notices that Hostas in Lytham don`t have any snail bites and decides it`s because Lytham is too posh. The dog smells, he gets car sick and he worries about his Geraniums.Bill`s new place, Daisy House has rules and he struggles to fit in.No pets are allowed, so he wants a Rottweiler - or a Budgie at least.He refuses to wear his Careline necklace and can`t resist pulling the emergency cord when no one is looking.My name is Sharon Sinclair and I have written a 30 minute script about Bill - a proud Yorkshireman who loves his garden, his daughter and his independence - not necessarily in that order.Older folk are the stars and as in introduction, they have the spotlight to share their thoughts and talk about whatever they like. It will certainly be entertaining!Bill`s daughter Abigail (Sharon Sinclair) wants to help her dad adapt to his new surroundings, but she is trapped in an abusive marriage and is struggling to copeDomestic abuse is a subject that is often hidden and not talked about, we bring it out into the open and through Abigail, show what it`s like to live with an abusive partner.Even when it seems as though there is no hope and no-where to go, there will be a way out. You just need to find it!Bill`s story is typical of many older people who move into retirement accommodation and often feel isolated and lonely. Initially he too follows this path and begins to withdraw from the world and spiral into depression.Ron, his best friend, takes control and leads him astray, with the help of a bus pass and several whiskeys. They end up blind drunk and get escorted home by Blackpool`s finest.  It`s not an easy film to watch, but when we get to the finale and Bill makes his last, triumphant gesture - it truly is a heartwarming moment.We are extremely pleased to have the support of Age UK and it`s members and we will be listening to any suggestions they have regarding the making of this film.Age UK do an amazing job supporting the elderly and it is our pleasure to be associated with them.We will be donating a percentage of any profits we make to Age UK.There`s never enough cash to go round on a small budget production, but we have spent many an hour poring over the figures and we`re confident that we can deliver a top notch, first rate film with 10k.We already have £6100 pledged and need your help to secure the rest.Expenses we have:Equipment Hire - Costs quite a lotCrew Wages (a few pints should do the trick)Cast Wages - (hoping a veggie burger and a plate of chips will do!)Catering - Mum and her friend Peter are in chargeLocations - Have some AMAZING locations secured and so far, not had to pay anything!Post Production - (see Crew Wages)FestivalsThat`s just a short list of expenses, but it will give you an idea of how much funding is needed to make even a 30 minute film.Good question.Sands of Time is a 30 minute film, that we are ultimately aiming to show on TV. Complete with a mention in the credits for all our supporters.We will also be entering it into national and international festivals to try and raise publicity, so that we can secure more funding for future films...Bobby BallHugely talented and much loved entertainer, Bobby was our first choice to play Bill and luckily Bobby loved the story.Bill is a difficult role as he is a complex character undergoing a dreadful illness yet facing it with a wonderfully dry wit and dogged determination.Bobby brings years of experience in the entertainment industry and his heartwarming portrayal of our central character is testament to his talentSharon SinclairWriter, producer, plays Abigail - daughter of Bill.Abigail loves her father very much and wants only the very best for him. Although she is trying to support him during a difficult time, she faces her own problems and is struggling to cope.Her husband, Matt is abusive and as their relationship continues to deteriorate, Abigail realises that she must make a decision that will affect the rest of her life.Abigail`s story is based on real life events and, although some scenes were very harrowing to film, it is essential that the abuse is shown.Abusers thrive on anonymity and our aim is to show how easy it is to be sucked into their world of broken promises. Watch how Abigail goes from being a victim to eventually finding the strength to make changes and take control of her life.Ed GreenbergDirector and the man in charge of the creative process Ed has an MA (Masters) in Film Production and has been producing films for over 7 years.Ed instinctively understood what we are aiming to do and from the very beginning he had a clear vision of how he wanted the film to look.In order to have our film shown on TV, we must create a professional film that is capable of standing next to other dramas.

Diners are not just served dinner but are offered a dining experience through a set of servers trained with precision of modern hospitality with a touch of modesty and simplicity. project Sāra is a platform that uses anti-restaurant concept to collaborate with a chef or an aspiring culinarian or even a home chef; delve deeper into what made them choose to speak the language of food, then inspire them to create a menu with cutting edge creativity and launches it through a specifically designed pop-up setting. We at project Sārabelieve that being a chef is a process, not an event. It takes years of work to be able to market your creations out to the public, years to open your own restaurant and more so survive it. But with project Sāra we give you all the resources to do so. It's like having a whole operational team for a restaurant, just not a restaurant in one place- it just moves, once a month, somewhere. For the adventurous diner, every experience is new, every bite of food speaks of creativity and expression, every dish is memorable.project Sāra has certain specifications with these collaborative pop-ups. We do not replicate a dish you make or have had in a restaurant. We urge our chefs to create a dish from experiences that have inspired them, we guide them to do so and give them all the resources to make them happen. Our pop-ups are not one long table, but white table-clothed tables of two complete with candles and placements. Our pop-ups have hints of decor that suit the theme and our team is in place, poised to give you that one day, a dining experience to remember.More so, we seek to create a social impact by joining hands with ALL those who cook and want a restaurant like experience. We aim at contributing a little to the community using only locally grown ingredients sourced through farmers around us.project Sāra seeks to create such pop-up experiences like never before in NYC.","project Sāra needs a place to host their pop-up and one having a functional kitchen. Delays in acquiring this space within certain time-frame may delay a pop-up for the month. Thereby, we have already tied up with a series of places who are ready to host us as soon as we are ready to roll.project Sāra welcomes everyone and anyone who can cook and want this experience.We would therefore have people with varied experiences and skills. However, our screening process and more so under our guidance and supervision we will ensure that our set standards of precision and upscale creativity is met. Like we say, if michelin comes to rate pop-ups, we should get 3 stars. We are and will always strive to achieve this. project Sāra being a food related business will have insurance coverage in order to cover any accidents of food poisoning, allergy attack or food induced problems. More so since prevention is better than cure we will always be working under highest standards of hygiene and sanitation. Our team members are already certified by servsafe and the health departments and are well trained in maintaining the health codes as set by the department.",https://www.kickstarter.com/projects/2078113034/project-sara-an-upscale-pop-up-dining-experience?ref=discovery_category_newest,2078113034/project-sara-an-upscale-pop-up-dining-experience,"What happens when a young Puerto Rican cook gets inspired to be a chef, backpacks through Europe working in Michelin Starred restaurants, comes back to USA and joins hands with Founder Chef of project Sāra?We invite adventurous diners to find out in a lower east side studio cafe where white cloth covered tables of two will be arranged in a subtle decor setting giving notes of an upscale dining experience. Cruise between unique consomme, crepes and crisps, fish roulade, smoked chocolate dessert all plated with uniqueness and finesse matching that of any ecclectic restaurant. We wont be serving dinner; we will be serving dining experience. project Sāra, an upscale dining platform that encourages young chefs to collaborate with us creates a unique menu. Diners get to tour through various textures of ingredients through a foreplay of dishes that enunciate the natural flavors of farm fresh ingredients. An ecclectic and upscale experience with our server and manager paying close attention to service through modest precision of hospitality that  our team is trained for.Our menus are omakaze, sample is available on our website, where in diners get to see the ingredients we will play aorund with but not know the dish that would be presented. But rest assured this is not one of those pop-ups with communal tables and family style dining experience. This is individually catered to, much like any upscale restaurant would do. Check out our website www.projectsarany.com for more details!Based on anti-restaurant concept project Sāra made its debut in TriBeCa in July in an upscale location. Restaurateur Viraj Borkar, a Culinary Institute of America alumna coined the words project Sāra (derived from the Sanskrit word meaning essence) with an aim to project the essence of being a chef and those of each locally grown ingredients through series of pop-ups each exclusively engineered in a unique way. Mangesh Elag, an active hospitality professional co-founded the concept and directs the service front.This one-of-a-kind dining experience is offered to a set number of diners and tables are arranged in deuces instead of communal dining. We are a white table cloth pop-up with a set team of servers aiming to give service through modest precision of hospitality. Each environment is exclusive to the menu and experience. Our menus are engineered in a grid style format only revealing the ingredients the chefs play with enunciating the Omakaze style, our underlying approach to food.",The only challenge we may face is the regular ups and downs of an operational kitchen and availability of certain ingredients in the market.

I love trying out new melodies on guitar and then thinking of either conventional or unconventional accompaniments (this is jazzafter all ;))to go with them.The StyleThe theme of this CD is ""Out of this World,"" so I want to hire someone on elance.com to create an out of this world cover. My goal is that it looks cooler than my B&W little sketch with Saturn as the ""O"" in world that you saw if you were browsing this project alongside other music projects here on Kickstarter.I'm naming all of the tracks some obscure letter and number combination. I want to do this because I feel like music is basically like this: we know the big names, ""Saturn, Jupiter, Earth, Mars, Neptune..."" that is, ""Mozart, Beethoven, Chopin, Bach"" but there are new composers out there and even though that are not well known, they still write some cool stuff! My InspirationI have been inspired by a number of talented jazz composers. Jelly Roll Morton, Duke Ellington, Zez Confrey, George Gershwin. But recently I came across a new composer who've I really enjoyed playing on the piano named Ned Gerhart. He doesn't sell his book of ""Standards"" anymore, but his style is a huge influence of mine.The DetailsFor the audio production, I plan to record all of the material myself. So if you like the sound in the video, good--that's what it's going to sound like on the record! I like to hand pick when I play because instead of picking which gives you this clicking sound, the finger gives it a brighter tone!All of the jazz that I play I will be offering the sheet music of and also the backing tracks so you can play along on a bluetooth speaker or something :)","I'll tell you what, playing these pieces is tough.  It's tough to play with a backing track and hit the right notes, takes a lot of practice.  The biggest risk is that the project won't be funded.  It happens.  But... DON'T LET IT HAPPEN!

I want to write across a lot of genres for this CD so that as the name of the album suggests, there is indeed, ""Something For Everyone"" ! Tentatively due out on 6/7/18.Being an independent artist is a challenge. In order to make a name for yourself, there's a lot that has to happen. Whereas the big labels will take care of the very expensive, but tried and true marketing, production and radio airplay for a new album, an independent artist has to wear a lot of hats! Or, one needs to raise a lot of money to get the kind of exposure that the Jay-Zs and Taylor Swifts of the world have.Every obstacle is an opportunity, and I believe we currently live at an exciting time where independent/unsigned artists are becoming more popular and prevalent in the music industry. The value of a direct artist-to-fan experience over a pop song made as a multi million dollar product/investment (click here for an example). And that's why I believe so many artists are seeing Kickstarter as being a great way to make a new album... So here I am!I am asking you as someone who wants to take a chance on me as a new name. I am a passionate Kickstarter Backer. Back in 2010, I backed a man who ran barefoot across the US for the homeless. More recently, I've pledged to help ""Mike Yung/Never Give Up"" who you can check out right now here on KS, Go Mike!!! I've backed a writer who submitted her new novel twice within a 4 month period and both times it failed. I'm sure she would have preferred have her project successfully funded the first time, but even though she didn't succeed, her determination is something I found admirable. I realize that you would be trusting me with your hard earned money if you pledge for this project, and that being given, I'll work as hard as I can on this project to earn your trust and make something really special for you to enjoy!This album will feature a rather eclectic use of instruments:-A Hauptwerk Organ-Superior Drummer 3-Acoustic Guitar-Mixcraft 8 Strings VST-SONiVOX Eighty Eight Ensemble (88-key VST)Here is some information about the tracks with some pictures mixed in (: :Little RaylenStyle: BalladMy wife and I have a son, Raylen, who was born two months premature, 4 lbs and 4 oz. He spent almost two months at the hospital, and so the lyric, ""Raylen, welcome home,"" is about his long awaited homecoming. It's the track on this album that is most nearest and dearest to my heart!Early MorningsStyle: ElectronicaThis one is semi-autobiographical in that I wake up super early for my job (Bus Driver). Usually a quarter to five, and how that is a sacrifice, but since I love my job, it's a situation where you look at it and see that roses have thorns, but the best way to look at it is that the thorns have roses.Bus DriversStyle: Pop/RockThis is a love song that uses jobs as a metaphor for being in a serious relationship. The chorus goes, ""Bus Drivers take people places, Firefighters fight blazes, but you do for me what no one can."" It's dedicated to my wife Vi, and is now available as a single on Itunes.I Love YouStyle: RockThis song was released on Valentine's Day this year on CD Baby. It is about how two people who love each other can grow apart, but that love can help them come together again.Vastness of SpaceStyle: Instrumental/AtmosphericThis song was released on my YouTube back in 2016 and I always wanted to make it with a better drum track because in that video I was literally playing drums with my fingers on my MIDI keyboard instead of the proper way with drumsticks and a metronome !What Do You Dream About?Style: Easy ListeningThis song is an attempt to connect with you. What is it you're passionate about and why is that so important to you? This song uses acoustic guitar and has a piano interlude in the middle.Symphony No. 1: Second MovementStyle: Instrumental/OrchestralThis piece is from my First Symphony I completed this January. It is in the style of Robert Schumann, so if you like his music, you very well will like this symphonic excerpt I wrote!Amor ImmortalemStyle: Orchestral/Pipe OrganThis piece uses a Hauptwerk Organ (arguably the next best thing to a real church organ) specifically, the UK Hereford Cathedral Organ. In the beginning you hear trumpets, towards the end, the very deep and low frequency sound of a 32nd pipe!Piano Improvisation No. 1Style: Instrumental/Solo PianoThis piece is a exploration of freestyle harmony. My influences for this piece are Debussy and Palmgren. The instrument you hear isSONiVOX Eighty Eight Ensemble. There will be a 2nd Piano Improvisation track as well!The next eight tracks are going to be a surprise, except if you pledged for backer updates, then you will get an exclusive look at the making of them!Cost Breakdown:$1,000 for Marketing (Facebook).$3,000 for Distribution, Mixing and Mastering (CD Baby Disc Manufacturing).Unless I somehow get a super outpouring of support, (double my goal) this means that I will receive nothing for profit. I'm totally fine with that, because this is my first album, and making it happen and gaining support from you is to me a lot more important than making big bucks. I think it's a big mistake to think of KS is a get-rich-quick scheme. You could share this page, or one step better, write a post on your social media account, Facebook, Instagram, Twitter, etc... telling your friends personally why you think it would be worth their support! Thanks in advance! And add the hashtag #rtsfe too, if you would! That's hashtag code for Riley Tucker Something For Everyone!","The risk and challenge of this project is that it will not get funded by the end time.  If there aren't enough monies raised by the deadline, your card will not get charged, and you will not receive your selected reward.  I will still do all that I can to get this album out to the public, it's just that it will take me longer saving my own money, working my day job, and a lot of the cool rewards that KS provides won't be available."

In order to show themselves more attractive, social, and confident they often apply effects and filters to photos and show off lives that don't match their real lives. People rarely share their failures, but they instantly post their exaggerated accomplishments. Not surprisingly, according to a study of the University of Michigan psychologists, many users who follow others’ lives on Facebook feel lonely, jealous, insecure, left out, and depressed.Pileyn is a social network that focuses on failures and difficulties in our lives. It will encourage users to share their sad moments, mistakes, and regrets which are an inevitable part of life. There will be no fancy photo effects or laughing reactions. On Pileyn people will notice the similarities in each other's lives and see that they are not the only ones who are going through difficult times. Seeing each other's real life will increase happiness while removing jealousy and depression that may result from following posts on  Facebook.Have you felt left out when you saw your friends sharing photos about their party while you were watching TV at home on a Saturday night? Have you asked yourself why you don't have a better job than those who brag about their fancy jobs and offices? Have you thought about why you don't have a car while seeing your Facebook friends showing off their brand-new sports cars? You are NOT ALONE. The majority of people live moderate lives. They just don't talk about them. On Pileyn users will be themselves again.Pileyn is an edited version of the word ""Plain"". It reflects the idea behind the project which is sharing your life in a plain and honest way.We are 2 developers ready to work on the project full time. We are aiming to release the first version in 2 months following the campaign end date. The first version will include core features such as adding friends, posting text/photos/videos, commenting, liking, and sharing. We will use our campaign budget for development and database tools, cloud hosting, help from a freelance designer, and initial marketing expenses.","Just like any other social networking website, the main challenge is building a community from scratch. Users may not be motivated enough to join the website since their friends are not using it yet. To overcome this challenge we are planning to offer perks to our first group of users. These perks will include sweepstakes for gift cards. Along with sweepstakes we will manually select and award users who make valuable contributions to the website. After a few months we are expecting users to love this website and invite their friends as it will make them happier than Facebook.Another challenge is maintaining and improving the website by financially supporting the team and infrastructure while continuing marketing. Even though we are not big fans of interrupting user experience by showing advertisements, we will have to go this route, especially in the first months of the website’s existence."

I imagine these prints can be hung by using magnets attached to a wall or magnetic surface.By supporting this project you will create a whole new set of possibilities for further designs to be produced to continue a series of prints including abstract photography and designs made from destroying / improving video recordings that I will continue with if this project could be a success.This is my first Kick starter project and I am using this as an experiment for myself to see if this is possible to be successfully funded which will allow me to create further digital fabric prints.,I want the prints to be of high quality - if there is any issue then I will have to deal with the problem to ensure the top quality result I am hoping for,https://www.kickstarter.com/projects/655695841/make-100-abstract-faces-mirror-drawings?ref=discovery_category_newest,655695841/make-100-abstract-faces-mirror-drawings,This is a very simple project idea. I would like to make 100 drawings using hand mixed multicolour paint sticks to draw onto acrylic mirror which is much more safe than glass mirror but just as shiny and could be framed etc. I always seem to draw in the same style doing abstract faces and faces are normally seen in reflection of ourselves in a mirror. So I'd like to make 100 of these for anyone to own. I'd love to spend more time making more of these drawings. I thought of this idea when I saw the make 100 project and thought it might be fun to try even if my Art style might not be for everyone. I'd love to spend more time making Art away from my outdoors job - its a mind freeing activity that I really enjoy. This is a kind of experiment and I have zero expectations on if anyone would actually like to own one of these original drawings on mirror. But here you go! I will even try draw anything you suggest in my own style using the multicoloured hand mixed paint sticks. I will get a selection of colours that will blend together in a swirl of colour and many abstract faces.,"I think my main risk would be careful packaging. I'd have to find some suitable packaging supplies and use a reliable postage courier to deliver to you. I have no idea if people will like my unique drawing style, its kind of messy, freestyle flow style, I don't preplan, I just begin moving my hand and my mind catches up in the moment kind of thing so it might not be for everyone stylistically but that's difficult to predict in all honesty. That's why I'm experimenting here."

https://www.kickstarter.com/projects/110497553/the-industrial-coastline?ref=discovery_category_newest,110497553/the-industrial-coastline,"Roger Tiley is known for his hard hitting documentary images, especially capturing industrial communities in the UK and USA. Since becoming a professional photographer in 1978, Tiley's work has mainly been shot on black and white film. But for this major commission, Roger decided to experiment with digital photography, using colour, and exploring extreme long exposure, introducing additional lighting using spot lamps.The industrial landscape and it's people have fascinated Tiley. But being a documentary photographer, exposure times are generally short to capture his subjects going about everyday life.Spending over a year to cover the area of the Welsh industrial coastline, Tiley found that there had been many changes of coastline use over the past century. Dirty industrial plants had moved or closed, so that the natural beauty could reclaim it's place in order to attract tourism. But evidence of the need for industry to be close to the sea still remained. Power stations, docklands and steel manufacture were still evident and relying on their close proximity to the sea to survive.With your help and support, we are hoping to make this body of work into a hard cover book, containing more than 80 images. There are a number of generous rewards on offer, some rewards including a DVD, covering the duration of Tiley's journey around the industrial coastline of Wales.","If successful, this will be he forth publication of Roger Tiley's work. He is a respected professional photographer who has published and exhibited internationally. This publication, if the funding goal is achieved, will be a professionally produced hardback publication which will sit well as a coffee table quality publication.",https://www.kickstarter.com/projects/110497553/picturing-the-industrial-south-wales-valleys-over?ref=discovery_category_newest,110497553/picturing-the-industrial-south-wales-valleys-over,"""Photography allows me to witness people's lives and see places I would never see.""I was born and have lived in the South Wales valleys all of my life. I come from a coal mining family. After studying for A levels, In 1987, I managed to obtain employment as an Apprentice Industrial Photographer for a large car components company. Although my real passion was documentary photography. Whilst studying under Magnum photographer, David Hurn, I began to photograph the people and places in the mining communities that I grew up in. I started in 1980, and it was the beginning of a photographic journey that has lasted more than four decades.I remember when I was a six year old child, hearing about a coal tip falling onto a school, just a few miles from where I lived. My Father went to help with the rescue.Gaynor is the same age as me. She was dragged out with two broken legs, from the coal slurry that engulfed the school. Her brother and sister were killed in the disaster. 116 children and 28 adults were killed on the 21 October 1966. I made a portrait of Gaynor 50 years on from the disaster. She is looking up at where the coal tip came tumbling down; the flattened a farm house, a large part of Pantglas Junior School and terraced houses,killing many in it's path. Miners from the nearby colliery came from underground to try and rescue their own children.When I began this project in 1980, there were over 30 NCB deep coal mines and numerous private drift mines in the South Wales coalfield. After the year long miners' strike of 1984/85, pits began to close on a unprecedented scale. Communities that depended on the pits for work were becoming ghost towns as unemployment increased. Working mens' halls, chapels and pubs were all facing closure. The heart of the community could no longer support them. Many traditions would change forever. Many valley folk still blame the 'Thatcher years' to this day, for the vandalism of hard working socialist communities.As collieries closed, more women found work in factories and offices in and around the valley communities. But factories would come and go. The club on a Saturday evening still attracts many through their doors. You could still light up a cigarette inside public places back in the 90s.During the time I spent photographing the police in the Rhondda, they were still busy with drink related incidents. We attended a 'blues and twos' call where a young lady had an argument with her partner. The police arrested him for carrying an offensive weapon in the street and threatening his girlfriend. I later took the photo to show the young lady. She was happy for it to be used, as it told the story of abuse towards women.Since the coal mines have disappeared, the undulating valley landscapes have changed beyond recognition. Job opportunities are rare and many travel to nearby towns and cities to find work. The culture of the hard working miner, factory and steel workers has been replaced with a cosmopolitan culture; people moving from outside of the valleys to live in the area. This however, doesn't change the fact that 'there will aways be a welcome in the south Wales valleys'.The bookThis body of work is extremely important to me and very close to my heart. This is why I want to share the photographs in a hard back limited edition high quality book with 200 photos. I've produced a number of books in the past and have always received positive feedback. This book covers a large part of my life and I'm very proud of the photographs.I recently had a book published through 2Ten Books called 'Last Days at Big K'. I was the only photographer to make a photographic document of the last deep coal mine in the UK - Kellingley Colliery in Yorkshire.I would really appreciate your support and there are lovely rewards on offer. There is no other publication covering the expanse of time over four decades of valley life. The photographs are all complete and will be placed into chapters, illustrating the four decades I've been making photographs in the valleys.Thank you for spending the time to read this.Roger","There are no risks. The photography for the book is all complete and 2Ten Books is a publisher growing with its reputation in producing high quality photographic titles. They will provide the graphic design and support to complete this title to the highest standard. If I'm successful  with funding, the book will be completed and delivered in early July of this year. Thank you."

The project image is a design template instead of this photo of the LCD because a photo simply can't capture the vibrancy of the LCD.The main differences are with the text, as there are limited fonts and sizes supported by this screen.The program also generates its own preview of course.We are not a hardware manufacturer and do not want to sell you hardware, so we can choose to support hardware that is of the best value to you. Currently we have developed on an Arduino Due and Due Compatible, and an Adafruit RA8875 display driver chip and asimilarRA8875display unit from alixpress. A complete package priced from as low as $40USD!Widgets are the buttons, display items and anything else that can be dragged and dropped onto an LCD layout.Basic Level WidgetsWhile there is not many, and they are not the prettiest widgets, there is very little you can't do with just the basics.  Advanced Level WidgetsBackers who receive beta level package can upgrade to these at a later date for $25 (approx 16USD).Advanced widgets are for when form is important, or when function is intricate.User WidgetsUsers with the advanced widgets unlocked can also add their own widgets, through an xml scripting system.If you can use the Arduino IDE, you can use this program. You don't need to know all about the C++ classes and structs and pointers this relies on. However, the generated code is well annotated and can be modified if you have very specific requirements which are not supported. And the program itself has many places to write C++ code which can be parsed and put into the generated files.The running GUI code requires just one function call, setup is another single function call.This software is designed to be very object oriented, and uses object abstraction with regards to hardware.The hardware configuration is very simple, your screen (or screen controller + screen) is wired to the microcontroller, which is then wired to anything else it needs to be, as per normal.The object oriented nature of the software structure means is the generated code will always use basic C++, and will run on any (the vast majority) microcontroller that supports this. All those Arduinos so popular with makers will work just fine. The generated class files are the main part of this system. The main microcontroller file initializes this in the standard fashion. It must also periodically call a display scan function to update and perform any display functions. Display functions like changing the menu, registering a button press; and even using the micro's digital I/O. This function call can also return an integer to represent data the microcontroller code should act on; these will generally be higher level functions as simple I/O can be more easily performed from within the generated class.On the other side the screen requires another library class to interpret the basic commands from the generated code. These commands are things like; draw a rounded rectangle here, draw this text, draw these lines, etc, and also touch commands if the screen supports it. Most screens cannot do this directly, but any of these methods can be simplified down as required, right down to a draw this pixel which makes up part of this bordered rounded rectangle. This down-simplification will always be the same for a specific screen, thus a static library class can be written to do it, and be completely transparent to the user. So, we expect to add more and more of these screen specific libraries as we add more and more display units over time.Each supported LCD will have instructions on what code to add to your sketch (only a few lines), common wiring configurations for the device, which is really all you need to get a GUI running.The following video shows the process of adding inputs and output through the screen using basic arduino functions. It's a bit longer than the Project Video but will give you a better idea how the software is used.Program interface may be subject to change over the course of this project.Faster Development!No wiring needed to add another button or led.More I/O!SPI capable displays can use fewer than 6 I/O pins.Potentially Lower Component Cost!With an LCD screen you have a flat rate cost of hardware, 1000 buttons cost the same as 1.Waterproof!No, not my demo one, but an LCD is suitable for waterproofing, flush mount the LCD within a waterproof enclosure then place a clear film across the LCD and enclosure. The touch functions will still work, and water will not be able to enter.It Just Looks Better!Using a touchscreen creates a modern and sophisticated look for the device.10kIn-built calibration function. Assign a button to this and a screen will pop up to click on a number of points, which then calculates the calibration data for the touchscreen. This can be saved to ROM if available, or recorded and written into the program.15kDial display widgets. Common dial types to make your project look really good, including needle and fill style dials.20k Picture object. An rgb image stored in program memory or on an SD card if available. Used as a background or in picture buttons.25kKeyboard. A pop up keyboard for text entry and text entry boxes.30k Open source. At the conclusion of this project's development it will be released as open source. This is expected to be in Q1 of 2016. Backers will still get earlier release versions at the specified times.35k Comprehensive open source documentation. Including xml scripting guides for both the creation of new widgets, and the addition of widget functionality. Support in a web forum with regular developer Q&A access.So what is all this money for?The funds raised will cover my time (both already spent, and still required) to make this into quality software. The stretch goals are where I stand to make a little profit, with the open source goal set where I feel is a decent value for the project; from which it can then grow into something even better with community involvement.","This is a very low risk project, because I already have a working prototype; and the cost of software distribution is very low.The only risks to going forward are the addition of extra functionality/stability, and the addition of more hardware support. These are low risk due to the modular way the software has been designed.Another risk I am mindful of is software piracy, and the steps required to prevent this; as it could detract from the user experience. Things like software activation delays, always/periodically online licensing checks. In this respect (and a few others) I consider the best project outcome to reach the open source stretch goal.",https://www.kickstarter.com/projects/475267705/urpc-an-arduino-based-pc-servo-and-light-controlle?ref=discovery_category_newest,475267705/urpc-an-arduino-based-pc-servo-and-light-controlle,"With urPC, your PC can be what you want it to be. Think of it as home automation for your PC, control the lights (RGB or Neopixel), heat (fans), and even doors (servos).Example showing active venting operation.Example showing smart LEDs used as a GPU braceBased on the Arduino Leonardo platform, these boards come out of the box with the connectors and drivers you need to read and control the following:Inputs:This is all in a package sized similarly to a 2.5in hard drive, and can be screwed into such a drive bay. Power is provided by a standard 4pin PC molex connector. Programming and communication by a USB micro connector.Board ConnectionsProgrammingAs this board is based around an Arduino Leonardo it can be programmined in all the same ways, I have generated libraries compatible with the arduino IDE and will make example programs as well.ConceptsHere are just a few ideas of what you could make with such a system:Parts CompatibilityThis system is compatible with the common 5V PWM type servo used in RC vehicles and simple robotics. The fan inputs and outputs must all be the 4pin PWM style versions. The LED outputs are the common RGB type as well as digital signals such as the neopixel range. Serial communication is done via the exposed RX and TX pins from the UART.Why Kickstarter?I'm using kickstarter as it is a hobby project which has grown to something others might find useful, so I'm willing to devote more time and 'polish' this hobby into a product. I have found it difficult to make time to do a fancy kickstarter video and sales polish, so after a few months of putting that off, I've figured I will just launch without that and hope those interested look to the detail instead!","The main risk in this project is supply chains, this is a very low risk as I have already identified multiple suppliers from different countries for each part.I have mitigated the technical risks by building a working version before starting this kickstarter."

Kunsthaus was an art house that started during the time of the Berlin Wall being in place and was located on the then East Berlin side. It was originally built as a department store back in the early 1900's. The Art House has since been shuttered and the artists moved on but the personal pictures of some of the vivid graffiti can tell a story that I think others will enjoy. Being a native of Berlin and living there during the wall era makes this project special and personal to me.The ArtMy personal journey led me there in 2004 to capture some photos that I knew I wanted to use for some type of project. I want to tell this story through the artistic medium that I work in. I am an artist that uses Lego® brand building bricks as my artistic expression and I want to tell this story by creating 5 large 30 x 45 inch Lego mosaic pieces of art that will become a gallery show which will also include a hardcover book highlighting the art, the process, the pictures and the history. The ProcessI have been creating art using Lego bricks for more than 10 years and have produced commissioned works for clients around the globe. I plan on selecting 5 images and converting them into the mosaics,. Each piece will be mounted on wood and ready to hang in a gallery.The End Result5 completed mosaics ready for gallery viewing to include no less than a total of 50,000 separate Lego pieces, a minimum of 50 books will be printed showing the art, the photo's, the process and the history.The MoneyThe money will go to purchasing materials to put each art piece together,mostly the new Lego bricks, the cost of printing and shipping the books, the art prints and for some labor/time spent on the project and any gallery show promotion literature.UpdatesSupporters will receive regular weekly updates as to how the project is progressing via email and facebook. Updates to include pictures, video,email,etc. Future PlansThe completed project will allow me to get ready for the initial Gallery showing near my home on Maui. The future plan is to take this gallery show to more cities in 2014. This will depend on the funding and how the show is received. I feel passionate about this art and will do my best to achieve the goal I have set. For every $1000 pledged above the goal, I will be able to take it to a new city (transportation, airfare, etc).Disclaimer: LEGO® brand logo is the property of the LEGO Group, which does not sponsor, own, or endorse this project.",As with any project being able to see ahead for any roadblocks or additional expenses or time delays is critical.  10 years of experience with hundreds of Mosaics created have allowed me to work out most challenges and risks.  If fully funded I will be able to complete the project with fidelity.My commissioned clients have been supportive of my work and the community embraced my art form.  With hard work and consistent dedication this project will come to being a reality.,https://www.kickstarter.com/projects/1172208028/the-library-mosaic-lego-project?ref=discovery_category_newest,1172208028/the-library-mosaic-lego-project,"My goal is to bring this program to 5 Public Libraries in Oregon and ultimately take it on the road around the US. If I reach my funding goal I can take this to 5 Libraries! Sometimes learning is so much fun that you don't even realize it! I have a passion for art and for helping others. Although I had been creating art using LEGO® bricks for over ten years it wasn't until last year that I decided to share my passion with students. I contacted the local public library, I was living in Hawaii at the time and they were thrilled and receptive to my idea.The idea was to create a collaborative project where learning takes place and students find a new way of approaching a problem. Our project goal was to create a map of the United States from Lego plates. I would do the final touches and mounting at a later time. The students learned about the States, mapping out ideas on paper first, conceptualizing the problem and just plain building fun.The Library could tie in book reading and learning about the United States as well. The program ran 3 consecutive Saturdays with about 20 kids participating each week for a total of over 60 kids and about 50 on the waiting list.","Production delays of the books could occur if the Library projects get delayed.  The goal is to conduct the programs in November and December leaving time to design, compile, print and ship by early January.  The feedback is exceptionally positive and more libraries are wanting programs that incorporate learning activities involving creative fun and Lego.LEGO® brand logo is the property of the LEGO Group, which does not sponsor, own, or endorse this project."

It takes lots of organization and preparation to complete a musical CD.Because i have done 2 projects in the past, i now have better and more efficient skills to complete this one. Many challenges come with the recording of a professional CD. Finances, musicians, recording studios, travel, marketing, Radio promotion and much more. I have planned it out very well and i have the support of my friends and family members. I am prepared to overcome any challenges that come my way. In music,  i am a current student at Berklee college of music. I am further enhancing my musical education at a professional level.Financially i have saved and budgeted for a big chunk of the project. But, i am still in need of some help to have it completed and thats why its delayed. I am confident and strong about my dreams and passion. Music has been my everything since the age of 14. I live by the principle that no dream is to big to achieve if you are motivated, inspired, prepared and firm in your desire to make it a reality. Nelson !"

To accompany the recordings will be commissioned illustrations, interactive features such as maps, history and extra information accompanied by videos featuring academic, informed comment and opinion. The launch will be to coincide with commemorative events in 2014 to mark the beginning of the war and it is hoped to link with museums and or galleries to stage a special event dedicated to this aspect of the conflict.It is also planned to build an e-book to accompany this as well.","The major challenge is a logistical one - gathering all the required elements and putting it all together. Filming and audio recordings will require extra personnel and travelling.All the personnel and facilities needed are in place, the main challenge is to accumulate the material and then assemble in the form of an iPad document, there is still plenty of time left to accommodate this so I don't foresee any risks or special challenges. If there are production delays it shouldn't impact on anything at this juncture as there is not a critical delivery date for the product.",https://www.kickstarter.com/projects/1408370197/owen-in-words-and-music?ref=discovery_category_newest,1408370197/owen-in-words-and-music,"This project is to be an accompaniment to the app (currently under development) that focuses on the war poetry of Wilfred Owen with all new audio recordings, illustrations and academic commentary.It will feature, initially, six readings which will have newly commissioned music that will weave in and around the words, so adding another dimension to the work. The intention is then to record this as an album and then take it out touring during the commemorative events to mark the beginning and subsequent prosecution of the First World War.All the readers are female, some of whom are either serving officers or wives of currently serving armed forces personnel with their own individual understanding of the words relative to contemporary war scenarios. This has resulted in another dimension already added to the poems - music will complete that factor immeasurably.The funds are required to pay for two composers to create the initial concept, subsequent recording using 5 musicians and then for some initial performances in the UK. It is hoped to be able to then take this ensemble to Lille, France in October 2014 for a conference based upon Wilfred Owen and his work.",There are no risks associated with this project - the challenges will be to reach as large an audience as possible both in the UK and on the Continent but with the encouragement I have already received from leading individuals and organisations that just requires commitment and hard work!

Sounds are around us everyday. If you happen to be deaf or have a difficult time hearing you can only imagine the sounds around you. When there are loud noises or bass vibrations the people can feel it. It would be nice too also feel the softer sounds.This Vibrating Hearing device can sense sounds and covert them into vibrational patterns across an array of vibrating motors. They are the same vibrators used in cellular telephone. For this device several of them are used to create a vibration felt against the sides of your body. Words or music can be recognized by the vibration pattern. The louder the sound the more intense the vibration.You can just wear this device under your shirt. It wraps around your body and stays in place. Its as easy to wear as putting on a t-shirt in the morning.Think of it as an earphone headset that uses your body surface as your ears for listening.,A challenge is when too many sounds enter the microphone at the same time it will not be able to distinguish which sound is which. The device might just vibrate all the time. When the vibrator motors gets wet from sweating it might stop working.The processing speed might cause a delayed reaction to the actual sound.Making the size fit right for each person.,https://www.kickstarter.com/projects/1271380674/sliding-door-tiltlock-safety-bar?ref=discovery_category_newest,1271380674/sliding-door-tiltlock-safety-bar,I need the funding to buy at programmable CNC router machine. The machine will be used to make fancy wood brackets and the TiltLock bar. An all wood version would match better with the interior of most homes. The machine could be setup to make 100's of units to reduce the cost and improve the quality.The bracket is made with different hole positions to fit a variety of sliding door sizes. By request I could also make a custom sized TiltLock.,The main risk is you could lock yourself out. The door can only be unlocked from the inside. It is possible to make the door open wide enough to let the cat or dog out. You will have to be careful to not let the intruder in if the gap is too wide. I could make an additional locking clasp  that requires two hands to unlock.

Personalised Christmas Sacks made of environmentally friendly, Hessian or in other words jute matrrial. I got the idea after working in this field for some time, I recognised a niche and decided to create my own designs satisfying the desire of a wider public such as, Children, The Nativity, a man's best friend, yes your dog :-) and anyone else who participates in this festive season.Just to explain, these sacks are personalised with your selrcted name (s) fonts and colours. You use these sacks to store your gifts and will thrn be placed under your Christmss tree. It is my intention to expand this business by also personalising gifts for valentine, birthday, wedding, anniversary and newbirth. I have now registered my domain names: fourseasonspersonalisedgifts.co.uk (.com) and Secured my work location. My six (6) designs are being patented & packaging are also being designed. Iam putting my all into this project, I realkt want everything to stand out from the rest and so far I believe I have managed to accomplish that. Please free to reach out to me if you have any enquiries regarding my project, I would be more than happy to answer them.Personalising items is a rapidly growing trend. Nothing beats the feelings of ""your"" name printed on to ""your gift,"" giving you the feelings that someone went out of their way to have this done for ""you.""On a personal note, this would benefit me a great deal knowing that I started out by scribbling on my notepad has indeed become a realityand is no longer a figment of my imagination or a dream but a dream come true.

I have worked hard to get it to where it is today but stop short of completion because of lack of funds. I have created some unique and fabulous designs for the enhancement of these sacks.

I want to bring these images to life on these sacks for your pleasure and satisfaction. Years ago I was a property developer. While this career allows the creative side of me to shine through (where interior decorating is concern) I never had the opportunity to bring out the artistic side of me. I have design ideas from pouches to backpack but I have to start here first and I need your support. Only you can help me to make this happen, Every pledge brings me a step closer to the manifestation of this project.For the completion of this project, I need to purchase 2 heat presses, Jute Sacks to be printed (minimum quantity 1000), Software, printing Labels, Label Printer and packaging.

In an effort to get flavors that are only available in very expensive spirits, I started to research how aged spirits traditionally get their distinctive flavors and aromas and see if there was a way to replicate the process at home. I have been able to do a lot of field research due to the growth of the craft distilling industry and find out how spirits are made, how they are aged, and what can affect the color and flavor.After making gifts of certain aging projects to friends and later experts, I started to make improvements in the way that I was able to change and improve the flavor of relatively inexpensive liquor. Remember, this kit does not supply any liquor or alcoholic spirits. All rewards do not contain any alcoholic spirits. This kit contains items and equipment which will allow the home user to flavor their own spirits.There are certain things which are only available in large quantities such as the type of oak used in aging and flavoring and the minimum shipment cost is quite expensive for one person.

Right now the shipping on single items to manufacture a kit can cost just as much as the items themselves.I hope that if the project does well, I will be able to start buying items in quantity directly from larger warehouses and be able to start producing kits more economically and for a lower price.I also hope to include other items in the future which will allow the home user to infuse the same kind of flavors that large scale manufacturers are able to produce in their most expensive offerings.",https://www.kickstarter.com/projects/1587416612/barrel-char-in-a-jar-spirits-kit-commercial-expans?ref=discovery_category_newest,1587416612/barrel-char-in-a-jar-spirits-kit-commercial-expans,"As a part of my cooking and baking, I typically use alcoholic spirits.

If there is money left over, I will use it to purchase a vacuum sealing machine. I hope to provide flavors of wood that are not available typically in most barrel aging kits. Sugar maple and cherry are already available, but I am hoping that with a vacuum sealing machine, I will be able to provide sherry and port infused oak so that the home user will be able to produce the same flavors only available in the most expensive store bought products. ","The market is saturated with a lot of DIY aging kits, most of which focus on purchasing a barrel. A barrel has limits as it will always transfer flavor from one batch to another. The other problem with barrels is that after 3 batches or so, there is very little flavor left. My kit is priced competitively for the home user and allows for re-using the kit with inexpensive consumables. Even without a second use of consumables, the kit is designed to flavor and age the same amount, if not more than a typical 2 liter oak barrel."

Pierre - $2,000· USACE approved outdoor paint - $900· Brushes - $250· Ladders - $250· Safety vest - $100· Graffiti-proof top coat sealant - $500Total - $4,000","Risks and challengesThe biggest risks New Orleans International Muralists will be timing the mural paint days when all the artist can attend and have them done over a two week but no longer than six months period. We know that most of our artists have other contracts that allow them to make a living from their art. Therefore, we have to plan very intelligently around everyone's schedule(s). Our other risk, is asking for what some may believe is a large amount of money. When it's really only a small portion of what this project REALLY needs to be a city-wide success. Our larger budget is between $65,000 per block and upwards of $450,000 to financially work for everyone involved over a 2-year time frame. Therefore, we are sourcing money from other corporate sponsors and grant providers."

My goal is to become an international artist and to get as much visibility as possible.Having opened my art gallery where I live, on the Magdelen Islands, this summer has been very exciting. It does come with many challenges and is a lot of work.Living on such isolated islands means that every time I want to participate in art shows, I need to consider not only the costs of renting the space for the show (which usually cost a few thousand dollars) but also the cost of travelling with my art. There are three of these that I am planning to take part in during the next year which are in Montreal. I would also like to take part in a show in the US or a different country at some point during the year.Also, having my own gallery is great for tourist season but in order to actually get people to visit I need to get my name out there. I need to be able to invest a good amount of money into marketing and advertising to reach as many people as possible.Lastly, there are the costs of running and exploitation of my gallery. I am in big need of restocking in art supplies. I am currently destroying some of my older works in order to reuse the frames to create new artworks. This makes me extremely sad but I am doing what I need todo in order to be able to keep creating.In conclusion, this dream of mine may seem big and out of reach for many. I, however, believe it is my reason for being in the world and I know that I will make it happen because I will never stop pushing forward and creating. All I need is some help in order to get the visibility that is so important in order for me to get to a level where I can truly live off of my talent and passion.Thank you so much for reading my story. Words can't express how much dream and all your help this means to me.","The main challenge associated to my project are the possibility of spending a lot of money to travel and rent areas in shows that might not bring as much return as I hoped. That being said, even shows where I sell absolutely nothing are not a complete loss because they have allowed me to be viewed by a wide audience and often times this brings orders on a later date.",https://www.kickstarter.com/projects/valerielbartist/painting-the-world?ref=discovery_category_newest,valerielbartist/painting-the-world,"I live on tiny isolated islands quite far from main land called the Magdalen Islands. After recently going through some very hard experiences and life changes, I have decided to follow my biggest dreams TODAY before it's too late.  I want to go explore the world on a backpacking trip alone to be inspired while hopefully inspiring others to follow their dreams as well.A few years ago, I was diagnosed with a very rare incurable brain tumor along my carotid artery and surrounded by many major nerves which would eventually take my life. Months later, after many many MRIs, scans and sleepless nights I was prepped for a major brain surgery. By some miracle, radiologists had a disagreement literally a few hours before my brain was to be cut open. They called for an emergency delay to do yet again more tests. This led to sending me home for several more months of waiting in fear. A biopsy is impossible and therefore a clear diagnosis is impossible. Years and many more tests later, they still have no idea what is for sure and it is still there but it has not grown at all, indicating that it is not cancerThis crazy, scary and unbelievable experience has changed my whole perspective on life. This, in turn, affected my priorities and how i experience life everyday. I started to want to make my dreams a reality; my art career was not going to be something I hoped for anymore, I was going to make it happen, period. I have since then been investing everything in me towards my art; getting my art gallery, expensive travels outside my islands to take part in art shows, working sometimes 4 jobs at a time to pay for expenses for my art gallery, marketing and supplies... That goes without mentioning the many many hours of creating almost daily with all of my heart and soul. Lets face it... being an artist is HARD.Another big hurdle...A year ago, another big obstacle crossed my path. I separated from a toxic 13 year relationship. A relationship in which I had been emotionally abused. It was only after the relationship painfully ended that I realized that my whole world had been a mountain of lies and deceit to which I had been blind. It was like having been in a cult and waking up 13 years later to realize that everything I had believed in my whole adult life was a lie; that someone had been playing around in my brain. I, still today, sometimes have some backlash caused by ptsd. This realization or the ""waking-up"" phase, as I like to call it, was by far the most painful experience I have ever lived through. On top of that, I was ending up all alone with a mountain of dept all left under my name and crazy responsibilities. I was about to lose my house, my art gallery, have to send my father who lives under my art gallery to live elsewhere... On top of the horrible pain, I was losing everything I had, my whole world was caving in and I really thought my life was over.I had to work so hard to not lose everything. I had another apartment built in my basement for extra income. I sometimes had to work 4 jobs to barely make it. It's still quite the struggle.But what then? After that blows over, what comes next? What's left?Valérie, her health and what Valérie wants. And not just any Valérie... a much, much STRONGER Valérie; stronger than I could have ever imagined being. AND a much more COURAGEOUS Valérie. Also lets not forget.... a FREE Valérie!My story is a happy story not a sad one. All the scares and pain didn't happen to break me or leave me wounded. They happened to make me the strong, courageous, daring woman I am today. They happened to push me in the right direction. They happened so that I would have what it takes to make my wildest dreams come true. They happened so that I could share my story to help those who are maybe dealing with similar hardships at the moment; telling them to hang on a little longer, to keep fighting a little bit more because there is something more beautiful than they could ever imagine just around the corner. They also hopefully happened so that my story could inspire others to go for what they want no matter how scary or impossible it seems.Am I scared at the thought of travelling the world alone? Of course I am. Am I afraid to run out of money? Yes. Am I growing more and more nervous daily as I see my departure date coming closer because I'm might not be ready? Absolutely. Does my mind try to convince me that I'm not strong enough, that I don't have what it takes? Everyday. I will do this no matter what it takes. I know it won't always run perfectly, I know before going in that this adventure will have all sorts of ups and downs, that's part of the beauty of it.I surely don't plan on making this trip a luxury vacation. I plan on staying in workaways, couch surfing and hostles, I even bought a hammock just in case. I plan on travelling by bus and train when possible and on keeping everything as simple as possible. However, the air fair can be quite expensive, especially when crossing oceans. Doing 5 continents in 5 months is going to be an incredibly enriching experience but also very costly. I am therefore hoping to raise at least 3000$ for my travels.In addition, because the whole point of my adventure is to create art along the way, I will be needing a good amount of art supplies. As I create more and more artworks, I will need to ship them back to Canada to avoid having to carry them around along with my backpack and art supplies. I estimate that 1000$ should be good to cover both the supplies and the shipping of my artworks.For these reasons, I am hoping to raise 5000$ for this ambitious project and dream come true. By embarking with me in this adventure and encouraging me, you won't only be contributing to sharing my story and inspiring people all around the world, you also will be receiving a piece of my creation and inspiration. I will be landing in Panama on Dec 31st, I plan to be there for about 10 days. I will then be travelling to Costa Rica by bus and train and should be there for 2 to 3 weeks. If all goes as planned I will next be visiting new Zealand and Australia. From there I plan to fly to Malaysia and travel by train and bus to Thailand, Cambodia and Vietnam. Next, off to Barcelona and Portugal before ending my trip in Morocco.Now, of course, this is all up in the air. The only ticket I have booked is a one-way ticket to Panama. I want to give myself the freedom to change plans as I go and as my inspirations call on me!If this kickstarter fails, I'll survive like I have everything else! ;) I guess I will be quite disappointed because it will most likely mean that I will not be able to visit 5 continents and complete this adventure. I will probably be forced to cut my trip short and come home with much less experiences to share and less inspiration than I hoped.Throughout my travels, I don't only plan to create art; I also will be creating a travel vlog where I plan to share my discoveries and my ups and downs as I go from country to country. I will be sharing many art videos as I create along the way as well! Subscribe to my YouTube channel to follow me in all this excitement!Subscribe to my channel by clicking the link below:https://www.youtube.com/channel/UC5p9C1jgZvLBBRhkkNkFKQAAfter all the ""no's"", the tiring art shows with no positive results and summers spent alone with no visitors coming to my little, not yet known art gallery, after almost everyone around me telling me that maybe slowing down a little would be a good idea, after impossible amounts of tears and ups and downs... I still keep believing in myself, my talent, my dream and I have never stopped pushing. I cherish every single sale and embrace every little victory. There is simply nothing else that I want more than this from life, nothing that makes me feel so good, nothing I am more passionate about. The chance to travel the world and to make this crazy dream, that I felt almost impossible, come to life is the most exciting thing (although quite scary) I have ever done and I truly hope that my story will inspire and that my art will touch other people's hearts. ","Of course, travelling the world alone will come with many obstacles and challenges along the way. Many of these are impossible for me to prepare for. However, I have been doing my research and learning about how to avoid many dangerous situations. I think that being a person who easily adapts to many situations and being open-minded and positive will all be great assets for me as I travel.Health wise, I have gotten all the necessary vaccines and I will be carrying basic medications and a first-aid kit just in case. Hopefully, I won't need them too often.Backpacking is one thing, but backpacking as an artist is much more complicated. I need an extra bag with wheels to carry my art supplies which can be quite heavy. I have worked out a system and tested it during my 1 month trip in Cape Hatteras. I think this will work out well for me and will most likely get more and more fine tuned along the way.Finally, shipping my artworks to myself is a little complicated. I will therefore be stretching and unstretching every artwork as I go. I will then be shipping them back to my home in Canada. I understand that in some countries this won't be easy and could end up being quite costly."

Is it stories we hear in the news? Is it how they are portrayed in movies or is it an all around misunderstanding of a wonderful breed? Anyone who has ever owned or been around a Pit Bull, they’ll tell you, it’s because of a misunderstanding.The goal of this project is to change that. Let’s change how Pit Bulls are pictured. They’re not this horrible breed that no one wants.Pit Bull is actually a classification, not a breed. Breeds that fall under Pit Bull are American Pit Bull Terrier, American Staffordshire Terrier, American Bully, and Staffordshire Bull Terrier, The American Bulldog and the Bull Terrier (standard and miniature) are also sometimes included.In order to change how Pit Bulls are pictured, we literally need to do just that. We need to show off their loving, adorable and beautiful personalities.As a Pet Photographer, I can make that happen, but I need your help. AGoldPhoto takes unique pet portraits that highlight the personality of the pet, in ways most people have never seen.You can help by contributing to this project, sharing it with friends and family and show off the book once it's published.Showing off how wonderful Pit Bulls are, will intern change the mindset of those who picture them in a negative light and increase their adoption rate from shelters and rescues.This book will be self-published and the money raised will go to printing, shipping and the time it takes to photograph the dogs.","The risks involved with this project is getting behind schedule.

Below is a timeline of events that lead to the creation of this photo book.December 2013: I started working for the Humane Society of Broward. I was hired to run the social media and website.Once the website project was complete, I was asked to take over the photography program. At the time, I didn't know anything about photography, let alone taking photos of pets.Over the next 8 months, I trained myself by watching YouTube videos and tutorials online. I also trained volunteers to help with the photography since the volume of animals surrendered was too high for one person to manage on their own. I spent 4-5 hours a day, either taking photos of shelter pets, or training volunteers how to do it.December, 2015:I left the shelter and moved back to Tampa where I went college at the University of South Florida. I took a corporate job, but it didn't take long for me to miss working with animals on a daily basis.April, 2016: I started volunteering at the Humane Society of Tampa Bay on the weekend taking adoption photos. In July of that same year, they asked me to host a Pet Photo Shoot Fundraiser.August, 2016: I launched the Pit Bull Picture Project. The goal of the project is to show the goofy and lovable side of pit bulls to inspire more adoptions. The project has been featured by Huff Post, People Magazine, Southern Living, ABC News and many local news stations.May, 2017: I quit my corporate job to take on pet photography full time.January, 2018: I have hosted over 70 Pet Photo Shoot Fundraisers all over the country and have raised over $55,000 for more than 35 different animal shelters and charities.February, 2018: Launch Kickstarter to fund the Furry Faces of Gold, a collection of pet photos that will help raise awareness of pet adoption. 10% of net proceeds will be donated to various animal charities.Here are some sample photos that you can expect to be in the collection",Kickstarter will only release the funds if this project is at least 100% funded. Please share this campaign with anyone and everyone you know. This collection will make a great gift. Furry Faces of Gold is being self published.

What I am trying to complete is my Independent Artist project. I am not with a label so I am trying to back myself with copyright,  registration,  lawyers, digital distribution and my own personal marketer. I write for other artist as well so I have so much music to get put there. This would be the start of myself as an artist and a label. I will be calling the label Still Real because the music that comes from me will be very real with substance. I have over 50 written songs typed up and even more in my head ready to be written.  The ones already written are ready to be recorded.  In the music industry you pretty much have to go hard or go home and when it comes to the beats and producing and the visuals and graphics I want to be recognized for quality work. I just you all support.  The adversity I face day to day is what makes you guys so important to me. I'm currently struggling to work through depression as I keep up with daily task and raising my son. My family really isn't the richest, financially me and my mom are on the same level which says alot. I really just need my music to work out for me as well as my family We truly need a change and I know there is nothing else in this world I'd rather do so I want to put my all into it. To validate what I'm saying you can Google my name ; Shalisa Mitchell. Find me on YouTube,  Casting360,  Explore Talent, Facebook,  Instagram, Twitter, Reverberation,  Soundcloud. I really am trying. Thanks for listening. And Lord willing we will raise this Money! !","Th risk and challenges that I have dealt with so far has been putting my music out there unprotected. i take risk of my music being stolen and used by another artist.

https://www.kickstarter.com/projects/244148559/mq-27-dragonfire-drone?ref=discovery_category_newest,244148559/mq-27-dragonfire-drone,"Several months before the release of the video game ""call of duty: black ops 2"" Youtube creator FPSRussia released a video featuring a ""prototype quadrotor"" Me being Both a robotics and Radio control enthusiast was fascinated and in fact fully tricked by this video. Not knowing it was a plug for an upcoming video game I made a concerted effort to share this amazing new ""development"". Even after watching the same video dozens of times with friends I was still fooled. Until that fateful day. Sam-witched between what I believe was a sanitary pad commercial and an add for a (great?) lawyer , was a 30 second cut of a new game to be released. To my horror I got to watch the ""amazing new tech"" I was blabbering about to all my friends get shot down...quite literally in crisp, ps3 graphics. Great. So while jamming approximately 3/4 of my right foot directly in my mouth, I had time to reflect. Rather than accept da-feet, I could use da-hands, to create.   I quickly realized the mountain I was about to climb. using skills I learned working on a break press in a sheet metal shop, and after pouring over the same video, and hundreds of pictures I drew up blu-prints. It took the person I had contracted to cut my frame almost 6 months to finally get the parts to me for my frame while at the very last minute critically messing up the arms. I had my frame but my incredibly important and somewhat complex arms were not working out at all. I knew then i was on my own. So over the last two years I have been building up the tools I need and doing work intermittently. Relying on holiday gift money and the occasional splurge to fund a part I needed to continue building it without help. There were times I thought I wouldn't ever finish it. I was building on a timeline of years..not weeks or months, electronics are expensive haha! There were even some people who thought it would never fly. To my great relief and excitement it flew for the first time for approximately 2 minutes Feb 5th 2015. Success! Now for Phase 2. Mark 1 is finished-ish.Apparently it took COD 27 of them to finally perfect theirs. It seems like I am on the right track. Next step is 3D fpv vision and a mission based rail system on the bottom. One of the first things everyone asks me is if im going to put a gun on it. Besides that being an incredibly bad idea, its extremely illegal. I mulled it over and went through my alternatives. I can make a mock one for regular flight or put an air-soft with a servo. Neither of these I found would give me the effect i was really looking for. So much of my design has been based around the idea that my quad was going to be a functional workhorse. be able to carry a relatively large payload. I thought hard about what people would actually need and expand-ability. I finally decided that an independent fpv paintball turret will be my happy medium. I really wanted to bring my friends and family into this but am unwilling to allow anyone else to fly. Using a paintball gun (in a safe area of course) maximizes visibility to see if you have hit your target and adds a certain level of awesome. Easily removable, and replaced with the next attachment. May it be a small air crane, or even a ground based robot. my design incorporates and addapts as per the ""Mission""","My next challenge is to lose some weight. She looks great in the air but to get everything as rigid as I did I needed to use allot of aluminum, rivets and sleep. It seems that iv hit a wall in my design process and the time has come that I need a key tool. Part of the money goes directly to a 3d printer. I have complex brackets that will be either too hard to  machine myself or to expensive to have done. These will be critical in the next phase. My biggest challenge will be learning how to use the tool effectively. thankfully there is a plethora of information and collaboration for me to tap into. At this point Im more afraid that somone else with more monies than me will come out with a finished better one than me. It took over two years from conception to maiden flight of a prototype. Not to mention more than $3000 invested. I want to get this done and share it with the world.",https://www.kickstarter.com/projects/244148559/pok-egg-o-usb-power-packs?ref=discovery_category_newest,244148559/pok-egg-o-usb-power-packs,These started as a fun little project for me and my friends but it soon grew in popularity. This pushed me to try and share them with the world. I hope you like them as much as I do! First step to getting them built will to source the batteries themselves then its gravy from there. I have the tooling to make the moulds myself so its just a matter of getting the resins and colors just right.,I am a bit worried i might not be charging enough for them and may be over budget if I can not find a good source for batteries/charging circuits. With a bit of help I'm sure i can overcome this issue. If it blows up and much more than 100 people want them we may have delays. This is also something I am preparing for.

My goal is to have a mobile kitchen fully functional and rollingby July2016. Thefirst step is securing aworkhorsetruck. Because these trucks sell fast, I amreaching out toKickstarter backersin order toraisemoney to buythe truck. The wrapping and build of the truck will be financed by the bank.Asowner/operator, I am working hard to make this vision of bringing a hot,homestyle breakfast to the Nashville community a reality. After extensive research and interviews with other food truck businesses, detailed business planning, personal counsel from SCORE and self-employed friends, andhaving a commitment from the US Bank for financing the final customizations, I am prepared to begin this service. I come from a family of hardworkers that love to cook. So it is timeto put the talents that were passed down to work.The main product is breakfast with menu items such as pork sausage, turkey sausage, pork bacon, smoked ham, salmon cakes, fresh cut breakfast potatoes,local farm raisedeggs, homemade biscuits, assorted French toast and more. There will alsobe specials and featured items to fit all occasions. If McDonalds felt the need toprovide breakfast all day, then I have confirmation that there is a demand. I have the supply!","With every business, there will be challenges.  Potential obstacles that may arise during the construction of the truck, would be delayed delivery of parts.

In his first comedy for the stage, the popular actor and screenwriter plays fast and loose with fact, fame and fortune as these two geniuses muse on the century's achievements and prospects as well as other fanciful topics with infectious dizziness. The final surprise patron to join the merriment at the Lapin Agile is a charismatic dark haired singer time warped in from a later era.

He had his first taste of a non-traditional stage in 1998 when he traveled with his college performance of Samuel Beckett’s Endgame to the Regional College Theatre Festival.  While there, he placed as an Irene Ryan Nominee for his portrayal of Clov.  His producer/directorial debut was with a stage adaptation of Trey Parker’s (South Park co-creator) Cannibal: The Musical.  Bill followed that up with the hard-hitting Zoo Story by Edward Albee.  His last production was The Lion in Winter by James Goldman in 2012.

I am very excited to show this to the world and can't wait to see what new opportunities open up for it.The idea for Mooga came somewhat out of the blue. I was brainstorming potential business ideas that would impact my community and could easily expand into others. I needed to come up with something that would be fun, new, and far-reaching. That's when a random thought hit me, I hadn't been to a party in a while! These two seemingly unrelated concepts suddenly begged the question:Is it possible to industrialize parties?Industrialize may be too negative and inaccurate of a connotation, so I'll use the made up word Mooga! Is it possible to ""Mooga"" parties? As in, can we make parties accessible, affordable, and widespread? Just as Uber revolutionized transportation and food delivery, can we do the same with parties and events? I believe we can with Mooga!My vision for Mooga is this:To make an all-in-one platform for finding fun, local, and safe parties that are sponsored by Mooga. As time goes by, I envision the platform being available and used in multiple cities across the US.What is currently in development?I have already set up a simple but fully-functional website for the Mooga platform (www.partymooga.com). Furthermore, an app version of the website will be submitted to the app store soon (by Jun 1st, 2020) for review. Depending on Apple's response, the app may need to be tweaked and could hit the AppStore sometime after it hits the Google Play store.Plans for the first launch party in my home state of Florida are already in the works. Currently the optimistic time-frame (due to the pandemic) for when it will be is sometime around September 2020. The first launch party is aimed at being a triple-feature concert of local artists with refreshments and other amenities (DISCLAIMER: Please do not purchase tickets for this party on the website yet. The party listed on the website is just a filler).How will the ultimate goal for Mooga work?Parties will be hosted by local, licensed Mooga hosts that will oversee everything specific to each event. From there, a proper chain of command will be established so that no Mooga party is outside of our standards (fun and safety-wise). Of course, all of these ideas are simply future plans for now. Currently (as stated before) Mooga will operate in only three cities so that the platform can establish itself and adjust to any changes quickly.The reason I need Kickstarter funds to further this project is simple, more resources available will enable this project to get off the ground sooner, quicker, and more effectively. Funds will be used to make any necessary improvements on our website and app, distribute our platform across the initial three cities (""distribute"" meaning: Attaining hosts, buying necessary party hosting equipment, and having investment capital to host parties) and to purchase the necessary equipment and features for our launch party in Florida.Furthermore, Kickstarter has a wide user-base and unique website functionalities which are convenient for spreading the word about this project, attaining funds, and rewarding backers.Simply put, all I can offer is my passion, dedication, knowledge, and effort for this project. I know it might seem daunting for a young college student but I am confident in my ability to see this through. Besides, I'm in the very market I'm targeting! College students go to parties all the time (some more often than the library), and I think having a student himself lead this project makes total sense.I have experience designing websites and apps, attending parties, and networking with local members of my community. I also consider myself to be amicable and approachable, which should make for a good host! With these qualifications, I am positive Mooga will successfully launch.You've reached the end of my description but don't despair, you'll be able to find live updates of the current status of the project right here on Kickstarter! From there I will keep you informed of all stages of Mooga's development. You can also checkout the website and app (once it launches) in the meantime to get a feel of their functionalities!I sincerely hope you enjoyed listening to my vision and that you consider donating. Thank you for your time!","There aren't any risks and challenges in this project that can't be overcome. One risk is that the Apple AppStore declines the app for not being ""functional"" enough. This is always a gamble when submitting an app to Apple, but should anything happen, the app will be revised and corrected. Simply put, there may only be a delay between the app launching on the Google Play store and the AppStore.Another challenge of this project is getting a good rhythm for hosting local parties. The first party (which is local to me in Florida and is poised to happen in September 2020) will require me to network with local artists and community members to gain the traction necessary to attract an audience. This is more than possible however, it is simply going to take some time (which is partly why the party will take place later on this year).One last challenge that I can foresee is finding exceptional hosts in other cities. Although I have many contacts outside of Florida, it is always a little difficult to network outside of your local environment. This however, should turn out to be a relatively simple task and I do not see it impeding the growth of this project!"

We've been plugging along, writing and recording since.We decided we needed a whole new mythology for our band and came up with the concept that we were all immigrants from the fictional land of Korvenstania, a country formed as a repository for all the biggest jackassesin the Roman Empire.Our songs are not based on this, but the web show we do and the book we released are. What we really are is a group of musicians that life sidetracked. Now, due to various new paths, we have found each other and a chance to kick ass again.Unfortunately, the path that opened up to us was due to the singer contracting Multiple Sclerosis and not being able to work anymore, and the guitarist, a veteran marine, who developeda degenerative arthritis in his back, after his service. This prevents the band from playing out, so we are pushing it along other avenues.These other avenues and funding for the completion of them is why we are thanking you for the time you have taken to stop here, and a huge nod and horns up for your contribution!","Well, since the biggest risk was the disabilities of two of the band members, which has already been overcome, I'd say other risks are minimal.Most of the work is already done, we just need a little help finishing up everything.But worse comes to worst we do have alternates in place to take over for anyone that goes down."

He was born in Colne, East Lancashire in 1955 and still lives in the area with his wife and four children. Looking at the quality of Steven’s work today, it is hard to believe that he showed no talent for art as a schoolboy. He only began to paint when he was 27, during a period of redundancy and illness. He felt the urge to copy a picture of a Kingfisher and, to his surprise; he found he could do it with ease.

A long time admirer of Big Game, particularly the big cats, he has produced a stunning series of pictures including tigers, cheetahs, lions, leopards and most recently a captivating study of a puma cub, Curiosity, who’s prints were sold out long before the painting was complete. This has been followed by two portraits of wolves and an arresting image of a Polar Bear with her cubs in snow called Warmth of Nature.Steven’s other great love is birds. The hyper realistic nature of his paintings has also made him one of the countries most collectable painters of British Birds. Not satisfied with this he has added land and seascapes to his portfolio.

https://www.kickstarter.com/projects/denvizion/friend-funding-a-firestarter-before-kickstarter-yo?ref=discovery_category_newest,denvizion/friend-funding-a-firestarter-before-kickstarter-yo,"Is Friend-Funding a necessary first step to Crowdfunding? Crowdfunding has changed the world of finance. It has greatly expanded the horizons of individuals who want to develop creative projects and start entrepreneurial ventures. Still, existing crowdfunding platforms, while being great avenues of empowerment, often work under rules that are too strict and which ultimately lead many crowdfunding project authors to fail in their campaigns, or to shy away from getting started in the first place. We believe it is time to create a ""before crowdfunding platform"" – that people can use while taking their first crowdfunding steps.We noticed 3 interesting things    A lot of startups get their first funding from friends and family Friend and family fund half of all “self-financed entrepreneurs”Getting funded by friends and family is expected to be used before using crowdfunding. Indeed, many investors invest in people before they invest in ideas or products. Since they don’t know you, their first integrity check on you as a person is whether your friends and family believe in you strongly enough to give you seed money for your new idea. If they won’t do it, they ask, why would strangers invest in you?That’s why we decided to create Friend Funding, where the chances of feeling shy or failing to crowdfund a project are very low. Through Friend Funding, we will help you in a funny, smart and witty way to fund your projects, starting with your circle of friends and family. Friend Funding think of crowdfunding Campaign as a ""© digital piggy bank"", that your friends and family can contribute in a funnier and smoother experience. The premise is simple. You reach out to your friends and family, and instead of just asking for a contribution, you ask for a contribution in a fun way, a way that makes the whole seem like a game.We will also offer your friends and your project’s fans badges whenever they contribute, while also offering you points as they support your project.Every month the top 3 most popular projects which have the most points will receive the Crowdfunding Package (Website creation, logo, advertising for a month, contibution to your Crowdfunding Campaign up to 1500€ and much more...).Featuring both a free and an affordable premium subscription for getting funding, crowdfunding project authors will find on our Friend Funding website a crowdfunding avenue that they can easily pursue and that they can successfully use, by understanding its simple rules and letting its structure work for them. Plus, Friend Funding’s premium subscription  offers a wealth of features that greatly enhance your chances of getting the funding that you need. It includes support from mentors, premium advice, social advertising, design support, brand name support, pitch validation and much more.So this is it! With Friend Funding, you’ll no longer need to feel pressured by all-or-nothing campaigns, or by a crowd of potential backers who knows nothing about you, and whose attention is being fought for by endless crowdfunding initiatives. At Friend Funding, we are creating an even more fun and entertaining method for raising startup capital, a method that will help you reach out to the people most likely to support your campaign. You’ll have a flexible, rewarding, friends and family-based crowdfunding source that can actually work – just as you want it to.  Since Friend Funding needs to operate from a technologically smart, safe, user-friendly and dynamic platform, we are seeking to raise 5.000,00 € to fund its full operational creation, by covering the following expenses:These amounts are for a 3 month development schedule. Everything else is already paid for by the project creator using personal friend-funding.Accountancy work : 		720,00 €Hosting : 432,00 € Platform Design : 360,00 €Platform Coding and Development : 2.500,00 € (Project Team has already coded 30% of the work. We use powerful software and platforms like wordpress.com for blog, buddypress for social interaction and amember.com for member management)Crowdfunding fees, Marketing & Social Media Promotion : €1.000,00 We are now inviting you to take part in the exciting development of Friend-Funding, while also turning your support into an immediately available option to run your own crowdfunding project in a simpler way by using friend-funding first as a fire starter for a successful Crowdfunding campaign. Please take a look at our great rewards on offer and select the one that will make you be part of the exciting developing of Friend Funding.  We also invite you to share this campaign with your friends and family members who may also want to enjoy the funny before crowdfunding strategy that Friend Funding offers.

https://www.kickstarter.com/projects/minutesight/far-and-easy?ref=discovery_category_newest,minutesight/far-and-easy,"Far&Easy, through its website farandeasy.com, connects local guides with remote tourists.What does this site offer?Interactive tours around the world. The guides film live and tourists experience the tour in real time from their homes on their mobile, tablet, television or computer.Creating a new conceptThis is an innovative project based on a simple idea: the majority of people like to travel. Some would like to better prepare for their trip, others to return to places they have already visited. Some are limited by time, others by budget. We needed to find a solution to allow everyone to make these visits. This solution connects the tourist with a local guide who broadcasts a video stream in real time.Our site farandeasy.com allows tourists to choose the local guide who suits their needs, according to tours offered, their technical equipment, the languages they speak and their reviews. Far&Easy trains guides and manages the tourist-guide relationship.Far&Easy isn't a replacement for travel, and is not in competition with the tourism industry. It's simply a new tour experience, in real time and without any need for visitors to travel.MinutesightTo allow tourists and guides to test virtual tours, Far&Easy has created Minutesight, a free iOS app allowing one minute of streaming between geolocated anonymous people. If they are available and accept the call, each Minutesight user can become another user's webcam for one minute, and only needs to film by following the green arrows on their screen.When you first install the app, each user receives 20 points which allow twenty free one-minute tours. When you call and receive a film, you spend one point. When you shoot for another user, you earn one point.Minutesight runs on iOS, you can download our beta version with the following link: https://testflight.apple.com/join/Rf9jZ5RuMinutesight is also launching a Kickstarter, to finalise the iOS version and finance the development of an Android version of the app. Far&Easy and Minutesight have been awarded the 2019 French Tech Grant.Screenshots of the Minutesight app:Social and environmental aspectsFair tours: we have travelled a lot and often found that foreign or local intermediaries take most of the income generated by guides. At Far&Easy, we return 80% of the money paid by tourists directly to the guide. We train guides and help them to equip themselves, creating local jobs.Ecological tours: according to a 2018 study from the University of Sydney, traditional tourism is responsible for nearly 8% of greenhouse gas production. Far&Easy respects the planet by limiting emissions of these gases: Far&Easy guides move around locally on foot or by bike. You can tour the world without consuming 3.5 l of fuel/100 kilometres per traveller, or 770 L per person for a round trip between New York and Beijing!Far&Easy can limit long-distance business trips: when you have to view and interact live on-site (scouting, reports, interviews, presentations, shows, events), send one of our local guides who will film for you and send the images through streaming. You will direct the shooting and can interact in real time with the people filmed. Here too, no fuel is consumed.Far&Easy for touristsFar&Easy for guidesOur guides todaySpoken languagesOur guides all speak English, plus the local language. Some of our guides speak 3 or 4 languages.Copyright of images shotthe tourist shares the copyright of the images with the guide, with a paid option for the tourist to acquire the totality and exclusivity of the copyright.Future developmentsFar&Easy will quickly benefit from technical innovations and the deployment of new technologies. 5G networks, 360° cameras, allowing tourists to pilot the drone camera. As soon as they are operational, the guides will integrate these technologies into their tours.Funding needsWe require funding to:AimsWe are launching Far&Easy in June 2019.Our goal at the end of the launch period on Kickstarter is to present 40 guides, and have more than 100 destinations by the end of 2019.We are currently recruiting guides. If a guide, for any reason, could not ensure the visits promised to our contributors we undertake to do everything possible to ensure that another guide can ensure the same visits (city, tour) as soon as possible.CreatorsLorenzo Felici, IT architect & international consultant.François Marquet, advertising, creative director.Felice Nikolaou, arts student.Lorenzo has created the site Visualtravelguide.com, the first website of its kind for downloading free HD tourism images. François founded the Bellevue studio and the magazine Most. Lorenzo is an international consultant, François has managed a communications agency in Moscow. Both are frequent travellers for both business and pleasure. And both are drone pilots.","Far&Easy does not depend on a platform, an internet service provider or a single streaming application. All that is needed is a model of camera, smartphone, stabiliser or drone. Across all these areas, there is choice. Whether you are a tourist or guide, Android or IOS, Far&Easy sets the minimum configurations for a good tour experience.  For streaming applications, we have created our own Far&Easy app which runs on iOS and Android. It stems from the iOS Minutesight application which we developed and whose beta version is downloadable via Testflight: https://testflight.apple.com/join/Rf9jZ5Ru Apple Face Time and Google Duo are also compatible with Far&Easy. By the end of 2019, our guides will be able to use more powerful cameras, stabilisers and drones, while 5G will enable 360° video streaming for an immersive experience. Our development challenge is in recruiting and training guides to increase the tours available and meet demand.  And of course, we will have to manage the growth of Far&Easy. Our guides and beta testers were enthusiastic about this project.  Come and experience this adventure with us by participating in the birth of this new form of tourism.

UaN exists to to enjoy the important things in life and to inspire others to live life with a fun-first mentality.Did you know? •	7 out of 10 children don't learn their left from right foot until the age of around 6 years •	In under developed countries there are less children with foot alignment disorders.  •	Barefoot is best for healthy foot development  •	Rigid ankle support and inflexible soles hinder natural foot movement.  •	Neutral fitting shoes can correct in-toeing.Doyour children put their shoes on the wrong feet? Ours do. The 50/50/90 rule. If there’s a 50/50 chance, the wrong selection will be made 90% of the time.  Don’t worry! Up until the age of around 6 years it’s completely normal that they can't tell the difference between their left or right foot. There is moment for every learning step. The ideal age to learn to distinguish between left and right foot is from 4 years on.A simple but innovative idea. The UaN Shoe Form A neutral-fitting shoe form with no left or right foot distinction.WHAT THE EXPERTS SAY  After 2 years of development and lab-testing in London and Barcelona, we have been backed by a team of podiatrists, psychologists and the Technological Institute for Footwear and innovation.  On the way we wanted to have a little more fun and we thought...what if we let them combine colours as they like?  So we decided to sell UaN Shoes by the unit! Not in pairs You can mix & match your favourite colours or buy a TRIO and let your children choose which combination they feel like today! They’ll wish they had more feet!The alternatives to UaN are few• Nagging and controlling 24/7. Toddlers go through a ""I can do it myself phase"". Not giving your child the freedom to be independent will only knock back their self- confidence and sense of responsibility. Kids should be encouraged to take lead in their daily tasks if we want to nurture confident adults. •	Let’s just leave them. We don’t believe you should compromise on foot health. Confining the foot into an unnatural shape has negative effects on a child's constantly growing foot. •	Labelling methods. For a 2,3 or 4 year old child it’s still tough to work out which shoe is which and to remember what colour or image goes on what foot. Let them learn when the time is right. ...and the Benefits are many  FEATURES  Our SuppliersSkilled craftsmanship  In addition to the quality of the craftsmanship, the fair working conditions and the compliance of EU REACH regulations and environmental standards is what gave us the thumbs up to choose our suppliers and production partner.

Our kids are key in helping us create kid-centred products and together we like to share our experiences, likes and dislikes.   Our Team  STRETCH GOALS VERSIÓN ESPAÑOLBIENVENIDOS A UN NUEVO MUNDO DE ZAPATOS  Se acabaron las discusiones sobre el pie izquierdo o derecho, y se acabaron las lágrimas. Padres relajados y niños felices, independientes y por supuesto con estilo. Deja que tus hijos se vistan solos de manera más fácil con UaN shoes.El Concepto UaN  UaN existe para disfrutar de las cosas importantes en la vida y para inspirar a otros a vivir la vida con una mentalidad donde prima la diversión basado en los valores principales de UaN.¿Sabias qué? •	7 de cada 10 niños no aprenden a distinguir el pie izquierdo del pie derecho hasta los 6 años de edad.  •	En los países en vías de desarrollo hay menos niños con trastornos de alineación del pie.  •	Andar descalzo es lo mejor para el correcto desarrollo del pie  •	Las plantillas con arcos y otros elementos anatómicos no son necesarios para los pies.  •	Un zapato de horma neutra puede corregir la alineación del pie – una marcha convergente (caminar hacia dentro)¿Tus hijos se ponen los zapatos al revés? Los nuestros sí  ¡No te preocupes! Hasta la edad de 6 años es completamente normal que un niño no distinga entre su pie izquierdo y derecho.Una idea simple pero innovadora. La forma de UaN Shoes  Un zapato con una horma neutra, sin pie derecho ni izquierdo. Después de 2 años de desarrollo y pruebas en laboratorios entre Londres y Barcelona, hemos conseguido la validación de UaN Shoes por parte de podólogos, psicólogos, el Instituto de Tecnológico de calzado y el Colegio Oficial de Podólogos de Cataluña.

I was a graphic design student and took many rolls of film in 1983-5 of the London rockin' scene and a couple of years ago I created a Facebook page and posted my photos. People quickly became re-acquainted with old friends and added memories of the scene. The book comes directly from this feedback. The photos stand by themselves as a record of the time, but the completed book will be enhanced by an introduction from DJ Tom Ingram, a key personality of the scene, contributions from many of the people pictured and descriptions of the key venues.By supporting the Kickstarter campaign you will of course get a copy of the book (professionally designed and edited) - and your name will appear on the supporter page in the book. And there are bonuses that will never be available again: art-quality prints of your chosen photos and you can choose the cover star with one-off dust jackets featuring your choice photograph.If you have memories of the 80s London scene please contact us very promptly via the Facebook page: ""Rockin London in the 1980s"".Just a few of the more than 150 photographs from the book...","I worked for many years in book publishing, rising to the giddy heights of art director, so I have a complete understanding of the process of getting a book from concept to printed item.Obviously the photographs already exist and the negatives will go to be professionally scanned the minute we reach our target.

The book of these photos includes four iconic London rockin' venues of the day, such as The Phoenix, and two of the bands, Red Hot 'n' Blue and the Chevalier Brothers. All enhanced by comments from people there at the time.This overlapped with me co-creating a fanzine called Zine devoted to indie and pop music. I took a great many photos for the articles, these feature in the Zine book with never before seen interview shots of artists such as Paul Weller, Deacon Blue, John Peel, Cyndi Lauper, Bo Diddley, Bow Wow Wow, Edwyn Collins, Billy Mackenzie and The Blow Monkeys. Accompanied by some of the original Zine articles and graphics.The candid photographs in both books stand by themselves as a record of the time, taken from the viewpoint of an insider, the other voices in the texts add personal colour and detail.Rockin' DJ Tom Ingram - now resident in Las Vegas - features in many of the original photos and was an important personality of the London 80's scene, he introduces the rockin' book. The Zine book has photos from a quick lunch we spent with John Peel, and has an intro from the DJ who has done most to continue his work, the well-respected 6 Music presenter Steve Lamacq.There's a great range of bonus rewards on top of the books themselves, only available at this time : as a backer for the project you will get your name into the book on the supporters page, there are archival quality photo prints available of your choice of image, a limited edition Zine badge (made by the same company that made the original 80's Zine badges) and the top reward means you can choose your cover model on a custom dust jacket for either book.Known to our family as Rockin' Dave, David Waterman introduced my sister and me to the rockin' scene and will be working on the text to bring together the memories of that time. In the years after Zine, my sister, Juliet Sensicle worked at London Records and was involved with bands such as All Saints, L7, East 17 and Utah Saints (to name but a few). She will be editing the text for the Zine book, having co-edited and co-written the fanzine in the 80s (together with Tim Southwell, who went on to co-found Loaded magazine and Iestyn George, later section editor on the NME).The original negatives will be professionally re-scanned for previously unseen detail. The books will be professionally designed and have top quality printing. Both books will have a square format of 220mm (a bit larger than the sleeve of a 45rpm).Zine - One Fanzine's View of the 1980's Music Scenewill be 96 pages.Black & White - A Snapshot of Rockin' London in the 1980swill be 160 pages; both books averaging one display photo per page.AND TO GET YOU IN THE MOOD:Search Spotify for ""Zine Mixtape"" to find a virtual C120 that will transport you back to the heyday of jangly indie guitar!Or ""Rockin London"" for a playlist of favourite jive, bop, stroll and smooch 45s.JUST A TASTER OF THE IMAGES IN THE BOOKS:","I worked for many years in book publishing, rising to the giddy heights of art director, so I have a complete understanding of the process of getting a book from concept to printed item.Obviously the photographs already exist and the negatives will be professionally scanned the minute we reach our target.

https://www.kickstarter.com/projects/133216059/arkadian-joystick-para-los-retrogamers-mas-exigent?ref=discovery_category_newest,133216059/arkadian-joystick-para-los-retrogamers-mas-exigent,"Hace dos años, por Enero de 2016, mi colega Sam y yo, comenzamos una aventura cuyo objetivo era, simple y llanamente, fabricar y comercializar el mejor Joystick del mercado.Pero todo comenzó mucho antes… Corría el año 88 y un niño de 11 años, lleno de futuro y emoción por la vida, inmerso ya hasta las trancas en las recreativas y los juegos de 8 bits,  descubrió, en un destartalado escaparate de una escondida tienda de reparaciones de las afueras de Barcelona, un maravilloso Joystick de sobremesa…con el aspecto de los joysticks de las recreativas!!!. Era el afamado Joystick Professional Telemach.Como muchos dentro de la comunidad de gamers retro avezados, somos de la firme convicción de que el Joystick Telemach, que se comercializó en España a finales de los ochenta, ha sido el mejor Joystick de la historia. No somos los únicos que opinamos así. Hay decenas de foros que apoyan esta idea. Para los nostálgicos, y para los que no lo conocéis todavía, el Joystick Telemach tenía esta pinta:Por qué era el Telelemach tan bueno? Que tenía que otros no? Básicamente ofrecía dos valores añadidos, robustez y durabilidad, dentro de unas líneas de diseño bastante sugerentes. El cajón era de madera en vez de plástico y la palanca era magnética en vez de muelles. Con los años, fueron apareciendo otras consolas de 8 y 16 bits, los PCs, luego las PlayStation, etc.. El Telemach ya había quedado obsoleto en pocos años, pero yo intenté darle uso adaptando su electrónica y cableado a los nuevos standard de puertos gamepad que iban saliendo.  Solo había que ponerle la placa electrónica de otro joystick y ya está. El problema es que el Telemach, como la mayoría de Joysticks de los 80, solo tenía 2 botones, suficientes para los juegos de saltar y disparar, pero insuficiente para las nuevas generaciones de juegos que necesitaban 4 o 6 botones. Aquí los apaños eran varios. No os riais, pero en los 90 llegué a usar “tuppers” con ventosa para añadir botones anexos al mando.Casi 30 años después, ya con trabajo, casado y con niños, un día de mudanza me apareció el joystick Telemach de una caja y algo dentro mío se volvió a activar. En ese entonces me había hecho con una raspberry PI y la había programado para jugar a emuladores de consola y MAME en el televisor de casa y automáticamente pensé “necesito un Telemach 2 players con 6 u 8 botones por jugador.... pero eso no existe! Pues habrá que hacerlo...“.Tomé las medidas del Telemach e hice un modelo en Autocad a escala incluyendo botones de start, select, player 1, player 2 y 6 botones de acción.  Luego busqué en ebay algunos Telemach con la idea de desmontarlos y usar las piezas para el nuevo que quería fabricarme.  Sobre todo para obtener las palancas magnéticas originales de Industrias Lorenzo S.A, que es la empresa que fabricaba el Joystick Telemach y fabricaba las palancas magnéticas en los 80. Pero, para mi sorpresa, Industrias Lorenzo todavía estaba operativa!! De hecho actualmente se dedica a la fabricación de componentes para máquinas recreativas, máquinas arcade, maquinaria industrial en general, y lo más importante… todavía suministran las  palancas magnéticas originales!!! Me hice con botones, micro-interruptores y palancas en Industrial Lorenzo, compré unas placas de joystick universal compatible con PC,Mac,PlayStation,etc.. y me enfoqué en conseguir el cajón perfecto.Necesitaba un cajón de madera, con cantos redondeados, con filigrana y lacado en pintura metalizada.Después de varias iteraciones con ebanistas y lacadores profesionales llegué al resultado óptimo que buscaba. Y por fin hice el primer prototipo, el Telemach del siglo XXI : Pasado varios meses, un día probando el Joystick con mi amigo Sam, surgió la idea de comercializarlo.Él se encargó de transformarlo en un producto de mercado.Nos asociamos y creamos la marca Arkadian Station.Actualmente estamos fabricando joysticks Arkadian, de 1 y 2 players, y vendiéndolos en la web www.arkadianstation.com como producto artesanal bajo demanda.El producto está fabricado, lacado y ensamblado a mano. Compatible con sistemas operativos Windows, Linux, Mac OS y PS3. Su peso de 4 kilos, sus palancas magneticas de Industrias Lorenzo y su base antideslizante dan al Joystick una robustez y durabilidad únicas. Hemos comprobado que encima de una mesa lisa de madera, metal o cristal, el joystick es inamovible ante cualquier impacto. De hecho, antes se mueve la mesa donde está apoyado que el propio joystick, El valor añadido que buscábamos era el de dar al gamer la satisfacción de poder aporrearlos botones y desahogarse con las palancas con la fuerza que te pide el cuerpo cuando lo sometes al estres de acción y emoción que solo los juegos arcade consiguen. Llevamos un año en marcha, aún no somos empresa pero esperamos serlo si conseguimos los hitos que nos hemos propuesto. Hemos vendido ya algunos mandos y los clientes se han mostrado entusiasmados con el resultado. Estamos activos en twitter e Instagram, y tenemos ya más de 1000 seguidores, que nos dan muchas muestras de apoyo y lo más importante, nos dan feedback para mejorar. Y el comentario más recurrente es: “El mando está muy chulo….pero es muy caro”. Al estar hecho a mano, el coste y el tiempo de entrega son altos. Cuestan 179€ el 1 player y 249€ el 2 player.Creemos que el precio que el mercado establece a un producto de estas características es de 100€ el mando 1P y 180€ el 2P. Y ahí está el problema, y la razón por la que me hemos decidido dar el siguiente paso lógico: Industrializar el producto y abaratar costes para poder bajar el precio. Aunque ahora es un producto artesanal, no tiene valor añadido el hecho de que lo sea. Mediante un proceso de CNC se puede fabricar en serie y hay empresas que lo podrían hacer y lacar en cuestión de minutos a un precio menos de la mitad de lo que nos cuesta ahora. Eso sí, los pedidos mínimos son del orden de cientos de cajones, y para alcanzar el precio de coste objetivo necesitamos hacer pedidos de al menos 1000 unidades. Con lo que necesitamos una inversión acorde a la nueva estructura empresarial capaz de sufragar y procesar grandes pedidos a escala industrial. Esta primera fase del proyecto incluiría el primer pedido de 1000 unidades de cajones (fabricados de una sola pieza en CNC y lacado metalizado), que nos costaría unos 30.000€ (a unos 30 euros la caja).Si conseguimos el presupuesto para esta primera fase, pasaríamos a la segunda fase en la que desarrollariamos la estructura de empresa. En esta segunda fase necesitamos unos 200.000€.  Esto incluye los gastos del primer año referentes al alquiler de un local, a los gastos de marketing y operaciones y el sueldo de 2 personas para la gestión, ensamblaje y control de calidad del producto final. Haríamos una caja de embalaje acorde a la calidad del producto, con garantía de fabricante marca CE, pudiendo así suministrar a tiendas geek, de informática, grandes almacenes y Amazon. Solo así el producto llegaría a manos de los retro gamers a un precio acorde a la demanda con todas las garantías.Instagram: @ArkadianStationhttps://www.instagram.com/arkadianstation/?hl=esTwitter: @ArkadianStationhttps://twitter.com/arkadianstation?lang=esFacebook: @Pedro Arkadian Station Martinezhttps://es-es.facebook.com/ArkadianStation/___________________________________________________Two years ago, around January 2016, Sam my dude and I started an adventure which objective was mainly to fabricate and commercialize the best arcade Joystick of the market. But everything started much earlier.  During last eighties, around 88, I was a 11 years old child, full of future and excitement for live, already immerse in the arcade saloons and 8-bit games, find out a rare thing, in a ramshackle showcase of  a hidden electronics store of the suburbs of Barcelona… a wonderful Joystick, with the look of the ones of the Arcade videogame machines!!! It was the famous Professional Telemach Joystick. Like many of the experienced retro gamers community, we are firmly convinced that the Telemach Joystick, which was produced in Spain in the late eighties, has been the best Joystick ever made. We are not the only ones who think that way. There are dozens of forums that support this idea. For the nostalgic, and for those who do not know yet, the Telemach Joystick looked like this:Why was Telemach so good? What did it have that others did not? Basically it offered two added values, robustness and durability, within some pretty cool design. The case was made of wood instead of plastic and the stick was magnetic instead of using springs. Over the years, other consoles of 8 and 16 bits appeared, the PCs, then the PlayStation, etc. The Telemach became obsolete in a few years, but I tried to use it by adapting its electronics to the new standard gamepad ports. You only need to install the electronic board of another updated joystick and that's it. The problem is that the Telemach, like most Joysticks of the 80s, only had 2 buttons, enough for jumping and shooting games, but insufficient for new generations of games that needed 4 or 6 buttons(even 8).Here the fixings were several. Please, don’t laugh, but in the 90s I got to use ""tupperware containers"" with suction pads to add buttons attached to the main joystick. Almost 30 years later, already with work, wife and children, one day of moving boxes, the old Telemach joystick suddenly appeared to me from a box and some burn inside me was activated again. At that time I had working with a raspberry PI and had programmed it to play console emulators and MAME games in TV…and I automatically thought: ""I need a Telemach 2 players with 6 or 8 buttons per player .... but that doesn’t exists! Well, it will have to be done ... ""I took the Telemach measurements and made a scale model in Autocad including start, select, player 1, player 2 and 6 action buttons.Then I looked for in ebay for some Telemach with the idea of disassembling them and using the pieces for the new one I wanted to manufacture. Especially to obtain the original magnetic sticks of Industrias Lorenzo S.A, which is the company that manufactured the Joystick Telemach and manufactured the magnetic sticks in the 80s. But, oh surprise, Industrias Lorenzo was still operational! Actually, it is currently dedicated to the manufacture of components for arcade machines, industrial machinery in general, and most importantly ... they still supply the original magnetic sticks !!! I ordered buttons, micro-switches and levers in Industrial Lorenzo, I bought some universal joystick/gamepad board compatible with PC, Mac, PlayStation3, etc ... and I focused on getting the perfect case, a rugged, polished rounded wooden case and finished in metallic paint. After several iterations with cabinet makers and professional lacquers I arrived at the optimal result I was looking for. And finally I made the first prototype, the Telemach of the 21st century:After several months, one day playing with my friend Sam with the beta prototype of the Arkadian Joystick, the idea of selling it came up. He was in charge of transforming it into a market product. We partnered and created the Arkadian Station brand. We are currently manufacturing Arkadian joysticks, of 1 and 2 players, and selling them on the website www.arkadianstation.com as a handmade product on demand. The product is manufactured, lacquered and assembled by hand. Compatible with Windows, Linux, Mac OS and PS3 operating systems. Its weight of 4 kilos/2players) and 3kilos (1player), its Industrias Lorenzo magnetic sticks and its non-slip base give the Joystick a unique robustness and durability. We have verified that on a smooth wooden, metal or glass table, the joystick is immovable before any impact. In fact, you will move the table before the joystick itself. The added value we aimed was to give the gamer the satisfaction of being able to push hard the buttons and relieve the levers with the force that the body requires when you are submitted to the stress of action and emotion that only arcade games achieve.Arkadian Joystick: The professional arcade Joystick for all platforms.   We have been selling homemade joysticks for a year, we are not yet a company but we hope to do so if we achieve the project milestones. We have already sold some joysticks and customers gave us enthusiastic feedback about the result. We are active on twitter and Instagram, and we already have more than 1000 followers, who give us many samples of support and most importantly, give us feedback to improve. And the most recurrent comment is: ""The command is very cool ... but it is very expensive"". Being handmade, the cost and delivery time are high. They price is € 179 for the 1 player and € 249 for the 2 player. We believe that the price that the market establishes for a product with these characteristics is € 100 for the 1P control and € 180 for the 2P. And there is the problem, and the reason why I have decided to take the next logical step: Industrialize the product aiming lower the costs to lower the price. Although now it is an artisanal product, there is no added value in the fact that it was artisanal, and it has no sense in wasting resources in laborious work being possible to fabricate it by numeric control CNS. Through a CNC process it can be manufactured in series and there are companies that could do it and lacquer in a matter of minutes at a price less than half of what it costs us now. But, CNC production needs high volume orders. The minimum order is in the range of hundreds of units, and to reach the target cost price we need to order at least 1000 units. Consequently, we need an investment according to the new business structure capable of covering and processing large orders on an industrial scale. This first phase of the project would include the first order of 1000 units of units (manufactured in one piece in CNC and lacquered metal), which would cost us about € 30,000 (at around € 30 per box). If we get the budget for this first phase, we will move on to the second phase in which we will develop the company structure. In this second phase we need about € 200,000. This includes first year expenses related to the rental of a place, marketing and operation expenses and the salary of 2 people for the management, assembly and quality control of the final product. We would make a packaging box according to the quality of the product, with CE labeling warranty, being able to supply it to geek stores, computer stores, and also Amazon. Only then the product would reach the hands of retro gamers at a balanced price with the demand with all the guarantees.Instagram: @ArkadianStationhttps://www.instagram.com/arkadianstation/?hl=esTwitter: @ArkadianStationhttps://twitter.com/arkadianstation?lang=esFacebook: @Pedro Arkadian Station Martinezhttps://es-es.facebook.com/ArkadianStation/___________________________________________________","El reto es conseguir reducir el coste de fabricación y componentes de Arkadian Joystick a casi el 50%.

Nobody knows how this dialogue began, but the truth is that it was and has been happening since then in all the terrestrial orb. The gods are still there. Each town gave them names, gave them faces and transmitted their sagas from generation to generation. The gods are still there. Like a distant memory in our genes, resonating in our conscience, like a magical song that shakes us. To know them is to know ourselves better.  And this is the main motivation of this digital codex. It seeks to gather as much information as possible about the identity of the ancient gods that our ancestors have idolized. It avoids modern versions, current point of views. No further re-interpretations, no further revisiting, It aim to show only original translations from the original texts. Everyone can take their own conclusions, but the important think, the key point that this digital codex try to remark is ""a good research has to start from the original texts"". A large database of our gods, terrestrial or stellar, benevolent or destructive, their names, their domains, their teachings, their tales, their kinship and even their correlation between different cultures can be inferred from them.Welcome and enjoy reading.This project started the day I met the Greek pantheon of gods when I was a child. Is the Olympus our Heaven? Why Greek people believe in several gods and not in only one? Why I believe in a single god? Why they was wrong and we are right?Years later, I understood that even a single human can became a god after some generations if his footprint was large enough. For example Imhotep, the first known pyramid architect in the history, was a single man. However he was glorified and venerated as a god about 3000 years after his death because his huge influence in his civilization. Greeks knew him as Asklepios and Romans as Esculapio whom teachings leaks in nowadays knowledge and culture. Other gods are related with star constellations. The same stars can be seen from different locations in our planet. Isis was the start Sirio and Osiris are related to Orion constellation. Sun gods or solar deities can be found in all cultures: Horus, Shamash, Apollo, Aurora, Mitra or Jesus Christ are well know examples.Which correlation can we found between Anu (Sumerian), Ra (Egypt), Cronos(Greek), Ometecuhtli (Mexica) or Yahve? Could their saga explain us the same teaching in essence?  What about Enlil, Seth, Zeus, Tezcatlipoca or Baal? And…What about the known correlations between Enki, Osiris, Poseidon, Quetzalcoalt and KotharWaKhasis?  Could they be the same person, the same star or the same concept? For example, I developed a theory connecting these characters, this analysis is shown in the research and will shown in the new website. But more people supporting the godscodex website project will participate in elaborating new hypothesis and theories, and also contributing with new old text sources to be analysed. This is the real objective, to enable a research tool in which people can learn and participate about these main topics: history, anthropology and mythology.More tables of gods with associated features and characteristic will be shown also in the website enabling a search tool to find items and filter them in the data base.Same characters with different names can be found in different cultures. Their teachings were relevant, even they can be considered as crucial for survivor, and our ancestors told stories about them and their life during millenniums to save their knowledge before the writing. These old words are now lost puzzle pieces. Mesopotamian pantheon, Egypcian, Greek, Semitic, Aztec, Hindu, etc… remain in old codices, in old petroglyphs,  in old stones. They still keep saved some puzzle pieces that we can revisit.The studies have to be done from primordial texts, without prejudices, with open mind with the aim to clarify our golden past. I started my research 5 years ago and I made a website to show results. My writings and research show relevant information and crossed analysis about the gods appearing in the Bible, Rigveda, the Real Canon of Turin, the Palermo stone, the Boturini Codex, the Dresden Codex, Popol Vuh and the Tablet writings of Gilgamesh saga (the flood tablet).New comparative research is coming about correlation of original texts of different cultures about the legends(not myths) of the famous universalflood, the tower of Babel, islands submerged by cataclysms and human immortality.I started the project in Spanish language 5 years ago. The website (www.godscodex.com) is continuously under development with new inputs from my research.The website born with the objective of help people to have easy access to old texts of different cultures about genesis of cultures and civilizations their mythology and gods, to learn and participate in discussions about these relevant topics which are unknown in regular schools. Now, as a earlier milestone, the objective is to translate my drafts and finish the English version of the website enabling cooperation of backers and founders of the project in further research.The two main milestones expected to achieve in the following 3 months with the budget achieved in this project are shown below:1) New website design - User-friendly navigation and attractive website enabling tools for the founders and bakers for their participation in further content research and developments. This tasks will be externalized to a third company. The amount of the proforma invoice including this task and 2 years maintenance is€4,234.2) English translation of the current content of the website www.godscodex.com. This task will be made by myself.After these previous milestones other tasks will be carried out to achieve new ones:3) Research and publish new work in the field by means of www.godcodex.com4) After a consolidated path in the research an eventual book will be written including and summarizing the work, the old text translations, open discussions, hypothesis, etc...More codices and writings will be analysed and posted in the future even if the project hasn't achieve support enough. If you are interested in to follow me in this adventure looking for our ancient gods  you will be more than welcome.","Main risk is to have not enough human resources to achieve the milestones. The challenge is to achieve a successful platform, with a number of followers enough in order to have a live website in which people can learn, give opinion and open new discussions about history, culture and anthropology topics."

Once printed, the cards will be sold, the models will be paid modeling fees, the profits from the card sales will be donated to three Portland nonprofits: WISER (Women Inspiring Sexual Education & Revolution), Portland Slutwalk, and a sex-positive theater group called Dance Naked Productions.There is a Facebook group for the project.Photographed over the course of two and a half years, this unique and respectful look at Portland dancers has been created to show the power, diversity, personality, and beauty of this community of entertainers. This is my tribute to these inspiring performers. Stripping Out Loud is a collectible card set, similar to baseball or other types of trading cards.I've been a photographer for over 22 years and have brought my background in journalistic and commercial photography to this project. More of my work can be seen at jasonsavageimages.com and Jason Savage Images on Instagram.This Kickstarter campaign is to raise the money needed for the printing and packaging costs of 2,500 card sets of 70 cards each (69 dancers, and one title card in each set). Printing will be done at a Portland print shop to help support local business.The cards will be printed on heavy 16 point card stock and will be 3.5 x 2.5 inches in size. Sets will be packaged in clear collectible graded card bags (also purchased from a local business).After printing, 2,400 sets of the cards will be sold at one or more special Portland events in the Spring of 2018. The first event will be on June 10th, at the Funhouse Lounge. Once the cards have sold, each model in the project gets a $200 modeling fee from the card sales money and the sales profits will go to the three local nonprofits:-WISER (Women Inspiring Sexual Education & Revolution):APortland networking and information resource sharing group for women leaders in the Sexual Revolution sphere, from touch positive to body positive to sex positive.         -Portland Slutwalk:A yearly peaceful protest that acknowledges the sexualized violence and victim blaming in American culture. It believes in nuanced discussion around consent, boundaries, and kyriarchy. It also promotes people of all genders having bodily autonomy and sexual freedom.-Dance Naked Productions:A theater company located in Portland, OR that creates and produces sex-positive theater that illuminates, educates, and entertains.They celebrate theater as a pathway into evolving human consciousness.The images in Stripping Out Loud are conceptual and none of the photos contain full nudity. This series has been created to represent the wide range of exotic dancers in Portland: including male, transgender, and various body types. For most of the duration of the creative process, I have had several dancers/activists who have been a tremendous help as ""technical advisers"".There are also numerous local landmarks shown in this set. This project is as much about Portland as it is about strippers.The ETA for having the cards out and the rewards fulfilled is June of 2018. Once the Kickstarter is funded, I will be sending the card designs to the printer, and finishing up arrangements on the launch party/sale event. The first scheduled sale event will be held on Sunday, June 10th, at the Funhouse Lounge in Portland (unfortunately I cannot offer special invites to the launch party/sale as rewards, as it will be held at a 21+ establishment. All are welcome to attend though). Thank you very much for your support of Stripping Out Loud, freedom of expression, and of the very worthwhile causes that the card sales will benefit. Please click the green button for whatever backer level you like and help make this unique project into a reality.This is a sample of the 69 dancers featured in the card set. To see all of them, backers at certain levels will receive full sets or they may be purchased at the sale event this spring and at the sale event on June 10th, 2018, and the Funhouse Lounge in Portland. Cards may also be ordered at StrippingOutLoud.com, soon.","Risks for this project have been anticipated and measures have been taken to prevent any unwanted surprises. Research has been done with the printer to ensure top quality. Test prints have already been made for the limited edition Kickstarter cards.  Proofs will be done for the main 2,500 sets to make certain that color, registration, and overall quality are top notch."

We are looking to upgrade the packaging of the multi-sourced products into an english and homogenized look.This will allow us to garner a corner in the retail market and grow a stronger connection to our widening suppliers. Currently, our products can be reached through our online shop and other online distributors as well as wholesale supply direct from the producer. Our video is a selection of clips of the manufacturing process from each of our suppliers whose products are included in our rebranding line.All of our honey is unpasteurized and unheated, retaining all of the natural nutritional value of vitamins, amino acids, and enzymes. Honey is the food of bees that is digested externally from their body in storage. The process that this honey takes to reach you is simple, it is mechanically extracted from the honeycomb, carefully blended so that the entire batch is homogeneous, and hand packed. Our honeys are made from specific flowers’ nectar, including: Wildflower (from uncultivated assorted flowers growing in resting soil), Buckwheat, Phacelia, Linden, Acacia, and Heather.High Organic's smoked meat is hand cut, arranged by hand, and smoked with traditional recipes that Poland is known for. Very little, if any at all, of the meat is unused, as all animal parts have a place in Polish tradition. All of our meats are quality controlled by hand and eye. Other than the time tested herbs and spices, there are no additional flavors, preservatives, or colors in the recipe. Thus, our meats retain all the smoke flavors that have been created with selected wood without any unnecessary additions. Because of animal product shipping regulations, we are only able to distribute smaller meat cuts. In this case, small dry sausages called kabanosy and beef jerky. Rose Hip Juice is extremely rich in Vitamin C, more so than any citrus fruit with 450 mg of vitamin C per 100 mL of juice, and has a very strong tart taste that is surprisingly palatable. The rose hips are hand picked, juiced using only a mechanical process, and packaged shortly after. This juice is good to drink straight, mixed with water, and added to other juices and drinks for an extra kick of flavor and vitamins. High Organic specializes in pastas made from non-GMO grains harvested from lands that are far from industrial zones, from typical pesticides and other unnecessary chemical runoff areas. The pastas are made up of only two ingredients: water and the grain itself. In addition, these grains are milled only when they are to be mixed with water and pressed into the pasta’s shape. There is no long term storage or addition of preservatives of the grain before and after the pasta is made. Our pastas are made up of the following organic grains: Buckwheat, Einkorn, Spelt, and Emmer. These ancient grains are the purest grown in Poland as their genetic makeup has not been watered down by selective breeding that is aimed at high quantity production. Similar to our pastas, our cereals come from a non-GMO area and come to you untainted by any chemical additives and chemical processing. These cereals are simple and full of dietary fiber that is necessary for everyone and helpful for those who spend a lot of energy throughout the day and do not want to refuel soon after breakfast. These types of grain are also selected to have high content in protein and minerals in levels that are uncommon in typical supermarket cereals. Our cereals are made from the following grains: Buckwheat, Emmer, Spelt, Millet, and Einkorn.Our jams are pure fruit immediately processed and packaged after harvest, insuring that the flavor is as rich and ripe as a freshly picked Strawberry, Raspberry, or Blueberry. These jams have the highest concentration of berry of any jam on the market at 80% berry and 20% apple concentrate. The apple concentrate is a necessary addition, as it contains natural preservatives that are necessary for the long shelf life of these fruit jams. Our suppliers have been using this same recipe for generations, eschewing all the modern processing shortcuts, chemical enhancements, and added sugars.High Organic does not have an exhaustive stock but this is because our suppliers are local producers that sell out of products in their own local markets. The demand for this type of traditional product in the producer's local areas has not waned in the face of industrial globalisation.We are continually looking to find more sources and producers to make a more diverse and better stocked selection for you. We do this not only to distribute high quality food across the globe, but to support these producers and lands. We can do this by offering these producers another outlet for their product while allowing them to retain their own techniques and methods.By choosing High Organic, you are choosing not only high quality foods, but supporting all the flora and fauna of the land that maintain the possibility of producing these foods.Hello Everyone, I’m a co-founder and a lover of organics, wine, design, travel and eco solutions. I don’t live on a farm, but I grew up on an organic farm. I know farmers and artisanal producers and I find it enriching to buy directly from those who work within nature.

But just because a food product is expensive, does not mean it is tasty nor invigorating.I’ve helped fund High Organic simply because I’m really dumbfounded at the availability of ingredients and waste output we have from common food sources. I’d like to offer another option for those who are pickier in choice, have specific needs, are weary of the industrial complex’s damage of our planet, or want to explore how foods can change the way their life is experienced.","A couple of the tasks we face from this point on are to finish the label designs and to test the packaging of the pasta. We have a good connection with our designer and we are working together to gradually bring a classic but fresh look to our traditional products. The actual design on the packages will be subject to minor changes throughout our campaign as we refine the look. Secondly, our pasta packaging seems to be the most complicated of all the containers. We have several samples that must be tested for size, durability, and look.

We are attempting to expand our customer base by rebranding our most popular product: honey!At the moment, the honey is contained in the original supplier’s polish packaging. We hope to package it in english High Organic labeling so that it is more accessible to the world and so that our brand is more visible. We offer a great range of premium raw honey produced by artisan beekeeper from Poland's natural wilderness. The bees are never exposed to chemicals or antibiotics, increasing their natural resistance and health, to provide a tastier, purer honey. Each variety is obtained seasonally, resulting in a truly unique product.Family Fujarskich honey is stamped with a yellow and blue logo. This is an agricultural stamp that indicates the source land where the bees’ natural process has not been tainted by modern chemicals and dilution. The stamp refers to the Drawa terrain of Poland which is a river and surrounding area protected by national conservation laws. This natural park is home to flora and fauna that have been denizens of that land for centuries and the protective laws upheld there are to ensure those denizens flourish in all seasons.Along with this stamp, each jar of Fujarskich honey has its own “seal” number that indicates the honey contained has been grown, processed, and packaged freshly within the parameters of local tradition as well as the European Union’s organic specifications. The bees that create this honey are necessary to the survival of the Drawa watershed because they are an essential role in the reproductive process of all flora that sustains all local wildlife and much of the human inhabitants.Some honeys are described to have an exceptionally long or short crystallization time. All raw honey crystallizes and it is the different flower sources of the nectar that determines how long this process takes. It is well understood that liquid honey, honey that has not yet crystallized into a thick paste, is easier packaged, measured, and eaten. This is one of the reasons why most honeys you find in the market are filtered, diluted, and pasteurized. Another reason is that honey is usually more appealing when liquid, as it appears pure and unclouded by solid matter.The difference between our raw and filtered/pasteurized honey is not only in consistency and appearance, but in nutritional content as well. The process of filtering results in similar results as heating: easier to process and less nutritional honey.Family Fujarskich honey isin the “List of Traditional Products” by the Ministry of Agriculture and Rural Development in Poland.Hello Everyone, I’m a co-founder and a lover of organics, wine, design, travel and eco solutions.

This Project responds to the First Volume only. We will raise other Projects for the next 5 Volumes, once completed this one with your generous support.Our Goal: Cover Translation and editing expenses of Volume 1From the time Romero was named archbishop of San Salvador on February 22, 1977 until he was murdered at the altar on March 24, 1980, he delivered 193 homilies that were broadcast to the nation by radio. These homilies were later transcribed and published in six volumes in El Salvador. The homilies are the impassioned voice of a prophetic pastor addressing his people and his nation at a time of unprecedented crisis and violence. Romero unrelentingly condemns the repression of the people at the hands of the powerful and resolutely commits the Church to the difficult and dangerous struggle for justice and human rights. The homilies offer an unsparing indictment of the harsh political reality of El Salvador but never cease to summon Salvadorans to respond courageously to the Gospel precepts of peace, love, and social equality.Presented in a style suitable for both specialists and the general readership, the present and first volume is an English translation of the first 46 homilies, delivered between March 14th and November 25th, 1977, corresponding to the first volume of the original Spanish edition. Pope Francis approved the Beatification of Oscar Romero for May 2015.Who was Oscar Romero?Oscar Romero, born in Ciudad Barrios, on August 15th 1917, studied theology at the Pontifical Gregorian University in Rome and was ordained priest in 1942. He served the diocese of San Miguel for 25 years. In 1967 he moved to San Salvador as Secretary General of the National Bishops’ Conference.With little pastoral involvement he lived in the Jesuit-run seminary and became speechwriter to the Nuncio. In 1970, appointed Auxiliary Bishop, he expressed frequent criticism of the social involvement of the clergy that had come in the wake of the Medellin Conference of the Continent’s Bishops. In 1974 he was named to the rural diocese of Santiago de Maria and found himself once more caught up in the rural people’s struggle for survival.In 1977 he was the surprise choice as San Salvador’s new archbishop. Over three years he became the voice of the voiceless poor, speaking the truth about the violations of human rights and the exploitation of the poor. His weekly sermons were legendary and gave hope to the communities suffering terrible repression. He saw six of his priests and dozens of lay leaders assassinated by the security forces before he himself was gunned down at the altar as he celebrated a requiem mass on Monday March 24th 1980.He is venerated in Latin America and throughout the world as a Vatican II Bishop who made a fundamental option for the poor and gave his life for his people. He is already ""Servant of God"" Romero - the first step on the ladder to Sainthood. The cause for his Beatification was accepted in Rome in 1997. Ten years later Pope Benedict XVI stated “that Romero himself merits beatification, I do not doubt.""

In Spanish, but it will soon be available in English and Italian at http://beatificacionromero.org/Below is a YouTube link to a general presentation on aspects of Archbishop Oscar Romero. To play, click on the arrow in the box:The Joy of the Gospel in the midst of a situation of violence and turmoilEspecially after his conversion Oscar Romero was a joyful person. He specially liked jokes. I will tell you one of the jokes he liked best. ‘In a convent of religious sisters mysteriously the fridge gets emptied by night. As this happens repeatedly Mother Superior disguises herself as the devil, hides in the kitchen and waits. At midnight a sister appears and starts taking things out of the fridge. Mother Superior switches the light on and says with a terrible voice: I am the devil. The sister answers: thanks be to God you are not Mother Superior’. The theme of Archbishop Romero ́s homily on the 20th of January 1980 was “Christ shows his glory in happiness”. He pronounced this homily in the midst of a situation of violence and turmoil: “It can almost sound sarcastic to proclaim such words when we, in El Salvador, experience so much affliction and fear and live with so many different forms of psychosis. Nevertheless, I believe that no other call is more important for our country, for the people of El Salvador, than the call of this morning ́s liturgy: a call to the joy of optimism. ... God is not a God of sadness but a God of celebrations and feasts, a God of happiness. Therefore in the heart of people who have faith there is no room for pessimism.” According to the rules of discernment of the spirits of St. Ignatius peace and joy are clear signs of the good spirit, of God ́s spirit.What made Romero especially happy and joyful was his experience of God in the poor. How can this be explained? Simply by the affirmation of Jesus that he is present in the poor, the hungry, the suffering and the marginalized. And that the one who sees him sees the Father. So Romero could say: “I came to know God because I came to know my people.” And “A bishop always has to learn a lot from his people.” And “The people is my prophet.” “I have to listen to the Spirit who speaks to me through his people.” And again “With this people it is not difficult to be a good shepherd.”Speeches from Arch. RomeroWords by Jesuit theologian Jon Sobrino SJI am delighted that the homilies of Archbishop Romero have now been translated into English. As I write in the general introduction, Romero’s Sunday homilies are a perfect expression of who he was and what he did as a Salvadoran, as a Christian, and as archbishop of San Salvador.His Sunday homily became the center of attention for all Salvadorans throughout the country and also for many people in other parts of the world. As soon as each homily was finished, foreign correspondents would begin broadcasting his words on all the media. The powers of evil, in the shape of unscrupulous persons and institutions, used every means possible to stop him, but it was all in vain.As with Saint Paul, so with Archbishop Romero: «The word of God is not chained». In a very real sense, the word of Romero was the word of God. And it was also, as he himself said, the word of the people.Time goes by, and Romero’s homilies remain alive. A few days after Romero was killed on 24 March 1970, Bishop Pedro Casaldáliga wrote a poem that ends with these words: «Saint Romero of America, no one will silence your last homily».Now in the United Kingdom a group of Christians has worked to make this prophecy come true. This edition of the homilies in English, the language of the United Kingdom and a universal language, will make it easier for Romero’s words to remain alive throughout the world. To be sure, Oscar Romero belongs to everybody, but I think English readers have good reason to feel especially close to him. I have in mind two important things.First, it was British parliamentarians who in 1978 proposed Oscar Arnulfo Romero as a candidate for the Nobel Peace Prize. The award was not granted to him, but rather to Mother Teresa of Calcutta. In his homily of 21 October 1979 Romero expressed his satisfaction and read the telegram of congratulations he had sent to Mother Teresa: «Mother Teresa of Calcutta, India: I am delighted that the Nobel Prize has been bestowed on you for your preferential option for the poor as an effective path toward peace. May those who generously desired a similar honor for me feel equally satisfied for having promoted the same cause. My blessings, the Archbishop». The people in the cathedral broke into loud applause. Romero was satisfied because the Nobel Peace Prize had most definitely been awarded to «the option for the poor», and he wanted the British parliamentarians who had proposed him for the prize to share in the same satisfaction he felt. A little later Romero thought further about the poor. Taking up the appeal made by the Carmelite Sisters on behalf of the women suffering from terminal cancer at the Divina Providencia Hospital, he said, «They still need 290,000 colones». Then he remembered the Nobel Prize: «It’s too bad the Nobel Prize went to India!». If it had come to El Salvador, he imagined, it would have helped toward the construction of a home for the orphans of the sick women. English readers can feel proud of the support their parliamentarians gave to Archbishop Romero, even if he did not win the Nobel Prize.The second thing that comes to mind is the solemn ceremony on 9 July 1998, when ten Christian martyrs of the twentieth century were given a place of honor in Westminster Abbey. Queen Elizabeth II and her consort, Philip, Duke of Edinburgh, accompanied the archbishop of Canterbury, George Carey, and the family members of the martyrs honored in the ceremony. The life-size statue of Archbishop Romero is located in the center, beside that of Martin Luther King. Romero is holding a child in his arms in a way that recalls the words he spoke in his homily of 23 September 1979: «For me it means so much that a child has the confidence to smile at me, embrace me, and even give me a kiss as she leaves the church —it means much more than if I had millions and were repugnant to children!».We Salvadorans are grateful for this poignant gesture of the Church of England. It amounts to an ecumenical Christian canonization of Romero. The more evangelical canonization has already been bestowed on him by the poor in many parts of the world. By their love and gratitude they have proclaimed him brother of Jesus and father of the poor. In this introduction to the English edition of the homilies of Archbishop Romero I want to recall two persons who are no longer with us. Miguel Cavada, who died on 6 February 2011, was the person who knew best the homilies of Romero. With extreme care and precision he elaborated the critical edition of the Spanish text and composed the extremely useful indices. Father Dean Brackley SJ, who died on 16 October 2011, was an enthusiastic promoter of the translation of the homilies into English.The present edition is dedicated to his memory. Archbishop Romero is one of the fathers of the Latin American church. As was the case with the Greek and Latin fathers of antiquity and with Cardinal John Henry Newman more recently, it is important to preserve their words. Only by doing so will their spirits remain alive in many places and endure in the swift currents of time. This is the great merit of the Archbishop Romero Trust, which has taken the initiative in translating the homilies of Romero and promoting his cause with untiring enthusiasm. From El Salvador I want to express to them my profoundest gratitude. And if anyone asks why it is so important to keep Archbishop Romero’s words alive, there is no better answer than the one given by Ignacio Ellacuría at the funeral we celebrated at the Central American University three days after his murder: «With Archbishop Romero God passed through El Salvador».Jon Sobrino SJCelebrating the BeatificationArchbishop Oscar Romero will be beatified on Saturday, 23 May 2015 in San Salvador. Over 260,000 people are expected to attend the celebration which will take place at 10am (5pm BST) in the Plaza Divino Salvador del Mundo in El Salvador's capital on Saturday, 23 May.After Popes John Paul II and Benedict XVI blocked Romero's entry into the sainthood process, Pope Francis's unblocked the cause and declared Romero as Martyr because of his faith, not just his politics. His Beatification will take place on May 23, and speaks about the relationship between what we believe and how we act in the world.

This Project responds to the Second Volume only.Our Goal: Cover Translation expenses of Volume 2From the time Romero was named archbishop of San Salvador on February 22, 1977 until he was murdered at the altar on March 24, 1980, he delivered 193 homilies that were broadcast to the nation by radio. These homilies were later transcribed and published in six volumes in El Salvador. They are an example of human rights speech, as recognized by the United Nations, and represent the struggle and sign of a Church for the Poor as Pope Francis has proposed for the Christian life facing today`s dramas.This volume is the Second in an ambitious initiative to provide English translations of a series of books about the martyred and Blessed Archbishop Oscar Arnulfo Romero. Romero has been attracting a growing interest worldwide because of his prophetic words and his option for the poor, which he faithfully lived out until his assassination at the altar.The present volume is an English translation of the 44 homilies delivered between November 27, 1977, and May 28, 1978, corresponding to the second volume of the original Spanish edition and to Cycle A of the church’s liturgy.Where do the funds go?Your contribution will help us pay the Translation Costs of this second Volume into English, as you can see in the following chart. We have already paid other costs, such as Printing, Copy editing and Design.The relevance and actuality of these WritingsRomero managed to find an extraordinary synthesis between orthodoxy and the way it is practiced, and he exhibited a beautiful blend of deep prayerful spirituality and effective action for justice. Because of these achievements, he has become an increasingly attractive ecclesiastical figure for the twenty-first century and a genuine icon for our skeptical times.The United Nations has recognized him, and the Anglican Communion has virtually canonized him by including him with a special collect prayer in its annual liturgical calendar.As he came to the end of his first year as archbishop of San Salvador, Oscar Romero had a strong presentiment of the rivers of blood that would flow in the years ahead, and he spoke out vigorously against violence in every form. He condemned the killings and kidnappings perpetrated by government troops, death squads, and guerrilla forces, but he deplored as well the “institutionalized violence” of the political and economic structures that ruthlessly oppressed the poor.Romero’s passionate homilies capture the combative spirit of a church trying to restore hope and direction to a country in crisis.The homilies are the impassioned voice of a prophetic pastor addressing his people and his nation at a time of unprecedented crisis and violence. Romero unrelentingly condemns the repression of the people at the hands of the powerful and resolutely commits the Church to the difficult and dangerous struggle for justice and human rights. The homilies offer an unsparing indictment of the harsh political reality of El Salvador but never cease to summon Salvadorans to respond courageously to the Gospel precepts of peace, love, and social equality.Who was Oscar Romero?Oscar Romero, born in Ciudad Barrios, on August 15th 1917, studied theology at the Pontifical Gregorian University in Rome and was ordained priest in 1942.

Hi, I'm Kinetics. This album is the beginning of the rise of an artist, a brand, a development of self sounding entertainment as well as products. I wanted to be called Kinetics because I feel like I can always speak to the listener with instrumental flavor. My rap skills are up to par but the passion was always to create my own sound. Every time I listen to a beat, I feel as if I'm speaking to myself while exerting my own flavor to it, meaning placing words of truth and intuition on a sound so creative that it can never be duplicated, sort of speak. The funding for this project is going to start off at a cool 10,000. Just to see how many people are equally inspired to help create a new sound. I have already started writing a bunch of songs and made a few beats of my own. The funding is for studio assembly, production cost and any other form of advertising. This could be the ground breaking that I ultimately needed to start a passion that I always loved. A greatly help is needed and appreciated. From one fan to the next, from one creator to another, ""love who you are and what you can become"".The project will be created here in Chicago. I'm hoping to raise enough in the future for video equipment, better studio equipment and any other necessity to produce this as well as better Kinetics products.

The plan is to take the audience on a journey through dreams, not knowing if they are awake or asleep, essentially we want the audience to feel hooked and on the edge of their seats, capturing them with risk and question.The journey is of a young boys dream in which he becomes conscious and aware of what is happening around him but still not knowing if he’s awake or dreaming, as the show goes on new characters will be introduced, all with incredible skill sets that will test the possibility of reality and physics, lots of small plots will branch off from the continuous plot but will all meet at the end for the final realisation of the dream world/reality.WHY I AM SEEKING CROWD FUNDINGDue to the current situation with Arts Council having reduced funds it is harder for emerging artists to get funding.We hope that with a number of smaller donations (Add pennies to make a pound) we hope to raise the required funds to develop our concept and to tour with the showWe are not asking for the full amount but donations from many to make our desired goal.WHAT WE WILL DO WITH THE MONEYCreate from scratch a theatre show that will tour the UK and potentially internationally.Hire 14 freelance artistsDesign set, costume, lighting, music and filmHOW MUCH WE NEEDCreation - £60,000HOW MUCH WE ASK OF YOUWe ask for a donation of;What you feel this project is worthWhat you can afford to support this creative concept.WHY DONATE AND WHO BENEFITSJobs for 14 Freelance artists.Schools in each touring city will get workshopsEntertainment for audiences all overThe short term work for the artists if successful will become fulltime.WHAT YOUR MONEY IS PAYING FOR8 Performers5 designers (lighting, film, costume, set, music)Specialist workshop for castSet and equipment (trampoline, scaffolding tower, cyr wheels, crash mats etc.)Costume (Velcro suits, safe footwear etc.)Rehearsal spaceArtists accommodation during creationWHY TRUST ME10 years industry experienceCo-created 5* show that ran for 4 years (The Lock In dance show)Worked in TV, theatre and entertainment industryHave strong contacts in the industry that support my visionTrusted and recommended nationally and internationallyOrganised 18 international level dance competitionsCare about giving back to the communityLINKSIntroduction to lucid dreaminghttp://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lucid_dreamPrevious workhttp://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nE-ygN0UqPEhttp://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KTH3A6rq0NEhttp://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y-vAMDEGvdYhttp://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nAJukxyNZGY","The greatest risk is that potential audiences dont appreciate the concept and therefore do not attend the shows were potential moneys would be gained to fund further shows, however due to my experience and reputation for providing highly creative and exciting works, we would hope this wouldn't be a problem.",https://www.kickstarter.com/projects/849718402/4-elements-of-hip-hop-summer-school?ref=discovery_category_newest,849718402/4-elements-of-hip-hop-summer-school,"We would like to provide Hereford's young community with the opportunity to be educated in the 4 different elements of Hip Hop and enable them to learn these elements in a supported environment. These workshops will be delivered over 5 consecutive days in the summer school holidays and will cover Break Dance, Rap, DJ'ing and Street Art (aka Graffiti). In addition to this they will be provided with an insight into Free Running and Beat boxing, as well as learning how to film and digitally edit a short documentary on the weeks process.Each of the workshops will be taught by professionals who are specialists with years of experience in each of the individual elements.Towards the end of the 5 days the participants will be asked to prioritise one of these elements to focus on. Working together the participants and the workshop facilitators will create a short show in which the participants will be supplying all the entertainment content. The back drop to the show will be the art work created by the participants of the Street Art workshop, the beats and scratching supplied by the participants of the DJ’ing workshop, the vocals by the participants of the Rapping workshop and the participants of the Break Dance workshop will perform a choreographed piece to an open audience.","The biggest risk would be that children don't turn up for the final show when they have been choreographed in at certain times, but as each teacher is highly experienced and trained for many years in their own fields, they will know who the risk children are and how to rework the show if the problem arises."

It's up to you.To put things into perspective I've written a short description for the fictional planet NINU- a broader project I've been researching for some years now and where these weapons seem to fit well as part of the arsenal of a peculiar Order of Librarians and Mercenaries, the infamous Navaan Academy. LafayetteMortimer, as you've probably guessed already, is a fine and respectable member of this ancient order.Located between the Tu and Te meridians, the Republic of Quantum Obscura is the largest political entity on the Continent. Beyond the Northern borders stretches the Armentiers plateau - a huge and unexplored area due to the frequent storms caused by the Anomaly. Towards Nord-West the wild Htu people dwell in caves hidden in complicated fjords. South of the Dogon Archipelago stretches the Apsu Peninsula, the land of the Water Whisperers - the Eyree folk. Beyond the slopes of the Inkunga mountain range, the Bone Bandits dominate the most coveted territories of the Continent - the Graviphoton Mountains.The one entity that needs the Graviphoton ore most happens to be the Republic - sworn enemies of the Bone Bandits for centuries. The only thing keeping the Republic still standing is a fragile contract with the Navaan Academy - a dark Order of Librarians and Mercenaries. This is planet Ninu.

Give steampunk what it deserves!Use the library within an application designed entirely for steampunk enthusiasts - Enter Project Requiem:An app one can use to design a steampunk prop/handgun using a library of pre-modeled objects. The result can be sent to your local 3d printer or to a 3d printing hub online.And achieve something like this:Currently I own a no-name DIY printer - a reliable works-horse, but rather slow (as 3d printers are) and in dire need of proper upgrades to ensure a smooth, continuous printing process. New extruder, new hot-end, a new main-board to access more features slowly becoming common place (wifi, LCD screen etc). Above all, a new, enlarged frame - with enclosure panels to ensure temperature stability. I am half-way trough designing the enclosure, apart from fittings required to hold the main-board, spool and power source.Or...one may suggest to buy a new printer altogether! It all comes down to quality/reliability against cost - if moding a current printer comes cheaper, I'll definitely go for this route.After months and months of fiddling at the lower end of technology and DIY with scrap materials and dubious glue brands trying to put together something I realized that quality doesn't come neither quick - nor cheap.Very early on I discovered that 3d models created in anything other than a CAD environment are notoriously fiddly to print. A simple cube created in Maya prints very different from one made in Fusion 360.So I went ahead and trained myself to use CAD software. There was an immediate improvement in the printing process yet perfectly designed pieces wouldn't fit together right - regardless the level of quality (layer height).I won't get into a lot of detail here - but after many a sleepless nights and grinding of teeth, I managed to print a small collection of prototypes.Needless to say there was a lot of sanding and priming involved. The props look good in pictures - but up-close they lack certain detail and feel DIY-ish.Even after priming and painting the props still look less than ready for prime time.In this first prototypes batch I made, I used a bit of relief paste as well. Ideally, those details should've been part of the model but, let's remember the tools I have.This small armoury was on display at Oxford Comic Con last year.Tank Girl using my Cloud 9 Handgun- Model -Verity Millett.Verity Millet and Jon Campling (King Regis, Final Fantasy) fooling about at Oxford Comic Con last year.This is the first prototype I finished - Bad Larry One.

I began to design my Mooncalf toys. Now, I want to bring these milkshakes of cute and creepy to life. This small start out budget would give me a chance to make my dreams come true.","This budget is bare bones, so I will be using some of my own money for supplies as well.

My name is Kaff and about a year ago I came up with a cute and creepy design for some figures. They began to get backstories, and a place of their own and Murky Noggins took shape. A friend came to me one day and offered to write me a theme song if I was inclined to make an animation. He came back with a great song and i began to design a world, a life after death. Something sassy,creepy and sweet. something for all the grown up Halloween fanboys and fangirls. I want to dedicate myself full time to making this world, and i do need a few items of equipment...a better chair for my studio, money to pay voice actors, and to buy music. Thank you for your time, and I do hope you can help me make this a real thing.","Yes, there are risks with anything. I’d like to have this 30 min animation done before Halloween. Yes, that could get pushed back a week or two... life does happen. Making figures also takes time, as does making shirts and drawing.

The art style was created by a developing manga artist who goes by Ghost. We've worked on the Chronicles of Kisoné series for about 9 years now and it has went through many changes, such as design, story, even down to dialogue. However, we did it for you, the readers and soon, the bingers. The book has become popular enough for an animated adaption with me, the author, making sure you have the fresh experience you're craving.The funds are being used mostly for paying people to push this project to fruition. I hired a team of professional screenwriters drafting the script right now for approval. As professions go, they need to be paid since they're working so hard for all of you, not just me. The rest of the funds are for a film agent to pitch the animation to major film companies on our behalf. The plan is already in motion, it's just behind a paywall. Yet, despite that, I'm willing to break my bank if it means you get an opportunity to be part of history.The story is about a teenager trying to survive his sophomore year of high school and all the angst that comes with it. I'm sure you've seen it before since most anime protagonist are high schoolers. Even though Kisoné is the main protagonist, the real stars are the women he surrounds himself with:The story takes place in Vanitia; a supercontinent formed by the King of Gods who named it after his wife Valencia. Kisoné meets many different (read eccentric) characters throughout his journey. the characters themselves were tailored to be mostly relatable (one's a demon for God's sake) so that the audience can see themselves in a character. Yet, there is an alternate story taking place in the background that we challenge you, the audience to figure out before it's too late.",The biggest potential risk is the budgeting. Of course we have the coronavirus thing going on so that may or may not delay the process. The only other risk known to me right now is simply getting a no for the companies.,https://www.kickstarter.com/projects/433345164/the-chronicles-of-kisone-school-days-trailer?ref=discovery_category_newest,433345164/the-chronicles-of-kisone-school-days-trailer,"Kisoné Hoshigaki here bringing you some sweet news!

It would ruin the fun. She's a closet nerd who loves video games and D&D.Amelia Kims: She doesn't show up until later, but according to her, she's part of race called Espers. Could there be more to it than that? Especially that attitude!My parents Kagumi and Tsuyoshi Hoshigaki: My mom has a weird obsession with wearing kimonos.

Just look at that face! I look just like her don't I? And then there's my dad.

We are working on the Compassinate Rebel intro. The one we had was to long and would not unload. Thank you for your understanding and your financail support. Another video coming soon.The title of our project is Compassionate Rebel On the Move, No More Giving Up. We created this project because we feel a need to expand the message ofH.O.P.E (HearingOther Peoples Experiences) to communities around the world via storytelling , music and film.In these desperate times, many people are hungry for reasons to have hope and find solutions to problems in society and in their own lives.. Some have given up finding the solutions they seek. What many people don't realize is that the answer lies within them. They just need to know how to find it and share it with others. There are rapidly growing numbers of people in our communities and around the world who are discovering the power they have within them to make change and the desire to tell that story to whomever will listen. These are the compassionate rebels on the move. It's been said that ""whomever tells the stories defines the culture."" Stories define and transform us individually and communally. Throughout history, the art of storytelling in many forms has been used to entertain and inform, but also as a tool for networking, and for creating social changemovements and life-changing experiences. Our project is based on the stories in two books published by award-winning Minneapolis author Burt Berlowe and other contributors. The first of those: The Compassionate Rebel; Energized by Anger, Motivated by Love was published in 2003. The current sequel published this year is The Compassionate Rebel Revolution:Ordinary People Changing the World. Together, they contain over 100 inspiring and hopeful personal stories of everyday heroes in Minnesota and around the world who have turned their anger into positive change, who have combined caring and courage to make a difference in society, and who have told or are yearning to tell their stories publicly for the first time. They are powerful examples of how to use storytelling as a way to give voice and hope to ordinary people and to promote meaningful and lasting social change. In times like these when we are constantly saturated with negative news that make so many of us feel hopeless, we need positive and hopeful stories like those told by compassionate rebels.We believe thatIt will give people in communities the tools necessary to find and tell their own stories and to grow the compassionate rebel revolution which is the largest and most diverse social change movement in history. By turning these stories into short documentary film clips we can assure that people in Minnesota and around the world will have the information that they may not otherwise have available to them to do something positive within their own communities.Since the publication of the two books, featuredstorytellers have toured the Twin Cities with the author, telling their stories in person to receptive audiences in churches, bookstores and other community venues. Even as those appearances continue, we want to expand the potential audience by turning several stories into a documentary film that would be shown widely as a partner to the books. We would videotape those artists during their presentations and in separate interviews, re-enactments and combine it with existing footage to complete a compelling one -hour movie that will be shown at various venues in combination with live appearances by the featured compassionate rebels as a supplement to or alternative to reading the books. The soundtrack for the movie will include songs from an existing compassionate rebel CD.Independent filmmaker Donald (DJ) Jackson of PoorNoMore productions will produce the video in partnership with Burt Berlowe (the author of the two compassionate rebel books), local recording artist Chantel SingS and guest rebels on a live performance tour to Minnesota communities The video will also be made available on the author's and producer's websites as well as on UTube and other internet sites. People will be able to obtain the film with or without the books and show it in their own communities. After meeting expenses, proceeds will go to help Poor No More make more films creating at movement to createand provide jobs for people seeking to work in the film industry. Project PersonnelBurt Berlowe, Minneapolis journalist, author and activist.

You can see some of hiswork on his website www.poornomore2008.comProject DetailsCompassionate Rebels on the Move, a live venue being documented by Burt Berlowe and Donald Jackson will do agreat deal to promote storytelling as an art form and educate and grow audiences whowill recognize and appreciate quality storytelling. It will teach participants how to create and share their own stories and build community and social connections. Our artistic goals would be to attract people of all ages to attend and participate, including actors, production personnel and other artists we would hire from the affected communities, as well as audience members who would benefit from the storytelling experience. We will work in partnership with community businesses, organizations and community centers who will host, sponsor and/or otherwise support this project. It currently has the support of the Independent Film Board, among others.All of our sessions will be free and open to the public We will assure that any of our events will beeasy to find and centrally located. We will accommodate the expected audience through handicapped access when necessary and through diverse forms of community outreach and education. A written evaluation will be handed out at each event and results posted on our website which will also have shared feedback from participants..We will complete this project when we meet our goal of raising the funds needed with your support we will begin inFebruary,2012 and complete byAugust 2012. How the funds will be used. With the high unemployment rate in our state and country, our goal is to also employ as many people as possible. We would pay a film crew and compensate the storytellers and actors. We would use funds to print announcements, to secure locations and musical artists. We will distribute printed information announcing the events and location where the Compassionate Rebels on the Move will be. Social media networking will be a support through a text, email campaign. We will publicize these sessions through internet, calendar listing, press releases and website presents.We are looking to fund as much as we can through book and CD sales as we go forward, but that would only cover a portion of the project. We appreciate your funding of this project at whatever level you can offer.. We'll keep updating the project site so you can see progress and how the people involved feel about this project and how it can make a difference in the world,TAX Deductable DonationsIf you would like your contribution of $50 or more to be tax deductible, please select ""NO REWARDS"" when you back this project and you will receive a formal thank you letter from the non-profit group sponsoring this project that should serve as your tax receipt for your donation.Contributions in support of this project are payable to Radio Bendiction a 501(c)(3) public charity, and, to the extent permitted by law, are tax deductible for U.S. taxpayers, less the value of any goods or services received.Mobilizing Community Anyone can listen to, and tell a story. But we want to take that a big step further, using stories as a way to mobilize and empower individuals and communities to take action to create the change they believe in, Through the experiences of our featured rebels, this project is a model for sharing stories and improving lives, for recognizing and utilizing the compassionate rebel that lives in everyone, and for growing the compassionate rebel movement for generations to come. In order to transform communities you most inform and educate youth and adults of solutions. We know about the problem, but only when we can provide resources and direction, only then, can we change people's ways of seeing and doing better things for their neighborhoods.Collaborating storytellers will not be hard to find as the books give us ample numbers of people to pick from..Donald Jackson will be one of the first storytellers.Visualize ChangeThe documentary film will be an actual way to ""visualize change"" on the screen as it is happening in real life situations. The project will give participants the unique opportunity to visualize change in their own lives and communities and how they can bring it about.

This project touches the heart string of every person who have followed their dream and may have fallen short, so I can say I’m one of you.","This has been a labor of love for Donald, and he is now ready to share it with the world. Assuming that this projects is funded I have answered what are the risk and challenges.    RISK: Prior to posting the request for $4,500, estimations from various professional organizations (such as Copycat printing, and i have quotes) were requested by by Donald which developed a budget for this project. The only risk here is that the estimations used to develop the budgets for the production of the CD master, poster prints and packaging, are not accurate or are misleading, which could result in costs that exceed or be less then the amount requested.     RESOLUTION: The CD will be reduced in the number of songs, production quantities, or amount of full color pages vs black and white. The quantity of CD's produced, even at the printer's production minimum, will exceed the demand posed by Copycat and Kickstarter donors, making it possible for Donald to sell the CD's - printed with the kickstarter money - beyond the time frame of the Kickstarter fundraiser.     RISK: Because all of the Donald start-up costs are paid for by my full-time employment position as a independent Museum creator at the Minnesota Musician Museum Wall, the security of the project is dependent upon my ability to maintain 40 hours of work every week until Donald is able to turn a profit.    RESOLUTION: The solution is to produce revenue generating programs within the promotions that will help gain additional money if needed. The programs include: a fee based release party (fee based until Donald sources of funding to make it free in months to come), and the exhibition CD sales to exceed the $4,500 raised through Kickstarter will dramatically increase Donald's ability to gain financial independence.     RISK: Mismanagement. It is possible that because I work 40 hours per week in the museum a week, despite that, I assure you that I will work harder to complete this project, I have brought inspiring and successful professional people to assist me, they have also energized hundreds of people already. I will continue to produce these installations, events and happenings unless the power of God see this is not what is in his plan for this me.     RESOLUTION: Donate to Donald project Keep on keeping onPlease contribute whatever you can and feel good about supporting the arts, and more specifically, independent artists. Because Donald isn't on a label, he has no entity behind him, thus his friends, family, and fans have this incredible opportunity to serve as his catalyst to the world."

Demby SwansonTHE PLOT: A strong, bitter comedy about women scorned in Minnesota and the really, really nice gangsters—Norwegian hit men—they hire to whack their ex-boyfriends. Olive is a transplant from Texas and Betty is a transplant from Kentucky, but neither of them was prepared for the Norwegian men they would fall in love with there: the practical, warm, thoughtful, destructive, evil, jilting kind. If you're a hit man in Minnesota, 83% of your clients want to take out their ex (oofda!). Betty has referred Olive to Gus and Tor, a partnership in the whacking business. What Tor doesn't know is that Gus has been sleeping with the clients. What Olive doesn't know is that Gus is Betty's own ex, and she has already put out a hit on him with a Swiss firm. Can Betty call off the job in time to let Gus do his? Should she?WHAT THE CRITICS SAID: “The Norwegians,” C. Denby Swanson’s extremely odd and delightful comedy, is something of a guilty pleasure.”   Anita Gates, NY Times“It is brilliant largely because it takes place in Minnesota — the same frigid, isolated Minnesota that gave Garrison Keillor’s “A Prairie Home Companion” its quaint homegrown charm and the Coen brothers’ “Fargo” the quirky cultural context necessary to turn cold-blooded murder into dark comedy. “The Norwegians is loaded with charm and layered with delicious dark comedy, but it is particularly quirky and outrageously funny because the Minnesota hit men are Norwegian.”   News-Herald (Cleveland)“If  C. Denby Swanson’s The Norwegians was a food, it would be a chocolate mousse. It is a darkly delicious black comedy about two spurned women in Minnesota who consider hiring Norwegian professionals to kill the lovers who jilted them. Yet despite the murderous subject, it has an entertaining lightness that leads to frequent and yummy laughter.”   DC Theatre Scene","The production of a touring show is guaranteed to present problems that must be dealt with on a daily basis and you must anticipate these problems and deal with them swiftly so your mind can be clear to deal with those you cannot anticipate. These problems generally center around issues of balancing the needs of the individual venues with the needs of the production. The key to dealing with these issues is communication in the early stages of booking and having a clear contract that spells out the needs of the production. Occasionally, personality conflicts arise in production, but hiring well can eliminate 99% of these issues.Using Kickstarter to raise funds for the production also helps to solve a problem for the non-profit venues we will play. By raising the pre-production funds in this manner, we are able to offer the show to the venues at a significantly lower guarantee than if we had to recoup our start-up costs from the venues.

Once baked, it will melt in your mouth, giving you a wonderful experience leaving you reaching out for more!My Story:When I was 11 in 1978, I was known for baking very delicious chocolate chip cookies at my young age. Once baked, the cookies was like a Chocolate Chip Cookie dream, especially if you had it with ice cold milk or with vanilla ice-cream. Everyone that tasted my cookies loved them, and always told me I should sell them!Over the years I wanted to develop the same great taste as I remembered as a young boy growing up in the 70’s. In the early 90’s, I finally developed the same great taste as I remembered as a young boy, a true old-fashion chocolate chip cookie. It is so delicious that you can just eat the cookie dough by itself and/or bake it in the oven.I don’t claim to have the BEST EVER tasting cookies, but what I’ve learned in 41 years is that if a chocolate chip cookie dough has the right ingredients, color, and taste, the “Baked” cookies will be even more AWESOME!My Business Project Plan:I am seeking to sell my cookie dough on-line direct to consumers and through retail outlets. This will require purchasing the ingredients, getting insurance, obtaining a co-packer, buying packaging, and covering shipping cost.My Dream:I really do believe that a person is successful in what he or she loves to do. I love making good tasting chocolate chip cookies and I want to give families that fun and wonderful experience of baking these delicious cookies at home. With your help, we can finally spread the word, “Say Yes, If You LOVE Chocolate Chip Cookies”!",I believe my risks are low because my plan is simple.  I'm producing cookie dough for people to experience warm delicious homemade chocolate chip cookies from their own ovens.  They don't have to shop for the ingredients or worry about measurements because everything is already prepared.  One of the challenges I face is that I have other competitors that make chocolate chip cookie dough.  However the taste was too commercial and lacks that homemade flavor.  I overcame this challenge by sourcing the right ingredients and coming up with a system and method for mixing the ingredients together.  This makes my cookie dough stand out from other competitors.Another challenge I face is producing the cookie dough in mass quantity.  My plan is to seek out a reliable co-packer that can deliver the quality and quantity needed on time.,https://www.kickstarter.com/projects/chocolatechipcookies/rodneys-chocolate-chip-cookies?ref=discovery_category_newest,chocolatechipcookies/rodneys-chocolate-chip-cookies,"My Story:For over 40 years, I was known for baking very delicious chocolate chip cookies at my young age.

I combined old videos I had done with friends in order to make a new short film. I doctored it up but you can only shine a turd so much. This is only so I have something to present to backers and others to show that I do have the drive to do this. Once I have enough money I can present a better product and make my dream come true. Thanks for taking the time to visit the link and watching The Lost and please enjoy..https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gNFagUHNxboWHAT IS THIS?I'm raising money for our new horror/psychological thriller film, the Damaged Four!WITH MUSIC FROM DANE GEROUS SCHIDMTThe musical score will be by Dane Schmidt from GerbilHamster Records. Check out his music to get a taste of what ear candy you will hear in the Damaged Four.https://soundcloud.com/gerbilhamster-records/blank-space-aidsWHATS IT ABOUT?Meet the Faceless. He wants to change the world with old-fashioned, vigilante justice, but instead of being the hero he has chosen a life of crime, he's a serial killer. He has trapped four individuals with no way out: a small storage unit is their prison. One by one they are murdered, and before they die find the truth about each other. This is not only a fight for survival but its character driven and deals with the human condition.WHAT WILL MY MONEY GO TOWARDS?We are still looking for more actors. The money I will need for this project will go towards camera, boom mic and other Indy film gear. Also the money would go towards the showings, t-shirts, posters, locations, casting, actors, music and Dvds.The Damaged Four is a psychological thriller that will use practical effects. Practical effects are a big thing for me when making any kind of project. It brings a realism that most films seem to lose in the mainstream. As for the rest of it, I want to give you the gift of remembering old films from the ‘70s: I'm wanting to appeal to your nostalgia. I really want to take inspiration from the classic B-Movie genre in order to bring you a new classic that will keep you coming back. Your money will go towards all of this.This film will mess with your mind. It will place you in the heads of four unsuspecting characters. A dirty cop named Steve Carol, an uncaring psychiatrist by the name of Sigmond Young, a rapist named Hewlett De'llancy and a strong female lead by the name of Jessica Perry.the Damaged Four will be put together by people coming over from the film Hungry Eyes, a film known throughout Indiana and has been featured in several news papers such as the Kokomo Perspective, Pharos and Kokomo Tribune. It also was Best Horror Feature at the 2015 IUK theater. Hungry Eyes is now currently showing at the Logansport Mary Max theater. Its trailers are showing before mainstream features. Trust me when I say that the Damaged Four will be just as great if not better. Your money will be in good hands.I FEEL LIKE YOUR GIVING ME TOO MUCH. DID YOU JUST SPOIL THE WHOLE THING FOR ME?One by one they are murdered by the killer. Jessica must save herself and the others. You are not hearing the whole story, trust me.

He loves the spirit of other 'cinematic universes & hopes to breathe new life into the genre, making a fresh horror as a whole, giving viewers an interwoven story line, strong characters, and an overall style that constantly keeps you on the edge of your seat.DO YOU HAVE ANY EXPERIENCE?Other than youtube and the occasional directing and writing of short films with my friends. Professionally I am now in the process of creating two animations with my company JayWorks and in association with Romancon Animation Studios BRUCE and A Little Red.I am also in the process of working on a 1940's style noir audio drama thats also a ghost story called Shadow Noir.I have also acted as Fezziwig in a presentation of A Christmas Carol as well as in a film called Hungry Eyes.IS THE DAMAGED FOUR A HORROR FILM I CAN TAKE MY MOTHER AND EVERYONE ELSE TO?Of course it will be, it's written with everyone in mind.

Just the task can freeze many talented artists, overwhelming them from moving on. Every day on set is a battle of fatigue, inspiration, and resources. In this case, I'm doing something I have never done before. Am I up to the challenge? YES!Like most films, there’s a lot of bad things that could go wrong during production. A location might not work, an actor might quit on us or I could decide to take a vacation and fly off to Never, Never Land.My point is, 'Sith' happen.Sometimes, we can't do anything about it. What if an outdoor location gets flooded. Since we’ll be filming this in a storage unit, water might seep in. There might be a possibility that we all freeze. So I will provide you with a list of problems we may be facing. This way I ensure that you know that this is my first time but I have a good head on my shoulders.Have a question? If the info below doesn't help, you can ask me directly on Facebook,  just PM and I will answer you to the best of my ability.1. One of the many risks and challenges I may face is staring at me right now. No backers. Everyday I check my Kickstarter page and am greeted by the number zero. It's disconcerting and horrifying to know that no matter how hard you work you may never make it in life and will be a nobody till the day you die. I am hoping I can rectify this and gain some backers.  2. The delivery date listed on this project is simply an estimate. The creative process of creating something can be very fluid and easily leads to delays. Add this to the fact that your dealing with a human being, one of the creative types who has not done this before, so I see how it is important to be upfront about the potential for delay.3. Another risk posed would be by you, the backer. If you have changed addresses or incorrectly input the address. Through no fault of the creator, a copy of the product may be shipped to the wrong place. Requiring an extra payment for reshipping. Often, a backer forgets about a project that they have backed, particularly when that project is delayed.4. The reality is that most people will see $5,000 as only a drop in the bucket for making a feature-length film. People have mentioned that Clerks had a budget of only $25,000 and that was an incredibly small budget for a film of its length. The reality is that some consider my expectations to be incredibly unrealistic. They are blind and closed minded, thinking that I wasn't making a good case for why I needed the funding. But the fact of the matter is I love to create, the reality is that I live for creation and thats my case. It's also a very good one.5. Like I had said in the first risk and challenges. I haven't actually gotten any donations yet. None at all. This means that others have similar concerns, but nobody else has the courage to tell me how to improve.6. There are tons of active film/video projects on Kickstarter which I am in direct competition with.7. Again, people are blind and closed minded, not realising that this will be a low-budget Indy film. I have heard from others that most of the video projects are asking for more money. Even for short films. That's because you can't do a feature-length film for $5000. I say you can and I have broken down the items to prove it. They say that even if all of your actors work for free it would be a bad deal for them and I say not unless you enjoy what you are doing.8. Some can't pay through Kickstarter to fund my project because they use Paypal and for some reason Kickstarter won't allow Paypal which will exclude half of my clients.9. In my opinion backers already should have some idea about a project creator’s ability to deliver. Examining a project creator’s bio as well as whatever material a creator has shared on the Kickstarter page. It makes no sense for someone to have to post risks and challenges when they don't always know what the future holds for their products. You have no way of telling and even people in Hollywood who have been doing this stuff for years face many problems they didn't know would happen and they are the pros. The risk and challenge that this brings to the creator is what if they leave something out?.. Well, you really have no way of knowing that until you cross the bridge. Great things don't happen without taking risks. 10. People don't like taking risks. Especially with a nobody just starting. They don't want to put money into something that may fail. Again, nothing happens when you don't take risks. Some cult classics and great films didn't become cult classics or great until years later. They took risks. George Lucas had others laughing at his idea for Star Wars and then it became big. The risks and challenges I face are that very same thing that Mister George Lucas and many others faced, rejection and ridicule.11. Just shooting a movie is a great challenge alone, but since I have people coming over from a previous film I was in called Hungry Eyes it shouldn't be as big of a problem, there isn't any risk of the project not being done but it still may take some time. In other words, I already have a story coordinator and creative consultant coming from the other film, four actors, plus acting experience. 12. Recording a score, sound design and mixing, getting the DVDs, T-shirts, additional actors and makeup. Again, the biggest problem is just having to reach my funding goal. The real hurdle is getting the word out about the kickstarter, since I've been sharing and posting every day, and with your help, we'll be able to do a lot more that will make this project awesome. So share, back me and help me make this a success. Take the risk!..",https://www.kickstarter.com/projects/2059029964/the-damaged-four-trapped-by-love?ref=discovery_category_newest,2059029964/the-damaged-four-trapped-by-love,"We’re looking for $4,694 to help create this film.

Jessica Perry lives with her boyfriend until one night she goes to bed only to wake up in a storage unit with three other men. However, the girl's life is turned upside down when she and the others in the room begin to piece the puzzle together.  Jessica is shocked by the revelation that they may have been captured by the local serial killer. Certain that her and the others are in danger, she ends up fighting for her life as they do the same.However, when Garrace Walkers, the local serial killer's true identity is found out by the others, Jessica is forced to defend herself against the group.WHAT WILL THE FUNDING BE USED FORBelow is how much funding I need and what it's going to go towards: A camera (Canon XA20 Professional Camcorder) $1,749.00On Stage MBP7000 Handheld Boom Pole $37.97Audio-Technica ATR-6550 Video Camera Condenser Shotgun Boom-Mic $55.56$700 for the showing locations ??? casting UnspecifedWHAT ARE YOU SHOWING ME HEREShadow Noir will be an Audio Drama.

The reality is that some consider my expectations to be incredibly unrealistic. They are blind and closed minded, thinking that I wasn't making a good case for why I needed the funding. But the fact of the matter is I love to create, im good at it, this isn't much to ask for in comparison to what others will ask to do such a project so it's cheap and won't wreck your wallet. The reality is that I live for creation and thats my case. It's also a very good one.5. There are tons of active film/video projects on Kickstarter which I am in direct competition with.6. Some can't pay through Kickstarter to fund my project because they use Paypal and for some reason Kickstarter won't allow Paypal which will exclude half of my clients.7. In my opinion backers already should have some idea about a project creator’s ability to deliver. Examining a project creator’s bio as well as whatever material a creator has shared on the Kickstarter page. It makes no sense for someone to have to post risks and challenges when they don't always know what the future holds for their products. You have no way of telling and even people in Hollywood who have been doing this stuff for years face many problems they didn't know would happen. The risk and challenge that this brings to the creator is what if they leave something out?.. Well, you really have no way of knowing that until you cross the bridge. Great things don't happen without taking risks.8. People don't like taking risks. Especially with a nobody just starting. They don't want to put money into something that may fail. Again, nothing happens when you don't take risks. Some cult classics and great films didn't become cult classics or great until years later. They took risks. George Lucas had others laughing at his idea for Star Wars and then it became big. The risks and challenges I face are that very same thing that Mister George Lucas and many others faced, rejection and ridicule.9. Just shooting a movie is a great challenge alone, but since I have people coming over from a previous film I was in called Hungry Eyes it shouldn't be as big of a problem, there isn't any risk of the project not being done but it still may take some time. In other words, I already have a story coordinator and creative consultant coming from the other film, four actors, plus acting experience.Again, the biggest problem is just having to reach my funding goal. The real hurdle is getting the word out about the kickstarter, since I've been sharing and posting every day, and with your help, we'll be able to do a lot more that will make this project awesome. So share, back me and help me make this a success. Take the risk!.."

The funds will be used to present two “viewings” of the performance for the public for the continuance of the viability to offer performances as a troupe to students, colleges, and educational institution audiences nationwide.  “The Lion of Time” is primarily a fantasy story interlaced with history that introduces the audience to our main character, the “Princess of Time” who through ballet (accompanied by her daughter), reveals, portrays, and interacts with real and famous people of the past. These people have all demonstrated timeless love and courage in their lives. In this first story, the “Dying Lion” character that the Princess interacts with is the persona of the brave men of the Swiss Guard who were sworn to protect the King of France when the Revolution of 1792 began.

After my nephew was born, I decided that I needed to do more in my life, at least for him. I decided after 4 long years to go to college.

I was told that my poetry is inspiring, heart felt, and makes you think. I want to share my work with more people by getting it published.

I was born and raised in the Boston area until I was 13 when my mother, two siblings, and I moved to a small suburban city 30 miles north of Boston called Newburyport. After graduating from Newburyport High School in 2007, I decided that college was not for me, and joined the work force. I was working as a street vender in Boston for a few years. After my nephew was born, I decided that I needed to do more in my life, at least for him. I decided after four long years to go to college. I am currently in my second year of college at Husson University in Bangor, Maine. I will be transferring next semester to a school in Concord, NH in order to be closer to family.My name is Matthew Stasio, and I write free verse poetry. I have been doing this since I was about 16. It has always been a safe outlet for me to express myself. I have never shared my work with anyone up until a couple years ago. The feedback I received was great. I was told that my poetry is inspiring, heart felt, and makes you think. I want to share my work with more people by getting it published.

https://www.kickstarter.com/projects/381388015/saints-and-slayers?ref=discovery_category_newest,381388015/saints-and-slayers,"This story takes place on our lovely little planet earth, 2044. The sun grows dimmer each day and is developing solid mass upon the surface . After the fall of the cyber era and most computer technology fails to serve its purpose people were forced to be self reliant once more while struggling to survive through harsh and unforgiving conditions. Artemis, young college graduate and protagonist, must find a way to restore balance to earth, end the ongoing war and save what's left of humanity. I have more than 22 storyboards ready to animate and a 215 pages of script. that's where the people of this lovely world come in. I'm searching for quality equipment as well as semi-experienced individuals who have worked with animation, film production and/ or voice acting capabilities. Your funding will go toward animating, editing and producing while making a life long dream and loving tribute to many lost loved ones finally come true, as well as compensating any volunteers and handling equipment fees. I'd also like to hold a personal screening of the finished product in a public setting. So to summarize, Your funding will go toward a wonderful staff of artists (voice actors, animators, musicians, etc.) bringing this work of art to life. Thank you and best wishes to all.","Now for the risks, as far as funding. Since kickstarter is an all-or-nothing campaign site we must reach our funding goal otherwise the project cannot be properly funded and we will have no way of completing it, the 400+ jobs we provide during the time of this project, everything will have to be shut down and the volunteers won't be properly compensated for their time. Please help us make this project possible, thank you.",https://www.kickstarter.com/projects/381388015/saints-and-slayers-the-experience?ref=discovery_category_newest,381388015/saints-and-slayers-the-experience,"Saints and Slayers is an depth look at a post apocalyptic world mainly through the eyes of three individuals who've spent their entire lives together, graduated college and must apply their knowledge to saving the rest of humanity. Rather than zombies and supernatural abilities the protagonists Artemis, Saint, and Rebecca must use strategy, creativity and ingenuity to achieve their goal. As for creative flare I've written several diaries in the perspectives of the protagonists to help the viewers understand the characters on an intellectual level.I feel developing an understanding of the character and how the think, act, and feel will give the audience a chance to walk in their shoes.This project will display my different art styles such as sculpting, Acrylic/oilpainting, drawing/ sketching , Writing ( novel writing, Screenwriting) and possibly sewing. This is a continued work of mine which I've been unable to finish due to a lack of supplies and capital. If everyone could just donate at lest $5 to the campaign we can reach our goal in no time at all! Just $5 per person and We will not accomplish our goal but we will finally be able to open this experience to the world!Story / Concept.The concept is based 30-40 years into the future. Computer technology is at its peak and humans are becoming more and more dependant. After years of wear, tear, and abuse the main systems begin to fail. Since most of the world has become dependent of technologymostanolog or primative methods of livingand preserving information were never passed down to any of the newer generations.Their weren't many libraries or books anywhere. All information had been digitzed and uploaded to the main computer or AVA, in the center of their capital city. AVA's system fails the city and most of the world's power supplyhas beendepleted. The civilians panic, reeking havoc across the city and across the world.Covac Grandova, a terrorist leader and antagonizing force, tries to take advantage of the citizens, convincing them to follow him by supplying them with temporary power. Once the temporary source was empty Covac would return tothe citizenswith a list of demands. If the demands weren't met Covac would retrieve the empty power vessel and destroy thecivilians' homes.The Experience/ ExhibitThroughout the story/ exhibit their will be gadgets, mechanisms,an array oftools used by the characters while they explore vast mountains, bunkers, and ruins. Each of these artifacts will be crafted by me, some of the tools used in their adventures will be actual working models, routinely checked and tethered to a display table, which viewers can hold and examine. The characters' clothing will also beon display and viewers are free to touch the clothing.The gallerydesign as well as painting, all done by myself. Now for the execution: I'd like to assemble the display myself but lack the resourcess necessary for completing the project. If possible I will need a studio or gallery space of 1200sq. feet with at least 6 projectors for added visual effect and interchangeable enviornmets/settings, mannequins for displaying clothing, some small gadgets and their position on the body, small display tables placed in unique areas of the gallery for displaying the diaries, scripts and novels with printed summaries. I also need canvases ranging from 12x16"" to 18x24"" with frames, acrylic paint, new paint brushes ( ranging from 3mm-3in.), and a variety of fabric to finish the character's clothing. As a bonus and to show support to other artist or service providers I will use a portionof the funding to purchase service from fiverr! That means $5 per service, and about 100- 500offered services , that's $500-2500! If we receive $5 dollars from everyone , this will only be a small portion of our costs.The display shall start with the system failure,Each of the projectors shall face a certain wall, building an entire surrounding area of virtual atmosphere. With each location in the story, there will be projected images of the location in full color. For the first dispIay I will have a sculpted scale model of the city before and after the crisis to give viewers a visual example of the aftermath. The second exhibit will contain the small gadgets, diaries of the protagonist and the Antagonist with listening stations. The final portion of the Exhibit will have the original first drafts of the entire project from paintings to literature and any remaining costumes for the characters.At this time I'm asking for at least $5,000-$10,000 which will go toward gallery rental fees, product rental fees (projectors, tables, mannequins, display case rental), supplies such as canvases ranging from 12x16"" to 18x24"" with frames, acrylic paint, paint brushes ( ranging from 3mm-3in.), armature wire, variety of fabric to finish the character's clothing, Moving services, plasteline, plastor of paris, and alginate silicone rubberfor sculting. If my project is over fundedI'd like to contribute a small portion to a fellow artist in need. If we can make things happen for my campaign, why not help someone else along the way, Sharing the love is always a major way to say thank you. Thank you all for your contributions, your time, everything. Thank you for even considering my project.I wish you all the bestand thanks again.","Since this campaign is all or nothing I don't want to make a single mistake have a single delay, to prevent any delays or mishaps I will schedule the even at a later date, keep constant check on venue, supplies, and any information necessary for success. I've had Two exhibits at the National Arts Club, Gramercy park south, Personal display in public setting with 12 major sales. If This project succeeds it will mean a new life for me and my family, a new beginning for those who volunteered the time, working hours on end to help spread the word, voice acting, having weekly meetings, sharing what information they could, all for the sake success."

Starting with music and arts, then evolving into interviews, events and politics.In 2016, the magazine has moved away from local entertainment to taking a more serious role. Changes have included free advertising contests to support local charities and helping people (homeless / animal shelters / etc.) Focusing more on community based articles (weather coverage / articles on the homeless / etc) is now more of a priority.The magazine still covers the Lehigh Valley in the form of local business reviews and select events.After seriously looking at the magazine between Christmas and New Year, it was decided time to expand into covering other locations. This decision was also based on statistics from the website and social media. A majority of the audience is outside of the Lehigh Valley.A Valley and Beyond is on the street level. Meaning, a majority of the articles are video and done while walking the street. The articles are uncut and unedited. This has been a very popular approach, the true ""reality"" version.Starting in April 2016, the magazine plans to travel to major cities including Philadelphia / New York / Atlanta and the West Coast. A priority is to do an article on the homeless in a major city and compare it to the Lehigh Valley. With hopes of sparking some ideas to help in both situations.For the magazine to continue, new technology is also required. Currently, the magazine operates on an older computer and low end Android phone. Another area the magazine has expanded into is reviews of apps, software, and video games. In today's on the go, high tech world, this is something everyone can use.As you can see, the expansion does require finances. The 2 main goals of A Valley and Beyond online magazine will be as follows:1) To provide the best, possible experience for everyone. This is accomplished through a weekly variety of content. Also through the true ""on the street"" level articles.2) To continue to make a difference in local areas, people's lives and our world. This is accomplished through articles in a wide variety of topics and interviews with people.One of the series the magazine is most proud of is a series on the homeless from living it. Honestly, at times, the founder has lived on the street while continuing the magazine.","The biggest challenge since the start of the magazine has been raising advertising and sponsors. Expansion and covering topics in major cities will show the magazine is a very solid and serious online publication that can handle major events. Another goal is to attract the attention of major media in these cities. With the long term goal of co-operating with them. Stories will be submitted to their departments.As the owner and basically entire staff, any other problems / challenges can be overcome. These may include: travel delays, dangers in pursuing some articles (the homeless in major cities), etc. To make a difference in this world, every risk and challenge is worth it.",https://www.kickstarter.com/projects/290352211/a-valley-and-beyond-evolution?ref=discovery_category_newest,290352211/a-valley-and-beyond-evolution,"A Valley and Beyond is on the street level.

The majority of the funds would cover the cost of traveling to the cities, in which the castles are. I will be residing in Japan from the end of February until the end of May, and the castles are each 3.5-5 hours from where I will be staying. Traveling will be by Bullet Train and by airplane.The remainder of the funds would cover production cost of 20-30 page Hard Cover books, and prints for rewards. My second goal will be to secure publication for my book, so that many others would be able to enjoy the moments and places I capture.I will create and post weekly video blogs to be shared through YouTube.*My minimum fundraising goal of $6,000 does not include traveling and lodging within those cities, so I hope that this goal will be exceeded.*The video is of my photography captures taken during the Jade Buddha For Universal Peace World Tour ceremony event held in Memphis, Tennessee at Quan Am Monastery.","The availability of funds will greatly affect the successful completion of my project.

This has become known as ""The Hero's Journey"". Something about it is innate to Human Beings across all generations. The story always starts off in ""The Ordinary World"", and the Hero has to have a ""Call to Adventure"" to ""The Special World"".There are certain events that take place that the hero goes through to come back home a new person. These Story telling templates are no different from what goes on in real life when a person has to go to the special world to return home with ""The Elixir"". My travels over the past year as of June 2016 have led me to a very new and interesting road. I did not know that it would lead to where I am now. I am actually excited I have a platform in which to tell this story that has been developing in my life for this past year.So, The Journey started in June of 2016. I booked a plane ticket to Cartagena, Colombia because I wanted to experience something new and exciting and I thought it would be a good place to play my music and make some money while doing this. Now mind you, We are talking about COLOMBIA! The country where everyone speaks Spanish. I did NOT know spanish before doing this.I was completely diving in head first (As I tend to do a lot these days!!). I had planned my trip for one month. And I thought that I would be in Cartagena the whole time. I had made a friend at my Spanish school literally a short walk from the beach. We became good friends on this trip, He was from London. I then met another guy who was staying at the same Hostel as me. He made a very serious and interesting comment. He told me ""You have to see Medellin"". And I felt like he really meant that for whatever reason. I brushed it off though because I was planning to be on the beach for a month straight while doing music gigs on the beach. The whole thing was planned out lol... So as time went by I started having fun in Cartagena and I met some very talented and cool musicians there. Now my friend from London Two Weeks in was leaving to go to Medellin. I honestly wanted to go too because of what the guy from the Hostel told me. So I went. I re-booked my ticket to From Medellin to Austin and I was on my way. I now know why that Man told me I NEED to see Medellin. Did I mention that the fruit that just grows so abundantly in this city is super fresh and amazing to the taste? Well if I didn't, now you know. Meanwhile I felt actually that on top of the amazing climate and fresh food that this city was actually a better place to gig at. I was on the beach before so everything was a little too relaxed and venues were slower with getting your gigs together. Medellin is a Metro City, so Me being from Austin, TX  (The Live Music Capital of The World!) I can work my way around and get some nice gigs and make some good money. I did just that and I met some of the most humble talented people I've ever run across. Not only were the musicians talented they were classy people who showed me that no matter where you are in the world you can meet true friends. This part of my journey was my very first encounter with the music and Culture of Colombia. I returned in the beginning of January to escape all of the madness here in America and to play my music to people who wanted to listen. This trip I knew what I was doing, I knew where I was going and even better I had friends in the city. This time I stayed a whole one month in Medellin, Colombia. And let me tell you, It was one of the most rewarding things I have ever done. The amount of love I felt from God for giving me the opportunity to do such a thing, Traveling to another country to play my music that I made up in my apartment. This is life to me. I did the same thing in May of 2017 and stayed there for two weeks touring Medellin and surrounding cities. Because at this point people had started buying my music from me and asking me to perform at their venues. So now I am in Austin, Texas. I get a call from my friend in Colombia and he tells me that he wants to make an album with me combining my Hip-Hop culture with his Colombian Musical Culture. We had been gigging a lot together whenever I was in town and at this point for him to ask me that was like the only logical step that could happen next. That's where you come in, I can make this trip possible and continue this journey that I am currently on. I am a Musician. I create my music honestly and no one controls or censors my output. I have started making a living off of my Music. Do you know how good that feels? For me to eat a meal and pay rent because of my music is like the most satisfying thing in the world to me. I know with the completion of this album and documentary I can make this my launch pad for reaching my audience across the entire world. I have gotten this far by taking risks. I didn't just dream about it. I did something about it. I hope that my story can inspire anyone who has stumbled upon it. And if you did support my dreams and my music, Just know you have a very special place in my heart and soul.God Bless,Damon Scott Miller, Jr.**P.S. OUTLINE OF MY BUDGET FOR THIS TRIP!!**The money will go to:  -Accomadation for 1 month in an apartment in the city of Medellin (Air Bnb): $1500  -Food and Eating expenses: $350  -Studio time from professionals in Medellin: $2500  -Music Video costs from same film crew as the documentary makers (Estimated two to three videos for the songs : $1500  -Documentary Makers (really just like two guys, but they are top notch videographers and really cool friends.): $1000-Direct payments to my sound engineers and producers (Again two guys who are my friends in the music industry in Colombia)-$2000  -The flights to Medellin are very cheap compared to most places you fly internationally. I will be traveling with my Wife, two round trip tickets range from about $600 for flights with 17 hour layovers to $1100. In total that is $10,000. Having had the experience of traveling to Colombia before and having professional Musicians and sound engineers as my friends. This is a very calculated project. We are in very close contacts with each other and our ambitions on this project are monumental. We all come from different places in the world so it's going to be a unique experience.  ","-The ambition of this record could possibly need more than a month to complete which would affect budgetary needs. But with the experience I have working in the studio, this shouldn't be a problem.-Being that the time frame is around Christmas time, this could affect scheduling with the studios and days off from work could affect output.",https://www.kickstarter.com/projects/834560469/im-creating-an-album-overseas-commissions?ref=discovery_category_newest,834560469/im-creating-an-album-overseas-commissions,"I am going to make this straight to the point. I have been touring Colombia as a Musician for a little over a year now. I have been there 3 times since July 2016. I have never had a music following in my life until I went to Colombia. I met up with some fellow musicians while gigging, and we've become quite good friends. I received a call from my friend who lives in Medellin, Colombia. He is a producer and excellent musician. He and I decided to make an album leading into this new year. I am planning to spend a whole month in Medellin, Colombia to make music and play gigs to keep my music going. I hope to use this project as a launch pad for a career that I have always wanted.I also have a friend who is a professional filmmaker planning to make a documentary for this project! I hope to make something great that I have never made before. I have made a lot of albums over the years with a total of 10 under my name (Ryan Eagle). This project is different, I can feel the anticipation that I have to start this project. It means something to me when I feel I have to do something! I am optimistic that this project will get fully-funded! Thank You to everyone who has given me the time to tell you my story!Money for this Campaign will be used for:$850-Living Accommodation for one month in Medellin, Colombia$1800-Two tickets to Medellin, Colombia.$1000-Recording and Engineering Costs for my album (Paying a guy to mix and master the audio for this album at a professional level)$1000-This album will be a collaboration of my music and the Music of my friend Adan Naranjo. He is a very well known Musician in Medellin, and the person who I mentioned earlier that called me to make this album. This money will be for him to work with me and collaborate on composition. (I usually compose all of my own music independently, But having worked with this musician before I have a certain amount of trust in his songwriting abilities, and I am excited to see how we mix together as musicians!)$350- filming a music video in Medellin with a fillmmaker!Here is a link to my music website:https://ryan-eagle.bandcamp.com/","I may need more than a month to get the album completely right. But we will be working everyday to ensure we get what we need done. I have recorded a lot in the past and I usually get songs over with really fast, which is why I have a lot of material. But I do think this is something that could be an issue if I weren't aware of it."

In my opinion music is the highest form of expression and in many cases can be used as a healing modality. Music is a gateway, a direct access to one’s soul. It is sound vibrating in a rhythmic pattern that allows one to feel certain emotions based on the vibes that are given off.I started rap as a freshman at Knox College on the 2nd floor dorms of Seymour Hall. At first its was all gimmick rap; me and a few others were simply taking turns goofing around on the mic during winter break. At the time I was playing basketball so I couldn’t really take rapping seriously nor was I interested. It wasn’t until Spring term my sophomore year I began to become more deliberate about my approach to rap. I spent most of that term taking art classes and studying the poetics of Hip-Hop. I decided to focus my attention towards rap after an unsuccessful basketball season. The next year my junior year I decided not to play basketball and decided to focus on school and making music/art. I was fortunate enough to link up with another fellow Knox graduate named Griffin Belzer who turned out to be a brilliant producer who mixed and mastered my first project Joy of the Game I released the next year. I created the rap persona Craw the Sage based on the name people called me while I was at Knox now I’m looking to put together another project and expand my brand further to Chicago, then the US, and then to the rest of the world. But first I have to finish the Elixir project.Chicago has always had a music scene, and also a Hip-Hop scene that has been thriving in the last few years. The city has gained national and global attention due to the amount of violence, so if there was a time to get into music it would be now. It’s more than just rap; I feel like as a rapper and visual artists we have a responsibility to bring ideas/issues to light that speak to our respective audiences. I believe I can take my talents and use them to create a better place, a better time, and a better future. I have the gift, now I have to be heard. To make the best quality mixtape it will take more studio time, at least a couple well thought out high quality videos, a couple more beats, and money for marketing and promotion. On top of that I’m confident that once the mixtape is out it will essentially promote itself by gaining attention of some of the Hip-Hop blogs. That is why I’m asking you to make a contribution and help make the Elixir. When you make a contribution you willreceive a 11"" x 17"" Print designed by me plus, you can an email with the entire Elixir project before it is released.

I know I can take my talents and use them to create a better place, a better time, and a better future. I have the gift, now I have to be heard. To make the best quality mixtape it will take more studio time, at least a couple well thought out high quality videos, a couple more beats, and money for marketing and promotion. On top of that I’m confident that once the mixtape is out it will essentially promote itself by gaining attention of some of the Hip-Hop blogs. That is why I’m asking you to make a contribution and help make the Elixir.

I need funding for purchasing rights to beats and booking time in a professional studio.Since I prepare before recording I don't waste any time in a studio. Funding will also go towards marketing the EP locally with physical media and internationally via the internet/social media.I'd also like to make some merchandise like shirts and hats to promote and give as rewards to those who help in funding this EP.,The main obaticle is investing into my goals.

I have a lot of new content and a many unreleased content i haven't released due to quality.The funding i receive will mostly go towards booking recording sessions and the mixing and mastering process.I plan on usingindependent studio's and engineers as well. I figured i'd help others that have services i need like the help i hope to achieve from here. I also plan on using a portion of the funding to promote the EP and purchasing instrumentals.I'm very passionate about writing my music and recording it the best i can every time. I'm a lyricist and pay attention to detail, i'd say i'm in the late 90's/2000's style of Rap/Hip-Hop where i concentrate on word play,metaphors, and delivery.

I have written many songs that haven't been recorded, and found many sources for instrumentals at decent prices with excellent quality."

https://www.kickstarter.com/projects/skylorsos/skylor-sos?ref=discovery_category_newest,skylorsos/skylor-sos,"From the whole team at Skylor we thank you for your consideration in backing our project. My name is Eugene Hoyt and wife Heidi Franz-Hoyt and I created Skylor Omni Security LLC with the sole mission of saving lives. As featured recently on ABC 7 SWFL, ""Skylor SOS"" is designed to provide the best possible personal security by maximizing the technology already in our cell phones to keep us smart, alert, and safe.Many great missions are borne of tragedy. Whether it’s brutality, gun violence, mental illness, or other factors, the personal security challenges in our world are becoming more complex, frequent, and deadly. We have seen horrifying and wide-spread incidents of mass shootings, innocent joggers and travelers being kidnapped and often killed, and an ever-growing list of unstable bad-actors both globally and at home.Sadly, my wife and I can speak from personal experience. We sent our daughter, Sara, out into the world to attend High Point University in North Carolina believing as most parents do that the risks were tolerable. But we found out this fall that risk factors mean little when a dangerous situation is already occuring around you. Our daughter had to experience a credible threat of a mass shooting on her campus.We were elated to learn that some brave students “Say Something, and Said Something” and the alleged would-be shooter, an (ever-more-commom) manifesto, and the suspect's weapons were retrieved without incident and the person taken into police custody. The suspect was attending the university and our daughter's dorm but but a few hundred yards away.So we thought about the jogger that was abducted and murdered in our heartland. What if that had been my daughter or even my wife? With Skylor SOS, this jogger would receive a “tap on the shoulder” from the app if it senses a follower. That’s our Stalker Alert. We imagined being a student in all of our nation’s some 35,000 high schools and having a platform on which to engage in safety and security practices with real time updates. That’s our Student Engagement network. Imagine you were among the office workers at YouTube in California and could have reached 911 emergency with your voice alone. That’s our Voice Activation. We all can imagine giving our first responders eyes inside while they plan to keep up safe in an emergency. Skylor SOS can with our Live Streaming function.This is what it's is all about. Our features are designed to provide enhanced personal security for all that need it and we would be honored by your help to get our project off the ground. We will be launching locally in Florida and then rolling it out nationally in the near future. Your backing will make or break our opportunity to save a life. Because even one life saved as a part of our mission makes it all worth it.Our application will be free to download but to unlock the primary functions of the application will require a subscription. There will be some features that can be viewed after downloading the free app but most functionality is disabled. We take our mission of security very seriously and part of ensuring the best product for our customers isn’t just their personal security but their digital security as well. That’s why Skylor SOS will not permit advertisements nor work with 3rd-party applications excluding first response and campus-connected services. Subscriptions additionally fund the 911 services, continued development, security enhancements, as well as investing in new technological infrastructure to help our first responders do their jobs as safely and efficiently as possible.Risks: We have assessed risks involved with funding, technological capability and infrastructure, and lack of demand. All can be overcome if we secure backing for this project.Challenges: Most challenges are foreseeable and we have a plan for those that aren't.We have expressed our passion for safety and helping to save lives but this passion isn’t just ours. We all believe in a person’s right to feel safe and secure while having easy access to first response if they find themselves in an emergency.We’re asking you not to invest in Skylor, we’re asking for your backing in the cause of saving and protecting life. Because whether it’s the jogger, office worker, student, first responder, or even our own daughter, this issue (and our solution) is bigger than all of us. We hope that you will be encouraged to back Skylor SOS and play a part in making the world smarter, more alert, and safer.","Risks & ChallengesRisks: Funding: KickStarter and Private InvestmentTechnological Capability: Target market is saturated with compatible mobile devices.Technological Infrastructure: We will design the code to connect campus and first response accounts and build the additional infrastructure as demand requests.Lack of Demand: Cohesive marketing campaigns targeting parents, students, and business owners as well as the general public. Skylor SOS can help anyone, anytime in a dangerous situation.Challenges:Development Quality: A portion of Kickstarter funding is earmarked to create a well-developed and tested application. Our app will be smooth, user friendly, and attractive.Technological Changes: API and OS changes, late-surfacing bugs, and the complexities of managing the 911 services are areas that require further study to ensure scalability and our backers will give us the capital to accomplish this while paving the way for an entirely new form of security in the industry.

The Movie will be shot in 5 selected cities, and locations. Washington DC, Surrounding areas of Maryland and Virginia , Pittsburgh and New York City.Independent films are finally getting the respect that they deserve. With the enormous success of this market segment, some independent companies such as Miramax have become well-financed divisions of studios. Studios can then capitalize on the success of the ""independent"" distribution arms attached to them, while the ""independent"" distributors maintain a level of autonomy within the corporate structure. The independent distributors are then free to produce and distribute those films that have smaller budgets, which can then be placed into niche markets. American society, and other countries around the world, are calling for the media to be responsible in its depiction of violence and graphic content, even going so far as to require distributors and programmers to label and/or edit content here in United States. A recent example of this occurrence is the Motion Picture Association of America's (MPAA) TV ratings system. The ratings system developed when the United States Congress basically gave broadcasters and programmers a mandate that they were to patrol themselves or the government would intervene. This intervention would mean that Congress would adopt some form of censorship, which of course is what the entertainment industry does not desire. The past few years have seen a resurgence of independent filmmakers. Smaller production companies and distribution companies are gearing up and independent production is growing even as of this writing. In addition, specialty theatres are also on the rise. Most low-budget features get their initial theatrical release in these venues, which attract adult and college audiences. While previously most of them stayed in the specialty circuit, low budget films are being moved into the main stream mall theatres for general audience consumption. All these developments serve to increase the chances for a well-made, low budget film. The only risk is not investing.

Doors to the new space will be opened.If all goes well we can expect to have a working space by August/September 2017.Please see the below approximate pricing breakdown for equipment:Audio Equipment (Amplifiers, Soundboard, On-Stage Monitors, Microphones, Cabling, Stands, Snakes, Digital Interface) - $4000Video Equipment(Production Switcher, Camera, Control Laptop, Cabling, Tripods) - $4000Marketing (Online ads via Facebook, Twitter, Google. Radio Marketing) - $2500Space Rental(Space Rental will vary pending funding raised. Smaller funding means smaller spaces) - $4500 (This includes the first few months of rent to ensure the business has time to begin generating its own income.)Obviously up-front funding will only go so far, so a strategy needs to be in place to keep the doors open.Pricing will be arranged on an ""artist by artist"" basis. This space NEEDS to be affordable to every artist that walks in the door. Pricing will vary between artists. Each individual artist/band looking to use the space will be granted a free consultation to review exactly what they are looking to accomplish in the space.Fair pricing (starting at a minimum $100 per 4 hour session) will be arranged based on what each artist is looking to accomplish and how.Audio Sessions will start at $100.Pre-Recorded Video will start at $300Live Video Streamingwill start at $400.In addition, artists will be given the opportunity to sell tickets to any video sessions. Tickets will start at $5.Between these sources of income, a minimum total of $5,000 will need to be taken in monthly in order to keep the space operational.Operational Expenses:Space Rental (Per Month): $1000 (this number is doable in the greater CT area)Utilities: $1000Employee Payout: $2500 (not including any tips received by employees from consumers)Unforeseen Expenses: $500This would mean a minimum of 50 artists per month would need to work in the space.This number will be easily reachable as pricing will vary, these numbers are based off of bare minimum pricing.Here's the magical part. This space is not ONLY for musicians. In order to produce this content Remnants Recordings & Entertainment will need to work closely with audio engineers, directors and designers. This means we are not only developing a product for musicians and bands, but inspiring creativity in aspiring filmmakers, artists, sound designers and more. This gives so many creative people a chance to show the world what they can build!Volunteers, Part-Time, and Commission based employees will be staffed accordingly meeting the budgetary needs of the space.Find a sample of the work:https://remnantsrecordings.bandzoogle.com/homePlease take a moment to review the rewards being provided for backing this project. In addition, any backers are supporting local artists and musicians within the New England/Northeastern US area. As this project expands and grows you will be supporting aspiring artists throughout the country and the world. You never know if the next Jimi Hendrix lives at the end of your block.My name is Josh Lopez. I am a musician and a graduate of the Connecticut School of Broadcasting. I have worked in both the audio and video industry, performing live sound setups (for both large events and small ones i.e, theaters, casinos, festivals) and have worked in the broadcast production world running cameras, video controls, graphics engines and switchers for the better part of 10 years.In addition to broadcasting and working as an audio engineer I have worked as a private party disc jockey (DJ) both independently and through my own business (New Sound Systems). While this has mostly been hobby work I have used it as a full-time job in the past to support myself when needed. Most of the outlined marketing mentioned above is based on the success I have had when using for DJ work. The above concept was developed while working with members of my band. We had come up with the idea to use to knowledge base that I had in both live and in studio sound (again, the better part of 10 years) and broadcast production to combine both into a ""virtual venue"" space where artists, filmmakers, and musicians can develop content and communicate with their fanbases worldwide.",There are minimal risks for backers during initial funding of this space.Major risks occur after the opening of the space. A steady customer base will need to be established to ensure that the minimum income ($5000 monthly) is made to keep the virtual venue operational.Due to the pricing structure mentioned above clients will be able to afford multiple visits. This will ensure a steady income flow during the operational period. Providing this product to the music industry ensures that new content will CONSTANTLY be developed by artists of all genres. The amount of business that can be secured with the proper amount of advertising is endless.,https://www.kickstarter.com/projects/252428534/a-v-engineering-and-design-workspace?ref=discovery_category_newest,252428534/a-v-engineering-and-design-workspace,"Remnants' Recordings & Entertainment was founded in 2017 by brothers Josh and Shea Lopez in an effort to provide affordable audio/visual services to the local community, including community theater programs, middle/high school drama clubs, and local musical talent. We are happy to have been the proud service providers of more than twenty theatrical and musical productions since our incarnation.Our team comes with a number of prior experience in the industry and are certified Biamp, ClearOne, and Dante engineers. We are very proud of all of the members of our team who work equally as hard to provide the best quality of service possible.Since our initial startup in 2017 our company has seen substantial growth and interest from the surrounding community. With such rapid growth and development we continue to strive to provide the best quality of sound engineering, system design/integration, and system rental services to all who require it as well as continue to develop new ways to inspire creativity within our own communities.Our goal in this Kickstarter campaign is to find sponsors to help back our growth to ensure that we can continue to provide the same quality of locally owned, family friendly service we have been working so hard maintain over the past year.For the past year all office/warehouse based work has been done out of our home offices as well as a garage storage bay being rented for equipment storage. To help with our expansion efforts we have found a new building available in our hometown which has the ability to serve as an office and warehouse space for our expanding company.The building owner is looking to rent out the space for $10K for the year, however, we are only looking to raise half of that as a startup to move into the new space for continued development. The building is locally owned by another small business owner, so all funds raised to rent this building be helping out not only our business, but another local business in town.Please take a moment to find out more about us on our website:www.RemnantsRecordings.com","The rent on this building will only be for a one-year term. Therefore it is our job to continue to support growth throughout the course of this coming year and earn the profit necessary to renew our rental agreement in mid-2019.With funding from a Kickstarter campaign to assist with some of the costs of production, this will free up additional budget from jobs for further marketing and planning for the future. Therefore, we will be able to continue our expansion into 2019 and beyond to ensure that the necessary funds remain to drive this business forward."

A typical white kid growing up in the suburbs, and then moving out of his parents house to pursue more in life. But still having his senior year to conquer, he has to balance school with his ascending passion to be a lyrical, conscious rapper that hopes to make millions. Songs will be a journey into his theory of mind about all the things he sees around him, such as dead end jobs, religion, women, and of course school. But will also include radio hits and ""bangers"" to have mass appeal.","If my project is fully funded and finished by May (graduation), I will be going on tour to build my reputation one step at a time.

Like all psychics in the realm, she has blue skin. Her day consist of smoking her pipe, smoking her pipe and sitting back smoking her pipe.A very blain, boring woman. Roji cannot stand his emotionless mother, nor her very small breast. Roji remembers vividly going hungry when trying to be breastfed, which is why he drools over big breasted women. She shows no worries over her long lost husband or her adventurous young child braving a harsh world alone. Perhaps she already knows their future?

Men and women with honor, courage, strength and cool ass weapons and armor. They have made Roji stronger, wiser, better skilled to face the darkness that preys upon the land. They are all different in personalities, methods of combat and philosophies on life. But one thing they can all agree on... being a hero ain't easy. In this realm, heroes drop like flies and Roji is starting to see that getting too attached to a hero is not a safe bet, especially if there is a swarm of hell goblins chasing their ass.BAD GUYSMake room for the bad boys and girls coming through, because it's a lot of them.From greedy rulers with demonic midgets for pets, to persistent assassins and bounty hunters looking for blood. Monstrous Cyclops with a fine eye for details, to hellish fiends that can drop it like it's hot. But Roji relishes the opportunity to test his might against these evil doers, seeing how they are just as whacky as he is.Roji is living life through the eyes of a child. Imagine all the wonders you would be able to see. Having no fear of the unknown and embracing the mystery. Learning as you go and living unattached to failures and outcomes. To be so free that the Universe guides you, as if you are destined by the Gods themselves.FUNDING USAGEThe money will be used to create a eight minute long pilot and will cover the costs of animation, voice acting, sound and hired help.

What hasn’t changed is that two people that are lovingly committed to each other in a monogamous relationship whether married, engaged or not, still want everyone to notice and share in their joy with symbolic rings. Many modern couples never plan on getting a marriage license, even though they plan on being, happily ever after, together. 4ever2® was created to meet those needs.Traditional couples wear engagement rings or wedding bands to show the world they are in a loving, monogamous relationship. Today, modern couples do not always follow this same path. Even though they too are a monogamous relationship, however, they do not feel the need or desire to have a document confirming their commitment such as a marriage license. Some couples purchase commitment rings which show ""you are my one and only"" with someday an intent to marry. 4ever2 bands far exceed the simple concept of commitment rings. 1) 4ever2 bands feature two interlocking rings, one to represent each person in the relationship. 2) Just like their lifelong, loving commitment, 4ever2 bands never separate. Because they are interlocked together, forever.3) 4ever2 bands are a patent-pending design that easily rolls up and down the finger to become “the world’s most comfortable ring”.4) 4ever2 bands offer various metals, sizes and widths that make each and every set as unique as you are.5)4ever2 bands feature a proprietary ""Jewelstone""© hidden inside each set of bands. The “Jewelstone” is made of Rose Quartz, known for centuries as the love stone, far long before diamonds became popular.6)4ever2 bands that feature the “Jewelstone” gently touch the skin, providing love vibrations. Some cultures strongly believe that this special gem, offers strength against infidelity.7)4ever2 bands are designed for all committed couples, including those that are married in the traditional manner.8) 4ever2 bands do not have any diamonds or gemstones which can be prone to falling out with wear and tear or prongs being caught and broken off, making these bands extraordinarily durable.Visit the 4ever2 website to learn more about this new, creative and exciting product:https://4ever2.com/Like us on our Facebook page and share this campaign with others.https://www.facebook.com/4bands2uniquepeople/After all, love and sharing is why 4ever2 was created... just for you!","Our plan is to hire and train disabled veterans confined to a wheelchair due to protecting all of us and defending our freedom, but we need your support to help make this possible.In a caring environment, our jewelers work to create these bands in a sitting position. This is an ideal and productive employment opportunity for wheelchair-bound veterans.In order to make this possible, though, we need to add ADA bathrooms and a wheelchair inclined platform lift within our facility. This is what the majority of our initial funding needs, with your support, will be used for.The challenge hiring people with disabilities is far more than just providing ADA bathrooms and accessibility. Our wounded warriors have mental and physical trauma which can result in needed time off for medical visits, and flexibility to work around their personal needs.We intend to not only provide the required physical improvements to our facility but, also, to provide staff support along with their peers who share similar special needs and compassion. Our plan is to create ""flex time"" to allow time off as needed, without fear of disciplinary action.Caring and supportive staff will assist our heroic veterans in order to ease them into their new occupation as a jeweler. Whether it is building access or ease of moving around the facility, our staff will gladly assist.",https://www.kickstarter.com/projects/4ever2/the-worlds-most-comfortable-wedding-bandtm?ref=discovery_category_newest,4ever2/the-worlds-most-comfortable-wedding-bandtm,"Every year in the United States, there are approximately 2.5 million weddings. These unions celebrate the unconditional love and commitment between two partners, and the standard symbolism of this commitment happens to be a pair of rings. However, over the past century, wedding bands have barely evolved. The standard plain gold wedding band has been the preferred style for most- until now.Combining elegance, durability, comfort, and cost efficiency- we have decided to reinvent the traditional wedding band and how it symbolizes the true love between two people. 4ever2 Jewelstone Bands feature two interlocking rings, one to represent each person in the relationship. These rings never separate, and because the strength of TWO rings is being combined, 4ever2 bands are much stronger and more durable than a standard single gold band. The design of the rings allows them to easily roll up and down your finger for maximum comfort. Though interlocking bands are not a new concept, 4ever2 Jewelstone Bands feature a proprietary gem hidden inside each set of bands. This gemstone is mostly comprised of Rose Quartz- which has been known for centuries as the official “Love Stone”, providing soothing energy that fosters empathy, reconciliation, and opens the heart to all types of love. Most importantly, 4ever2 Jewelstone Bands can be customized to represent each person further by offering various different sizes, individual band widths, and metal combinations. There is no question that 4ever2 Jewelstone Bands are unique- but so is our company. Beyond our mission to symbolize your unique love stories, we have teamed up with Michigan Works and Michigan Rehabilitation Services to help us locate, train, and offer people who may have physical challenges an opportunity for gainful employment. Although our building meets the minimum ADA requirements for a business, in order to make our workplace wheelchair accessible and more comfortable/convenient, additional alterations will be required.We are so grateful for your support of our project. Please share our story with anyone you know who may get married, someone who lost a wedding band, or someone who travels and wants to show they are married, but without a diamond ring which can be lost or stolen while traveling. If you do support us financially, below are some of the rewards we are thrilled to offer.

We discovered through our previous Kickstarter campaign that 4ever2 was not destined to be a “promise ring” or a “commitment band” after all, and to our surprise, most of our inquiries came from couples who were looking for a new wedding band option. After carefully reviewing this information and feedback, we went back to the drawing board.With over 7,000 weddings per day in the USA, it is clear that a strong and viable market for wedding bands already exists. However, the US Patent and Trademark Office has only credited one to be the “The World’s Most Comfortable Wedding Band™,” and that is 4ever2.Reinventing any product proves to be a difficult challenge, especially something as traditional as the wedding band. Though we have achieved strength, distinctiveness, and cost efficiency, the greater half of the battle will be successfully educating our consumers on why our new product is incomparably the best option. Keeping that in mind, another risk most startups must consider is running out of funding for crucial marketing techniques needed to showcase the product effectively. We intend to enjoy the process- crawling, walking, and then run, to ensure that we do not encounter this common mistake made by most entrepreneurs.In January 2019, we will launch nationwide on Amazon. The Amazon platform sells more wedding bands than any other online retailer, meaning we may run into some friendly competition. However, a major goal for our company is to obtain a Prime badge. This will aid in our marketing and allow us to offer free 2-day shipping, setting us apart from the other brands and appealing to online shoppers."

Having moved to Maryland about 4 years ago, I noticed there is really not any restaurants here that offer a good home cooked meal. That made me want to share my cooking so that more people could enjoy a home cooked meal. I want to own my own food truck so that I can do just that. I need to raise at least $60,000 to purchase a food truck that has everything ready to go. In order to pull it off I would set my truck up at spots that I know will be appreciated by the community.

https://www.kickstarter.com/projects/380201120/infoexchange-a-lind-innovation?ref=discovery_category_newest,380201120/infoexchange-a-lind-innovation,"=====================2015============================InfoExchange is an extremely ambitious project that has been in the works for nearly a decade. The idea is very complex and nuanced but once explained extremely powerful. It has the potential to change the world on a global scale and dramatically reduce poverty. At the same time it simply makes business sense for people of all socio-economic status to use an embrace, including the economic elite. All accomplished without the need for any government or economic elite buy in.The goal of this kickstarter is not to fund anything, but rather build a community of stakeholders in the project. This project (mission?) is happening with or without community financial support. The tools and platforms we will develop have vast applications in project management and technical architecture and thus as developed will build a following regardless of the validity of my over all goalA thread detailing the research behind my motivations for this project (and people's mostly negative reaction to them): https://www.reddit.com/r/badeconomics/comments/3p4l7u/literally_the_worst_economics_i_have_ever_seen/, I'm hoping that eventually I will be able to turn the tide in that thread, however that hinges on it being active.Please review: Imagine a World without Money: A.M.D.G.===================2017=============================The basic principal is to move to a barter exchange economy.On Exchange Medium and Speculation is the BluePrint for proving this framework is the right thing to do.This project is about building the Technical Framework and Operational Infrastructure for Roddenberry's economy in the Federation in the here and now. I am Lt Cmdr Jason (Wesley Crusher) Lind, ""Star Fleet"". You can find my BluePrint on that LinkedIn profile. That describes the relationships I have built which will enable development and deployment of InfoExchange.Sorry I'm having major tech issues. bb Tuesday. Note all the lind-i links are dead Because we are in the process of becoming ?/Lind<Transformation> where ? is a new named partner.Also I did not have a credit card to verify an identity, which was not required when the project was approved in 2015, so I simply ""spammed"" an offer with the project preview and credentials to the net with an offer for 10% to enter their card and launch. Obviously it worked.==Tuesday==First please look at the design document, which has been approved by a world class patent lawyer, for A Generalized CommodityBarter Exchange Engine. There is code to go with this but I am not particularly proud of it and I have come up with another approach that will be made public, to the community,coincide with the August 2017 date. This of course is limited to commodities however we need a system that expands well beyond that.Then take a step back and read A System for Goal Oriented Governance.Which a formal Use Case Diagram might look like:There has been significantly more modeling done, as you can see from the links in Imagine a World... however I do not have immediate access to those files.Please contact me, lind@yahoo.com, if you have any suggestions about how to meet this goal because this is an OMEGA moment and $500 is truly all I really need to make this happen.==================2015===============================The planned go live date is January of 2021, however as you can see in the rewards there are several major milestones before that.(1) - Membership Portal (September 2017)The portal will be an invitation only socially aware project management suite. Initially it may be a little more then a message board, the funding level will dictate the initial features.The medium-term vision is to have a socially aware wiki/blog platform that enables teams to define and promote their ideas. While the intent is to use this to promote Lind Innovation there will be no limitations on what purposes the membership chooses to utilize this resource for.(2) - Alpha Release (January 2018)The Alpha Release is intended to include a relatively stable architecture with general contractual mechanisms that cover 60% of the use cases. After which releases will be on two week sprints (in Agile/SCRUM talk).It will open up to developers that have not contributed to this kickstarter at this time, and throughout alpha. However these developers will be hand picked and considered experts in their fields with a significant amount to contribute to the project. All people who pledge the $5000 will be granted an alpha developer account, with access to the code and tools from day 1.(3) - Beta Developer Release (December 2019)The Beta Release will have functioning infrastructure: automated distributed build and deploy processes, management tools and a developer store, complete with financial transfer settings. It will also mark a strong commitment to not making any more breaking changes.This is still a relevantly early development milestone and is the critical phase that will determine the practicality of InfoExchange. It is expected there will be significant bugs, and the kind of bugs that can cost people money.While in theory the system will be 90% feature complete at this milestone and could be used in limited production scenarios, it is not going to be safe to use in a fashion that will improve ""the production of real capital at a level on an order of magnitude not seen since the introduction of the Internet itself, and in fact probably never before in the history of humanity.""It will open up to developers that have not contributed to this kickstarter at this time, and throughout beta. However these developers will be screened and likely expected to pay significantly more as there is a significant cost to supporting developers. All people who pledge the $1000 will be granted a beta developer account, with access to the code and tools from day 1.(4) - Release Candidate (December 2020)The system will be released to end users when there is significant developer production, service buy-in and testing has proven ability to securely and effectively. This is when the real power of the system begins to happen.During the RC period it is expected there will be bugs, but that are unlikely to cause even minor economic harm that cannot be easily reversed.It will open up to end users that have contributed to this kickstarter, although that is expected to be by partner recommendation only. At some point in this process, probably in mid-2020, the platform will be opened to the public.(5) - Production Certification (January 2022)We expect to have all major players on board and using the service at this time, including regulatory authorities. There will not be an official production release due to the nature of the project, but at some point we expect InfoExchange to be robust enough that it is considered a world financial system.By its very nature there will be no central authority, Lind Innovation will exist to provide tools, platforms and infrastructures to support InfoExchange however the community at large achieve control through competition, including competing tools, platforms and infrastructures. The certifications of these components will be up to each individual actor to decide to trust or not.","This is a monumental project that we have been developing for over a decade, and be we I mean mostly me, Jason Lind. You can find my resume: http://www.lind-i.com/Docs/jlindresumev7_3_open_cover.pdf. I have been working as a Software Architect for the past 7 years with over 20 years of total IT experience.I should also mention I am diagnosed as bi-polar type 1 with severe manic episodes and have been hospitalized several times. This has caused me to employ strategies in the past that have severely ruined my reputation among my peers. Also, while I attended Marquette University studying Electrical and Computer Engineering, I did not graduate even high school and am not a traditional academic although I have written papers to research subject matter traditionally left to those with PhD's in the areas of information theory, economic theory and theoretical physics. These papers have largely not been taken seriously to date due to their non-traditional presentation and my methods to promote them in often manic states.That said I am currently not manic and I am hoping this approach and presentation of my body of work will raise the funding needed for me to focus full time on this effort and hopefully hire other qualified experts in IT, Management, and Academic Research needed to achieve the ambitious and radical goals of this project.Nothing like this has ever been attempted before, and there is obviously no guarantee of success. However I contend that the theory, architecture and business model is sound, practical and pragmatic.",https://www.kickstarter.com/projects/380201120/infoexchange?ref=discovery_category_newest,380201120/infoexchange,"A rapidly evolving code base. High res images available here.To accomplish this first we must define a new kind of organization as defined in the 2009 article ""A System for Goal Oriented Governance"". This will be done through a Charter Orchestration Engine that enables end-users to define organization’s through charters, have others agree to their roles and federate these organizations with other organizations. Eventually enforcement of these contracts will be executed on the exchange, but that is probably far down the road. For now we will keep the data in a highly structured standard format so that when that time comes we will be ready. The next phase is about improving the effectiveness of the economy while improving on efficiency. In 2011 I wrote an article, that was not well received then or now due to the highly technical cross-disciplinary nature; although John Forbes Nash, Jr. did research the topic before he died, called “On Exchange Medium and Speculation”. Essentially, I attempted to demonstrate that the very nature of Exchange Medium (money) fundamentally drives speculative behavior in humans for when there is a score to keep we are wired to maximize it even at the cost of our true objectives. As Dr. Stephen Merrill would say the Solution is ALWAYS Obvious: in this case eliminate the score, eliminate exchange medium and go to a n-way automated barter system. A detailed design document for this can be found here. Speculation is the root of all evil - Gordon Gekko Why Δ∞? See http://wwidew.net For the technicalities this project will be CopyFree (MIT most likely) and this kickstarter is to build our community to get institutional support more than fund the actual Azure resources as they will likely cost much more than $5000 over the next year. Yes we are a Microsoft shop: Azure, ASP.NET, SQL Server, Data Lake, C#, Visual Studio, UWP, etc. Those are non-negotiable in the fork I will be involved with, and quite frankly I’m probably the only one with the technical and business backgrounds as well as the industry connections to make this reality.Acting Fleet Admiral Jason (Wesley Crusher) Lind, STARFLEET IN BOLDjason.lind@wwidew.net 414.788.2820Bing me (not Google) look right and click.-∞Ωα∞+","The largest risk is that this won't have the impact I'm predicting as that requires eventual institutional support. For example commodity-to-commodity n-way exchange isn't very useful unless its on a current exchange like the CME (where I have contacts).Beyond that this is all new technology and patterns, most of the detailed design is to come but that is because I have needed a team (which this kickstarter is designed to generate) to build out my designs."

Using only a flexcut carving jack I have been able to carve a variety of pieces including walking sticks/hiking staffs, wood spirits, childrens play swords, adult fantasy swords, trinket boxes, and memory boxes. For me to speed up the process of creating pieces to sell I need certain costly tools. I have totalled up the combined cost of the tools along with wood stock and finishing products and the start up cost is unachievable for me to do it alone. Through research I know my products can sell, I just need the tools to do the job!I appreciate any support from you, and have provided some tempting rewards that I hope you find appealing.

https://www.kickstarter.com/projects/buddyflight/buddyflighttm-ios-app?ref=discovery_category_newest,buddyflight/buddyflighttm-ios-app,"The idea of BuddyFlight™ came about as my son was training for his private pilot license and the need for buddying up with other pilots started coming up in conversation. We discovered it was very difficult to find other students/pilots to buddy up with. The flight school said he needed to hang out around the hangar and wait for other student pilots who were at his level and willing to Buddy-up but this isn't very effective.The App is currently on Apple's App Store but is still very ""beta""... maybe even closer to an ""alpha"".

https://www.kickstarter.com/projects/118043437/manufacture-new-color-tikz-tags?ref=discovery_category_newest,118043437/manufacture-new-color-tikz-tags,"I am constantly traveling and losing things. One day, I left my AirPods at the airport terminal. I was so upset but ended up buying another set. As I sat on another plane, I stared at my new AirPods and I asked myself, ""What is someone found my old pods and they wanted to return them?"". There would be no way for them to know who they belong to. So I thought about barcodes. Small barcodes that you can attach and work with an app or database to determine ownership. So I designed and created the website tikz.app that same weekend. Then I developed the Google and Apple apps.So have you ever lost something that you cared for but never got it back? What is someone found it? How would they know who to return it to?Or have you ever found something and you felt compelled to return but to who?The solution? tikz!tikz is available for download on both the Apple and Google Stores.The tikz tags are small aluminum tags that attach to any flat surface. Tag your personal or company items in the event you lose them. If your item is lost, others can contact you via the app and without giving them your information. Better yet, they don't even need to have the app. A camera phone will scan the QR code and our website will take care of the rest!Based on user feedback, our project now is to manufacture fun colored tags. Here are some sample colors we would like to fund.Original Color Samples",This funding will be utilized to produce new colored tags that will feel more personal to our user base. The tags are to be used by consumers with the tikz app and website. Aluminum tags are expensive but adding fun colors (based on user feedback) will increase the chances of users buying them.,https://www.kickstarter.com/projects/118043437/tikz-tags-a-smart-way-to-tag-your-belongings?ref=discovery_category_newest,118043437/tikz-tags-a-smart-way-to-tag-your-belongings,"Have you ever lost something you love? What if someone found it and they are willing to return it? How do they know it belongs to you? How do they contact you? Have you ever found something and willing to return it? But to who?A QR code tag that sticks to any flat surface, an app, that is the solution! We call it:My name is Hector, I came about this idea when I lost my AirPods on a plane. I am sure this has probably happened to you. Losing something you love and not have a remote chance of ever getting it back. Sure, some people may not want to return some items but with tikz, your chances of getting your item back increase substantially. Whether it is keys, electronics, tools, kid's toys, or anything with a flat surface, you will be able to attach a tikz tag and register it in the event you lose it. Gives you piece of mind. I started with paper tags and a prototype of the apps in both Apple and Google stores. These apps are available today on both platforms with limited functionality.Download it from apple hereDownload it from google hereShould you want to try out the prototypes, you can scan the tikz tag in the ""tikz tags"" image above. I am raising funds to complete development of additional functionality that will bring value to you as a tikz app user. I will also use the funding to create NEW colored tags.I have many ideas for this app but let me give you an example of a new feature that will be supported with this project funding:You attach a tikz tag to your keys and register it using the app. You are at the mall, you lose your keys! oh no!Well, login to the tikz app. Submit an alert for your keys. Everyone in the immediate area (who has the app) will receive an alert so they are on the ""lookout"" for your keys (amber alerts re-defined lol).Someone finds your keys and they scan your tag. They can immediately contact you via the app. No need to give out your name or phone number! The best part is that even if others don't have the app, they just scan with any phone camera and the QR will generate a link to the tikz website which will allow them to contact anyway.Amazing right? So now that you know what tikz will be able to do, hope you decide to pledge and help this get off the ground. tikz are going to be everywhere! Be part of something big! Any pledge will make a difference!Or if you cannot pledge, please help by sharing with your friends! And if you don't want to share with your friends, send us some feedback. Cheer us up!Thank you for your consideration!HectorP.S.Here are some examples of marketing ideas",There is very minimal to no risk with rewards. We will be able to furnish the tags if you meet the reward criteria and we fulfill our funding goal. The question is how we add value to you as a tikz user?  The challenge will be marketing the product and app once developed. This funding will also be utilized for our marketing strategy.

Now I am trying to produce a show that covers in-depth custom cars and just as importantly the drive behind the men and women who build them. Often times the stories are about the car only but as I film this potential series, I find that many times there are other reasons behind a high-end car build. In some cases, they are tributes to loved ones who have passed, for others they may be a healthy replacement for drug addiction. While the show started out with the intent of being an inspiration for younger kids to become successful with toys being the reward, other more human sides have come to the surface through various interviews with these car fanatics.

Last spring, I launched a campaign to start a new TV series called Men, Money and Machines. The sizzle (preview) is available to peruse here:https://vimeo.com/110957638or you may read below for a synapsis or go to mionmassmedia.com.Remember, this is the old sizzle. The new one will be done along with the pilot within 72 hours. While my Kickstarter campaign only raised a little over $1,000 last time, I soldiered onward with the determination of a walking person, setting aside my writing career and becoming even more determined to get the show to air. Nine months later, I am in the same position financially after covering my own filming and editing costs but leaps and bounds closer to being on a National Network. Remember, I was on Comcast a few years back with Nice Drives. Since then I've worked with a ""Network Liaison"" who sort of showed me around the dicey, cutthroat world of broadcasting. Thanks to him I found two potential homes for MMM which is now titled DRIVEN, the money, motivation and madness behind modification. One network made me a sizable offer but i have refused it in order to retain creative control and all future international and streaming rights. I can't disclose the Network immediately but it is happening. It's ""almost"" official. I am in talks with the Network president and the executive VP ""on the reg"" I have ""people."" There is a way to get paid while retaining creative control and that is to bring sponsors with you. If a Lee Iacocca type is reading this please take notice. I may be able to source these sponsors. I know a lot of people in the industry but I suck at sales and would rather put energy into polishing the first three episodes, at which point the Network may make me another offer. Retaining ownership also means you can jump ship if things aren't going as you like. And I want them to go as WE like. I want this to be a platform that my friends, family, acquaintances, hell even my haters if they come around, to relay progressive ideas and theories that may happen to surround our love of high-end modified cars, or racing, or just ""Cruisin' down the street in ma Six-Foh! Cars and bikes and trucks are a beautiful thing, not just rolling art, but a means to moving forward in life. No this is where it gets lofty. As I've been going full-steam producing a television show for the first time, I've changed quite a bit. I don't know what it it is but I think i need to start something I'm calling the Analogue Zeitgeist, or Real Time with Howard Maehre. Basically it means we all talk to each other in person and help each other out and STOP FUCKING TEXTING SOO MUCH.

I can get this on television, I was on once before. I just don't have the budget for quality of television I feel necessary. $5,00 may not complete the season but it will allow me to film and edit the show in a timely manner inorder to have three episodes for the network by the beginning of February.

This lead to the development of SoXies. Standing over a long period of time can be straining for one’s feet, as well as the arch of the foot, which can lead to exhaustion of the feet. With its integrated ergonomic Gel Pad, SoXies support and soften the arch, which causes the feet to relax. In addition, the TPR-Gel Pad massages your feet with every step you take. I've tested a lot of different possible insoles. None of them were flexible and most of them don’t fit in every shoe. SoXies, on the other hand, only support where it is needed, at the arch. Whether you work in a restaurant, as a craftsman, in an office or travelling to fairs, SoXies will help you get through your day. We currently offer our SoXies in different Sizes and Colors. Our SoXies are made from 80% high-quality Cotton, 10% Nylon, 10% Spandex The Gel Pad consists of skin-friendly TPR Material and is ergonomically formed.

The whole point (aside from telling a beautiful story everyone can relate to) is to prove a great film can actually be made outside of Hollywood, without million dollar budgets, without big name actors, and with camera gear that anyone can afford in today's advanced technological world. This is certain to be the greatest theatrical production ever made with the fewest people involved. It will change the mindset of all who aspire to create film art. In the end, it really is about telling a good story. So many have gone untold because Hollywood kept them on the other side of the gate! Help us?Story synopsis:While rescuers frantically searched for survivors in the World Trade Center attacks, Jack Taylor was searching, too. His life-long journey to find one woman who would love him unconditionally was somewhere among the rubble. This is an epic journey along the road less traveled and littered by the bones of other hopeless romantics who failed to find perfect love. Jack discovers it is not what you find at the end of the journey but the journey itself.The story of Jack Taylor begins in his childhood as he sets off on a life-long journey to find a lover who will accept him for all that he is and is not. Jack does not realize he has been on such a journey until his mother dies. She dies only hours after he has made plans to move home and take care of her.Following her death, Jack is forced to revisit his childhood bitterness for manipulating women. By now, he had perfected his malice. Frustrated at not understanding his spite, he seeks revenge against the opposite sex. In the process, his first marriage falls apart and he turns his back on the world. By accident, the power of a youthful first love resurfaces and begins to soften his heart.Jack becomes entangled in another doomed relationship. In retreat, Jack almost misses the love affair he longed for, only to have it stolen from him by unchangeable circumstances. Deciding to abandon his convictions to find unconditional love, Jack settles for a larger endeavor - trying to instill the impenitent search for inner peace in his young daughter.A Journey Through Pines is a pilgrimage all humans pursue, yet one that leaves them unsure of what they have found until faced with losing it along the way. Jack Taylor was a risk taker unafraid of falling from grace in the name of leaving behind an ancestral message of love.","I AM going to make the movie.

A win-win situation right? By buying a DutchCraft T-shirt you contribite to a better world. Both socially and ecologically. Fair without child labour. a fair cotton production and no plastic used! Our overview of the making and shipping of a fair DutchCraft T-shirt:Slim fit T-shirt made from 100% organic GOTS cotton in white. With black chest print. In the summer, this basic fits above every item for a modern timeless look. DETAILS Q&A -T-shirt made in the Netherlands? Why? Nice that you ask! To keep it short: Because it is possible. Why buy a T-shirt that is made on the other side of the world in often bad conditions when you can also buy a beautiful T-shirt which is made fair in our own country? -Organic jersey cotton. What is that? Suprime quality without polluting pesticides and cultivated fairly. The cotton farmer also gets a better price for it. Jersey cotton is a stretch cotton that molds around the body and feels super soft and fine. It also lasts much longer and the quality remains very good for a long time. --Why do not we already have this concept on this scale? Two words: too expensive. Manufacturers prefer to produce in low-wage countries where profit margins are enormous. Producing in your own country simply makes too little. Yet we want to make this possible, that is why our T-shirts are slightly more expensive but not very expensive. Our price consists for the largest part of pure production costs. This is profit for other manufacturers. -How do you check that everything is fair? The workshop has been selected with the utmost care. Which means that we regularly go there to see if everything goes as it should. It must of course be certain that you also buy a fair product when this is said. Furthermore, the cotton cultivation and the entire process are also controlled by external parties, including the GOTS label itself. This is done under strict conditions. As soon as a party in the production chain does something else, the farmer loses its quality mark. This is to ensure that everything runs smoothly and according to the rules. That is what we stand for.","The clothes are already made and are even in some stores. Delivery time: We’ve been working with the same supplier and we have a really close working collaboration. However, in manufacturing, there's always a risk of delays. We have added some buffer to minimize the risk and we will be in constant contact with our supplier to ensure a timely delivery. And we always have items in stock for fast delivery."

Sherri Johnson, the publisher & photographer from Massachusetts, decided after photographing so many amazing teenagers, that their creative endeavors needed to be documented & shared with the world. It is her hope that teens will look at this publication and see teens in it that have the same problems, issues, hopes, goals, concerns, and type of life that they live. She hopes that they say to themselves "" If they can do it, so can I !"" We want to continue giving them an outlet where they can actually have their endeavors be heard, read, or visually enjoyed around the world. We are receiving submissions from lots of different locations internationally. We have worked very hard and put in a lot of effort and have published four issues with overwhelmingly positive feedback. We would like to continue in our endeavors to celebrate & share internationally these amazingly creative teenagers. Due to financial difficulties we need your help because we are in need of a camera and equipment to keep up with the photography demands, and we need a computer for our graphic designer. We need your help to continue to encourage and foster teens creativity in a plethora of areas... such as acting, art, cooking, dance, drama, drawing, hobbies, music, photography, sports, and writing. We hope to have your help in our mission to continue celebrating teens creative endeavors... We Thank you so much!Please remember that we only have 60 days to reach our funding goal, and we can't do it alone. So we are counting on you all to help us spread the word about this really cool project to give creative teens the chance to be published for their awesome talents! Please invite your friends and family to help support this project and encourage them to share it with their friends too! If you know creative teens tell them to check us out we would love to put their work into this project. Together I think that we will be amazed at what we can accomplish and help us to continue to help creative teens for years to come by investing in this project today!",,https://www.kickstarter.com/projects/949687856/teen-smudge-art-project?ref=discovery_category_newest,949687856/teen-smudge-art-project,"We would like to be able to keep publishing our monthly magazine for creative teens. This gives teens the chance to submit creative ideas or pieces of art for publication. We want to inspire and motivate future artists. We also help teens express themselves in a positive way. Our magazine has been around since July of 2010. We are happy to have just published another issue. We hope to obtain enough funds to be able to pay for our four person staff, office expenses,a location and an amount to order enough magazines to send to local schools and hospitals.

Life events and the demands of the construction business caused my dad to drastically scale back the number of pigs we kept. Now that I am out of school it is my goal, working alongside my dad, to rebuild the pastured pig business That is why I am here, I am asking for your assistance to rebuild this part of our farm business.We raise pigs on pasture for several reasons. It is a more natural environment for pigs and pigs are an efficient grazing animal and do well on grass, weeds and roots much of the year. Pork raised on pasture has a firmer texture and richer taste to it. ( Note to any aspiring pastured pig farmers: Do not try to take pigs out of confinement and adapt them to pasture. They are adapted to being in confinement and it is unlikely they will adjust to pasture).Pigs doroot which can be a problem for some farms. On our farm though their rooting is simply another management tool we will use to improve the health and productivity of the land. We will be grazing the pigs in places that we want rooted up. Either in new garden spots or in areas that have weeds we wish to remove. For instance the State of Nebraska considers Canada Thistle to be a noxious weed and we are legally required to control it. We've been successfully keeping it controlled with cattle and horse grazing the last few years but with a rebuilt pig herd we are planning to let the pigs root it out of the ground for us. Hopefully in time eradicating it. All without the use of any pesticides. Please note: In twelve years on this farm we have never used any pesticides or herbicides on the farm. As we build the pasture pig operation ( and other farm enterprises ) up we plan to market primarily to consumers and restaurants within a 400 mile radius of our farm. We live about as far in between cities in the U.S. as a person can get so a larger potential marketing area is necessary.Funding will allow us to buy heavy feeder pigs, buy non-GMO supplemental feed, build hog fences, portable housing and other infrastructure and cover basic farm expenses while we are doing so.We have several exciting rewards planned for our supporters including; t-shirts, can coolers, wrist bands and packages of our pasture raised pork delivered to your door.","The funding goal of this project is only a starting place.  Every dollar raised beyond our funding goal will be used to scale the project up.  Difficulties may include; sourcing suitable feeder pigs, sourcing suitable non-GMO supplemental feed,  arranging processing dates at a USDA Inspected Locker and marketing.",https://www.kickstarter.com/projects/1477699366/help-us-diversify-our-farm?ref=discovery_category_newest,1477699366/help-us-diversify-our-farm,"Hello and welcome to our farm and project! My son Christopher Jr. and I operate a small grass based farm in the hills of Northern Nebraska. Our farm sits ten miles to the north of the Niobrara River Valley and ten miles to the south of the Missouri River Valley/Lake Francis Case. This is a wild and scenic area! We've been on the farm here since 2012. I've been working off farm with a small construction business the last few years and my son Chris Jr. has been in school. Chris Jr. graduated last spring. His focus has always been on the farm and sustainable/regenerative agriculture and together we are ready to diversify our farm enterprises and go full time with the farm!In 2016 we principally plan to market our farm products. Mostly beef, pork, chicken and turkey through a CSA ( consumer supported agriculture ) or subscription agriculture. Most of our rewards are based off of the subscription plan.The new enterprises we have planned will both help us improve our income so we can focus on the farm full time and improve the biologic activity of our farm.Thanks to our greenhouse we had cucumbers and tomatos flowering early this summer but there were no bees about to pollinate them! So, our first purpose in adding bees is to pollinate our garden! The honey to eat and sell is actually a bonus! To give the bees the best chance at success we want to buy in a full hive not just a package of bees pulled off of a hive. For monitoring during the season we would also like to purchase one of the Flow Hives you may have seen advertised.Chickens: While we do have a handful of chickens we want to expand our layer flock sufficiently to be able to provide at least a dozen eggs in every CSA basket we deliver each month during the season. We would also like to start a meat breed flock to produce our own chicks on farm. An incubator purchase will be part of the chicken project. We feel that hatching chicks on farm will allow us to save the chicks the stress of shipping and eventually adapt chickens better to our farm and feed resources.Aquaponics: We have dabbled around a little bit with aquaponics and have liked what we've seen. We'd like to take the time and spend the money to build a functioning system. We have a lot of the parts and pieces so it's just a matter of filing in with what we don't have. The aquaponics system will allow us to eventually add Tilapia to our CSA baskets and possibly some vegetables too.Mushrooms: We have access to logs suitable for mushroom cultivation. All we need is the spores to inoculate the logs and the time to do so! We feel this is an enterprise that will fit in well on our farm because it can use an existing or free resource, will fit into space we haven't really been using and will add another valuable product to our menu and mushrooms will also be included in the subscription baskets!Goats and pigs. As part of better using available feed resources we'd like to add about a half dozen goats and a half dozen pigs as well.Thank you for taking the time to visit our project! If you have any questions please feel free to contact us. For additional information please feel free to visit out website: WWW.ANOKABUTTELUMBER.COMor our Facebook page Marlowe Family Farms. -Chris Sr.","There are always risks in every venture and especially in agriculture. Weather plays a huge role in everything we do on the farm.  We have lot of experience with cattle, pigs and chickens and can predict fairly well how many of each we will need to produce the numbers we will need to fill subscription baskets.  The other potential enterprises while we do have some experience with each of them they are still very much new to us and while we will make every effort to manage each of them well we don't entirely know what to expect from them."

One set includes 4 cones and 4 cubes with each model doubling involume. The other set includes 3 cones and 3 cubes which progressively doublethe edge-length. Students will be able to easily measure dimensions andcalculate volume for each object.Loaded Dice – Leveraging the unique capabilities of 3D printing, two outof three included dice have been cleverly weighted to roll non-randomly, butlook nearly identical from the outside. Incorporationof a hidden design element allows the teacher to distinguish between the loadedand normal dice. This engaging model will be sure to get your students rolling.Note- this kit only includes the enclosed dice. The open dice pictured are simply so you can see what they look like on the interior. Shipping Packages– Set within a real-world scenario, this kit discussesgeometry, area, and volume through shipping constraints.A visually-intuitive kit, this simple set up provides aclear illustration of the Pythagorean Proof. Students can move the trianglesaround and come to realize on their own that the base shape’s visible areastays the same and that therefore, a squared +b squared = c squared.Human Allometry –An integrated math and science lesson, this kit explores theratios of different body parts within the whole as a human grows from birth toadulthood.Load-Bearing Test– By examining the way differently-shaped and differently dense prisms handle a load being placed on them, students can gain a real-world understanding of geometry uses in structural design work.Pantograph – Integrating art, technology, and engineering, thispantograph provides a visually-stimulating understanding of ratios andproportions. By drawing with the pencil nearest the fulcrum, students will seethe pantograph draw a replica at twice that size.---Comments:* These two kits are still under development. If we find we cannot get them up to our high level of satisfaction, we may trade them out for a kit in the same field of study. We do not anticipate needing to do this, but we do not want to send out any kits which are not going to work well, every time. On a similar note, all kits pictured here are likely to be identical (except for color) to what you receive. We do, however, believe in a constant state of improvement, so some of the kits may be slightly altered prior to shipping if we find it increases usability. Thank you for your understanding.","Generally, there are very few risks. We've finalized almost all of our kits, and are prepared to trade out the last couple that we haven't if we are unable to make them the best they can possibly be. We promise we won't send out anything that isn't going to exceed your expectations, but we also won't let this stand in the way of an on-time delivery. The curriculum is still being written, but the concept development behind the ideas is already solid, and so we foresee no hold-ups on that end. The only other potential difficulty comes with a few parts we are intending to injection mold. This process is notorious on Kickstarter for delays, but we have worked with our mold-making company before, and they have remarkably fast turnaround time, often sending finished parts within a week or two. We're also only injection molding a few parts, and will be either 3D printing or silicon molding the rest of the pieces, and we've personally tested these mediums in-depth to ensure the process will work flawlessly every time.

We work to design kits which touch on at least one of these subjects, and we strive to make as many of them as truly interdisciplinary as possible.","We are facing very few risks. We have already seen the finished products of the kits we're planning to ship out and have thoroughly tested all of our kits for ease of printability. We've run sample test prints remotely with our Alpha system. Of course, technology has its inherent risks, but from all of our tests with 3DPrinterOS, we are confident that it will work. The only possible setback to everyone getting access to all of our kits without a hitch is that we don't own all of the printers our files are compatible with. This means we haven't been able to go through thorough testing on each and every type of printer for each and every file. And from the variety of printers we have worked with, we've discovered that they all have personalities. What prints perfectly fine every time on one type of printer will fail every time on another type. We expect a bit of this with some of the printers we've never worked with. So, along the way, we'll need you to work with us. If you have a print job that doesn't work the first time, let us know, and we'll work with you and your printer to ensure we have a file that will work. We've done what we can up front. We've tested our files to ensure quality prints on all of the printers we have worked with and will continue, with your help, to perfect the files for each of the printers out there.

Over the past few decades, this once great city has experienced population declines and financial hardships which have driven many of the once great businesses out of the area.  In the most recent decade, Auburn is reemerging as a destination location, due to it's contributions to art through the off-Broadway theatre, The Merry-Go-Round Playhouse, Auburn Public Theatre, and their annual Music Theatre Festival.  All of this is also helping Auburn regain their once flourishing business district.  That's where Octane Social House comes in.  Our intention, along with other great new businesses, is to re-seed a vibrant population of townspeople, out-on-the-town, enjoying themselves, sharing their ideas, and rebuilding Auburn's stature in the state.Octane Social House will be a centrally located, community focal point providing high quality espresso-based drinks and teas, nitrogen cold brew coffee on tap (available to be sold in growlers), Italian sodas, craft beer, and local wine.  Octane Social House will offer (~70%) locally sourced food in a comfortable atmosphere in which local professionals, students, and families will feel at ease to enjoy their experience in lounge chairs and a large window-seating area.  Octane Social House will host in-house special events including live musical performances and entertainment, local-interest workshops, with an on-site used bookstore, in-house games, and small-business promotions (think LuLaRoe).  Any time of the day, Octane Social House will offer wholesome fare in a comfortable, free Wi-Fi environment where all are welcomed to relax and enjoy a book, play a game of Jenga or Cards Against Humanity, or just enjoy the sights, sounds, and hospitality of a friendly staff and their patrons in this beautiful historic city.Our plans are to open the doors to the public on October 1, 2018, but a lot needs to get done before then.  We're certainly up for the challenge.  Any support you can provide this project will be greatfully received and provide the much-needed building blocks to make Octane Social House a reality.Thank you,Rob & Joni Otterstatter","Every project comes with unique risks and challenges... ours is no different.

We finished filming bit more of half the Film (The Films complete Duration will be around 100 Minutes) during 7 Months of Filming now and the biggest Problem wich i have at the Moment is the Music Score. I can make everything by myself just not Music and getting a nice Movie Score cost of course some Money and i just cant afford that all by myself. The Rest i would Invest in more Movie Weapons and Costumes, i have much more Crazy Stuff in my Mind wich i would like to put into that Movie.

The PlanAs a executive producer of the movie, I am responsible to raise funds and oversees the project.   Having a background in project management, I have broken down the whole project into 3 stage.  Every stage has specific deliverable.   During the pre-production phase, we are launching this Kickstarter campaign to raise $15,000 to get an short Animatic done, which would be used to pitch the movie to raise funds for next steps:  Production and Post Production.I already have a finished script that would be used to make storyboards which would be used to create a about a 10 minute Animatic.We would be working with a world class Canadian Pre-Production companies, that have served clients like Disney, Pixar, and DreamWorks.  While they would be directing, creating storyboards, and recording voice over (dialogue), I would be overseeing the whole process.All the money raised would be solely used to cover the production cost.  Any left over and extra raised funds would be apply towards the next two stages: Production and Post Production  In order to get the traditional investors involved, we need this Animatic done with your help.   So please join me on this journey and you will enjoy the ride.Thank you for your support!Whatever funds you contribute will help towards:We have some great rewards to offer!

https://www.kickstarter.com/projects/1369927907/scroll-stories-promo-animation?ref=discovery_category_newest,1369927907/scroll-stories-promo-animation,"That video is my nephew Nico! What a good dude! Hopefully if I receive funding for my project, one day I can give him a hard copy of my stories or a stuffed animal of one of my characters!The project you are donating to is to fund a promotional video for my website Scroll-Stories.com.I am going to create a 30-45 second promotional animation involving all the characters. The animation involves each character kind of introducing himself/herself to viewers with the hopes to draw them in and come visit my website.Right now I have two ideas for a promotional animation. One is strictly introducing the site, one is more like a spec for a show that will work as a promotional tool as well. Both will be around the same price and can be seen below:I have already contacted an animation studio about this video. They said a very rough estimate of pricing would be 10 - 15K! Animation is expensive! However, a promotional video would be absolutely huge for my site as I could post it on Youtube and link to Facebook, Twitter, Instagram, anything! Who knows, it might even go viral! I am asking for 15K because more than likely the animation will cost more than that and if it doesn't I will use whatever remaining money I have towards marketing the site and/or creating hard copies of my stories.The reason why I'm asking for $20,000 is to also fund the cost for creating the hard copies of the stories. This is also very expensive and can be up to $5,000 for limited copies of one book!So although this full project is heavily involved, right now I am only looking for money to create this video.Below is a description of what my actual site is about and the whole big picture of my project. It is a lot to take in, but I thought you might want to see what the animation is for. Please keep in mind all the money I raise will be going towards the promotional animation video and creating hard copies of the books. This is just the first step. I hope you are as inspired as me to make something fun and creative!www.scroll-stories.comAbove is the link to my company Scroll Stories. Scroll Stories is a free online collection of wacky short stories about ten hilarious characters. I am hoping to get paid through advertisements on the site. It is a fun website for viewers to read for a quick laugh.Right now, the goal is to create this website that has stories for each character. Currently I am writing all the stories. They will be posted in a blog-like manner. Each new story will be posted on the page ""Today's Story."" After that story is up for 24 hours it will be added the that character's page where the stories will build up over time and eventually readers will be able to ""scroll"" through each characters stories.I am also trying to run a promotion in which viewers will be able to send in their own stories about a character I created named Cliff Hanger. The promotion is for viewers to send in their stories about Cliff each month and I will pick the best one and display is on Cliff's page on my website. Whoever's story gets chosen for that month will receive $100.Lastly I am hoping to also have an e-commerce page where viewers can buy hard copies of the stories if the want and buy various paintings/drawings I have made along the years of my characters.However, this is just the beginning. This project is very involved and there are a lot of pieces to it. I envision becoming another Disney, Looney Tunes, or Charlie Brown-like company. I understand my goals are lofty, but I need to start somewhere! Below is a list of goals I am trying to incorporate into my site/company.1. I am a graphic designer and I also would love to add detailed and funny pictures relating to each story (that could also double as a meme to promote the site or a comic I could send into online newspapers). This would make the stories and website more exciting and entertaining.2. Pictures are great, but I would also love to add short animations to my website to go along with each story. Animations are extremely difficult and take a lot of time and practice. To pay for even a 10 second animation costs thousands of dollars.3. Another piece of the project would be creating hard copy versions of my stories and trying to get them published/sold at bookstores.4. One of my characters (Donnie Trumpet) is a Trumpet who is a famous Frank Sinatra, Michael Buble-esque singer as well as a world class trumpeter. I am also a musician and I am hoping to create a legit big band/jazzy Album for Donnie Trumpet which I would sell on my site/iTunes. I would sing and create the songs but it is very expensive to record songs. Once again this would take a lot of time and money.5. However as I said earlier, the website is just the beginning. If my site becomes a success and I earn enough money through it, then animation will be the next step (The website will still continue). I currently have three ideas for shows I would like to create and pitch to tv networks and netflix or even share like crazy on Youtube.5a. One idea is animating the full stories I have created for the website instead of just 10 second clips. Each show would be a different character's story kind of like Looney Tunes.5b. Another idea for a show is Walter Strawberry (my character who is striving to become a stand up right now in his stories) would be a Late Night talk show host. It would be set up like a real talk show. I would write his jokes and monologue and the guests would be the other characters as well as famous people (who I would animate). Also, Donnie Trumpet and his band would be the house band and I would create all the songs they make.5c. My last idea is to simply have a Walter Strawberry stand up special animated. I am very interested in stand-up and have always dreamed of being a comedian. If I could combine my website with stand up that would be pretty cool!However, for now, the main focus is marketing the website and combining pictures/short animations with each story and we'll see what happens!","1. Marketing - It is the biggest challenge I have and it costs a lot to advertise/market a new idea. With the money I receive from Kickstarter, the money will be put towards the promotional animation to market my site. However, it will still be tough even with this video. Sharing the animation could prove difficult, but I need the animation first!I would also market my site by advertising on Facebook (which I'm currently doing and it's very expensive) and Twitter.2. My website - it's is pretty good right now, but it is a makeshift website I created using a template builder. To have a website created professionally would not only look better but would be easier to promote and allow viewers to share each story. The e-commerce section of my site would also be easier if created by a professional. And most importantly getting ads on my site, whether it be through Google ads or through receiving jpgs of ads and putting them onto my site, would be a lot more easier and sufficient with a professionally developed website. Once again this costs thousands of dollars and takes time.",https://www.kickstarter.com/projects/1369927907/the-kid-and-friends?ref=discovery_category_newest,1369927907/the-kid-and-friends,"My name is Tom Burke.Here I am in my ""studio.""I'm an musician and producer who goes by the name ""The Kid"". I'm from Boston, and I'm incredibly excited to share my story and this album with you.In 2016 I purchased an iMac computer, Ableton Live 9, Native Instruments, Autotune (influenced by Kanye's 808s & Heartbreak), and a Roland FA-06 keyboard. These tools along with my microKorg synthesizer are what I have used to create all my beats.I create all my beats from scratch and currently don't sample from other songs.After a while, I had built up a pretty extensive portfolio of Hip Hop beats. I thought to myself, why not finally go all in on this and pursue my dream of being a musician/producer?At this time I had the idea to google up and coming rappers. I had put a lot of passion and time into these beats and I didn't want just anyone featuring on them, I wanted to get talented rappers to feature on them.I then began an almost addiction of researching every single rapper on the planet and emailing rappers I liked. I received my first feature from Rome Fortune in September of 2016 and from then I was hooked. I was able to get a pretty impressive list of rappers everywhere from Los Angeles, Chicago, Atlanta, New York and more, including five rappers from Boston, which I think is pretty cool.The entire features list includes:CyHi The Prynce, Mick Jenkins, IDK, G Perico, Mir Fontane, Michael Christmas, Tdot illdude, Supa Bwe, Rome Fortune,ScribeCash,Rob Markman, Dutch ReBelle,Kemba, Gio Dee, theMind, ScienZe, Daddio Smoov, Blanco BlackAfter a lot of hard work, energy, and money, I finally have all the features. I have been working on getting the songs for this album finished, mixed and mastered for over two years now as it is a very tedious and expensive process if done right. I am currently about halfway done with the mixing/mastering and am working with a very talented sound engineer, Mertz, from The Bridge Sound and Stage Studio to get this done.Up until this point I have funded this entire project with my own money: the equipment, the features, the mixing and future mastering. However, over the three years I've been working on this project, I've learned that marketing is just as important if not more important than the actual music itself.If no one hears your music, does it even exist?If this Kickstarter is successful, I will be putting the entire $5K towards marketing with the help of a Boston company Gupta Media. If by some chance more than $5K is raised, I would put all the extra money towards mixing and mastering. I have put too much passion, time, and money (wayyyyyyy too much! Woops!) into this project and I don't want to just release it on my social media and have barely anyone hear it. I want to do it the right way so that as many people as possible will be aware of it and hopefully give it a listen.I've questioned myself many times throughout these last three years on why I am even doing this project. It's truly been a wild journey of incredible lows and incredible highs and I've sacrificed a lot to put my all into this, but I've grown to learn I'm doing this simply because I love it and I want to. If people hear it and enjoy it, then the project was a success to me.If you donate to this Kickstarter and help me accomplish my goal I can not put into words how thankful and appreciative I will be. It would mean everything to me.Thank you for taking the time to read this and I hope you're as excited about this project as I am. Who knows what will happen if the right person hears this album! For updates and posts about this project and future projects (I already have my next album recorded!) follow the Instagram: @TheKidTunesBelow you can checkout some music I've released in the meantime, while working on The Kid And Friends.1. Pigs Fly (short Jazz/Big band inspired project. Not professionally mixed/mastered)2. Kewl Grewves (short Island/African inspired project. Professionally mixed and mastered by Mertz at The Bridge Sound & Stage)3. The Kid (Not professionally mixed/mastered).","There are always risks when producing and promoting a studio album, but I've learned a lot in my experience and I know just what to do to deliver this project efficiently. Also, all I want to do is release this album. Right now I don't care about making money or anything except releasing this album for people to hear. So if I am able to raise the 5K to put towards marketing, that's it really. There's no real risk."

Fashion has been her passion since she was 5 years old. She was raised in Detroit, Michigan and now resides in Kennesaw, Georgia. She has been sewing for over 28 years and throughout the years she has developed the ability to drape her designs to create her visions. She loves to design ready to wear apparel. Her designs are Sassy, Sexy and Classy and sometimes with a little twist. Her real passion is the admiration of formal and elegant fashions. Her inspirations comes to her from many sources surrounding her life. She created her first fashion line in 2011 Swice Collection and in 2012 Dezire Collection. These were just local to Facebook, family and friends. Making clothes is her serenity so she continues to make them for family and friends.I have the opportunity to present my cothing line at one of theAtlantaFashionWeek shows on August 9, 2014. My short term goal right now are trying to buy fabric, get a few patterns made, photo shoots of my designs. I am very thrifty and I try to shop thrifty and quality at the same time if you can understand that. But i really need help. My long term goal for the presentation is to really come up with some ready to wear fabulous wear that is classy, sexy and stylish hoping that a store or boutique will buy my brand. I need help in making this happen.",One of the challenges  are finding a person or company to make my patterns. I wanted to give a student that is in their last year the opportunity to do this so that they can start their portfolio. I also have started to look at local. My last option would be a company which would cost me more money that I don't have. Another challenge would be getting the production done if I get orders from my show. I do want to keep my production in the USA even though it looks advertising to go overseas. My thing with doing my clothes overseas. You don't know what you really are getting unless you are over there inspecting it yourself.  I am still looking for a company here in the USA. I have found some but not have been able to go take a look at their products. The number one challenge is TIME. I had a full time job. I made the sacrifice of getting a part time job so that I could have more time to work on my dream of having a clothing line. Before I decided to go part time I was exhausted by the time I got home. I always get up at 5 in the morning (internal clock). It took me 1 hour to get to work which was fine but getting home of course takes a little more than 1 hour and at the end of the day I am tired from working and driving. When I get home sometimes I feel guilty because my family gave me a break from cooking for 2 days sometimes 3 so I will cook. Now it is about 7 or 7:30 no time or energy spent in my sewing room. I literally never get to my sewing room until the weekends. That time sometimes was not well spent. Now I get off at 1 or 2 I come straight home to my sewing room. I have more energy in the morning to do my work now. This has been the best for me mentally and physically but not financially. This was one of the reason for me starting a Kickstarter account,https://www.kickstarter.com/projects/1434326212/childrens-boutique?ref=discovery_category_newest,1434326212/childrens-boutique,I am hoping the Kickstarter helps me to kickstart my business. I have a children's boutique shop called Lil Dollz n Gentz sizes start at preemies to size 8. I bought this shop at the end of August 2015. I am the only children's shop here with the items that i carry. I also custom make clothes too. and refashion clothes. I have been sewing over 30 years. I do have repeat customers. I came up with this name when i saw a picture with a little toddler boy and girl. the little girl look just like a baby doll she had all bows and feathered band around her head and the baby boy had on and little fedora hat and was holding the little girls hand. I just thought this was the cutest scene ever. I said to myself she look like a little doll and he looks like a little gentlemen. When i bought the shop I knew this was the name although i had my doubts I still decided to name it Lil Dollz n Gentz. I love children they are some very different unique little people. When i saw the shop for the first time it was so enchanting. I had so many vision for it and still do. I just don't have the funds to do them. A family member gave me the money to buy it. I told them i was going to give it back to them in payments even though i do not have to. When i bought it i had not money saved. all i had was 1000.00. I thought i was going to be able to get some inventory with it but i came in at a time when the rent was due and had to pay other fees to get thing started like insurance internet and licences. That assumed the 1000.00 plus. The items that my customers are asking for they are too expensive for me to get right now because i have to keep up with the popular items. So this forces them to take a long drive elsewhere. I also want to be able to donate a newborn layette basket to a person i need once a month to start. I have many ideas that will help parents and children and at the same time it helps me out too. I need to replenish my shop and kickstart it to going. If i can get a kickstart i will be able to get the things i need in the store and make the profit i need to do the other things.  Please please help me.,The challenges are making sure i get the items that customers want with minimum funds. I have young parents mid aged parents and grandparents that shop here not to mentions different culture and some like the expensive items and some like the cheaper items. Some like the expensive and want to pay way less. i try and satisfy all of my customers. This is were my shopping abilities come in. I shop for the good price and quality . I am in the middle of adding a layaway plan to the stop at the beginning of the year and I am adding bigger sizes

I had great support form the kickstarter community but unfortunately the campaign was not funded.In that past few months I have made tremendous progress with the game and the Alpha is now open for anyone to play. However the game is still missing numerous art assets. These assets aren't cheap, so I've returned to kickstarter to ask for your help.Fleet Wars is a browser based massively multiplayer turn based strategy game. The game is primarily text based, but will be packed full of beautiful 3D art and pre-rendered animations.The aim of the game is to rise up the rankings and become the most powerful empire in the universe. You will achieve your ranking by exploring, acquiring new planets and exploiting their resources to grow your population and drive your need to create the most powerful ships with the most advanced technologies.You will research your way through the tech tree to unlock the most powerful weapons and gain the knowledge to build ship classes like Dreadnoughts and the Star Destroyer. Once you have your first fleet, attack an opponent and fight for your place at the top of the leader board.Fleet Wars is free to play with nothing locked behind a paywall. The websites monetisation will be primarily driven by non-intrusive ads. In addition to this there will be a subscription model (advanced membership) which will remove the ads from all pages and unlock additional cosmetic customisation options.Fleet Wars will forever be an evolving game. New features will constantly be added and balancing the game will be a top priority.  Below is a list of the features that will be included in the initial release of the game.- Expeditions to find new planets- Planet Management- Economy Management - Design your own Ship- Commander leveling- Create a fleet of ships for each Commander- Research Tech Tree- Tech Tree will consist of passive bonuses, new weapons and new ship classes- Guilds- Declare War on other Guilds- Guild Rankings- Attack other players and NPC's- Steal other players Technologies- Raid other players planets- Destroy or steal other players planets$4,000 - Animated visual representation of how the battle played out.$7,000 - 99.9% up time. This will be achieved by using more expensive, better performing servers.$17,000 - Native Android and IOS apps.

Fleet Wars has been praised for its tight, intuitive mechanics but is held back by the browser platform.Space Pioneersbuilds on the core game-play of Fleet Wars with a re-imagined UI designed specifically for mobile devices. Built in the Unity 5 engine for Android and IOS, Space Pioneers is a much smoother experience, incorporating 3D interactive models and a much more streamline flow.Fleet Wars: Space Pioneers uses classic multiplayer turn based game mechanics: game time is based on a 10 minute turn interval. When constructing ships, researching new technologies, etc, you will need to wait a set amount of turns for these to complete.The main objective of Fleet Wars: Space Pioneersis to gain new planets to increase your production, thereby increasing the amount of ships you can construct.You can accomplish this task passively or offensively.Passive Play:If you don't want to always be on the offense, attacking other players, you can discover new planets in your neighboring solar systems by sending probes on expeditions. Although you wont be attacking other players, watch out for space pirates who regularly intercept passing probes to steal and sell for scrap metal.Offensive Play:Head out into the galaxy with guns blazing, sieging only the richest planets from your enemy. Even once you've defeated the enemy fleets, the battle is not yet won. You need to send your most cunning of diplomats to infiltrate the enemies government and convince the politicians to join your Empire.Solo Play:Although Fleet Wars: Space Pioneers is primarily a multiplayer game you can still play it solo. As well as other players there are a hand full of NPC Empires that you can attack to grow your Empire.Play as a team:Create an alliance with your friends or join an existing alliance. There is always safety in numbers. Use the diplomacy systems to declare wars and form alliances. See when your fellow alliance members have been attacked and use the retaliation system to let the enemy know not to mess with your alliance.Construction Priority:The relationship between your 3 Construction Priority values will influence the rate at which Laboratories, Military Bases and Cities are constructed.Collect and Sell Scrap Metal:Use your idle probes to earn some extra Credits by sending them on scouting missions. They will scout nearby systems collecting scrap metals deposited from ship battles.Vendors will buy scrap metal for different prices depending on the demand. Some times of day have a higher buying rate than others.Research:The technology an Empire possesses determines its success in this hostile universe.Use your vast network of laboratories from all your Planets to research new technologies to give you the upper hand in battle.Commanders:You have commanders in your commander pool waiting to be assigned to a fleet. Not all commanders are trained equally, you are able to dismiss commanders whose skill doesn't match your fleets tactics in hopes of a better suited commander entering your pool.Assemble Fleets:A fleet is made up of two equally important parts, a commander and ships. To gain a tactical advantage against your opponent, make sure to choose a commander with an appropriate skill set to take full advantage of your ships load out.Fleet Formations:Arrange your fleets on the war table to best exploit their strengths and weaknesses. A common strategy is to place cheap, heavily shielded ships on the front line to absorb the brunt of your opponent’s attack.Espionage:To get the upper hand in battle it always helps to know what you’re going up against. Send spies to gather intelligence on your opponents and use this information to carefully craft an invasion to counter the ship classes and fleet formation used by the enemy.Siege:Once you've defeated the enemy fleets, the battle is not yet won. You need to send your most cunning of diplomats to infiltrate the enemies government and convince the politicians to join your Empire.Raid:Attempt to fight your way through your opponents defending fleets and overcome their planetary defenses to raid their planet and steal as many resources as your ships will fit.Fleet Wars: Space Pioneers is free to play with an optional premium membership for $3 a month. A premium membership unlocks extra cosmetic customization such as changing the colour of you text in chat, ability to change your Empire name whenever you want, option to add a custom profile picture and specificautomation features such as auto upgrading planets.On success of this kickstarter campaign work will begin on transforming the prototype build into the final game. Much of the back end server code has already been written and the majority of the art assets have already been created. This significantly reduces the development time on Fleet Wars: Space Pioneer.We are expecting to have development builds ready for Android kickstarter backers in late December. Android and IOS apps are scheduled to be sent to the respective companies for review and acceptance into each of their stores in February. Android Kickstarter backers will be able to bypass this review period by installing the APK that will be sent to all backers on completion.We are estimating that 50% of the budget will be going towards server upgrades and fees. The remaining funds will go towards app development.So what does Fleet Wars: Space Pioneers bring to the mobile space that is new?We are focusing on creating a clean and intuitive UI design that doesn't feel like a chore to navigate on a small screen. Coupling this with our accurately simulated battle system, simulating every weapon fire individually, we feel that Fleet Wars: Space Pioneers is filling a hole in the mobile market.So join us on this journey and help make Fleet Wars: Space Pioneers happen!Backers who pledge $16 will be sent this Fleet Wars collectible card:Backers who pledge $20 will be sent a personalized Fleet Wars collectible card which includes their chosen name/username and backer number - once the kickstarter campaign is over, you will be sent an email requesting the name you would like printed on the card.",The major challenges we had when launching Fleet Wars were server stability issues. For budgetary reasons we have been using low end servers which didn't scale well once over 10 thousand planets had been discovered in the universe. Since the launch of our previous game the server-side code has undergone vast optimizations to lessen the load but we are forecasting a need to upgrade the hardware to cope with the increased size of the player base when Fleet Wars: Space Pioneers launches. This is where Kickstarter comes in. This will allow us to proactively upgrade our servers to ensure there wont be any stability issues.

If you haven't - it's not too late!Chocolate Covered Bacon (CCB) has become our #1 seller at all of our local craft/vendor shows, and we are hoping to share the delectable with the rest of the world.So, why are we Kickstartering this? We take our bacon to various shows throughout the year andalwayssell out of it in a short period of time. And therein lies the problem. We could make bacon all hours of the day, all days of the week, all weeks of the year and still not be able to keep up with demand. Our products are all completely handmade, so to make bacon in a small kitchen oven is just not cutting it for us. We have hopes of building a larger kitchen for our candy making, but we need to cover the cost of the addition, as well as purchasing a much larger oven for baking the bacon! Your support will go towards just that - it's a start, anyway!!By pledging and supporting us, you are funding a small town business that truly cares about their products and supporters.","Chocolate covered bacon is pretty straightforward. We already have a license for our business and we have passed all the necessary inspections that need to be done when making an edible/perishable product. The only risk I feel we may come across is not having enough bacon in our small little town to supply the demand! :) Our CCB is all hand made, so it will take a lot of effort to be continuously making bacon to fulfill the pledges. If we can only overcome that by pulling a couple more people on board, that is what we shall do. I am dedicated and driven to make this a successful thing, so any challenges will be one more opportunity to prove CCB's success!",https://www.kickstarter.com/projects/1437508249/a-healthy-cafe?ref=discovery_category_newest,1437508249/a-healthy-cafe,"I could go many directions with my story.. How I've never ""liked"" meat... How I ENJOY healthy food more, but the fast food is so much more convenient for my busy schedule... How I just love being in business development and finding new markets that aren't already available....Instead, I'll take it this route:My home town is small, rural, and sometimes old fashioned. When it comes to food options, there isn't much to choose from that is healthy or vegetarian friendly, unless you want a boring salad that you are served every time you go to an eatery and ask for the vegetarian/vegan options.After opening my first business in July of 2015, it only took me a few weeks before I saw the sale jump to the highest it has ever been. Sure, the stress played a large part in that, but so did the unhealthy, quick options I had relied on for weeks, if not months, while I was ""too busy"" to cook 3-4 meals every day.It was then that I decided I needed healthy options that would not break the bank, would taste good, and could be ready quickly. Why not open a cafe that fits the budget, has healthy options, keeps it cruelty free (because you know I love my animals), makes the food delicious, and still has the option for people to pick it up while they are in a hurry to get along with their day?It's a nameless cafe at the moment. I want my customers to have the opportunity to weigh in on the title.It will be healthy and affordable.Quick and easy (maybe even an ordering up down the future, and we will meet you on the street and hand it to you as you drive by).No meat will be served, but I promise you won't even know it's missing!Your opinion will matter. Be sure to weigh in on the foods you love, the foods you don't and what you'd like to try there!","First thing first - we need to get the cafe set up to start cooking. Currently, the kitchen is missing a few key pieces of equipment that we would need to purchase before we can start the ball rolling.Our next hurdle, getting it inspected and up to code. I'm confident in my capability of ensuring the safest food conditions, but we need to convince the city to give us time to come in and set us up. Last hurdle - finding a cook, chef, barista, cafe manager, etc. So, if you will be interested in working as such once we open, we are now accepting applications!"

I choose to see the funny side to most things. I want to give an honest look behind the curtain of teaching in a high school. It's not all smiles, highlighters and perfect PowerPoints. There will also be a smattering of anecdotes, whinging and anything that is floating around in the quagmire of my mind.Life is hard sometimes and life is funny sometimes. Help me write my blog and get my thoughts out in the world.....if nothing else my wife will be pleased I'm not bothering her!I want to entertain, motivate and develop my creative mind.The money you donate will go towards web hosting, advertising, kickstarter fees, tea, biscuits and maybe a pint of Guinness (Medicinal!)Huge thanks in advance,Paul",I have been micro-blogging for a couple of years now on various social media so I'm already in the habit of doing so. The biggest barrier is generating traffic to my blog. I have already started generating potential viewers through my Instagram (@teacherofsci).  I have generated over 2k new followers in the first 10 days alone; this figure will grow exponentially.,https://www.kickstarter.com/projects/teacherofsci/teacherofscicom-supporting-teachers-everywhere?ref=discovery_category_newest,teacherofsci/teacherofscicom-supporting-teachers-everywhere,"Hi, I'm Paul Stevens-Fulbrook, I am a high school Science teacher and education blogger based in Brighton, UK.teacherofsci.com is my pet project, I launched the website 19 months ago with the goal of helping teachers in three areas; classroom management, wellbeing and money. After canvasing teachers in all areas of the world, I found that these are three pinch points common to all teachers (myself included). Since I published my first blog post, the website has grown considerably, in terms of the amount of content, the site's authority and reputation and the number of educators who have benefited from my content.I publish content in the following topics:With monthly page views between 40-50k and unique visitor numbers approaching 20k, the site continues to grow at an impressive rate. The site has been featured on big websites such as Readers Digest, Twinkl and UpJourney as well as being cited on the websites of very big university websites including; the University of Wisconsin, Fordham University, California State University and the University of Saskatchewan.What has totally blown me away though, is the immense reach (and therefore, need) my website has. In the last 12 months, I have had visitors from 207 out of the 241 countries and territories in the world (The United Nations) (according to Google Analytics).This has opened my eyes in a big way. If a little site like mine, run by one little, very busy man (I'm 5'4) can be this helpful globally, there must be so many more teachers that I can help, teachers like me!..and, if that's not enough, I've just (last week) won an international blogging award for best education blog (Infinity blog awards).One thing is clear in my mind right now, teacherofsci.com needs to urgently grow to be able to support even more teachers. Whilst other players in this area have huge budgets and many people working for them, I'm doing this on my own with whatever scraps of spare cash I can put into it.I have plans for many more things that will help teachers, for example embedded tools that will help teachers (classroom timers, educational games and calculators to name a few).The money I am asking for will be used exclusively to scale up the website. It will be used for a couple of paid-for tools (that will help me get my content out to more teachers), a course (maybe two) that will allow me to learn more about running this type of project (this is my first website), embedded tools for the website (see above) and the rest being used to pay for more content written by experts in their educational area (at present I am writing most of the content myself, with the rest being written by generous educators and writers for free).More content on the site = more routes into the site = more teachers helped.Simple.If by chance my target is beaten considerably I will be able to employ someone to help me with the daily running of the site on a part-time/freelance basis.Please help me help more teachers globally.Thank you,Paul Stevens-Fulbrook (AKA TeacherOfSci).","The risks to you on this project are, as I see it minimal, teacherofsci.com is already established and running very well. I work very hard on it and am 100% committed to it continued growth and success. Challenges for me would be, as always, time."

Chocolate floral petit four™ are United States Patent Pending # 62143034.I invented the chocolate floral petit four™ because I had a problem which was to create a edible and environmentally friendly product that was new. I solved the problem by taking a petit four and surrounding it with chocolate. The chocolate flowers are constructed with 7 edible elements which could be almost anything. The chocolate flower invention can be made from cake, ice cream, fruit, chocolate bonbons and chocolate truffles. The outer layer is customizable also with choices like chocolate dipped potato chip, cracker’s, pretzels even crispy bacon could be made into a flower. These examples represent just a few of the choices available.I worked for over a year and half to perfect the chocolate floral petit four™.  At first the flowers were so ugly lol I laugh but they were very ugly. During the year and half I learned allot about working with chocolates and how to incorporate chocolate with other foods. I used my 30 years of culinary experience, culinary school and U.S. Navy cooking experience to invent the chocolate flower. I enjoyed the patent process with the United States Patent and Trademark Office. Researching the world over looking for anything similar in method of construction was difficult. The chocolate floral petit flour™ survived all the research and I filed the provisional patent application in April 2015The exciting function of the chocolate floral petit four™ invention is how something so simple and beautiful can really improve the environment and be helpful to people. Customers can make each flower their own sweet or unsweetened. Which helps people with allergies and or diet restrictions receive a beautiful edible flower. Money is saved by combining other wise separate items.The environment is helped by not having to plant as many flowers which lowers the need for pesticides and water. As if all that is not enough the invention also revolutionizes the gift basket and edible bouquet industries by providing options that are fresh and new.The Chocolate floral petit four™ is more than just a beautiful food item, it has a purpose.The personally satisfying part is how the invention helps people and the environment. At first I invented the chocolate floral petit four™ because I had a problem which was to create a edible and environmentally friendly product that was new. I solved the problem by taking a petit four and surrounding it with chocolate and adding options. The result of the chocolate floral petit four™ invention is much more than just a beautiful food item the chocolate flower invention has a purpose.I am asking for  Kickstarter community donations to build a manufacturing facility.This facility will be both a chocolate café plus a site to ship my chocolate flower through out the nation. YOUR DONATIONS WILL BE USED TO:   lease a space, hard and soft cost of construction at $150.00 a square foot minimum, equipment that includes ovens, mixers, chocolate temper’s, stove, kitchen exhaust hoods and fan, refrigerators and freezers, sinks, tables, doughnut robot, cash register, ice cream dip cabinet and pastry display cases and the furnishings for the cafe. Plus initial start up fixed cost. The clear end of the project is when the cafe is fully constructed and is ready to open. The space requirement needed is 2,000sqft. The location of the café  will be in the San Fernando Valley area of Los Angeles California. Were the median income supports chocolate concept cafés. Plus the patent allows the cafe to operate locally and web based with out competition for 20 years.The café menu is focused on all chocolate items. The menu items are used to construct the chocolate flower invention also. Providing the customer the ability to see, taste and watch construction of their fresh made chocolate floral petit four™.BY backing this project your donation will be put to use for the purpose of providing delicious edible flowers that help people with allergies and diet restrictions get a beautiful flower. But also help the environment and modernizes a whole industry with new and fun products that feel good to purchase. ",Construction of a new food service project in the City of Los Angeles involves allot of city permits and inspections. Relying on other work to be done in-order to be inspected / approved / permitted. Architectural plans have to be reviewed and approved and the health department is a key department through out the construction phase.I have met with City of Los Angeles Building and Safety Department. This city department has an express program designed pacifically for new restaurants. The express program lines up all city departments relevant for the food service construction. The express program is designed to cut the red tape and time wasted waiting for permits and inspection.I have met with other Los Angeles City departments like The Small Business Administration and SCORE small business resource plus City of Los Angeles Business Source - Valley Economic Development Center. These departments gave me the resource and ability to call upon them to find solutions to problems that may arise. Also I use these departments to inspect my projects and seek their knowledge and advice. Having met with various city departments and setting up a fail safe procedure just in case of a misshape. Their could me a issue that is out of my hands to for-see causing a delay. If the delay is such that it would affect rewards I have set up use of a licensed commercial kitchen that can be use to fulfill rewards.I am a communicator at all phases of the project their will be updates and photos and your ability to vote on various issues of the project.

It would always be delivered by truck in the future.There are millions of LAST stories, let alone life tales.What if we were able to capture their history and display it to the world?Imagine a child who loves trains, logging into the database, selecting stories from our elders about traveling or working on an old steam locomotive? Can you feel and see the excitement as he listens to an old man say, ""Yeah, Ole Bessy ran the line keeping small towns connected. People would tell me that they could hear the CHUG-CHUG way in the distance and would come to the depot to see what was coming that was new and exciting.""This is just a small example of what I would like to do.

I would like to gather stories from all countries. We are a world community and we all need to share in its history. Good or Bad.I can't offer grand prizes, but a project like this provides rewards far beyond the physical realm.Once this takes off I will be asking people, just like you, to talk with your elders and get their stories, now before we lose another piece of history.Please take care and if you can, donate. If you can't, today so many are living on meager salaries, I understand, so pass the project on and maybe others will be able to.If I see that my project is going to be successfully funded, I will create a nonprofit organization for the life of this idea.

When I started this business in 2012, I had no idea where my vision would take me. I assumed I would just sell dinners from my home as an extra income. At that time my daughters education was quite expensive and the side business took care of those expenses. Well fast forward four years....I've lost my job, experienced a fire in my home which turned into a loss of income since I have a duplex, no home owners insurance for repairs and a business in limbo. With that being said, I come to you humbly asking for your assistance. I would love to expand my business by purchasing a food truck which would put me in a better financial state to take care of my daughter. We all know owning a business comes with a price tag. The funds I'm asking for will cover the purchase of a truck, eqiupment needed and insurance. Yes, the city of Chicago demands a huge amount when it comes to food trucks and I want to be ready for those expenses as well. It's true, Big Mamas Kitchen is on the rise but there are obsticles and hurdles in my path that need assistance. Any donation large or small would be greatly appreciated. My family and I would like to thank you from the bottom of our hearts for your genorsity. I also plan to pay it forward once my goal is reached.  It's NEVER easy telling a story of misfortune, it took alot for me to get to this point.  My mother always said (for every blessing recieved you must pass on a blessing). So I thank you in advance for taking this journey with me and hope to see you as a customer soon.....","As you can see, I am currently facing challenges as we speak.

I began by only doing a couple private lessons out of asingle room that I rented one day per week. Over the past couple years, theschool has grown exponentially to over 100 students in a rural area of northJersey. I originally opened with the intention of one day being in a facilitythat would also enable me to offer training in circus arts. Classes such as aerialacrobatics, German globe, juggling, balancing, and acrobatic adagio were to be onour future curriculum. All of those hopes and dreams were cut short in September of 2013 when I was informed that my entire studio had to be cleared out by mid November 2013. Thelandlord was terminating my schools lease early, not by any fault of my own, but rather, in the interest of receiving greater profits from a new tenant.We were forced to move into a temporary space within the same building that was toosmall, had very large support columns in the middle of the room, and was overall just notappropriate for dance and tumbling training. We completed our season in June 2014 andthen packed up the studio for a second time. My school has officially been in storage since Julyof 2014. I have found a beautiful 4,000 sq warehouse space that will allow meto expand the school and add the circus arts program that I have always dreamedof offering. I am doing my best to make it happen but the finances aredwindling very fast. Most of the funds have been devoted to the townzoning board, as well as the lawyer and planner that I needed to pay in order togo before the town zoning board. Luckily, I have been able to make the downpayment on the space. With the funds that I receive from Kickstarter, I intendto finish all necessary construction, custom build a stall bar stretch system, build a gymnastic spring floor 24 X 42,as well as purchase (and have professionally installed) as many pieces ofcircus apparatuses as possible. This includes silks, lyras (aerial hoops), balance canes, andlanding mats. On behalf of my students and staff, we thank you for taking the time to read our story. Wehope that with your help, Metro Dance & Acrobatic Company will be up and running again very soon!","Once this project is complete, the main challenge I face will be reviving my clientele. Due to the strict zoning laws, as well as the limited availability of appropriate spaces, the new location of the school is actually 35 minutes away from the original location. Some of my original clients are willing to travel but I am ultimately moving the school into new territory.

She began the school by doing a couple private lessons out of a single room one day per week. Over the past 3 years, the school has since grown to 6 staff members and over 100 students in a rural area of northern New Jersey. MDAC was originally opened with the intention of one day relocating to a spacious facility that would enable the staff to instruct classes in various forms of circus arts. In July of 2014, MDAC closed it's rural location and has since been in the process of moving into a beautiful 5,000 sq ft warehouse space that is more suburban and closer to New York City. This new facility will allow MDAC to expand the school and finally add the circus arts program as originally intended. Since most of the money allocated to this project has been devoted to the town zoning board, the down payment on the new space, and construction of the facility, the school is running out of capital for equipment.With the funds raised on Kickstarter, we intend to build a gymnastic spring floor (15ft X 40ft), purchase all aerial equipment and have it professionally rigged, as well as acquire as many pieces of circus apparatuses as possible.

Step into a fantastically crafted hobbit hole, decorated with all the trappings and details you would expect to see of such a place. Find costumes that will let you become your favorite characters. Act out your favorite scenes or make up your own. You will also be delighted with food that would tickle the fancy of any hobbit. You won't just step into a hobbit hole, but into world of magic.The Hobbit HoleIn this Hobbit Hole I will be building, I will add massive amounts of details that will make you forget the world of Humans. It will have a stone fire place as the center piece of the living room. Lounge in a large conferrable chair as you warm your feet by the fire. Pull up a hand crafted chair to the dinning table to enjoy a truly hobbit like meal. In the bed room, you will be able to find a wardrobe of themed cloths to help the imagination in its wonderings. While authentic hobbit holes would not have a bathroom, this hobbit hole will include a full working bath room. Electricity will also be a feature that hobbits in the past have not enjoyed. Of course it will feature round doors and ceiling. It will also have grass growing on top.Added ItemsI will be using local artist to create decorative pieces. Some of these will include paintings, blown glass, and wood carvings. Second BreakfastFood offered will consist of Hobbits delights. Fresh berries, cheeses, jams, bread, eggs, sliced meats, meat and fruit pies are all things you will find set before your table. Feast upon the food that will satisfy any hobbit.The LocationEveryone knows what a Hobbit Hole is, but few people can travel worlds away to experience one for themselves.

The only thing that is left is a puddle of wax and a burnt wick. But it doesn't have to be that way. Candles can be more than just a temporary source of light when the power goes out. What once was set a blaze to leave nothing now brings hidden secrets and a story to share. DesignsIn this I am bringing you my first design. A face that melts into a skull. This design is a regular human face, but I will have more to come. The next design I have in the works will be a zombie face. I also plan to do other Halloween themed faces such as a witch and pumpkin. I would also like to one day be able to do custom faces (don't like your boss? Send me a picture and you can be melting his face in no time).SpecsThe candle is 7.5 inches tall not including the wick and 6.5 inches wide (this will vary slightly). It has five wicks. One burns down the center into the skull with four wicks that burn down the outside, one in front and back, and one on each side. It weighs between 3 and 4lbs (this will vary slightly as well). The face takes approximately 2-3 hours to melt off the skull with a total burn time around 5 hours.The FundsI will be using the funds to purchase equipment to make molds to make the production of the candles faster and more uniform. I will would like to eventually get it a manufacture so that they can be massed produced. This will also help me in the production of other designs. The funds will also go to the design and creation of a website so you can purchase them anytime. I will be pursuing retail stores as well. That way the candles can be purchased without shipping cost to the customer. This will also require packaging design and production. DisclaimerIn the video I say that this was my idea. The idea of melting candles with something inside was my idea, but the idea for a face with a skull inside, in particular, came from my bother-in-law Johnathan Prusse. With his creative help this project has come to life.",My main concern is shipping.  These candles are very heavy in a shipping perspective.  I am currently only allowing shipping to the United States.  It is flat rate so the more you buy the cheaper shipping is.  I will be working hard on reducing cost and working with distributors so my candles can be made available around the world.

The concept was simple: Two broken men, one a disabled veteran and the other HIV-positive, overcome their pessimism about their romantic futures and find self-acceptance and love. Which immediately sounded to me like it could very well be, if I did it wrong, the Worst Lifetime Movie Ever Made.Luckily, that wasn't the case. The novel's received 4.5 stars on Amazonwith almost 100 reviews, and was co-winner of the Rainbow Awards for Best Gay Romance in 2014.Doing my research for the character of Tom, who lost his legs in Afghanistan, I realized what a scandal our entire system of veterans' care had become. And what little has changed since I published in 2013 may now soon be undone.So when I published the book, I decided I would donate 50% of the proceeds to veterans' organizations, in perpetuity.When I did the audiobook, I decided I would do the same.I've now raised and sent almost $6,000 to Iraq and Afghanistan Veterans of America and Puppies Behind Bars, among others. I'll also be donating 10% of any screenplay proceeds (book rights, option(s), script sale, points, etc.). [FYI all $ have been donated under my legal name, Orland Outland - I know, that sounds like the made up author name...]When I decided to write my first screenplay, ALTB was the perfect place for me to start. It had a small cast, few locations, a compelling storyline, and oh yeah, cute animals, since Tom trains service dogs for a living. It's an ideal indie movie with broader appeal than the LGBT romance angle suggests.The greatest challenge will be casting Tom, who's lost both his legs above the knees. But I have the feeling that if the movie is made, when the casting call goes out, that the right person, the perfect person for the role, will show up. That CGI won't be necessary. Call it a hunch.And now the pitch...The screenplay is written. Now come the costs involved in analysis/feedback, promotion, and ""continuing education.""The BasicsScript hosting on the Black List site, Inktip, etc. that makes the script available to industry professionals. ($25 - $40/month total)Contest entry fees for ""realistic"" contest possibilities such as the WeScreenplay Diversity Voices contest - as opposed to the AMPAS/Nicholl where I haven't a prayer ($50-80 apiece)Paid evaluations by professional readers, screenwriters, and contest judges, available in addition to contest fees in some competitions ($50-80 apiece)WriterDuet (screenplay mode) subscription fees ($100/year)The best screenwriting books I'm currently reading as library books (The Hidden Tools of Comedy, Crafty Screenwriting, Screenwriters Bible, etc.) ($100)The Bigger Ticket Items:A trip to LA in late June for Scriptfest/Pitchfest, to get in front of actual producers, network with other screenwriters, and hone my story pitching skills. ($375/500 for the class, $500 for transpo/hotel)A short filmmaking class (already underway) where I'm learning how to cast, direct, shoot, etc. so that who knows... one day I might make the movie myself. ($200)I'm confident in my ability to learn the tools I need. Over the last two years, I learned how to make audiobooks ""from scratch,"" and now I've narrated, edited and produced three of them from my own novels.So for this round of financing, I'm looking for ""script development"" money to get the screenplay to a place, creatively and professionally, where it can be seen by those who have the power to make it a real movie. And barring that, to get me to a place where I can Do It Myself.So please check out the cool prizes, and thanks for your support!","The risks are low, as I've set my expectations for this project in phases. The goal for this phase is not to raise enough $ to get the film made, but to get the screenplay in the best shape it can be, and get it in front of people who can Make This Happen, or help me Make It Happen myself. When I became a self published author five years ago, I knew nothing about selfpub. Then I learned how to create my own ebooks, design my own covers, write my own blurbs, run my own promotional campaigns. I now offer ebook and paperback formatting services and created a video tutorial on creating your own covers in GIMP for $1 (the cost of a stock photo).When I decided to start doing audiobooks, I knew nothing about audio. I learned how to create a recording environment, got the best equipment at the lowest price, and mastered the editing and production process. I now have three finished audiobooks on Audible, and have made myself available as a narrator for other authors!What this means is that I'm self directed and I get very good at what makes me excited! And movie making is what really excites me now. The greatest risk to this project is that, even with a great script, nothing may happen, no deal, no option, no movie. But that's the risk that comes with every script.",https://www.kickstarter.com/projects/bradvanceauthor/crunch-a-comedy-webseries-about-the-housing-crunch?ref=discovery_category_newest,bradvanceauthor/crunch-a-comedy-webseries-about-the-housing-crunch,"Watch episode 1 NOW on Vimeo!https://vimeo.com/251681604AND, you can read the finished episode 2 script here!http://bit.ly/2DAFnY5 “To make ends meet, a permanently outsourced tech worker turns his basement into six tiny, Hong Kong style living quarters, and rents them out to desperate millennials with few other housing options.”Think of it as a modern and far more dysfunctional Downton Abbey.We need your help to make the rest of our 6 episode season. Episode 1 was made on a budget of $50, the cost of craft services from Costco. The goal is to make the best possible show for the least amount of money.The series is shot in a single location, Brad’s house. Brad’s writing all the scripts this way because that means no weather issues, no permit or permission issues, no worries about “losing light” or photobombers or all the usual little crises that come with multi-location filming. But, the decision to film all episodes 100% at the house is a limit that demands ingenuity in storytelling, and puts the focus on the stories of the “Darwinian struggle” within the house, and the messed-up but ever changing landlord-tenant power dynamics.We storyboard comprehensively, we rehearse frequently, Brad runs his scripts repeatedly through a screenwriting group. You can check out Brad's Reddit post here, on the details of prep for Episode 1.Come shooting day, we’re as prepared as any filmmakers can be. All this enabled us to film the 9 ½ minute first episode in one ten hour day!Episode One could be made for “free” because our cast and crew gave their time for something they believe in. Because of the parameters I've set (single location I control, rigorous prep), we don’t need a metric ton of money to do this! But going forward, we do need an editing-capable PC, Adobe Creative Suite, and additional equipment including LED lighting panels.If the funds raised exceed the basic needs in the budget below, the money will go to pay production costs including cast and crew, who will love you forever for that.WHO AM I?I’m a longstanding DIY guy. As a self published author, I’m responsible for writing the books, copy editing them, writing the jacket copy, even doing the covers for the most part, formatting the paperback, exporting the MOBI and EPUB ebooks…As an audiobook narrator of my own books, I narrate, edit and produce them myself. When I started, I didn’t know what a noise floor was or a peak level, but I learned fast. CRUNCH is my directorial debut, take a look and decide for yourself how I’m doing so far! And my first foray into editing was the short clip above, made in Camtasia out of the final MP4 video file, the music clips, and voiceover I recorded on my Blue Snowball. That's my ""use what you got"" aesthetic at work, so just imagine what I can do with Adobe Creative Suite!AND THE MONEY IS FOR…Here’s the breakdown:It's a modest goal, to cover the essentials for us to move forward. If we exceed the goal, the funds will be used to compensate the participants for their time and labor. This is the ideal situation, but in an ""all or nothing"" fundraiser, it's critical to set a lower bar.","I’ve worked very hard to minimize the risks involved in the project. Filming 100% in my house means there are no weather issues, permit or permission issues. Creating an ensemble cast means that even if an actor gets famous and moves to LA overnight, I can chuck a script and turn the focus to a different resident of the house. Taking on directing, writing, production, acting, and now editing of future episodes, is a huge workload, but after episode 1, my acting presence will be diminished, and the first time director jitters are over and done with. I’m a big fan of the Robert Rodriguez ethos: use what’s at hand, don’t wait for permissions, don’t wait for people, and most importantly, the more you can do yourself, the fewer moving parts there are that can break and stop you in your tracks. (And if you turn out to be the part that breaks, well, then you can reach out for help!) I workshop these scripts through my local screenwriting group, and take their great notes into account. I run them as stage pieces in my acting class to see where the jokes land, or don’t. I rehearse with my actors and take their notes on new jokes or sight gags. I’m not that guy, who can’t take a note! On episode one, it was a PA who came up with the idea of Jake and Liz folding their arms in defiance of Brad near the end, and I loved it and we filmed it, and it’s funny. The main risk is that I’ll be a first time editor on episode 2, but as an audiobook narrator, editor and producer I’m comfortable with that process. I’ve also done instructional design work for years, Adobe Captivate, Articulate Storyline, and I have a good sense of presenting content visually so as to keep viewers engaged. I’ve been immersing myself in Walter Murch, classic texts and new textbooks, just as I immersed myself in Judith Weston’s Directing Actors, Michael Rabiger’s Directing, the My First Movie series, and a ton of other books on directing before episode 1, my first foray into film directing. I’m confident that my technical and artistic skills will also transfer to film editing!"

Here's what we think are the mostly likely hurdles we may face:-	Hidden costs can blindside you. This could be shipping costs, lost shipments, damaged product, etc. We’ve done an in-depth cost forecast* in an effort to predict as many of these as possible (available above, if you're interested in details), and we’re keeping most of our rewards digital for just this reason. The few exceptions are rewards we feel people will really want (and will be easy to ship). We want to give you valuable rewards that won’t just collect dust on a shelf too. This is why we’ve decided not to do Tshirts, mugs, or other such items.-	Fullfilment can be a time-consuming, organizational nightmare if you’re not hyper-organized like Angel is (she was a project manager at hectic Microsoft Game Studios). Excel spreadsheets are her best friend, and this isn’t her first Kickstarter rodeo. She successfully Kickstarted an anthology called DEEP CUTS and so is familiar with Kickstarter’s wonderful tools for helping project managers manage rewards.-	With an ongoing project like this, you may get the first issue, but what about the rest? We’re planning ahead for a whole year of content (4 issues) and have set our goal to ensure we can provide four complete issues. If successful, we will be able to at least provide four rich issues of mind-bending content.-	What if Angel gets hit by a bus? That is a question worth asking. It takes a tribe to put together a project like this, and we are blessed with a hugely competent one that will step up if Angel earns her wings unexpectedly. :D-	No matter what, if you pledge, you will know about our challenges and risks to fulfillment shortly after we identify that there’s a problem. Communication is our middle-name, and we want to build a loving long-term relationship with our subscribers (you!).",https://www.kickstarter.com/projects/angelmccoy/commissions-matt-haley-draws-your-inner-badass?ref=discovery_category_newest,angelmccoy/commissions-matt-haley-draws-your-inner-badass,"One day, comic-industry veteran Matt Haley was chatting with his writer friend Angel McCoy about how everyone has an alter ego. We all have that imaginary personality inside, the one we would be if we had a fairy godmother or a magic wand. It occurred to us that it would be amazingly fun to see who/what people's alter egos were, their true selves unfettered by mundane worries, social norms, and gravity.So, we decided to collect some alter egos, but we need your help!Pledge to not only fund the book but to get your inner badass into it!You be you!Once you've pledged one of the levels with a drawing, we'll send you a survey of thoughtful, inspirational questions about your alter ego. You'll choose your genre, be it Fantasy, Superhero, Horror, SciFi, Steampunk, Post-Apoc, or whatever you feel suits your inner self.You fill out these questions and send them back, then Matt will apply his own imagination to your description to bring out the truly magical version of your true self.In this way, you and Matt will collaborate to produce a unique piece of art that will belong to you, will be included in the book ""Drawn into It,"" and will impress your friends for years with a true understanding of the depth of your being.We can't wait to get started! Can you?Matt will pencil and ink your unique drawing on a 2-ply Bristol board sheet of the dimensions you chose. You will receive this original art when you choose one of the Original rewards. You will receive a high-quality scan of it in digital format when you choose one of the Digital rewards.If you wish to have your piece colored, then Matt does that digitally in order to retain the highest quality. When you choose a COLOR Digital reward, you will receive a digital file of the drawing. When you choose a COLOR Original reward, you will receive the digital file, the original B&W inks on Bristol board, and a quality color print of your drawing on water-color paper (signed and numbered #1).These will not be ""to order"" portraits, but will be Matt's interpretation of your survey answers. It's a collaboration between your imagination and his.No nudity. No sex. No gorey violence. No neo-Nazis. No racism. Matt and Angel have the right to reject any concept that offends them.We cannot put copyrighted characters in the book.We retain the right to use these drawings for marketing the book worldwide in any medium and to print in the book ""Drawn Into It"". You may use them for your own purposes, as you wish, with no limitations. It would be nice if you gave Matt credit if you post them publicly.The characters themselves will belong to Matt Haley, though the drawing belongs to you.We have set December 2018 as our deliver deadline for the book because with all the art that will need to be created, we want to give Matt plenty of time. However, we will be sending out each drawing when it is completed.If you would like to gift a portrait to someone else, you may do so. When you fill out the survey, just mark it as a gift. Then, you may fill out the survey, or your giftee can. As you wish. We'll be in touch to discuss further logistics if you mark your purchase as a gift.If you'd like to have more than one person or pets in a portrait, we can accommodate that. You will pay an extra fee by purchasing an add-on for each extra person or pet. We'll then be in touch to find out if you want those individuals to complete their own surveys or if you will complete them yourself. The add-on cost for each extra subject is $75.Most recently providing art for the ""Justice League"" film for Warner Bros. and French fashion designer Jean-Paul Gaultier, Matt Haley has been illustrating for Marvel and DC Comics for years on characters ranging from ""The Defenders"" to ""Superman"" and has worked with ""Spider-Man"" creator Stan Lee for over a decade on films and TV projects like ""Comic-Con: Episode IV"" and ""Who Wants to Be A Superhero?"" as well as for TV series like FOX's  ""Gotham"".

I'm an independent filmmaker and I just made my first feature film called Despair, currently on Amazon and in the festival circuit. I'm starting pre-production of my next film called The Job and I need your help folks. Logline: When five guys robbed the bank, they thought that the robbery itself is the hardest part of the job. It's an action movie inspired by Tarantino's Reservoir Dogs. It's set in not too distant future.I have finished the screenplay and ready to roll. This kind of movies are expensive to film, and since we're filming it in London, England it makes it even harder. Remember Snatch (2000), ""Anything to declare? Yeah. Don't go to England.""? This is kind of film I want to make. Yes it's about the bank robbery, but it's also about being unable to do anything when you literally hold millions in your hands. In short, five men rob a bank, then successfully get away and to the safe house where they come to realize that they just been played like kids. Now they have to find out what happened and who set them up while time is running out and whole city's police are after them. The problem is, they can't leave.I've been making movies for a while now, and I figured that I need at least £5,000 to make this film. Equipment is expensive to rent, locations are hard to find. Leave alone filming on the streets of London during the day with machine guns and men wearing masks! Oh, and did I mention explosions? Yeah, there will be explosions too.I have to warn you tho, the screenplay has some heavy language to it. I think that's an important part of the story on its own, and people won't think about what they are saying when they are put in stressful situations. Especially these guys.Each one of those characters is unique and brings something to the table, piece by piece. It might not be clear or obvious at first, remember they are hired criminals to get a job done. But when you see the whole picture and realize what happened to them you will be impressed.  In short, think about it this way: guns + money + limited time + brain play = kick ass film! A lot of talented people are involved in this film, from music composer who creates incredible and very emotional pieces to visual effects artist who makes sure what you see seems real enough to be believed and ensures you enjoy viewing experience best possible. ","So yeah, support me guys. With your help we will overcome every challenge and make a kick ass movie.",https://www.kickstarter.com/projects/hanko/the-job-help-us-make-this-indie-feature?ref=discovery_category_newest,hanko/the-job-help-us-make-this-indie-feature,"A feature film shot in two days, with one camera, one lens, one light.Hello everyone, my name is Hank Orion and I'm making my second feature film and I really need you help with covering the cost of the post production. Edit, music, sound, foley and more. It's a film shot in two days, with one camera, one lens and one light.Please donate as much as you can bellow, and in return you will receive a copy of the film and a film credit. Back in 2014, when my life was a complete mess and I did not know what to do with it, I wrote a screenplay called The Job. Back then, I was living in London, I was working full-time in a restaurant and I just got myself a new camera. So I decided to write a simple, yet exciting story I can easily shoot without relying on other people. It took me a while. I would come from work late at night around 1 AM, and start writing, sometimes without looking at the watch. Sometimes I would oversleep work, and often call sick the next morning to finish a particular piece of the story. So yeah, I wasn't that of a productive employee. One year later, I wrote what seemed like a story that can be made into a film. The problem was I got carried away too much in the process and ended up with something that had lots of police chases on the streets of London, explosions, bank scenes, and even a helicopter scene. Soon I realized that I won't be able to shoot it, and eventually I abandoned the script. Then my life took a few turns, and I ended up making Outsiders instead, a simple forest story that was shot in few days. Eventually, I found myself in Los Angeles, and I showed the script to a couple of friends of mine who are quite successful in what they do and they seem to like it, we had a few meetings but it did not go beyond that. Then I started working on Heaven's Light, what later became Despair. That was a period of my life where I wanted to make a good drama film, and eventually I shot Despair in Scotland in early 2017. After we wrapped Despair I started to think what next. I wrote few other scripts and they were okay, and then I remembered about The Job again and decided to work on it. It took me a couple of months to rewrite the story. I had to change a lot. What was a classic Hollywood heist movie, became something not that many filmmakers do. It became one location, one scene film that goes on for a hundred pages. I could call it an artistic decision, but I would be lying as budget dictated everything. I knew I could not afford to shoot it the traditional way, so I changed and changed it to fit the wallet. I ended up with a one really long scene, six actors, one location and a real-time film. I really got inspired by Tarantino's movies and in particular Reservoir Dogs on this one. Tarantino is one of my favorite filmmakers, alongside many others. I remember when I typed final draft and I would stop for some reason or hit a wall, I would remind myself that the best things in life are the simplest. That worked every time strangely enough. Although I have to admit that I have changed so many writing techniques on this one. I even had to invent my own writing technique which works really well for me and might be very bizarre to some writers.","When people said that you can't do a feature in two days, I did just that. I went and made one. We used one camera, one light, one lens and we did it all in two days."

I am looking to grow my business into a viable organization that will not only help others who have been out of work for awhile, but assist them in getting them actually hired by an employer.As a recruiter I have seen people apply for job after job, make the same mistakes and not get hired. They wonder if the issue is them or the employer. Most of the time it is something they are doing or not doing. Recruiters representing agencies or companies say nothing because they are afraid they will be taken to court. So the candidate keeps doing the same things over and over again until they get so discouraged they give up. That is what I want to prevent if I can.If I had the capital, I could subscribe to job boards to find candidates for hiring companies. The fees from placing those people will fund the coaching side of the business. Those people who want coaching are going to get advise that they may not want to hear, but could be something they need to hear. Mock interviews will be video taped and discussed. Resumes will be written or rewritten. Appearance will be discussed. Other things may be discussed, depending on the candidates.

I started this project on my own by simply just writing a script. I the new decided to drop out of college to pursue my dreams as a filmmaker and by doing so I began to slowly try to produce this film on my own. With barely any money I planned on renting one single Panasonic gh4 DSLR camera and a single Panasonic 12-35mm lens. I then took a trip to the hardware store and bought myself a workers clamp light and a single LED bulb to use for my lighting. After completing my small equipment inventory I knew I needed actors so I set out to find some. With luck working in my favor I was able to cast all my roles without having to pay a single person. What I did was i found people who are just starting out like myself and who aren't eager to build their resumes. With actors and in place and my equipment ready for production I asked a few friends and a few local business owners if they would be willing to help me with my film and allow me to use their homes and trusted establishments for some of my locations. As again luck would have it they were all very generous and spared me a few hours of their time to allow me to film my scenes. Now that pre-production is complete I gathered my cast and crew(and by crew I mean me) and immediately started production. Unfortionately production hasn't gone as smoothly as the pre-production stage. I had actors calling out left and right forcing me to push back dates weeks later than I had scheduled which meant running out of rental days and losing my camera and lens. I have about 50% left of filming and I still have all the actors and locations ready for whenever i get the equipment back. This isn't the main reason I am looking for funding. At the end of this project I plan on entering it into festivals and then distributing it to the straight to video market and distributing it online to a few different video streaming networks so I can use the profit to produce my next film and continue to make bigger budgeted films under my own production company. I would love to also include anyone interested in producing to help produce my second film and so on if anyone is interested in building their resume as well. I put my funding goal to $5000 to cover every expense including another camera and lens and better audio and lighting equipment. I really appreciate everything I can get and I promise you won't be disappointed with the outcome. Also If you would like to read the script please contact me and I would Be more than happy to send you a copy! Thank you so much for your time and i hope we can work together and finish this project!,Risk isn't that I couldn't not make a profit but even if I were to make the exact same amount I put in I could still produce my second film with a low budget. The main and only challenge is going to be finishing this project by the end of march in hope s to make the deadline for the film festivals. As long as I have the funding I can ensure you that I can finish the project by the end of march. My entire focus will be on this project.

While it should only affect her sense perception and inept neurological system, it has crept into the depths of her heart and being, and Milla is incensed with cynicism and disdain; total apathy for life… and love. When she meets Zscheri [che-rî] while visiting the ER with a chief complaint of a nearly-severed tongue, her life just might be beginning to change…This project aims to engage and educate the audience with visuals, auditory accompaniment, and invoking emotional response to the very real, and very serious disorder, CIPA.Awareness is the beginning. Help is the goal.ProductionA portion of the raised funds will go to equipment and location rental and filming licenses/permits. The cast and crew will of course be compensated. The creation and distribution of the finish film will take a small portion of the budget. The majority of the funds raised will most likely be donated to organizational research and fundraising for investigations and studies into the disorder–and other medical diseases–that aim to alleviate if not cure the detrimental effect it has on those diagnosed with it.Funding & PlanningI was able to film a two-minute trailer [featured on this campaign page] only with some of the limited resources and talent I had about two months ago. I no longer have access or funds to acquire equipment and talent (that aren't just my sometimes reliable friends :P) that I did before, and the funding would go to actually producing a much longer, more comprehensive, and cohesive short film (30 - 60 minutes) with a higher production value and a better opportunity to reach a wider audience. it has not been filmed other than the two-minute video featured on this kickstarter page. a good portion of the funding would also be used to make donations (in backer's names) to research and development for treatment of the disorder.","During the production of the brief trailer attached to this project page, the two very prevalent and rather constant challenges I faced during filming and production were 1] keeping the cast/crew on the project, as the material is rather intense and at times explicit, many individuals found it difficult to embody the character of the suffering girl and/or didn't stand up to the story content so well and were made uneasy working on the project and 2] finding the perfect sets and locations and research professionals for the story to really give it the nuances and vulnerability that someone with this disorder would find themselves in or face to be true and valid and factual and really strike the audience with the intended empathy for those suffering with the disorder."

I finished my PhD exactly in 2 years and 8 months (pretty quick). It was possible to finish so quickly, only because, at that time I knew how to write code using MATLAB®.

This is the main motivation for writing this book. MATLAB® can be used in any field where you use data and/or make some analysis using those data (I guess finance, politics, science, Engineering and many more fields). I feel it is the easiest programming tools for anybody interested in programming.

We wanted to create something that might encourage you to go on that walk, workout or try out that newrestaurantinstead of plopping down on the couch and turning on the TV.

Our writings are never hurtful, racist or hateful. We consider ourselves thinkers, and in many cases do not fit in. We are like you, we are not “experts.”By starting this kickstarter campaign, we are hoping to use the resources to help us with printing and distribution of our book and Blotch© postcards. ""Energetic Invocations: A Book of Vibrational Change"" blows the lid on the self-help industry and sheds new light on gurus. Others guide you to believe as they do, and you will become empowered. Although we can all learn from learning about other’s journeys, finding the path to integrate these lessons into our own journey has never been paved. Nobody can truly understand your perspective, but you. This book does not tell you what to do, how many mangoes to eat or what things to tell yourself, it creates a process for you to find that for yourself. Our own answers are within ourselves and that’s what bleeds into our beliefs, values and habits. To really make a change, you must do the work, or you will continue to spin your wheels. This book offers you the tools to support this change. It will make you think, and it will move your own energy as you work with the “Energetic Invocations” within the pages. Changing your energy, to support the change in your cells. Think it’s crazy? Think again. Science, nature and documented studies have proven the truth of that statement. “Energetic Invocations” was the basis of the Blotch© Postcards. Much of Blotch’s words are based on the writings in what has been coined “The Blue Book of Energy”. This 5.5 x 8.5 paperback book, contains 158 pages.You can read more about it at:http://a.co/boLSZ6dBlotch© Postcards were created to empower people to be different, be themselves and to create a voice to hear (and say) that it’s okay to be different and not fit in. Blotch© embraces a different kind of viewpoint for people to share with each other. Greeting cards are over-rated and seem to say the same thing, and in some respects never putting into words, exactly how one felt. Blotch© cards are raw, have double meanings and quite honestly, very funny.They are meant to say what you want on the front, and in the back provides a perspective that brings a smile, a little laughter or break in the momentary troubles. As a postcard the giver is not bothered with much to write other than a possible “love you” or “thinking of you” or “Hang in there”. The receiver can pin up the postcard which has a cute, lovable Blotch character in the front, as a reminder that everything will be alright.We know that when the struggle with life is overwhelming, there are resources to help those who cannot find another way. In our effort to help others struggling with their “differentness” and feel they just don’t fit in, we are contributing a portion of the net proceeds from our Blotch Postcards to the American Foundation for Suicide Prevention Out of the Darkness Walks.See all of our current inventory at:http://www.eipublishing.com/blotch---wholesale.htmlOur rewards support our goals: If you send us $5 we will send you a Blotch thank you Gif that you are free to share as you wish!For $10 you will receive 10 different Blotch Postcards – ready to be signed, addressed and mailed.

It’s 2018, time we stop the racism, harassment bullying, and peer pressure around us. You were only meant to be you on this earth. Support others and support yourself and donate to our campaign.","The immediate challenges for our campaign are very manageable. The Blotch© postcards are designed, have been copy-written, and we have arrangements for our immediate printing needs. The ""Energetic Invocations: A Book of Vibrational Change"" E-books and printed book are also complete and we also have satisfactory arrangements for printing and delivery concerns. Although we hope this campaign can help us in promoting Blotch’s words and can help with printing and distribution, we are currently capable of handling all the printing, delivery needs for this campaign. At the present moment, our biggest challenge is getting the word out and helping someone who could benefit from support. Depression, suicide, stress and anxiety rates in our society have skyrocketed, and opioid use is at epidemic levels.  As parents and adults in our society, we are saddened and frustrated by what statistics are showing on our college campuses, and on our streets around the country. When we researched into the current resources, we found nothing that created any impact. We did our own soul searching and came up with some things we wanted to say, which were raw, honest and truthful. Blotch© postcards cannot fix all of these troubles, but if one can get to the right person, at the right time, anything is possible."

The time of this flight - this is my Movie!  Stretched seconds, when all life passes by, when the time stops and there is only one Truth, there is only God!  Igor Gagarin A feature film, based on a journalistic investigation, tells the story about the secret experiment of creation of the real human clones, started in the former Soviet Union back in the year 1966.Having got the actual video material (which is more than thousand hours of video files under the “top secret” sign), the journalist starts the investigation, demonstrating the documentary pictures to the viewer.The past restoration is taking place, search of the witnesses and members of the experiment, the people clones itself.The viewer is being introduced to the now living cloned people, gets knowledge about the post-mortem experience of the members of the above mentioned experiment. Part of the film is dedicated to the Opening of the new, alternate method of achievement of electrical energy, that will fully replace the currently existing ones. To discovery, made by a clone man.You will witness the problems of living of those cloned people, that are tied to their own fate.The modern video facts and documentary video confirmations from past years, that are first unveiled in the movie, left no shadow of doubt in reality of what’s coming.One of main storylines in the movie tells the love story between the human clone and ordinary woman, that takes place in the parallel world of 18th century. Moreover, this film is about God, that gives life and fate.With all now living participants of the events of those years, written declaration is made about the filming and interview.And informational explosion is the shortest characteristic of the film. Don’t you still believe?- How did this happen?I lived as I could, as everybody does, until the age of 24. And when in 24 years old faced God, and by my own stupidity and lack of knowledge became pity that I died so early, and I have not yet achieved anything in this life, had no kids, no son, no life at all. And after I have regretted I came back on earth in an instant, to my body, to continue my life. Now I have a son, even two.. And all the time I regret that I came back. Because there is no right or bad time to step before the face of God and then the life afterwards is only a struggle with temptations and understanding of what had happened. This is a try, a ridiculous attempt to make the earth living better than the life in heaven, the life with God. In fact, all this are ordeal, wandering of the soul in a worldly and sinful world. Nothing good. Like to cross out all your life and to come back, in the past, and to start walking to God again. Because I came to God in 24 years old by myself.How did this happen?On screen, in form of events reconstruction, the memories of a man clone of being 24 years old are shown. The background voice of a man clone comments the events.The young man is shown (clone man) during the time of reading the religious ancient Chinese and Buddhist texts, The Bible, parapsychology books and different religious works of 20 century.Background voice:- All my youth I’ve tried to figure out what does the person live for, what is the meaning and ultimate goal of life? I was looking for answers in the Holy books of different cultures and religions. In Christianity, in Taoism, Confucianism, Buddhism, Shintoism, Islam. Read and comprehend sacred texts. Looked for answers in the texts of modern teachers. Teachers are largely misguided, because all the truths and answers to all the questions that have long been given and recorded. And I realized that the meaning and purpose of human life is the attainment of perfection, the attainment of Holiness, spiritual purity. And the path to it can only be reached through cleansing from spiritual dirt of the earth, from the imperfection and sin that a person accumulates throughout life, various bad deeds to come through repentance.  Come to perfection, to pureness, to come to it through the cleansing, through repentance, to confess that the earthly life, earthly desires and thoughts are not pure, and that's what they had been at that time in my soul. I wanted fame, wanted money, wanted recognition and all just what the ordinary man wants, what the most people want. I wanted to become someone!After all, the person is brought up and grows up in order to achieve something in this life. And this ""to achieve something in life,"" is, in fact, a path to the abyss. Because on this way people commit thousands of sins and mistakes. And no one tells them and no one teaches them that the most important things in life are to achieve spiritual purity, Holiness. And believe me, the worldly precious things will be given after that aswell. Perhaps somewhere children are raised correctly, but the correct, true knowledge is, in fact, an exception. Few of the parents tell their children that no matter what they become, no matter what are they going to do, as long as they stay pure and sinless. Have you often heard something like that from your parents? I heard quite another. And to my 24 years I came with the baggage full of filth. Thank God, deadly sins were not in it. Thought lies, deception and everything else like that was there in abundance.The onscreen events place the hero in the cinema hall to the moment of watching the movie. The voice of a real man-clone comments on what is happening:- And here I sat in the chair and watched a feature film ""The Witches of Eastwick"" with Jack Nicholson, where he plays the role of the devil, seducing the people with earthly blessings, and more specifically, seducing women with sexual pleasure, plunging into the abyss of depravity and filth. And I understand that that devil on the screen is me, that I am exactly the same. That this devil lives in me and my life is exactly the same.Realizing all that, I recoil from myself, from my life. I am aware of the sinfulness of the desires of my soul, the sinfulness of my life. I realize that the depth and extent of sin is so great that the horror grippes me. And when this understanding comes, right in the cinema hall, I repent of my sins. I admit to myself that this evil nature lives in me, and had permeated my whole life. And I push out, refuse from what is not mine, because deep in the soul, in its essence, I'm not the devil. The love and kindness live in me. In my heart I weep because of understanding of my dirt, of my sinfulness. An internal repentance comes, confession of the sinful life and sinful desires as the deeds of the devil. And I confess, not even knowing to whom, and free from the devil, knowing that he's evil. And after repentance, purification, catharsis, something happens - I think that is how life works, in it such laws, that clean cannot exist in dirt, the perfect cannot be imperfect - and the exclusion of my spirit takes place, myself, everything that is me from my body.Right now, after so many years, I can talk in detail about what happened then. And back then, I had not analyzed this, I just lived in it.The screen shows the output of the human self, the human spirit, of energy, of life itself from the physical body and further transition. The God is shown for the first time on the screen objectively, with his physical body. All subsequent events of post-mortem experience are filmed using the special effects and computer graphics. The voice of a real person-clone comments on what is happening.- New and clean, I broke out of this imperfect body, like a ball popping up out of the water, held by an invisible hand called life. Broke in the final frame of the film, flying into another world, more precisely, in a world that is always near and stood before the God. All this I did not expect, did not think about it, wasn't ready for it. When I stood there before Him, only then had I realized that this is God. When you are before the face of God - no explanation is needed, you understand everything without tips, beyond any words. This is God - Loving, Great, Golden. But most important thing is - the Loving essence of God, the body of His Love. And I, my soul, my spirit, my life - where I live - is a part of God, a small, microscopic part of the body of God. You feel and understand how much He loves you. As painful, as incredibly painful does it hurt Him because of us, his children, a part of Him. What a strong paternal and maternal love from Him comes to us. He is closer than own mother’s love. He loves us more and better than we love ourselves. I saw it all, felt and realized, in that moment. But in my heart the drop of this unlived life had stayed, and I regretted that I died so early. Then, I transited back swiftly and safely back into my body. Which has been carried out of the theater already, an ambulance arrived fast, and the doctor tried to give me some injection in a vein in my arm.The full and detailed restoration of events takes place. The hero moves to the place near the cinema hall, in the city of Kiev.- For me, life has not interrupted even for a second. During the time of removal of my body and all the rest, I was with God and saw nothing. And after returning to my body the doctor had said that everything is fine, nothing is to worry about. I rose from the parapet, on which I laid, and left, supported by my female companion.Digesting and analyzing those events, I understand that this is the meaning of my small and feeble life, to tell You about the God. That He exists, He gave us life, that He loves each of us and waits with tears in heart for a return to yourself, to kindness and love in yourself. For a conscious return to God.We continue to publish the fragments from the movie script of “ K-men: Origins ” directly from the human clone diary.- At 33 years I have met God again. God descended to me in His mercy. I guess I'm a very stupid and arrogant man that could get even God himself with his persistence. Although, it is rather the idea that His Love is so strong and perfect that It responds to the call of each pure heart. In my case it was this and that.At 16, I got carried away, really carried away with a search of possible solution for alternative, a new form of energy that will replace existing types of energy production. My teacher of geography lessons at high school told about the approaching energy crisis, the depletion of natural reserves of different energy resources - oil, coal, natural gas. That arose in me a desire to solve the issue. And for long 16 years, somewhere deep in the subconscious, I had this question left without an answer. And when in 32 years I have seriously addressed this problem, and spent about a year studying the existing alternative sources of energy – I understood that theoretical alternatives are at large, even infinite number and that to study further all the known alternative ways of energy production is meaningless. Because the possible solution will be really an innovative, new and unknown to modern science method. Although, everything new is well forgotten old. Nikola Tesla came close to this in his time.So, spending about a year on study of existing alternative methods of producing energy and coming nowhere with it, I’ve started using the paranormal abilities ofcomprehension of the unknown. My brainstorm was close to madness, about a month I actually didn't think about anything else but this project.A clone man is shown in a simple household and work life in the period of using the traditional paranormal abilities that lead to dementia and lost of consciousness.- Although at the same time I continued to live, to raise my son, work as a psychotherapist and counseling my patients. And that evening in 2000, the month of February, after finishing counseling the patients, I had been on my way home and of course continued to think about a possible solution...  Here I interrupt myself, I want rather to explain how I spent my usual day for the last month. Back then, during the day, I worked and lived, and at night I had been trying to understand the unknown with ... The paranormal way of understanding the unknown, which the man-clone tells us about, is shown on the screen. Restoration of events is taking place in details.- My passion in search of solution to the problem had been so severe that I can't remember if I've slept at all back then. The burning desire and passion had given me incredible strength and energy.So, after finishing consulting and leaving the office, I went home.Despite it was February, the weather reminded me rather of early spring, the snow began actively melting and the evening out on the street, I saw a solid puddles of wet snow. I wore light shoes and I had to float, to swim literally in the weak evening urban lighting in this snowy mess. I came to the first intersection and saw the flood all over, I stepped into it. Right in that second I was taken by God and transported into the future, my spirit, myself, all what I am. And the body continued to go through these puddles. Has been taken up and transported into the future and saw the answer to the question that tormented me – exactly what kind of new alternative way of energy production will replace the existing ones. I felt the presence of God and was very surprised by what I saw. Massive energy installations, as I called them later, in a working state, had appeared before me. I could penetrate with my consciousness, by my will, inside of these structures, under the ground, saw the machines and connectivity of all nodes of mechanisms of this energy producing installation. I beheld this majestic view of the mountainous terrain where they were located. How can I tell you about it – you will never forget something like that.After such ""excursion"" in the future, I returned to physical body in my surprisingly dry shoes. And when I got home I thought my body was floating above the ground. I could talk for hours about what I saw, about experiences and lessons learned, but it would be better if you will see what I saw.On the screen, in a real mountain landscape the original vision, seen by a human clone, is rendered using advanced computer graphics and special effects.P.S.""Become the part of this amazing idea, and we will make your forthcoming months into unforgettable adventure, at the end of which You will get the product that you helped to create yourselves !""   of A.D.Dear friends, right now our team at stage of active search of funding for our extraordinary project.

I am aware of the sinfulness of the desires of my soul, the sinfulness of my life. I realize that the depth and extent of sin is so great that the horror grippes me. And when this understanding comes, right in the cinema hall, I repent of my sins. I admit to myself that this evil nature lives in me, and had permeated my whole life. And I push out, refuse from what is not mine, because deep in the soul, in its essence, I'm not the devil. The love and kindness live in me. In my heart I weep because of understanding of my dirt, of my sinfulness. An internal repentance comes, confession of the sinful life and sinful desires as the deeds of the devil. And I confess, not even knowing to whom, and free from the devil, knowing that he's evil. And after repentance, purification, catharsis, something happens - I think that is how life works, in it such laws, that clean cannot exist in dirt, the perfect cannot be imperfect - and the exclusion of my spirit takes place, myself, everything that is me from my body.Right now, after so many years, I can talk in detail about what happened then. And back then, I had not analyzed this, I just lived in it.  The screen shows the output of the human self, the human spirit, of energy, of life itself from the physical body and further transition. The God is shown for the first time on the screen objectively, with his physical body. All subsequent events of post-mortem experience are filmed using the special effects and computer graphics. The voice of a real person-clone comments on what is happening.  - New and clean, I broke out of this imperfect body, like a ball popping up out of the water, held by an invisible hand called life. Broke in the final frame of the film, flying into another world, more precisely, in a world that is always near and stood before the God. All this I did not expect, did not think about it, wasn't ready for it. When I stood there before Him, only then had I realized that this is God. When you are before the face of God - no explanation is needed, you understand everything without tips, beyond any words. This is God - Loving, Great, Golden. But most important thing is - the Loving essence of God, the body of His Love. And I, my soul, my spirit, my life - where I live - is a part of God, a small, microscopic part of the body of God. You feel and understand how much He loves you. As painful, as incredibly painful does it hurt Him because of us, his children, a part of Him. What a strong paternal and maternal love from Him comes to us. He is closer than own mother’s love. He loves us more and better than we love ourselves. I saw it all, felt and realized, in that moment. But in my heart the drop of this unlived life had stayed, and I regretted that I died so early. Then, I transited back swiftly and safely back into my body. Which has been carried out of the theater already, an ambulance arrived fast, and the doctor tried to give me some injection in a vein in my arm.  The full and detailed restoration of events takes place. The hero moves to the place near the cinema hall, in the city of Kiev.  - For me, life has not interrupted even for a second. During the time of removal of my body and all the rest, I was with God and saw nothing. And after returning to my body the doctor had said that everything is fine, nothing is to worry about. I rose from the parapet, on which I laid, and left, supported by my female companion.Digesting and analyzing those events, I understand that this is the meaning of my small and feeble life, to tell You about the God. That He exists, He gave us life, that He loves each of us and waits with tears in heart for a return to yourself, to kindness and love in yourself. For a conscious return to God.  We continue to publish the fragments from the movie script of “ K-men: Origins ” directly from the human clone diary.  - At 33 years I have met God again. God descended to me in His mercy. I guess I'm a very stupid and arrogant man that could get even God himself with his persistence. Although, it is rather the idea that His Love is so strong and perfect that It responds to the call of each pure heart. In my case it was this and that.At 16, I got carried away, really carried away with a search of possible solution for alternative, a new form of energy that will replace existing types of energy production. My teacher of geography lessons at high school told about the approaching energy crisis, the depletion of natural reserves of different energy resources - oil, coal, natural gas. That arose in me a desire to solve the issue. And for long 16 years, somewhere deep in the subconscious, I had this question left without an answer. And when in 32 years I have seriously addressed this problem, and spent about a year studying the existing alternative sources of energy – I understood that theoretical alternatives are at large, even infinite number and that to study further all the known alternative ways of energy production is meaningless. Because the possible solution will be really an innovative, new and unknown to modern science method. Although, everything new is well forgotten old. Nikola Tesla came close to this in his time.So, spending about a year on study of existing alternative methods of producing energy and coming nowhere with it, I’ve started using the paranormal abilities ofcomprehension of the unknown. My brainstorm was close to madness, about a month I actually didn't think about anything else but this project. A clone man is shown in a simple household and work life in the period of using the traditional paranormal abilities that lead to dementia and lost of consciousness.  - Although at the same time I continued to live, to raise my son, work as a psychotherapist and counseling my patients. And that evening in 2000, the month of February, after finishing counseling the patients, I had been on my way home and of course continued to think about a possible solution...  Here I interrupt myself, I want rather to explain how I spent my usual day for the last month. Back then, during the day, I worked and lived, and at night I had been trying to understand the unknown with ...The paranormal way of understanding the unknown, which the man-clone tells us about, is shown on the screen. Restoration of events is taking place in details.  - My passion in search of solution to the problem had been so severe that I can't remember if I've slept at all back then. The burning desire and passion had given me incredible strength and energy.So, after finishing consulting and leaving the office, I went home.Despite it was February, the weather reminded me rather of early spring, the snow began actively melting and the evening out on the street, I saw a solid puddles of wet snow. I wore light shoes and I had to float, to swim literally in the weak evening urban lighting in this snowy mess. I came to the first intersection and saw the flood all over, I stepped into it. Right in that second I was taken by God and transported into the future, my spirit, myself, all what I am. And the body continued to go through these puddles. Has been taken up and transported into the future and saw the answer to the question that tormented me – exactly what kind of new alternative way of energy production will replace the existing ones. I felt the presence of God and was very surprised by what I saw. Massive energy installations, as I called them later, in a working state, had appeared before me. I could penetrate with my consciousness, by my will, inside of these structures, under the ground, saw the machines and connectivity of all nodes of mechanisms of this energy producing installation. I beheld this majestic view of the mountainous terrain where they were located. How can I tell you about it – you will never forget something like that.After such ""excursion"" in the future, I returned to physical body in my surprisingly dry shoes. And when I got home I thought my body was floating above the ground. I could talk for hours about what I saw, about experiences and lessons learned, but it would be better if you will see what I saw.  On the screen, in a real mountain landscape the original vision, seen by a human clone, is rendered using advanced computer graphics and special effects.P.S.I have not imagined a single shot in this movie, a single scene, a single phrase. I have seen it by my inner sight already completed, from the start till the end. From the first shot - the birth of a man, to the final one - a scene in movie theater, where the viewers watch the same movie, and on the final shot the heads of clone-men are spinning. Every sound, every smell, every breath of this movie-bliss I have been carrying with me for 9 years already. I can not stay the movie-egoist anymore, I must share this Miracle with You.

My Name is Alexander Rodriguez. I'm here to talk about my very first Album A House is Not A Home. Most of the songs that I wrote were actually events that happened in my life.A Couple Song Origins:- My Heart Is Like A Wrecking Ball was a get back together after a fight with my girlfriend. Originally the song ends with the last line ""Will you go to Prom with me Kait?"". We got back together, and two weeks before prom, she got killed in a Car Accident. So I changed the last line to the title of the song.- Suntan is a song about having summer fun with girls, drinks and marijuana. After watching the Baywatch Movie in 2017, I was inspired to write a Summer song and try to make it sound modern, but not too modern because today's music was... ughh. The first thing that came to my mind is people with Suntan, then i looked at the bar where drinks are served, and two guys dealing with Marijuana out in an alley. I was going to make a Music Video on this song and a few others. The Music Video for this has 2 versions, the Safe-For-Work Version and the Unrated NSFW Version.- Nine and a Half is inspired by an online poetry post that my friend showed me about a Drag Queen having 2 identities. One of my friends ask him ""On a scale of 1-10, how you would you rate her"" and he said ""Nine and a Half"". So, when i wrote the song, I was thinking there should be a back story about 2 guys who met ""her"" before me. Later, the Drag Queen chloroformed the guys and stole a bone, a tooth, and some other things from them, and placed a knife on the guy's hands when police think it was a suicide attempt and sent them into rehab. The Guys tried to tell the police what really happened, but no one believed them.","These rewards are still in progress. August 2018 is the Physical Release Date while Digital is available now.

I am currently putting together a screenwriter and other cast and crew for my indie film of the same name. I am the Executive Producer for the film. As such, I have been putting together the cast, crew and supporting administrative roles so that we can get the film into the production stage. Currently the film is in the pre-production stage and we hope with this funding to move forward.Currently we are seeking funding for equipment, administrative costs (cast and crew payments) and beyond. I am a small business owner and author of multiple short stories and novellas. I am finally getting the time and interest in a movie of one of my books, Airships and Anatasia: The Series. Your funding will help make this movie a reality and hopefully a success. I am a 28 year old Freelance Graphic Designer and Retail Sales Associate. I have two Associate's Degrees, one in Multimedia and the other in General Business with two certificates in Management. I am hoping this film will be a big success and will help me with paying some of my bills that normally occur, as well as paying my cast and crew their deserved salary when it comes to that.What We Need & What You GetCurrently we are seeking $60,000. The majority of this will be for payment of the voice actors, crew and other administrative roles, such as production, advertising and the like. Another large portion of the money will go to creating the film, such as software and the like for creating the post production effects. There are four options for you to choose from in the way of perks. The first is the $25 level which allows you to receive 1 free ticket, this will be delivered near the film's release date (rough estimate of Nov 13th, 2014). All of the perks will be delivered near the film's release date and could be subject to change if distribution of the film format changes (Digital download vs In Theaters). The next level up is the $100 perk. This level will get you 2 free tickets to the film. The $1000 perk gets you 4 free tickets to the movie. and the highest level of $10,000 gets you 4 free tickets and 4 free passes to meet the author (Dusty Van). This is a fixed goal so any money raised will go toward the film. If the goal is not met whatever is raised will be returned to you. Thank you for any donations you make, even if it is below the gift level it is all appreciated.The ImpactWhen you donate your money will be first going to pay the screenwriter's salary. Then once it gets past that point your money will help pay for the rest of the film. This movie has already garnered quite a bit of attention from the indie film industry and now that it is a very good possibility, any funding will be put to good use. I would like to thank in advance anyone that does donate to help get this film made. I had fun writing the novella and I hope that the movie will turn out as good or better than the book. I am very excited to get the ball rolling on this project and I can't wait to see how much this project will raise. The first step is getting a screenwriter to adapt the script, that is in the works. The next step is the funding needed to make the film. I hope that this campaign will make that step happen so that the film can move forward into pre-production and production.Other Ways You Can HelpI understand that some people are unable to donate. That is why I am asking you to please get the word out to your friends, even if you can't spare the money, maybe your friends or their friends can. Another way you can help is by purchasing the book on either Amazon, Barnes and Noble or LuLu. The book is available in PDF, Kindle, Nook, Paperback and Hard Cover formats. Any money raised by the book will also go toward the movie (up to a certain point of course). Please spread the word about both the book and the movie. The more attention it gets the quicker it will gain steam. Thank you all.","If the film production is delayed I will keep all backers informed of changes. I will try and get the tickets and other rewards out to you, the backer as soon as I am able to. If production is delayed for whatever reason you will be the first to know. I will try and keep this project on schedule once I get the funding needed to start and hopefully complete the movie. I am already working with a screenwriter to adapt the script, hopefully that progresses quickly and I can get the rest of the cast and crew quickly in place so that the film can maybe be released even earlier that projected. The biggest risk, as with any film, is reliability of people, cast and crew. I am trying to keep that in check with selecting quality people for the movie.",https://www.kickstarter.com/projects/viper2k3sr/small-restaurant-seeking-initial-seed-costs?ref=discovery_category_newest,viper2k3sr/small-restaurant-seeking-initial-seed-costs,"My wife and I want to start a pop-up style restaurant in a permanent setting. The concept is to take a traditional supper club where food is served in courses and apply it to a permanent brick and mortar restaurant in Farmington Hills, MI. We are raising this money to get the initial startup costs out of the way as we are living paycheck to paycheck. This money would help us start on the road to our dream of owning a Vegan restaurant in the Metro Detroit Area. This money would be applied to our ServSafe Certification, the LLC application fee and other initial Licensing Fees needed to start a business. This includes$185/person for the ServSafe Food Management Class and $25 for the LLC Application Fee. Any support on this project would be helpful. One Facebook Share or Tweet could get the funds rolling in. All monies raised here will go directly to help open the business. If we exceed our goal those funds will help offsetour loan amount. Which means we would not have to take out as big of a loan as initially planned ($100k). All money above and beyond the Goal amount will go toward the paint, rent, and more for the business.We plan to lease a building in Farmington Hills, take my self-taught cooking skills and turn it into a restaurant where you can come in get a 3-course meal for a fair price. Our plan is to take a unique dining experience and make it fun and inviting. We are looking at a 3200 sqft facility in the above-mentioned city. We hope to remodel this restaurant into something to suit our needs and plan to keep our guests entertained while they wait for their food. Eventually, we hope to secure enough money - once we open - to expand into serving my own wine in the restaurant, as well as, other local Michigan wines and beers.Thank you for any support given.",Our biggest risk is that the company will not take off once we open. Our plan to fix this is to promote within the growing community of Vegans and Vegetarians here in the Metro Detroit area and other surrounding areas. Once our name gets out there it is a matter of keeping repeat customers. We will tackle that with good food and fair pricing. We know that we have to make a profit but we do not want to gouge our customers with unfair prices for quality foods. Another major challenge is obtaining a building. We plan to tackle this right after the project is successfully funded and we have LoopNet Commercial Reality search to fall back on if the building we are currently looking at falls through. There is always the challenge of getting reliable staff in the building. We are bringing on a qualified HR Manager to handle that risk. There are hundreds of other what ifs with this project and we would like to think we have made a contingency plan for most if not all of them. There is always the unknown with this kind of project and all we can do is plan for the best and expect the worst. We are committed to solving anything that comes up after we open and after this is funded.

Some pickups will be hand wound for that traditional ""custom"" sound however, I have also design an automated and precise bobbin winder for accurate and repeatable production. Not only will I use this system for my pickups, I have also designed it with cost in mind so that it can be reproduced and sold at an affordable price as a great tool for other independent custom pickup manufactures!","As with any development project we will no doubt run into snags we don't expect. I don't expect to have to many pitfalls in the design and manufacturing of the winder of the pickups themselves. I do however anticipate some typical ""lessons learned"" in the processor and software development side. With that said I have support from an extremely capable and experienced friend who has a PHD in electronics and a software engineer to help me through it all. I do not anticipate anything that is a game changer. I have included all anticipated costs in my development budget."

Support our first anthology and our unique approach to art.By supporting our first anthology, you will be laying the foundation for generations of artists to come. We're actively seeking fundraising from a number of sources, and we hope you'll be able to help us build this dream! Your funds will be used to cover contributor payments (we're paying the writers $100 per story), printing costs, and marketing fees. Royalties from sales of the anthology will go towards funding the Margery de Brus mission.Margery de Brus is an LLC backed by private funding with the goal of promoting artists in a world that increasingly marginalizes art. Our world is capitalist-focused, and art that isn't ""salable"" is often overlooked. Worse, graduates of the Fine Arts are often left with large amounts of student loans and no realistic job prospects. Art is a side hustle, while office jobs pay the bills.We want to change that.Arguably, the most stunning art in history came from the Renaissance period. And those works were backed by wealth. The most notable patrons were the Medici's who sponsored artists like Michelangelo, da Vinci, and Botticelli. Granted, the conditions under which some of the artists worked were not ideal, and the model isn't without its flaws. But it's our starting point. A base to build upon.Surprisingly, the trend of sponsoring art is growing again. Numerous articles have been published over the past two years regarding Angel Investors for artists. The idea is to treat artists like start-up companies by providing financial backing and security so the artists can grow and flourish.Margery de Brus will start with literature and grow from there. Our first eBook is coming out this month, and we're accepting short story submissions for our first anthology to be published in June 2019.In March of 2019, MdB will open to employment applications for a limited number of writers. The writer-employees are not residents. They are not grant recipients. They will be paid a salary and given freedom to write on the topics of their choice. More details will be coming soon!","The risks involve lack of submissions and interest in the anthology.

Our suppliers of components are in place and all we need are consumers that ride motorcycles, snowmobiles and ATV`s that understand the benefits of the EZC Smartlight has to offer. It`s not just a light but can act as a life saver as well. Watch the demo video and see for yourself. We initially called it ""EZC"" but  when people saw it and all the benefits associated in the design, they said ""That`s just smart."" So we took their words and incorporated it into the name. EZC Smartlight. ""It`s just a smarter way to ride.""The EZC Smartlight kit contains all the necessary components to have you ride with an upper mounted tail light brake light configuration. The jacket components are all ""Plug and Play"" and the machine mounted harness comes with the necessary connectors. We have on line video and or printed instructions.Our initial goal was to create a safer riding environment for motorcycle, snowmobile and ATV riders.With styles and colours of riding gear so vast we created a design that would easily attach to virtually any existing coat,jacket or vest making your existing gear EZC Smartlight equipped. Our sleek non obstructive design has been incorporated into the racing industry with a ""EZC-R"" version prototype being tested this year. Yes, the R stands for race, so if racers think it`s smart....should we say more?Benefits                Riding recreational vehicles such as motorcycle, snowmobiles and ATVs is fun, but can be dangerous as well. Part of the danger lies in the fact that these machines are smaller than a car or truck and more difficult to see. They also lack the extra upper mounted brake light found on cars and trucks today. While motorcycles have proper lighting, it is mounted much lower and impossible to create one mounted higher. The EZC Smart Light overcomes this with its rider worn tail light, brake light combination ability. When properly installed to a coat or jacket it is much higher than third brake lights on some cars, making the rider more visible at all times in traffic as well giving a better indication to stopping by emitting a millisecond strobe then steady brake light when the brakes are applied.                                 Snowmobile riding itself can and does restrict the visibility of the taillight on the machine, directly proportional to the speed and amount of snow particles kicked up by the machine. In many instances the amount can be so much that the machine light becomes completely obscured while being followed. The EZC light Smart Light mounted on the riders back makes the rider more visible because the kicked up snow is not as concentrated at the higher elevation. Riders are more visible during all riding as well have the higher mounted brake light for better stopping indication to followers. (Strobe and steady)                            ATV riding has become much more popular and in many regions are allowed to be operated on our roads. The nature of trail riding can cover the machine tail light with mud and the operator unaware of the poor lighting conditions. Dusty trail riding is very similar to snowmobile riding with the kicked up dust proportional to the speed and terrain conditions. The EZC Smart Light mounted on the riders back makes the rider more visible because the kicked up dust is not as concentrated at the higher elevation. ATV riders are more visible during all riding as well giving a better indication to stopping.  (Strobe and steady)                           All of the above mentioned riders would benefit with another feature EZC Smart Light has to offer, the ability to remain on after becoming detached from the ridden machine. With a built in rechargeable power pack and monitoring system, the EZC Smart Controller positioned inside the jacket pocket detects a power loss or when the rider becomes unplugged and  instantly switches to its own built in power source to keep the tail light mode in operation until such a time when the rider switches it off. This ability makes the rider more visible when the machine they ride is not running either by choice, or in the case of an accident. This mode is capable of being turned on or off when not connected to a ridden machine, but will automatically switch back to its riding mode when re-connected to the machine allowing the strobe and steady brake light function as well as recharge the power pack if necessary.EZC Smartlight comes with a one year warranty."

I am trying to jump start my new magazine series called ""FuckMTV"", currently only available for android devices. This jump starter is to help me make it available for iphones/ipads also. It is a magazine series designed exclusively for smartphones. Unlike all the big name magazines that just port their magazines to mobile devices, which are just page for page exact replicas of the same magazine you can just buy at the store, which are both for ridiculous price, the pages of FuckMTV are designed to utilize the infinite possibilities that android devices can do. Its more than just a magazine, its also a radio show at the same time, listen and discover incredible music that mainstream media overlooks and ignores, hear lots of funny skits, standup comedy, and even the exclusive ""Slow Motion Talk Radio"" show. Plus it has lots interactive surprises and original content you won't see anywhere else. Theres puzzles, prizes, and the exclusive ""Open Mic Page"" where comedians can record and submit their jokes straight from their phone, which will then be posted in an next issue of FuckMTV for people all around the world to listen to and know who you are, anyone can submit. Plus each issue comes with a free game. Plus a bunch of other stuff in the works which will blow your mind.Although FuckMTV has many features, at its core it is an underground magazine with a huge middle finger. FuckMTV is for anyone who is sick and tired of crappy reality shows, bogus radio stations that only play processed garbage, News channels that consistently feed us BS, and stupid annoying commercials that just won't shut the fuck up, or if you're simply sick of reading your friend's lame facebook updates all the time. FuckMTV is radical and says all the things that mainstream media won't say, anything goes. FuckMTV is as real as it gets. FuckMTV is perfect for when you're on the go and you want something cool to look at but you don't want to drain your battery trying to stream stuff, because each issue of FuckMTV is a quick one time download, after that no web access is required. Simply open it and flip through with ease, no hassle typing websites or passwords, no sign ups, and best of all no pop-ups or ads. Just straight to the point awesomeness. You don't have to wait for this project to be funded (if you have an android device) you can already checkout FuckMTV. The first issue of FuckMTV is absolutely free, just download it and check it out. If you enjoyed it and want to see more then you can buy the next issue. Each issue is just 99cents, thats way cheaper than all those crappy big name magazines that just worship dumb celebrities that are famous for no reason, plus 99cents is the very minimum google play allows, otherwise I would've only charged 50cents per issue. You could say fuck this at anytime, there is no signup or contract, just buy each issue individually like any other app in the google play store. Each issue is guaranteed to be more fucked up and more awesome and have more features than the previous issue.To download simply follow the link below and choose from the available issues. If you want to start with a paid one rather than the free one thats totally cool too. And be sure to rate it with as many stars as possible, it really does help.https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.checkoutline.fuck.mtv.volume.one&feature=search_result#?t=W251bGwsMSwyLDEsImNvbS5jaGVja291dGxpbmUuZnVjay5tdHYudm9sdW1lLm9uZSJd","My goal here is to get the equipment necessary to make FuckMTV available for Iphones/Ipads, for example i need a mac computer and devices to test on.

To see the demo video in 4 dimensions go to the official Quadruple Dare website: http://emergencybroadcastmagazine.com/quadrupledare/quadrupledare.htmlQuadruple Dare is designed to be viewed in 3 ways. First way is what I call ""Party Viewing"" where 4 people gather around on a couch with their smartphones and each person clicks one of the 4 views of an episode so all 4 are watched simultaneously, this way you can see this animation pop out and truly hear the surround sound in action. Second way is called ""Solo Mode"" where you can watch all 4 views on one computer screen. Third way is just the regular way, just sit back and watch the show in 1 view on 1 screen.Quadruple Dare is inspired by the classic TV game show Double Dare. But this version is way crazier, way more action, way more dangerous, and way more fun. You will have so much fun watching this that you will forget you're not playing a video game. This is much more than just a reboot of an old game show, there is a story: we follow the main character Aleph on his journey to ultimate universal knowledge through this deadly tournament against the world's smartest and most elite savants and parkour champions. Its a desert search for self in a game show setting, a psychological thriller on a roller coaster through every dimension upside round. Every episode Aleph faces a new opponent who has a unique ability that will test him mentally and physically as he becomes infinitely wise and powerful, what awaits him at the end of the tournament can't be described, only seen, in 4D.Quadruple Dare not only pushes what can be done technologically, but psychologically as well. This animation sets out to push the limits of the what psychedelic can be, to push the mind to the very brink of madness, and to melt your screen in the process with the most tasty radical visuals you have ever seen. It doesn't stop there, the sounds and music of the show alone will keep you on the edge of your seat like someone accidentally took a bunch of mars volta and listened to some acid.In a time when hollywood is rebooting every hit movie that ever existed, when writer's have no ideas left but to put Terminator up against Robocop in the hottest romance comedy film of the summer, Quadruple Dare stomps all others. Quadruple Dare is a reboot of science, a reboot of philosophy, a reboot of society, a reboot of LIF. Take the Metaphysical Challenge!!","It is quite a challenge taking on such a concept animation, doing a cartoon in 4 dimensions and in surround sound is something no one has ever attempted and requires alot more work. This show has become my purpose in life, I will stop at nothing to bring this show to life."

Like my city, the station has been battered by the years of cold and storms coming off of Lake Erie. Every year, I would day dream about what could be, the hotel and restaurant I imagined that could occupy the space. Other people came and went with their dreams, lots of ideas and projects were tossed about, but ultimately each eventually gave way to more years of neglect. It's time for me to realize my dream.The Sanctuary Hotel, as I am calling it, will feature several boutique rooms, along with meeting and banquet space, and our signature restaurant, Conversations with Amy, highlighting the Euro - American cuisine of Chef Mark Wilson, known for opening Collinwood's famed Grovewood Tavern and Wine Bar. With a special ""Lighthouse Suite"" in our tower featuring 360 degree views of the city and lake, along with ample parkland nearby and a boardwalk on the Cuyahoga River, the Sanctuary Hotel is an integral component to the city's lakefront renaissance.","There is certainly the risk that we might not even acquire the property. This is a piece of land that has had many people and organizations attempt to make use of it, so far with no success. It is possible that it will require far more capital to complete the project. Current estimates put it at around 6 million US dollars, and it is possible that we will not be able to raise those funds.In the event that we are not able to acquire the old Coast Guard Station in Cleveland, Ohio we will direct our efforts toward finding and purchasing another building within the city to open the hotel and restaurant, or a lighthouse within the midwest or mid atlantic states, but hopefully in Cleveland, which is our first choice.",https://www.kickstarter.com/projects/girainitialfunding/chamberlains-fakery-cafe?ref=discovery_category_newest,girainitialfunding/chamberlains-fakery-cafe,"Hello Everyone!Welcome to Chamberlain's Fakery, Cleveland's first caffeine free Euro - American kitchen! We don't want to call it a restaurant, because it certainly has elements of that, and we don't want to call it a coffee house, although you can easily sit back and lose yourself in a hot cup of chickory, rooibos tea, or any number of our specialty drinks. But food and beverage is not all that Chamberlain's has to offer, as it really is a culmination of all the things we love, including weekly open mic and poetry readings, philosophy nights where we pick a topic at random for open discussion, or Mark's (an ordained minister's) late night church service - the Church of the Holy F*ck Up. With an outdoor patio and seasonal menu Chamberlain's will be Ohio City's premiere spot to unwind, dine, worship, kick back, and really be yourself.","The biggest risk is that we will require more funds to open; in fact, we already assume that we will have to come back later once the initial seed money is in place for inventory and other necessities."

For I combine this warmth of the bronze with naturesgracefully transitional forms by applying them to our human proportions-relative to their movements. I feel, therefore, I am able to express thenurturing essence of our human energy, emphasizing the warm compassionate sideof our nature.Ultimately,I am attempting to find the means to express the joyful vitality that surfacewhen we support the binding forces that we each share with all life –especiallythose that exist between each of us.Thissculpture is therefore an expression of this realization and a tribute to the“joy” that leads to “fulfillment” as our ultimate human potential.""",,https://www.kickstarter.com/projects/1197972103/building-the-discipline-of-balance?ref=discovery_category_newest,1197972103/building-the-discipline-of-balance,"To Achieve thePotential of the “THE DISCIPLINE OF BALANCE” (text from above video)From an academic perspective, I admit that I would be amongthose who acknowledge that size does not improve the aesthetic integrity (orrather the poetic justice) of a work of art. However, I do recognize that everywork of art possesses a potential and this potential is always in line with itstruth.As with any expression worthy of its fullest grandeur suchpotentials lie laden in the impending vision of its intended size, meaning thatof the scope of its potential proportions relative to its environment and ourfield of vision. In addition, because monumental proportions can moreeffectively occupy our field of vision in large public areas, they canpotentially help augment the integrity of an expression by heightening itspotential to influence others. As a result, such monumental proportions willautomatically bestow upon any worthy expression the honor of a greater air ofauthority.Regarding my polished bronze sculpture titled “THE DISCIPLINEOF BALANCE”, that from among my sculptural works that I consider to be my mostcompositionally successful. The one I believe best projects itself mosteffectively regarding its composition high to low from every vantage pointsurrounding its entire 360-degree radius.In this case, this sculpture begs (if simply for this reasonalone) to project its expressive qualities from the commanding podium of alarger scale. Thus, I feel compelled (no driven) to honor its truth andpotential and build it eight feet high!For that I am in need of your support!What I Need...I have been and remain profoundlymoved by these experiences (see profile to the right). I feel compelled to serve the meaning behind thoseimages that have arisen from them, by bringing them into the scope of ourcollective consciousness. Just as in the manner of my 5-½ ft polished bronzesculpture titled “JOY”THE JOY OF SELF-LESS NESS, I feel as though I wasdestined to bring these images into the world. Unfortunately, because mypersonal funding is short of what I need to proceed with my next major project,I must humbly and respectfully call upon others in order to help finance theconstruction of an eight ft high sculptural version of the “THE DISCIPLINE OF BALANCE”from its mock version.To proceed, I will need to finance for at least two years, aworking facility large enough to accommodate the structure and all my tools andequipment. I will also need to maintain that equipment and finance/pay anassistant in order to build an eight ft mock version out of temporarymaterials. Next, I will also need to finance all these materials in order tobuild this piece. Then there will be the necessary financing needed in order tobuild a series of molds just to begin the arduous lost wax process of bronzecasting. Once cast in bronze, I will need well over a year just to metal-smithand hand surface the final sculpture. This grueling surfacing process mustbe accomplished by hand in order to achieve the flawlessly, elegant,curvilinear transitions -one form to another, necessary to effectivelyaugment its mirror finish and then achieve that finish.To get this project off the ground, I am in need of at least$5,000.00 of additional funds over what what I already possess: First there are all the materials and all theirassociated fees, which is the core objective of this fund-raiser. Although,ultimately, it will take at roughly $90,000.00 to fund this project (Notincluding my time) (not including a pedestal, platform or any otherenvironmental structure). For my next fund-raiser I will need to acquire$12,000.00 just to cast the various sections of this sculpture in bronze.By contributing to this effort you can openly declare yourcontribution to the “THE JOY OF SELF-LESS-NESS” and “THE DISCIPLINE OF BALANCE”by receiving one of the following gifts as gratitude for your generouscontribution.To observe more of my work, feel free to log on towww.rllandry.com",

https://www.kickstarter.com/projects/835375793/the-tesla-tales?ref=discovery_category_newest,835375793/the-tesla-tales,"I have been fascinated with Tesla ever since i first came across his name, From his ideas of free global energy, to his communication with extra terrestrials, to his creation of the a/c current. The man was easily one of the greatest minds in human history and his inventions helped create and define the 21st century. Very little of Tesla's achievements are taught in schools and people's knowledge of Tesla is few and far between to say how much of an impact he had on society.Nikola Tesla symbolizes a unifying force and inspiration for all nations in the name of peace and science. He was a true visionary who was far ahead of his contemporaries in the field of scientific development.Tesla was a pioneer in many fields.  The Tesla coil, which he invented in 1891, is widely used today in radio and television sets and other electronic equipment. His alternating current induction motor is considered one of the ten greatest discoveries of all time.  Among his discoveries are the fluorescent light , laser beam, wireless communications, wireless transmission of electrical energy, remote control, robotics, Tesla’s turbines and vertical take off aircraft. Tesla is the father of the radio and the modern electrical transmissions systems. He registered over 700 patents worldwide. His vision included exploration of solar energy and the power of the sea. He foresaw interplanetary communications and satellites. “The world will wait a long time for Nikola Tesla’s equal in                                           achievement and imagination.”  E. ARMSTRONGYet despite all these amazing inventions and clear genius of Tesla, most people will know very little about the man.I intend to change all that with this series of books, using the work of Tesla himself along with illustration and a little imaginative fiction. The life and inventions of Nikola Tesla will and should, always be remembered for the amazing contributions he made and could have made if given the opportunity! His name has been forgotten for too long now and it's time his name was back in the light.Follow Tesla on his journey through time and space in this quirky, educational series, The series will consist of 10, 60 page books following the adventures of Nikola Tesla using story, poetry, quotes and illustration, see how he came to create some of his most magnificent inventions with a little imagination and a lot of adventure The Tesla Tales will capture the essence of Tesla and all he stood for and i hope Tesla will be a character remembered for many generations to come","I am aware that there are lots of different challenges when getting a book or a series of books into the public domain, luckily i have already been through the process before and am certain i can do it again! my main challenge will be censorship as the history of Tesla is shrouded in conspiracy and the people who are in power have tried to keep his work and name from the history books, time is also a factor for me but i will en devour to have the books finished and released by a realistic date",https://www.kickstarter.com/projects/835375793/news-22?ref=discovery_category_newest,835375793/news-22,"i am a comic creator and have received high praise for the concept and design work of my comics, i am looking to expand and turn my creation into an animation! i believe the animation can be a huge success and know i will reach the desired audience and hope to build a bigger fan base than i already have! i have being asked on numerous occasions if i can create a show and have toyed with the idea for a long time but now believe the time is right and that this can be a huge hit!

I was born and raised in Stamford CT. My parents were born in Puerto Rico. Over the years I got to learn about my culture and about the amazing Puerto Rican cuisine. As the years passed , I found myself not only enjoying my moms and grandmas cooking but also learning the cuisine and leaning new recipes that were past down from my great-grandmother in Puerto Rico. As I got older and got into high school, I realized that I really was passionate with cooking and creating recipes and that it would be something that I would be doing for the rest of my life. It was a gift given to me from God which I had to share with friends and family. I guess the one secret that I use that everyone enjoys is Love, I prepare all my meals with Love because it is important to me that you get a great finished product. So the idea came to me that instead of having to hunt for Puerto Rican food, I should bring our food to you!

The studio has generated a loyal following after opening its doors on March 2015. People seemed to love our shop but with lack of advertisement and a minimal roster we just don't have the funds to sustain it. It is a constant struggle, is very hard to keep the doors open. The people that have been to the studio love the space, our story, and our willingness to give back to the community. I guess the idea of teaching people how to make great nifty gifts from the heart with recyclable items is somewhat catchy. Currently we promote the shop by giving complementary classes at the local libraries, senior centers, churches, and our studio. We have gain a fan base but we need more activity and increase revenue. On this quest we decided we needed merchandise, a product(s). We tried to out source but nothing seemed to really fit our with our environment. After trying to get a third party to display their handmade soaps in our shop and their untimely response I decided to give it a try. I put on my DIY hat and embarked on the art of soap making or soaping. Our first blend Honey Bee came about, an oatmeal and organic honey soap that smells delicious.  I displayed the bars in the shop on a service dish. Everyone was gravitating to eat them. I had to display a ""Do Not Eat"" sign and that is how the name Skin Candy was born. But the greatest reward was a nine year old girl, one of our best and most loyal customer. Came in and couldn't stop smelling the soaps. I gave her a few samples to take home for her and her sister. Her Mom called me back the next day, asking about the soaps. She shared a funny story how her daughter wouldn't come out of the shower since she couldn't stop using the soaps. Finally after much fuss she bragged about how soft her skin was and how wonderful she smelled. She was asking everyone to smell and touch her skin. Her mom place a few orders for her and other relatives. Similar stories started to come in. During the Christmas holiday I had a customer order 70 single bars...  That's all good, but now we are faced with the fact we do not have enough funds to keep the studio, handcraft the soaps, packaging, advertisement, etc.. We are asking for funding to get started with the packaging and advertising. Inaddition we want to get the product certified 100% organic with the USDA. We are also looking to apply for universal bar codes in order to distribute to shops and boutiques nationally. For now we have an online shop that we just opened. We know we have a quality product we need funding to push it forward. We are creating a product that is good for you and the environment..","A welcome unexpected obstacles would be to have too many orders.  I pray we can always keep up with the demand, and that we have good quality supplies.  We are looking to explore a soy hand pour candle line in the future to match the soaps",https://www.kickstarter.com/projects/1542433658/skin-candy-spa-products-launch?ref=discovery_category_newest,1542433658/skin-candy-spa-products-launch,"Our plan is to bring awareness and visibility to the fact that everyone can live a chemical free life when it comes to self-care. Thefeedback received from previous users have been extremely positive, now that our product tested well we want to use our products to educate and stimulate a healthier lifestyle for others using our own experiences. These soaps are handcrafted with nature's best to self-care and self-love our mind, body, and spirit. These products are formulated to nourish, hydrate, heal your skin by taking the medicinal properties extracted from the herbs, floral, spices, and fruits formulating a product that is a sweet treat to your skin. The natural aromatherapy is not overpowering. Free of synthetic chemicals and fragrances. Infused with essential and carrier oils. All blends are vegetarian friendly with some vegan options. The company was birth from an idea of wanting a better, healthier life the knowing that it could be done without having a plan. We think this is the best way to look at life.","Our production process is pretty good.

The first mention of the pawpaw in history is the 1540 expedition, Spanish de Soto. It is reported that George Washington's favorite dessert was a chilled pawpaw and Thomas Jefferson planted them at his home, Monticello, in Virginia. But today, very few people have even heard of the PawPaw, regardless of the many articles in NPR.The paw paw is the largest edible fruit indigenous to the United States. Itsfruit looks similar to a mango with a custard-like flesh. The seeds are large and easy to remove from the fruit. They taste like a cross between a banana, a mango and a cantaloupe. Pawpaws are rich in fatty acids, have more protein than most fruits, and are high in anti-oxidants, approximately the same as cranberries.We intend to create a PawPaw farm and Bed and Breakfast to help raise awareness of this great North American tropical fruit. The Bed and Breakfast will make fresh pies, jellies and jams, cakes, breads and even ice cream and wine from the PawPaw to sell to local restaurants and stores. Eventually blends will be made including other fruits grown on the farm.Stays at the Bed and Breakfast will include possible PawPaw picking, tours of the facilities and cooking classes. Guest will also be invited to hike the wooded portions of the property, or relax in the common rooms.Some guest rooms will have balcony views overlooking the PawPaw patch, facing sunset, or other natural views.","While PawPaws are not typically susceptible to insects or most diseases, they do require extra help for pollination.  To pollinate, they require two separate genetic varieties.  This can be overcome by manual pollination and ensuring that genetic varietals are planted within appropriate proximity.  Also, any land purchased will need to be just outside of Nashville proper as land values are currently skyrocketing.  Some people may not like a 30-45 minute commute from the Bed & Breakfast to downtown.  Pawpaws also typically have a short shelf life and only are harvestable between August and October.  Immediate processing will be required to prevent loss of the fruit.  There are also botanists working in Kentucky and Indiana to increase the ripe duration of the fruit which would greatly help bring the fruit to local markets.",https://www.kickstarter.com/projects/1420110548/help-me-turn-this-19th-century-home-into-a-bed-and?ref=discovery_category_newest,1420110548/help-me-turn-this-19th-century-home-into-a-bed-and,"A few years ago on a hike in Nashville's Radnor Lake park, I made a startling discovery, The PawPaw! The state park has several wild PawPaw trees and one of the fruits had fallen to the ground and split open. I had no idea what it was, it looked like a mango but smelled like a banana! I was enthralled. I later researched this fruit as I had never seen one, little did I know this seed would spark a passion in me (my apologies for the pun).The first mention of the PawPaw in history is the 1540 Spanish de Soto expedition. It is also reported to be one of George Washingtons favorite childhood dessert! (Our first President was as enthralled as me!!!) Thomas Jefferson even planted them at his Monticello, Virginia home.The PawPaw is the largest edible fruit indigenous to the United States.

Mostly just paying for the numerous updates to the home and ensuring the proper propagation and growing conditions of the Pawpaws.  We are taking this is small steps to mitigate the risk.  We definitely want this project to thrive!

Thanks for being interested in my project.My second comic book tells the story of the despicable King Mundano. His whole purpose is to destroy nature and let his rivers of greed run throughout the entire Planet Sullet. My characters(Legion of the Tropics) will arrive to stop his plans.My cartoonist's page rate for interior pencil pages is $225 per page. Colors range from $60 - $80 per page depending on the colorist and letters are $18 per page.My 32-page script is ready to go. Those charges will add to $10,336 but I can make it with $9000 since I have $1000 in my savings. Look me up on Facebook as Ronny A. Vargas or Legion of the Tropics where I will post updates on my project.Thank you,Ronny A. Vargas",My only challenge right now is the money to create this comic book.

https://www.kickstarter.com/projects/1206513934/dame-en-attente?ref=discovery_category_newest,1206513934/dame-en-attente,"  The work that I create centers around social and political justice in an effort to expand perceptions and challenge points of view. By doing this I hope to start a discussion that will move towards understanding and change. This piece particularly speaks to me on a personal level. Growing up with a mother who had to face the standards of society everyday while raising three growing boys, I learned early in life the double standards we set for men and women. It’s not easy being a woman in a society where you’re constantly being told you’re not good enough unless you do this or look like that.  My aim for this piece is to challenge those standards set by society and to hopefully carry on the process of breaking down those walls and continue to empower women to be confident in who they are. With the funds raised I will be able to provide the costumes, venue and marketing  needed for this project to be presented to the audience. If we go beyond our goal the rest of the funds will go towards dancer compensation and savings for the next artistic adventure. We as a company believe in making a conscious effort to speak to issues of today’s society in a way that is thought provoking, artistically innovative and tasteful. Dame En Attente meaning Lady In Waiting speaks to societal standards of beauty placed on women. In creating this work we aim to start a discussion that takes an outward look on the issues surrounding this topic. Dame En Attente merges classical elements with modern day execution to play on the theme of standards through generations and time.  In this production you are faced with two characters. Character Beauty and Character Truth. Character Beauty struggles with the standards of society while being taken on a journey through self-discovery and and self-love led by Character Truth.   We rehearse every monday and tuesday from 6pm-10pm as that’s the time that our schedule permits us. The piece that we are working on is around 20 minutes long. Small yet effective, these funds will make a huge crack in the overall production of this piece. With proper support his production will captivate audiences through its innovative choreography and visual stimulations.","There is only one challenge left in completing this project. That challenge is funding. I have already secured rehearsal space and we are in full affect close to completing the piece. I have already reached out to venues about prjected performances and they are very welcoming. The only thing I need is the funding for costumes, marketing and venue.If I am unable to aquire the proper funding by the deadline I will have to pospone production. To help in this area I will be presenting an impromptu public performance to gather donations and bring this production to the public light.",https://www.kickstarter.com/projects/1206513934/tone-nal?ref=discovery_category_newest,1206513934/tone-nal,"Hi all! My name is Michael Bishop, a dancer and choreographer living in New York. My partners in crime are Darlena Chiem, lead videographer and Kristen Andron lead costume designer. We are the creative team for the dance film Tone:nal. Please read below and follow the link to see the kind of work we create.“Tone:nal” is a conversation about colorism and it’s effects on the African American community. Throughout history, the tone of one's skin color, in the African American community, has been used as a social scale to place ones beauty, worth/value, influence and humanity over another. It is my hope in creating this film that we revisit the conversation of skin tone in today’s society and reassess its effects while moving towards bringing closure to the issues that have come from this injustice.Recently I have been inundated with the topic of colorism and self hatred within the African American community. On social media, in conversations on the subway, conversations with family and friends, everywhere I turned, the topic kept coming up. It became so frequent that I began to wonder why it was happening at all. What was the spark that started this, how deeply was it affecting people, where did it stem from, what was its purpose in society and most of all, how could we rectify the situation? At my core, I wanted to know if it only affected people of color, why and how could we change it? So, I began to do some digging. In my research I discovered its deep ties to slavery and racism and how those ties have carried over into the present. With this knowledge I began to wonder if the effects from past to present were the same or if there were some ease from its origins. The question always comes up when talking about racism, has it changed and if so, how much? Naturally I found it fitting to ask this very question about colorism being that the two are so closely related. I went on a quest to find out. Asking several friends, strangers, family members of color and even some white people about the topic, I discovered that much like racism, not much has changed at all and more often than not, the only people aware of it are people of color. further more, most people of color didnt fully understand the origins of the topic and how it related to slavery and racism ingeneral. I became emboldened to bring this topic to mainstream. I then began searching for authors who are speaking about this topic in their writing just to get more info from a different source. In my reading I was particularly inspired by author Marita Golden who wrote the book, “Don’t Play In the Sun”, in which she recounts her experiences as a dark skinned woman living in a society that views her skin as ugly. This book changed my entire perspective on the topic in ways I couldn’t have imagined.My intention with this dance film is to raise questions, shed light on the topic and its origins and inspire conversation around the topic that leads to healing. I will do this by creating a trilogy that will discuss, through dance and poetry, the history of colorism. I will release this film in novel form, creating a trilogy of artistic videos that span the topic in its entirety. Each visual aid will be tied together through text, original poetry that I have written and an excerpt from the letter of Willie Lynch, a slave owner who devised a way to control his slaves and was invited to North America to teach this methodology to slave owners.I will do a live viewing of this film at its’ premier and host a talk back at the end of the viewing. This will allow for the audience to give an immediate response to what they’ve viewed opening the floor to much needed conversation that will hopefully filter into their day to day life.Tone:nal will not only be a dance film but the conversation starter needed so that healing can begin.video link: This short film was created to speak out against the silencing of minority communities throughout history and in the wake of police brutality.https://m.youtube.com/watch?v=sfAeksSEJFE","The biggest risk in this kind of production is budget. Paying for rehearsal space, film space, crew and dancers is not easy or cheap. But with the passion I possess for this project, I will do everything in my power to complete this work. I have created and completed projects before with practically zero budget. It’s because of this that I know if I get the financial backing I need for this project, I will have no problem completing it.I have sourced friends who are amazing at their craft to work along side me in completing this. I have a camera crew, a design team and dancers all waiting for the go ahead and the funding for this project to get off the ground. I have planned for potential delays and implemented that into my time frame a moth out. I have two shoot locations in place in case one falls out and I have allowed for and excess amount of time to complete the rewards. In addition I have decided to shoot this trilogy individually to ensure Proper attention to each video prior to editing. This will also be more cost affective. We will have zero room for error on this project so it is of the utmost importance that every detail is combed through so that editing will go smoothly. With your trust and your support I know that we can create something that will inspire many. Let’s get to work. :)"

We have a passion for design and art. Tired of shopping for top designer candles, mostly made in the UK, we wanted to bring our ideas to life and start our company, Quiesco Candles, right here near Seattle. Bringing jobs back to the US and keeping the money here is important to us.When we first started, we knew that we wanted to be different. You may have noticed that most main stream candles from Europe or even the US, have large labels on the front with tons of information, names of scents, etc.We choose to be different! Everyone who buys a candle knows what the scent they purchased and we doubt they want to stare at it all day, looking at a label. Most times we noticed our friends and family would justturn them around backwards to not see the stickers. We wanted to solve that issue by creating a minimalist logo for Quiesco that would be more artistic and designer. Something without words or things to read. Just something beautiful and relaxing!With no name on the font label, we wanted another way to tell our supporters which candle they were burning. We came up with the idea to have a color for each leaf represent the scent of the candle. Green for 'White Lies', Brown for 'Intrigue' and Gold for 'Forgotten Treasure'. We love the minimalist and subtle hint of your favorite scent with out the commercial look like most others out there. As we develop more scents, we plan to intrude color and patterns into the leaf design.We have been producing candles for our online web site but are just starting to get into large production runs so we can obtain retail packaging and really get out there.

Along the way, we will feature candid interviews with real men and women who have experienced similar struggles with sexual abuse, manipulation, neglect and bullying as Christina's own story is based on the real-life experiences of writer and lead actress, Jennie Marie Pacelli.This film is part cinema and part therapy, blending documentary footage with a theatrical storyline, good with bad, tragedy with comedy. It's a snapshot of modern life with the underlying objective to explore pain, trauma and the revelations we all face as we discover our true selves, sometimes because of or in spite of the ones we love. The quickest way to the heart is sometimes the hardest, and Christina's story, as well as the stories of others, will serve as the backbone to a greater comprehension of human relationship.","All film projects involve a great deal of risk. Throughout the production process, from budgeting to insurance to principle photography, and all the way to distribution, there are countless financial hurdles to cross. Thankfully we have a dedicated crew with a DIY mindset, and enough of the right types of experiences to support this vision, but we need your help to make it happen. Staging production in Los Angeles, we have extensive permitting and location rates to pay. While our social network has already supplied several key locations and modest equipment, we desire the freedom to go above and beyond expectation in bringing this story to life on-screen. We have a small, intimate crew and aim to keep it that way, which isn't to say we couldn't benefit from several more key members once our budget is reached.

With all of the knowledge I have learned while making the first one I know I can make it an even better product with your help!The current snow blower I made has lots of room for improvement to make it even stronger and better overall. I already invested months into its design and I need funding to continue to improve upon it. If this kickstarter gets funded I will be able to make it the best it can possibly be!Additionally this kickstarter will fund the development of a tracked vehicle that is dedicated to the snow blower. Currently it is attached to the ""Kyosho Blizzard SR"" which is very limited. If I'm able to design a tracked vehicle I can give it more pushing power and it will be much better suited for snow removal! The snow blower will work on the tracked vehicle or any other RC vehicle.Winter is a long ways away but doing a kickstarter this early in the year will give me plenty of time to make an all new design and get your orders shipped to your door by next winter!The snow blower has already been proven to work really well and I have even sold several kits to happy customers. You can see for yourself! http://s1.zetaboards.com/RCsnowcats/topic/5749076/1/This is my website for the current generation snow blower: http://spykerworkshop.webs.com/This is a 1/10th scale 3d printed snow blower meant to be used with remote control vehicles. The market already has large scale remote controlled snow blowers for tens of thousands of dollars but this project is aimed at the smaller hobby level consumers.You can clear your whole driveway with enough batteries, however the main focus of this snow blower is to be a fun and enjoyable activity in the snow. This project will probably not replace your full sized gas snow blower but it might!The snow blower is powered by a standard 540 sized motor and uses standard RC servos to raise and lower the whole snow blower. Also a servo is used to turn the shoot that directs the snow. The current generation snow blower can plow through 14 x 5 inches of powdered snow in one pass!You will be pledging to receive several products in kit form or fully assembled: (Every kit will include stainless steel screws and hardware.)Everything will be produced in house by my family, friends and me. I have 2 customized 3d printers with hundreds of hours on them. They both have E3D Volcano extruders with 0.6mm nozzles run by the newest Smoothie board controller. Simplify 3D software and my life time of computer experience is used to produce the best possible parts for these kits.I also will be using my full aluminum CNC machine that I completely designed and built from scratch. This will be used to mill out larger flat components from ABS plastic sheets.The several kits I have sold of the current generation snow blower were completed and shipped with the up-most attention to care and detail.3d printing can be made very strong and durable if you do it right like I do! Many variables effect the strength of a print. I print using the following techniques to maximize strength:If you still don't believe me see the snow blower in action for yourself on my YouTube channel for just how strong it actually is! https://www.youtube.com/user/thegreatestmoo/featuredDepending on the amount of funds raised I will add stretch goals for the following:This may be my first kickstarter but I'm well known around the net. My name is Ryan but I go by ""Moo Spyker"" or ""The Great Moo"" online. I work online in ""Second Life"" creating video game content. http://spykerenterprise.webs.com/I have over 8 years of experience working with 3d content like, 3ds Max, CAD, CAM, and running CNC machines. I'm always building or designing something whenever I can. I also dabble in wood working, creating things like cribbage boards and signs.I have a lot of experience in bringing my ideas from concept to design and finally creation. I have sold several custom modular transmitters for RC boats but there was never enough interest to continue further.I also designed a massive 1/6th scale RC tank in the past using molds cut on my CNC machine. It never got finished though because of the difficulty of creating those molds for all the detail pieces. With 3d printers now that won't be an issue anymore on future projects like this one!These items are 3d printed which means they do not have a nice smooth finish that normal injection molded parts have. Most pieces will have imperfections such as visible layers or lines across flat areas. However functionally they are comparable in strength to injection molded ABS plastic.The snow blower can be quite powerful so keep your hands clear of the moving parts when it is in operation, I'm not responsible for any harm caused!For international orders you are responsible to pay for any import fees.","One of the biggest challenges to over come is actually testing the 2nd generation snow blower in the summer time while I'm working on its design to make sure everything actually works before I start producing them! I plan to over come this buy using some of the funds to buy a snow machine and use it in an air conditioned garage to make my own test pit!Other challenges would be just the design itself. Figuring out the best possible way to make each part strong and easy to print.Since I work online running my own business I can dedicate 100% of my time to this project without any limitations.Right now this whole project is only run by a handful of people, if the amount of support and pledges is very high I will put to use the funds raised to use better techniques to actually produce the kits, like buying more 3d printers, hiring more help or paying for other companies to actually produce the components. We will have to see how it goes!",https://www.kickstarter.com/projects/moospyker/3d-printed-rc-snow-blower?ref=discovery_category_newest,moospyker/3d-printed-rc-snow-blower,"The goal of this kickstarter is to fund the production of a 3d printed Snow Blower as well as a remote controlled Tracked Vehicle to go along with it.Winter is almost here!This is a realistic 2 stage RC Snow Blower that can blow fresh powdered snow up to 5"" deep and 14"" wide in a single pass! It is meant for 1/10th and 1/12th scale remote control vehicles. The main supported vehicle is the Kyosho Blizzard SR/FR but it can be made to work on other vehicles too. Control the direction the snow blows by rotating the shoot remotely, and adjust the distance it throws snow by manually aiming the spout on top! The power plant uses a 540 or 550 sized standard electric motor running a 5:1 belt drive.The auger uses a metal geared Traxxas differential and threaded rod running through the augers for strength.Equipped with an aluminum scraper bar and adjustable skid shoes just like full sized snow blowers.The snow blower has already been proven to work really well and I have sold several kits to happy customers.

However it could be much sooner then that. The STANDARD snow blowers will ship a lot sooner then the DELUXE ones.The STANDARD snow blowers will ship out as they are produced, and production on them will start immediately after the kickstarter ends.The DELUXE snow blower with the tracked vehicle will take longer to ship out because the tracked vehicle needs to be designed and tested. 1-2 months for the design, and then they will ship out as they are produced.I have 2 printers already to begin producing the snow blowers, but I will use the funds raised by this kickstarter to purchase many more printers to be able to keep up with all the pledges.I've shipped several kits out already!3d printing can be made very strong and durable if you do it right like I do!

We launched my History Digest in November 2012. We believe that everyone has a right to know the past and our app lets you easily discover stories that you cannot find in the usual history books and magazines. Moreover, parallel to the magazine, we have also developed the mobile version of my History Digest that provides daily history news on Windows8 mobile devices.The success of our app lies in our realization that the traditional digital magazine structure available on the market driven primarily by “pdf” formatted e-documents does not provide users with an appropriate reading experience. To exploit the features and capabilities of the Windows8 platform we decided to redefine the experience of magazine reading by adding several user-friendly functions to the app to improve the readability of the content. The content of the magazine itself is also unique. A key factor in the selection of materials for inclusion in my History Digest by our editors is to identify and present the lesser-known and surprising aspects of historical events.Our editors monitor over 300 leading history magazines worldwide that are published in dozens of different languages in order to select the most fascinating and previously untold (or rarely known) anecdotes. These historical briefs are translated into English and presented on my History Digest eliminating the necessity for readers to search the world’s history-themed magazines and then themselves translate their content. My History Digest does all that for the user and provides readers with carefully selected high quality content.Our aim is to reach as wide an audience as possible. We consider it amazing for one become familiar with the archaeology and history of peoples and countries far away from our own. There is so much we do not know about the history of the near and far away world. Consequently, we decided that such a treasure of knowledge must be shared worldwide on all major digital platforms.What we needWe have commenced the development and transformation of the app from Window8 to add iOS and Android platform versions but we need your help to finish those versions. The diversity of smartphone and tablet devices operating on these various platforms and the increased presence of those devices requires this development in order to reach all interested readers who own those different devices. The funds raised from this campaign are dedicated towards the completion and improvement of the development of the iOS and Android versions of the my History Digest app. The amount of £3,500 is what is required to complete this basic development and any other funds will be used for further improvements. The production of the content of the magazine, publishing rights, editing, publishing and promotion costs of the app are paid by us.Good to know about the my History Digest Magazine- currently available on Windows8 operating system;- available on Windows mobile phone devices;- the app is free, daily history news is free, primary monthly articles (typically nine) are payable with one article provided at no cost for each app user every calendar;- functionality includes the sharing of content,uploading photos of historical places by users, semantic zoom, changeable letter size with adaptive layout, scroll stop & image galleryThe impact my History Digest makesWe are attempting to globalize interest in world history and you can now be part of it. We have had an overwhelming response with thousands of downloads from around the world; our daily history news is particularly popular. Now it is time to take history to the next level and make the app available on every major digital platform so we can spread world history even more efficiently.

The issue will be published and made freely available to all irrespective of your generous support – but that support is appreciated.Perhaps the most horrific expression in History was used by Nazi Germany to assign and denigrate certain human beings they considered to be inferior: Lebensunwertes Leben, or ""life unworthy of life."" From 1933 the Nazi regime and its sympathetic regimes murdered civilians en masse, especially targeting those of Jewish faith and descent. Later in World War II, this policy grew into Hitler's ""Final Solution,"" the complete extermination of all Jews.“Holocaust” is derived from a Greek word meaning ""sacrifice by fire."" The Nazis believed that Germans were ""racially superior"" and that Jewish people, being deemed ""inferior,"" were a threat to the Germans. Even though Jewish people were the primary victims of Nazi racism, Nazis and their followers targeted other groups such as the Roma community, the disabled & mentally or physically handicapped and certain Slavic peoples. In addition, other groups were persecuted based on political, ideological, and other grounds, among them Communists, Socialists and homosexuals. In 1933, the Jewish population of Europe was over nine million. By 1945, the Germans and their collaborators had killed approximately six million European Jews as part of the “Final Solution” - now known as the Holocaust.The Holocaust (Shoah) was a moment in history when millions of citizens lost themselves in a German extremist idea and marched towards those ideals causing the death of millions. Everyone has a right to know these darkest chapters of history and we must learn from these mistakes. There is no excuse for what happened between 1933 and 1945 to millions of Jews and other victims. A large number of people lost their sense of judgment and went against fundamental human principles written in stone (Ten Commandments). The Holocaust is a tragedy, not only for the Jewish people, but is a tragedy for all mankind. We all must carry the heavy burden of facing the truth. Only facing history honestly can bring atonement to what mankind did and can perhaps bring forgiveness. We have to listen carefully and remain vigilant as to what the Holocaust and Nazi persecution tells us, in order to realize the necessary lessons of hope for a safer and tolerant society. The Holocaust must have a permanent place in our memory in order to teach people today the consequences of hatred and discrimination.What we needWe are asking for support in recovering our expense for preparing this Holocaust Memorial issue to be made available at no expense to the public. We will spend £5000 to produce the content of this edition, including archive research and the costs of publishing rights for texts & pictures as well as the expense for design and editorial works. This issue will be published in the e-publication – my History Digest – and will be available on iOS, Android and Windows 8 in the end of November. Please download the app and issue regardless of your support!The impact Holocaust project makesWe prepare this Holocaust Memorial edition for free because we want to reach as many people as possible in order to bring attention to the consequences of hatred and discrimination. The Holocaust provides a powerful lesson regarding the fragile nature of freedom and the need for constant vigilance in preserving democratic values. Remembering the Holocaust is a powerful and authentic way of maintaining moral responsibility among citizens in this global community.Alternative helpIf you cannot contribute financially, please consider helping us spread the word about my History Digest.

The first rendition of episode one was recorded about two weeks later. With a whopping nine sound effects (mostly fire, and nature noises) it was very rough around the edges.Pacific and Larissa teamed up to tell a story and the potential of Lake Clarity was realized. After reworking the plot and rewriting most of the early episodes, they finished the season, found an incredible cast of talented actors, and began production.The first episode has just shy of 40 tracks. The eighth episode has just over 60.Season one of Lake Clarity was made entirely by kind folk volunteering their time and talents. For season two, the desire is to compensate all artists involved with creating this audio drama. Whether it's a single line in an episode, a guttural noise of a monster, or editing, everyone in the cast and production should be rewarded for their time and energies entertaining you!If we surpass our goal, we also plan on creating supplementary content, like videos, and interactive materials for your immersion!Pacific Obadiah is a workaholic. Between writing, producing, andacting, he has a deep passion for the arts. In his free time he hashelped write and produce episodes for Liberty, The Alexandria Archives, and produced episodes of Jon Grilz's (Small Town Horror) newest podcast, Creepy.Larissa Fleming has co-wrote LOL, a group performance art piece that won first place in her high school state drama competition (Wyoming).

In her assignment, she stumbles upon information about Lake Clarity's dark past and her own past will push her to dig deeper into the history of Lake Clarity. The consequences of her pursuit for the truth will cause authorities to rethink the closure of Project Mikcheech.Its Teeth is a very generous composer who is collaborating with us this season to create an individualized soundtrack!

Golberg (Fall of the House of Sunshine) and James Oliva (What's the Frequency) this arc will be Lake Clarity's strongest yet. Blending bits of psychedelic horror, candy, time travel, and disgusting tentacle bearing wall flesh!Where we are in DevelopmentRight now, our script is fully finished and now we're looking for help!

From strange radio adverts to a missing typewriter and the crime king of LA, this show brings the best of David Lynch's surrealism, into an immersive audio landscape.Lake Clarity first began when I sat down with ten friends and told them I wanted to do an Audio Drama podcast. We had a studio on our campus, I had a computer, and an (admittedly cheesy) script I wrote last summer.So we did.And it did well. So we wrote a second season, and then we launched a few new shows, and that lead to partnerships, collaborations, and much more audio drama.But now, I'm ready to return to Lake Clarity, and share with you the end of an adventure that began over four years ago.Haven't Heard Our show?That's okay! Season one, two, and three all share the same universe but are designed to be their own standalone story. Anything you need to know we'll include in the new season, but truthfully, this is a new story in the Lake Clarity universe.But, if you do wanna catch up, you can listen to the whole show free on any podcast app! Or, read our summary below...The Story So Far...Five teens venture up to Camp Clarity, expecting a fun trip at a supposedly ""haunted"" summer camp. The camp's not haunted, but something devious lives below Lake Clarity. After venturing around, they discover an abandoned military facility, where that devious thing lives. Horror ensues.A year later, local journalist, Sam Parsons, ventures to the small town of Nederland where she is covering an upcoming music festival, but while in town she hears whispers of the missing kids. Deciding to follow her gut, she investigates the story and quickly finds herself in the center of a military coverup, and inter-planetary struggle.Now: The base beneath Lake Clarity has been reactivated, and the research that started 40 years ago, is to be continued. Site Five is active. The Rift is open. Project Kahlo is in effect.It's time to go through The Rift, and find what's on the other side.Pacific S.

However, we couldn't afford to keep the app alive - and without any warning, we had to pull the plug on it leaving our loyal users in the dark. It was unfortunate, but one demanded by the economic realities in which we live. Now, we have a fully functional app --- one that our users WANT to play --- but we currently can't afford to keep it online.

Our StoryI have been a music enthusiast for much of my life and an audiophile for more than 20 years.  My life revolves around music and I’ve been a seeker of great music and great sound.  In my quest, I determined the best quality sound source available (even today) is vinyl.

Earlier this year I participated in a local record show, paring down my collection while picking up some rarities in the process.  What I observed from the experienced dealers around me is there was a real need for quality crates to house and display their records.  Some were using old milk crates... some cardboard boxes... some plastic bins and there were some flimsily built wooden crates as well.  As a woodworker with a passion for music, I decided to build ""the better record crate.""  One which was both attractive in design but also built for strength and durability.

The result was our first model, the “Slat”.The result of our collaboration was the ""Slat"". This was a four-slat side design with rabbet, dado and pocket hole jointery techniques. Not only did it have an simple-lined, elegant style but it was built like a tank... and at 19"" in length, it could house nearly 100 records (or anything else for that matter).Inspired by clean, modern lines and a mid-century look and feel, we continued to discuss other potential designs.

There is a vast list of products that people living outside the US (both US citizens living abroad as well as natural citizens of these countries) are paying as much as 200% or more for due to the high cost to ship outside the U.S.Some clever folks overseas have already devised a way to beat the system, opting to wait until someone they know is going to travel to their location and create a list of items for that person to bring with them. The cost difference between a friend or family member bringing an item(s) in their luggage versus purchasing the item via localized versions of popular web marketplaces (such as amazon.in) or purchasing them from the U.S. version and paying exorbitant shipping/import charges is absolutely incredible.The focus of Backpack Delivery is to alleviate this cost for international buyers around the world, while allowing travelers, both frequent and sporadic, to offset the high cost of traveling abroad. The Backpack Delivery platform will be a web-based service for connecting travelers wishing to rent out their luggage space to international customers who wish to purchase airline approved products and have the traveler deliver them to their country on their next tripitinerary. The platform will include a website and mobile application that connect with popular web marketplaces such as Amazon.comand provide a proxy shopping experience. The purchase will take place through Amazon, but the handling of shipping will be at the direction of the platform to ensure that the qualified Traveler receives the product prior to their planned trip.We are a small group of web developers looking to raise at least $50,000 in start-up funds to build the platform with an initial six month timeline from the ground up. The platform will be custom PHP-backed with a Bootstrap-based front end UI. The start-up money will be used to purchase adequate web servers, pay the salaries for development of the platform, language translation service for the platform in all major global languages, and the hiring/training of foreign-based company representatives to handle safe transactions at the airport or Traveler's approved drop-off location for Buyers who choose to not interact directly with the Traveler in person.Thank you for your time spent reading our planned project. We hope you will help us achieve this goal and help millions of travelers and consumers around the world save money and maybe put a little more personalization back into the delivery industry.","When considering a global international service that involves real people traveling abroad and real consumers purchasing products from foreign markets, there are always legal ramifications to consider. One of our first steps in creating this site has been to consult with a lawyer on the various possible pitfalls that could be encountered once the platform is off the ground. According to counsel we have been advised that one of our first steps prior to launch should be to create a solid disclaimer/waiver that will be included within the sign up process on both the Traveler and Buyer Terms of Use.In fact, 10% of the project funding here will be going towards lawyer fees to ensure that the platform is protected and that each traveler/buyer is aware of their situation prior to signing up. We also intend to seek an insurance planner to provide a money-back guarantee to our buyers, as well as provide solid traveler protection.

The Shipper’s fee is placed into escrow and the item is shipped to the their address.When the Shipper arrives, the two meet in a safe, secure location (usually the airport but the parties can choose a mutual arrangement at their discretion) to complete the transaction.

For the last 8 years I have been writing great horror genre film scripts. The only problem is that I haven't had the funds to bring my creations to life. Due to the current state I live in, there aren't many opportunities to pitch my ideas to production companies. I always have to call around or email, and well you know how that goes. I have had little to no luck hearing back from companies. The horror and sci fi genres have always been of interest to me. I am 26 years old, and would love to finally have my films on the big screen.Pills is a psychological horror about ayoung Pharmaceutical Technician, who discovers that the treatment for her grandmother's dementia may be the cause of horrific murders happening in their lives.It's almost a modern day 'Who's Done It'If the goal of $8,000 is met, it will help with all pre production costs and post production costs.","The major risks to overcome with this project, is making sure I hire the best production team for a small budget to get the job done well. Another risk would be timing of the actual production start date. Due to my small budget, it will be harder to film for a prolonged period. So I plan to film this feature length film within a week's time. Which takes me to another risk. Getting a high end product in a small amount of time would mean that Production and Talent must be available during the week filming is set to take place.  My goal is to put out a horror movie that we've all been waiting for. Something unique and entertaining. Something that has never been done before in this genre. With your help, I will be able to get some of the best in CGI and VFX as well as one A list celebrity to gain the audience's attention.",https://www.kickstarter.com/projects/georgethemovie/george-0?ref=discovery_category_newest,georgethemovie/george-0,"Hello. My name is Adrienne. I wrote this movie to bring light to those that are battling depression, and those who know someone that is battling with depression. Many times depression is overlooked. Whether it's in the workplace, home, or school. Many do not understand the significance of depression, and how it can affect one's everyday mood. Sometimes depression can lead to suicidal thoughts or even suicide. We often wonder if there was something that could have been done to save a loved one, or if there were signs that had been ignored. I hope this film brings awareness to the signs and symptoms of depression. Everyone has a story, and everyone handles certain situations differently. No matter the circumstance, there is always hope.The funds will go towards hiring actors, crew, and paying for filming locations.Also, any post production costs that may be later incurred. Lastly, 10% of the proceeds will be donated to the American Foundation for Suicide Prevention.Now is your chance to back a project that has meaning and that could make a difference in someone's life. Even the smallest donation will help us get closer to reaching the goal of getting this project funded.","Some of the risks with this project would be the location.  Many of the scenes are set to film outside.  Mississippi doesn't have the best weather. It could rain one early morning, be 90 degrees around noon, then be below 30 later that night.

My project, this weaving loom is based upon years of passion for textiles, mechanics and PLC control. In this context I developed in recent years this automated wooden loom. This prototype was realized over a period of 4 years in my attic and in my garden shed. Where it is located now… Although it initially was not the intention to extract this personnel project any further, I was continually motivated by friends and acquaintances and also outsiders to lift this project to a higher level. By previous exhibition there even was interest from the industry to take over the prototype. However, I have spent a lot of time and hours and passion into the project, so I choose to take the next step to turn the prototype into a production worthy model myself. For this purpose all the elements and drawings must be realized and developed. I have chosen to use aluminum as raw material. There are little more then 250 wooden parts to be converted in aluminum parts. This weaving machine will be able to weave continuously ( so automated ) fabric up to 100 cm widht. Target group for this loom will be private people (hobbyists).100% silk winter-scarf: gotfather not included","Major advantage of this project is that the foundation is already very well prepared.

Difficulty may be the time frame, but with the necessary funds I’m able to restructure my time so there is sufficient space to show my funders step by step my progression when I go along.

I must change all wooden parts with aluminium profiles/systems.In industry today, weaving happens on the upmost advanced machinery. However, before the industrial revolution, people were weaving @ home on wooden looms. Today, still a lot of people need to weave @ home on old style wooden looms in order to survive, trying selling there fabrics on the local market. If you look around on the subject, you'll find that there has been no evolution what so ever. The working conditions are sometimes still the same as 200 years ago, sometimes even worse.I want to build a light automated modern loom for home based businesses, unique, never done before. I will construct the loom so it will be able to weave terry fabric.As shown in the video i've already finished the concept of the loom. Next and final step since al motions are developed,- is to convert this wooden prototype into a aluminium KNEX-like device. Meaning everyone can set it up using a manual. Overall intention is to have a automated loom as simple and cheap as possible.The idea is ""keep it simple"".I am a very experienced technician, i can build it. :-)Hope you love the project.",There are a few technical people/friends willing to support/advice if there are still any technical problems during the conversion. But i have a good look on what and how it must be done. As you can imagine i'm a technician myself. :-)

They travel the land, saving people from the tyrannical wizards.My film will be an origins story, explaining how Thundarr, Ariel, and Ookla had met. Where sorcery comes from. Why Thundarr can understand Ookla's bestial speech. How Thundarr acquired the Sunsword. Where Ariel is a princess of. Amongst many other questions.My hopes for this movie trailer is to get a major film company interested in making the actual feature film. Warner Brothers seem reluctant to do anything with the property, but someone with enough pull in the industry could potentially change their minds. At least that's the plan. If nothing else, it might put a bee in the right person's bonnet.My connections in the local film industry have estimated that make up, FX, locations, permits, props, etc will cost a total of about $3000.The above video is a collection of stills from the show, the actors who are in line for the roles, and pictures of characters from similar movies/TV shows (and the actors who played them) to give you an idea of what the movie/trailer will be like.","The biggest obstacles in this project are legal and practical. The practical challenges are the make up effects for Ookla and the Pig-Men, plus finding the necessary locations. The legal obstacles are that Warner Brothers owns the rights to the cartoon, while I own the rights to my movie script. This should have little bearing on the smaller project, which is essentially a not-for-profit fan film and thus doesn't break any copyright laws. It may make it more difficult to get the actual feature greenlit by a producer, but that's a problem for a later date.I have already made some inquiries of local film makers, and there are a lot of people interested in this project.

Originally created by Joe Ruby and Ken Spears of Ruby-Spears Productions, it was the best parts of Conan The Barbarian, Star Wars, Planet Of The Apes,and The Road Warriorall in one amazing program. Set 2000 years after a rogue comet destroyed civilization as we know it, the story centers on the adventures of the three main characters. There's the titular character, Thundarr, who is as fierce and as stubborn as he is strong. While hot headed and quick to charge into battle regardless of the odds, he has a good heart and seeks to help the less fortunate and the downtrodden. Then there's Princess Ariel, an attractive sorceress of Chinese descent who is as powerful as she is beautiful, and is very much in love with Thundarr. And rounding out the group is the very wookiee-like Ookla The Mok. A leonine humanoid mutant, Ookla is immensely powerful and quick to anger, but loyal to a fault. Together, the three of them ride across the ruined landscape on horseback, saving people from the tyranny of the evil wizards who now rule these lands.My complete film (remember, this is just going to be a trailer for the proposed movie) will be an origins story. It will explain things like ""Ariel is a Princess of what kingdom exactly?"", ""How did she come to travel with the likes of Thundarr and Ookla?"", ""Why is it Thundarr can understand Mok-Speak?"", ""How did Thundarr get his fabulous Sunsword?"" and ""Where did the sorcerers come from?"" among many others.My hopes for this movie trailer is to help get a major movie production company (Legendary Studios, Troublemaker Studios, Mutant Enemy, etc) to be interested in making my script into an actual motion picture. Or at the very least put a bee in Warner Brother's bonnet and get a Thundarr film made (although I can't guarantee that it'll be as awesome as mine would be, lol).My connections in the local film industry have estimated that make up, wardrobe, VFX, locations, permits, props, etc, will cost a total of $3000 to $5000. I have local film makers and actors who are all very interested in taking part in this project. Now all I need is the funding to really get started.","The biggest obstacles in this project are legal and practical.

In a battle between light and darkness, Lucius, an apprentice to the powerful queen of darkness, Zabravia, is ordered to capture and execute his brother Elias in a pitiful attempt to redeem himself for living in his brothers shadow all his life and become king of Dominia. Meaningless as to where he stands between light and darkness, Lucius is faced with the challenge and must choose who his loyalty lies with.This film will be distributed for free via Vimeo on January 22nd, 2016.In the land of Dominia we encounter a tragedy of love and the battle between the forces of dark and light. Zabravia was in love with Abel, a talented young sorcerer, but then entered Belinda, a smart, beautiful young witch who captured Abel's heart. Devastated, Zabravia vowed to put an end to the entire Abel blood line. Her powers with dark magic grew and so did her army ruling over Dominia as the queen of darkness.As their children grew, Lucius, a failure all his life, never lived up to the expectations of his father. Always living in the shadow of his younger brother Elias. Resenting his father and longing for a purpose Lucius turned to the dark side to become an apprentice to the powerful dark queen, Zabravia.In a pitiful attempt to redeem himself, Lucius made a pledge to Zabravia to capture and murder Elias in order to become king of Dominia. One dark night, Zabravia travels to the Abel manor in a deadly rage and murders Abel and Belinda out of pain and jealousy. If she could not have his love, no one could. Lucius began questioning his loyalty to the dark side.It is only when Lucius is unable to kill Elias that he realizes the good within himself by saving his brothers life, taking down Zabravia, avenging his parents death and ultimately restoring balance to the kingdom.We would like to welcome you all to be apart of this project that not only mean a lot to us, but to the world wide Harry Potter fan base!

I love woodworking, and becoming a shipwright would be awesome. I applied and toured the school, and I just found out that I was accepted to go learn there. If I am able to go we will be doing a restoration on Felicity Ann. Which Ann Davison , the first successful solo crossing by a woman, sailed in. In the first quarter I will learn all the woodworking basics and techniques. Also, this is when I will be crafting my own tools, and tool chest. http://nwboatschool.org/","There will be many challenges from understanding design layout to curving the wood, but because this is something I want to do, I will not give up.",https://www.kickstarter.com/projects/69799432/a-woodworking-journey?ref=discovery_category_newest,69799432/a-woodworking-journey,"The idea behind this Kickstart project is simple—I want to start my own handcrafted furniture business. I have worked for cabinet shops and built cabinetry for boats, but I have ideas and dreams of my own. In order to make my dream furniture, by hand, I need tools. Lots of special tools like: a smoothing plane, jointer plane, low angle block plane, rip saw, dovetail saw, a plethora of chisels, marking gauges, shoulder planes and the list goes on.Also, to make solid wood furniture, I need wood. I know I'm going to have to hustle and work my behind off to get this business off the ground (trust me, I know it isn't going to happen over night). I have the drive, determination, skill and design ideas to get this business off the ground.My plan is to make handcrafted furniture and sell the items I make on etsy, eBay, amazon, and other online selling venues. I don't have a need for a building, the shed in my backyard serves me well. The money from backers will be used to buy tools and wood.When I am able to get the wood and tools I will be able to make the rewards with no problem. Until then, I have to post the pictures from the book I have. Sorry for that, but I am working my way up from the bottom.","Some mishaps/challenges that this project may and probably will face are the many happy accidents (any Bob Ross fans out there?) that occur during woodworking. For example, my tools could potentially damage (i.e. chip or nick) the wood that will be used for any furniture piece. While I strive for perfection in my work, I am constantly learning and there have been times when I nicked and chipped wood and flesh. Once I get over the frustration, and rock kicking, I complete the piece I am working on and learn from the mistakes knowing they only make me better.Another issue is my natural, homemade wood finish. This finish requires numerous layers which slows down the process as the finish settles and changes depending on the type of wood. Another problem I see is the shipping of the final pieces. The larger pieces of furniture will need to be shipped whole because the hand-crafted joints need to be glued and clamped together and not screwed (I hate screws). I suppose I could include the glue and clamps, but this requires more money and requires the backer to put together furniture in a way they may never have before. So, I think it's best I ship the larger pieces as complete items rather than in separate parts."

The government has called on the world to participate in the future of Colombia with a unique project. We have been involved in the economy of Colombia, as well as securing jobs. The reason why we were involved was the almost 50% decline in core oil production. The reason for the decline is the climate and with Colombia we have the possibility to guarantee the cultivation as well as the production all year round. The Styrian pumpkin seed oil is world-wide known and big buyers such as the United States of America and Dubai but also all Austrians living abroad suffer from it. Meanwhile, China has also come up with this idea and produces this core oil, but not with our original recipe. We have accepted our project in Colombia and have given us an alliance by document, we will finance this project, but we have to take care of the start up ourselves. I would be glad to give you more detailed information as long as there is interest. We need to start up a sum of € 15-20,000, - with this sum you can either participate or we pay it back as a loan.

Additional mosaics will be added periodically to the original 30, expanding the mosaic library with each update.Word Mosaics is ""Word Art with Friends"" or just as a solo player. Word Mosaics appeals to the old school board game enthusiast, as well as, the next generation of word game aficionados.GAME PLAYEach mosaic shuffles across the playing board allowing the player to choose which mosaic to form on the board. The letter tiles also shuffle 7 at a time to allow the player to create words by placing the tiles on the board in the formation of the mosaic. The playing board has bonus squares like traditional word games and will score in a similar way. Players may also choose a timed game instead of a scoring game.GAME DEVELOPMENTWord Mosaics was created as a board game and is in production and will be available in the early part of July at www.enigmazegames.com.The next logical step is a phone app, and my platform for this game is Corona SDK.Corona is the best solution for developing cross-platform apps for all major platforms and devices.

The core words of Word Rhombus are anagrams which offer an endless possiblity for creating words. We just limited the game to four rounds per set of 21 letters.With each round the number of words needed to continue lessens and so does the time alloted. The player can chose to take it to the limit or move on to the next set of 21 tiles. (But where's the challenge in that?)After accomplishing the goal or time runs out you receive the points from the tiles that spell completed words in the bottom portion of the diamond and that ends Round 1. Beginning Round 2 the player hits reset and the bottom portion of the diamond clears; the letters refresh in the top portion and the counter restarts with a four minute counter to allow you to fill different words into the bottom portion of the diamond. A word log is generated for each game set to keep track of the words already used in each round. After accomplishing the goal or time runs out you receive the points from the tiles that spell completed words.

Our platform enables people to weigh in heavily and directly participate in news, community, networks, etc.. First and foremost is our News Platform (read more below).Built and created from the ground up with personal owner funds (75K) over the last 3 years, iLocalize already boasts 38,000+ small business owner members who have registered with iLocalize organically (no cash spent getting them to register)!iLocalize is already running, and is ready for a boost to push it beyond where it has organically travelled. Businesses and users are registering daily on iLocalize.com, hungry for a place to connect and build their local communities under an umbrella of integrity and  power of the people, away from mass-media and money controlled corporations.iLocalize is free to the public, and will always be free. We have built iLocalize with geographic tech in mind, allowing any member to stay logged in and set their geographical preferences to as broad as the entire country or as specific as the city, cities, county, or states they want to see and participate in for People Powered News, Cars, Classifieds, Housing, Projects, Shopping, Work Galleries, Coupons, Communities, Social Networking, etc..People Powered NEWS:Please take a moment to read about our unique news platform, which gives a good idea as to the workings of each section, we don't simply put up another static news or classifieds platform, we are changing the way news is done, getting the power, voice, and truth back to the people, and away from money-influenced agendas.Our News Section (where our first major push will be focused through funds acquired in this KickStarter campaign) will change the atmosphere of news and how it is disseminated: https://ilocalize.com/news/aboutcontent(be sure to check out the news postings both as a guest and a free registered user-member (set your geographic preferences and choose more than the 1 month of past news default setting) and post your own local news, and the owner will engage with each and every news post submitted until this cannot be maintained)People Powered, Local Business Backed and bid-for Projects:Say goodbye to cold leads! iLocalize projects enables consumers to engage with local qualified businesses who have understood their project needs and placed a solid bid. Consumers choose which businesses they want to work with, at a price they have budgeted.Businesses compete live on consumer's projects, taking out the nuisance of cold or dead leads and wasted advertising dollars.  This translates into savings for consumers, and boosts local economies.Businesses pay only for hot leads (our projects platform removes the pain of paying for cold leads), desired local exposure, and real project interest by consumers.https://ilocalize.com/projectsClassifieds, Cars, and Housing:Most of us buy and sell cars, things, and housing as we move through life. iLocalize simplifies this process of searching for, placing, and buying classifieds, cars, and housing.Cars: https://ilocalize.com/carClassifieds: https://ilocalize.com/classified/aboutcontentHousing: https://ilocalize.com/housingSHOP:We are long time amazon.com sellers, and understand the pains, frustrations, and awkwardness of that popular platform on both the consumer and esp. the seller side -  we are confident, we can compete directly with amazon.com, AND we can do so without competing directly with our sellers (as Amazon does) and minus the high Amazon commissions, while enabling local small businesses. The shop section is planned out, and small businesses organically have been signing up over the last few years.  It is ready to move into the launch phase.SIMPLIFIED SOCIAL NETWORK (worth your time):iLocalize is the first platform where a social network works seamlessly with all of life's necessary business transactions, community connections, etc.. https://ilocalize.com/usersLocal Geo-targeted advertising:With iLocalize, businesses can advertise locally in the category they belong to and geographic areas they want business in. Businesses  choose how long they want to place and ad, as well as the section(s) (Cars, Classifieds, Housing, Services, Projects, Galleries, Shop (coming soon) and geographical areas they desire to advertise within.iLocalize AgentsWe are excited to begin building iLocalize agent's platform, where agents will be brought on in local communities as contractors, to visit all the local businesses in their community, invite them to register on iLocalize for free, and become their personal, local, iLocalize representative.Agents will be encouraging those businesses, while inviting them to participate in our projects, local shop, and local community sections to boost their business, online presence, and work galleries through our powerful business-building tools available to all small businesses registered with iLocalize.com.  Agents can earn a residual income by visiting and maintaining a good working relationship with local businesses through iLocalize. We cannot stress enough the importance of integrity based, people powered, dissemination of facts, and information from a local position. We are mostly excited for our news section, and will hire a dedicated team solely for that section, as we will each section as they grow.Localize will never be a solely for profit-focused and run business, and we have proven this by exhausting our own personal funds and continue to pour in countless hours to avoid entirely the ownership of this platform to ever fall underneath a loan, bank, persons, or financial institutions who do not share our same values of integrity and people.We are serious about people, and people are the focus of iLocalize in the end. How can we build the individual, the family, and the local communities in which they live (includes small businesses) - is one of the first questions asked when doing anything for iLocalize.Help us out by registering for free today and spreading the word.Register as a User Member (individual accounts, not business accounts):https://ilocalize.com/user/registerRegister as a Business Members (business accounts):https://ilocalize.com/vendor/registerAll funds acquired through this Kickstarter campaign will be used in one or all of the following ways:","FUNDS TO BUILD and EXPANDiLocalize has had many challenges already, the biggest challenge upfront being that of taking this massively thought-through, site-specked, and thoroughly planned project and building it out on a budget without getting any type of loan upfront (to prove models of the platform). This was overcome in part by the owner being an avid web applications developer and already succeeding online-tech-entrepreneur (and also happens to be a very good graphic artist) - who planned for over a year  every tiny detail from the database structure, layout, to the User Interface (UI) and ajax-driven seamless technology behind each seemingly simple section on the iLocalize platform, to then be able to take the plans to his tried and tested web engineer friends (2 of them) to build out this platform at a fraction of the cost most pay for such a robust and tech-driven platform. The owner has also been, over the last decade, intimately engaged with some of the world's most popular platforms, from social networks, to eCommerce giants, from consulting small businesses across the globe, to working directly with lead generation companies, media sharing technologies, product development and more.  This combined experience has helped the owner not just plan and prepare each section to compete with and beat competitors in each niche market, and that at a fraction of the cost, but also connect and rub shoulders with many talented individuals who have given valuable feedback, insights, and introductions to talent that can and will be used as teams are built to support iLocalize. SMALL BUSINESS REGISTRATIONSNext in line was the challenge of getting small businesses to register without any advertising money upfront, enabling long term growth without the cost of any advertising money upfront. How do you attract small business owners, retain them, and enable their business's online technology and consumer-client attraction needs?These challenges have been overcome with both proper understanding of search engines and SEO (search engine optimization) which the owner believes such understanding only comes to those who have been extensively hands-on in web programming and development - as well as personal, extensive, hands on experience of the pains and needs of small businesses.38,000+ businesses registering on iLocalize.com later, plenty of new businesses registering daily now, all without having to spend a single cent on advertising upfront to them (proving both the idea that businesses still are hungry and don't know where to turn for an end-all platform to boost their business, get paying clients (hot leads), and expose their business geographically, and the idea that traffic doesn't have to be purchased but can be earned for long term, without-money, solid growth) - iLocalize is alive and ready for funds to see her into the future.PEOPLE POWEREDThe challenge almost every single popular web platform has is that of staying popular while avoiding the tendency to be driven by money and profits, which ultimately replaces people and names with numbers and bottom line profit margins, making any service less appealing and more robotic feeling.This challenge has been met head on, not just through what has already been accomplished without the need of loans or greedy investors upfront, but by building each section with the goal of building the individuals, the relationships of the individuals, and the communities the individual are living within. People powered is not just a feel good phrase to iLocalize and it's owners, but is what will power the platform, and in turn, empower the people.TEAMSIt may surprise most that iLocalize has been, so far, built by one single person who hired out a group of 2 friend-programmers and has forwarded many questions to many talented individuals across many business and social spectrums. Jared Smith, has been tirelessly working at iLocalize, bouncing ideas off of the friendships with people working in the most popular platforms of our time, while he has been continually gaining experience in his own successful small business tech consulting work, eCommerce brands, news and journalism industries, lead generation knowledge, web development technologies, server capacities, etc. - using all this knowledge to incredibly simplify life's most common reasons of being online, on the internet, in one simple place.The challenge now is to pull together these teams of talented people and build a company to catch and expand the iLocalize vision. Jared has met many talented individuals over the last decade who are ready to jump on board, but the timing and funds have not been ready as of yet to do so. Jared often jokes with a few wealthy investor-friends, who have wanted a piece of the pie so to speak, explaining to them that iLocalize will be bigger than google and amazon combined, yet will belong and be run mostly by the individual people-iLocalize-members and businesses and will return most of it's profits back to the people to help local economies thrive and that without asking a cent from iLocalize user-members and not requiring businesses to pay anything until they actually get clients (leads) or want to advertise directly on our platform.With a vision that big, Jared recognizes greatly the need for help on what has so far been accomplished with a team of 3 individuals, building out a platform that would have cost anywhere from 500K to 1m according to bids received from multiple software-web-development companies, but was accomplished for under 100K.",https://www.kickstarter.com/projects/integrity/never-to-pick-a-bad-melon-again-the-first-ever-mel?ref=discovery_category_newest,integrity/never-to-pick-a-bad-melon-again-the-first-ever-mel,"I love watermelon! I've enjoyed watermelon picked fresh from Chile, up through Peru, Mexico and throughout the USA.Depending on the season, even an experienced picker like myself can be fooled time and again, as to whether or not a watermelon or any melon at that is good on the inside. But let's start with the watermelon.I've been frustrated time and again cutting open an expensive melon only to find it was bad. After cutting yet another melon open last week, I'd had enough.I know the technology is available, maybe even in our ""smart"" phones - and I have the connections to make such a device if not available yet in smart phones.I looked to my wife and six watermelon-loving children - after cutting open another disappointing watermelon, smiled and almost said at the same time, we need a smart device to show us what the melon looks like inside before buying it let alone cutting it open.The idea was born. Create a device and/or software using hopefully existing smart phones to simply be able to point it at a melon, and show us if a melon is bad or good, crisp or ""cheesy"" (as my kids call it).","I have the connections of engineers, software developers, and even farm scientists, the challenge will be to create a learning device on the cloud that learns and shares as each melon is picked such that ultimately it becomes a standard app that can be used on all sorts of foods, starting with the watermelon.Testing and gathering data will be key, with watermelons of all types to begin with, we will need to test for thicknesses, color, geographic birth places, density, spacial volume, seeds, no seeds, and much more."

We have £2000 saved so just need an additional £2000 to get this project ready before Christmas!",https://www.kickstarter.com/projects/woodlea-gaming/mobile-cricket-championship?ref=discovery_category_newest,woodlea-gaming/mobile-cricket-championship,"Objective of the gameThe objective of the game is to limit how many runs your opponent makes by bowling and taking wickets, and then score more than them when it is your turn to bat. Both batting and bowling require the right amount of skill and brains as only the top cricketers in the world have.Take your created player up the world rankings through quick fire matches against other users. The higher your ranking the better tournaments you can enter. Matches are played over 2 intense overs each of bowling and batting VS real opponents. Challenge your friends or play random people across the world in the greatest all round cricketing game to come to mobile platforms (android & iOS)Batting system. Slingshot mechanism which will test the players reactions, timing and shot selection.To bat simply pull back (and your batter will raise his bat), to hit the ball release. If you have drawn back in the North East direction, your batter will attempt to hit the ball in exactly 180 degrees the opposite direction, in the South West direction (straight shot down the off side). The further you pull back the harder you will hit the ball. Your reactions will be tested as well as your timing as you will not know what sort of delivery your opponent will bowl. Anticipate correctly and the rewards are yours. Time your shots perfectly to hit the boundaries and watch out for the fieldBowling system.3 steps, easy to use but tricky to master.To bowl, simply swipe up and draw a line. The faster you swipe the faster you bowl. The straighter you bowl the more accurate your delivery, and how long your line is depends on the length of your delivery. Mastering the perfect line and length will take some time, just a few degrees out could be the difference between the perfect yorker or a full toss hit for 6. Seam bowlers - The speed of your delivery is affected by how fast you draw the line. Go all out for speed and beat the batter for pace, or go for the perfect line and length delivery.Special: Once you've ranked up you can unlock swing deliveries. To swing the ball draw your line as normal, but with the slightest bend. When executed correctly you can deceive the batter all ends up and get that crucial LBW/catch in the slips. Be careful though, if you try too hard you'll give away needless wides!Spin Bowlers - The spin on your delivery depends on how much you decide to rip the ball beforehand. Set the Rip-O-Meter, and draw the perfect line. The slower your delivery the more height you give it. Be careful not to bowl it too high, there's nothing sweeter than hitting a juicy full toss for 6!Special: Once you've ranked up you can bowl one Doosra per over. This is a great way of getting that crucial wicket in a tight match and keeping the batter on his toes.Although you can only select one specialism (Seam bowlers or Off/Leg Spin), if you rank up enough you get the choice of bowling one over with each specialism. Perfect if you need to change your strategy midway through the matchIf you have any additional questions about the game please feel free to drop me an email directly on pravuppal89@gmail.com","The important thin about this project is getting the animations and control system right. I will be spending alot of time with the developers to make sure we get the control system spot on and make it an extremely fun, yet realistic experience for players.

https://www.kickstarter.com/projects/250102195/know-your-honey?ref=discovery_category_newest,250102195/know-your-honey,"Locally grown honey, that you own.  Honey is much more than just a sweetener. It has been used for centuries for healing and rejuvenation. Most of the honey sold in stores has been heated and pasteurized. This processing destroys many of the enzymes and beneficial compounds that make raw honey so nutritious. Regular honey often looks clear and syrupy. Raw honey has not been treated with heat; it is often more buttery, solid and opaque than pasteurized honey and often contains ""cappings,"" or small pieces of beeswax. It is completely left in its natural state and therefore contains pollen, enzymes, antioxidants and many other beneficial compounds that researchers are just beginning to learn about.Welcome to the real live Farmville. Our mission at Know Your Food is to bring consumers closer to their food. Through ownership urban residents can realize how important bees are to the health of the planet. You can buy as many production units as you want. These units are housed at the Know Your Food ranch nearest you and will provide food for your family for years to come. You will pay a monthly boarding fee to cover the cost of keeping your bees. If at some time in the future you decide to leave the real Farmville environment, KYF will help you sell your bees.  Your bees will be raised in a herbicide and pesticide-free environment. We will be sure to manage your bees in the right time frames, just like you would in the game Farmville.  But on this farm you are the one that receives the actual harvest even if you live in a city or suburb.At Know Your Food we know enlightened consumers want to make more ethically-based choices about the food they buy. Our consumers want to have ownership of their health.  Today's consumers are concerned about supporting both humane husbandry and sustainable agriculture practices which place a high value on quality of life and land. While honey purchased at the grocery store is still healthy for you, owning the hive that pollinates plants that improve the soils for future generations is a more active role in making the world a better place.Honey, as a natural sweetener is more easily used in the human body. Along with the pollen and other parts of the honey, our immune systems respond in a beneficial manner that protects us from illnesses and allergies.According the the Permaculture Research Institute, ""There are well over 30 commercial producers of honey that have no traces of pollen and lack beneficial vitamins and enzymes among a host of other natural constituents which are removed due to pasteurization and processing. Most golden honey you see at your local grocery is dead and far from the health promoting powerhouse of its raw unpasteurized counterpart. Processed honey is not honey at all and if you desire any kind of health benefits, you must stick to the real stuff.In the U.S., the Food and Drug Administration says that any product that’s been ultra-filtered and no longer contains pollen isn’t honey. However, the FDA isn’t checking honey sold in the U.S. to see if it contains pollen.if you desire any kind of health benefits, you must stick to the real stuff.""When you own the hive you have the choice to use the honey in its raw state and reap the benefits, or to share it with your friends so they have the same health chances you receive from the honey. For bee owners who would like their honey filtered, Know Your Food offers this service for a per pint fee.Raw honey has been shown to carry 10 or more friendly, G.I. improving bacteria. These bacteria, include lactobacilli and bifidobacteria. This aids digestion for both humans and bees.Know Your Food Bee feed mostly on wild flowers and plants.

Your animals will be raised in a drug and hormone free environment and be chiropractically adjusted as part of their routine care. We will be sure to manage your units in the right time frames, just like you would in Farmville.  But on this farm you are the one that receives the actual harvest even if you live in a city or suburb.At Know Your Food we know enlightened consumers want to make more ethically-based choices about the meat they buy. Our consumers want to have ownership of their health.  Today's consumers are concerned about supporting both humane husbandry and sustainable agriculture practices which place a high value on quality of life and land. The meat bought at the grocer's meat counter can be confusing. Words like natural, farm fresh, and even organic in reference to meat animals does not necessarily equate with humane husbandry. We want to provide our owner’s an alternative to purchasing commercially farmed meat. Our buyers own the production unit and decide where to have them raised. They spend a bit more if necessary on meats produced sustainably and ethically. Know Your Food will take on the responsibility, time and effort to treat animals raised for your consumption with respect, and compassion. At Know Your Food we raise premium grass-fed and pastured meats for customers who are looking for wholesome, ethically raised products. Compared to grain-fed meats, grass-fed meat is: • Two to four times richer in heart healthy omega-3 fatty acids. • Higher in ""good"" unsaturated fats and lower in ""bad"" saturated fats. • Three to five times higher in CLA (Conjugated Linoleic Acid) content. • Loaded with over 400% more of vitamin A (as beta-carotene) and E. • Virtually devoid of risk of Mad Cow Disease. You are the owner, so you decide the cuts and sizes of your steaks and roasts, how big the packages should be. Do you want your chickens whole or parted? Know Your Food animals will produce a smaller carbon footprint than the meat found at specialty stores that bring in organic grass-fed meat from New Zealand and Australia.  KYF consumers will pay the same price for all the cuts of meat, no more jaw-dropping prices for prime cuts.  The meat quality from animals raised at Know Your Food will surprise most foodies because animal chiropractic helps to create tender, less stressed animals. The chickens at Know Your Food will be pasture raised, under protected pasture areas. Chicks will start out in protected enclosures to ensure they have a better chance to make it to adult weight. They will be offered mealy worms along with bugs and plants, however they won’t spend the day outside until they are large enough to defend themselves. Adult chickens enjoy the sunshine and fresh air in protected pastures where the highest portion of their food comes from the grass, grubs, and bugs. Know Your Food farms use rotational grazing for our pastured poultry, which is similar to the way animals graze in the wild. After the cattle have gone into another field, the chicken pastures move across that paddock. The additional droppings from the chicken further fertilize the soil and feed the microbes in the paddock before they move to new grass. Soil microbes are important for renewing the grasses in the pastures. As the chickens follow the cows, a harmonious process occurs that is never allowed to happen in factory farming. The birds get fresh air and move around freely in pasture each day, a huge difference to the conventionally reared confinement houses that resemble concentration camp for birds. No hormones or antibiotics are used; each bird is antibiotic and hormone free, humanely raised and chiropractically adjusted for optimal nervous system function. Chiropractic adjustment allows the chickens to gain weight in a naturally more efficient manner. It also improves the quality of the meat.",The OOPs clause:Accidents happen with animals.

Sometimes I write, sometimes I design, sometimes I make art. I made this illustration, which is kind of collection of all of those things. It's a common saying, but I had this vision of combining the words to form a solitary graphic that conveyed the thought. And through both form and light, I think the endeavor was successful.I recognize that ""Less is More"" can mean many different things to many different people. For me, through years of moving across the country and downsizing my life to what I can carry in only a few duffel bags, I've found that there is a profound freedom in shedding that which I don't need. It allows me to focus on only keeping things that are important and personally valuable, which is a constant challenge in a world where excess is seen as success.So, if it means something to you, maybe you can help support the project.

When Snow gets sick and there’s no medicine to heal her, Hopper decides to follow in his grandfather’s footsteps and set out for the cure.

As a follow up to my first book ""The Invisible Histories of the Spiral Mountain,"" I’ve created ""The Marchioness in Red,"" a collection of 12 religio-erotic poems, 4 digital collages, and an Oriental/Occidental sexuality comparison essay inspired by my travels in the Orient and my subsequent return to the United States.I am now ready to embark upon the next phase of my life which includes writing a 100 page novella. I feel that Kickstarter.com can help me achieve my goals by providing an opportunity to market my books independently. The sales from ""The Marchioness in Red"" will provide me with capitol for my next project called ""The Erotic Tales of Bucephalus.""""The Erotic Tales of Bucephalus"" will be a 100 page novella published Christmas 2011. The collection of episodic stories will center on Alexander the Great’s mighty steed Bucephalus who dies in the Battle of the Hydaspes in 326 BCE. After his death, he awakens in human form in a dilapidated modern-day hotel room. In these first-person tales Bucephalus learns of the eternal struggle between beast and man by indulging in licentious engagements with the hotel’s occupants: an elusive room-hopping nymph, a tattooed dominatrix widower, and aged prostitute named Olympias.In 2009, I also wrote my first book, a parabolic autobiography entitled ""The Invisible Histories of the Spiral Mountain."" The self-published work was a 362 page narrative relating the labyrinthine quest of a knight-errant into a sort of dream world of the erotic: a sensuous, idealized realm of possibilities. To help support ""The Marchioness in Red"" and ""The Erotic Tales of Bucephalus,"" Sublimation Pressworks has made available a new limited edition hardcover version of ""The Invisible Histories of the Spiral Mountain"" (The coffee table edition includes all of the illustrations from the original one-of-a-kind edition of the book). There is also a paperback version (sorry... no illustrations) for those that can't afford the coffee table version.Check out the work @ http://www.facebook.com/pages/Christopher-Kramerand http://www.facebook.com/pages/Sublimation-PressworksTo be able to achieve my goal, I need to raise enough money to fund the creation, production, marketing, and distribution for my next book which will be promoted on my new Sublimation Pressworks website (details to come). I've set my goal low ($1,000), but I need much more to make this all happen. With your donations, I can make this possible.I thank you for the opportunity to submit this proposal for your consideration.Sincerely,Christopher KramerP.S.

Like the Bauhaus, the Beats, or the Surrealists, the Romantics, the Dadaists, or the Cavaliers we want to encourage a new creative paradigm unfettered by location.Sadly, we surf the Internet and rarely see this kind of interaction. Our work challenges this by offering three separate websites that will contain diverse content:Sublimation Pressworks (http://www.sublimationpressworks.com) is an arts and literature periodical/online-store. It's our ambition to publish limited-edition artist books and trade paperbacks dedicated to literary erotica, mysticism, philosophy, art theory, occultism, and fantasy-based fiction and non-fiction.The Modern Babylon Reader (http://www.modernbabylonreader.com) continues the erotic legacy set by 19th century periodicals The Pearl and The Oyster, and 20th century publishers Olympia Press and Obelisk Press. We aim to provide high quality—sometimes controversial, but always provocative—erotica for an audience in need of something poignant and unique. Serials, confessions, short stories, interviews, reviews, and erotic art create an epicurean feast for the imagination. (Official launch: September 1st).The Odeon Review(http://www.odeonreview.com) provides in-depth, intelligent reviews, commentaries, and musings on films both obscure and mainstream for those craving something interesting and insightful. A step above the average film review site, which primarily focuses on new releases and comic book movies, The Odeon Review will focus on history, directors, themes, and genres. It will entertain and educate those with a love for epic cinema. Fans of the Criterion Collection rejoice. (Official launch: September 1st).Quarterly, the Sublimation Pressworks umbrella will publish a journal in trade paperback format highlighting the best articles from the weekly/biweekly/and monthly formats of all three websites.For this Kickstarter campaign we’re focusing on the premiere volume.The periodical will be in the 5.5” x 8.5” perfect bound trade paperback format with interior pages printed in black and white on 60# white Husky Offset paper. The full color covers will be printed on white 12 point C1S, a heavyweight stock that is coated on one side. After printing, the covers are laminated with gloss film to protect from scuffing. The edition will be limited to 1000 copies. The printing and design cost for the edition will be around $5000.Being an independent publishing company is not easy. It takes time, money, and perseverance.You may ask: Why should I give money to Sublimation Pressworks when there are so many other artists in the world also in need of funding? The answer is simple: What we’re asking for is the unique chance to contribute something literary and daring to an Internet world that’s getting more illiterate and predictable.We’ve set our goal low barely covering the cost of the first edition, hoping we’ll be able to fund the volume on a shoestring budget.If we succeed we’ll be able to sell copies of the book on the websites.If we double our goal, we’ll be able to produce a second volume.If we hit a success of $20,000 or more we’ll be able to professionally compensate our writers, designers, and staff for their hard work.With your donations, you can make this happen.

Well for one I plan on getting a better quality for printing this then originally planned. Since there been such a great interest in this I figured why not try at least.

The magazine was started in May 2006 and was going along nicely until the fall of 2009, when the economy tanked. The magazine stopped publishing temporarily.In March of 2011, Diversity Rules Magazine returned in digital format. The exposure the magazine has received has been incredible and that tells me that it has been missed and it's time to return to a print version as well.The purpose of this Kickstarter campaign is threefold. First, I wish to pay off the straggler debt that is owed. There still is an approximate $3000.00 debt to be paid. Second, I wish to raise and set aside enough money to be able to print 6 monthly issues. Having the funds to do that will allow the staff during this initial 6 month period to solicit advertisers, patrons and investors.Last and probably the most important, is to provide a publication in both print and digital formats that meets the needs of the queer community. Diversity Rules Magazine is my passion. I see it as a vehicle to educate those that are not quite sure about what it means to be queer. It also is an outlet for up and coming queer publishers, musicians, and writers to express themselves. Often times it is hard for folks to get publicity for their queer oriented projects. I want to provide a forum for that. My focus is on people and helping them succeed, in addition to being an educational resource. I also want to provide a resource to let folks know they are NOT ALONE in this crazy queer world!In addition to this Kickstarter campaign, there are other opportunities to support the magazine.

Before the name, I was looking for a way to start my own business. Scroll through every search engine looking at owning a franchise. Then I started looking for a business idea. I happen to land on this company called Aliveshoes. They manufacture some of the greatest design and custom made sneakers. They have variety of great shoe products. They have upcoming designers who have some design background. So I had a vision and idea of how I would present my sneakers. Therefore, I signed up to be a part of the brand and begin designing sneakers two days after filing process. I had hit some curves with my ideas and I have made poor decisions on presentation. Not to mention name for the sneakers. They all failed due to preorder numbers. The fact I didn't have a prototype to present it but I couldn't hit the numbers. Jefferson Ave became my Mona Lisa of sneaker design. The issue is selling them to a skeptical crowd. The design is there but I want to present them to the public without a picture. I want to advertise them without describing them. This is why I need your help and support.","In order for these sneakers to be in production, they have to completed the preorder phase. The sneakers do not get made and will not be available to sale. I have been through this rodeo before when you design something so great; it doesn't grasp attention. People are skeptic buyers who do not buy something from a brand they are unfamiliar with. I have place a full campaign on social meda platforms with advertisement but nothing has been solid proof. When this product is completed and it will be in production where people can buy with out waiting for preorder numbers to reach its goal in order to shipped. Once buyers get a peak of the sneakers physically it will encourage skeptic buyers to check em out. I have face adversity before and accomplish the challenges that lay before me. This isn't nothing new and I know it will inspire to put more effort into accomplishing it.",https://www.kickstarter.com/projects/1999430701/elegant-rae-collection?ref=discovery_category_newest,1999430701/elegant-rae-collection,"What you just saw from the clip above this paragraph was the Elegant Rae campaign ad. Be as elegant and inspiring as you should be is the slogan. What does that message mean, it's a message of encouragement. It means not allowing others to discourage your elegance and whom you are inspiring to be in life. On top of the project page is a video showing you the product. Today, I come to you in need of investment. The product looks wonderful and the campaign ad feels inspirational. Yet, these two elements aren't really driving in consumers to preorder which is the road block. Preorder demands are complicated and also advertisement can be difficult without the right tools. I have investing my full commitment into this opportunity to grow not just making shoes but the whole brand itself. I have investing in most of finances to begin this venture. The only way this opportunity can work is if I am giving more tools to increase marketing and sales. That is why I need your help.The funds will go to the product and marketing. Having the product in my position will help erase skepticism on the product. It will also help out with advertisement such as hiring a model and photographer which will increase more exposure. It definitely would make my marketing plan function more efficient. You are investment is important and it shall not be a bad investment giving the scale of the shoe market. You will play a huge part in this brand with your investment. Upper high heeled ankle boot. Elegant & imposing: the best recipe for all independent and powerful women.

I would have to find a local model and hired a photographer for the ad. I have to make sure that the product isn't a defect product. I have no worries on the video aspect for the product. So far I manage to sale one shoe for each design which is by far a Christmas miracle in itself but I am thankful that someone took a chance. I have set up social media ad to push the product on each social media platform for which is helping a bit for exposure. Even much so that exposure has come from here to international expressions. To me that shows a bit of improving with awareness but I need sales to fully get this product into production."

https://www.kickstarter.com/projects/slainilluzion/laws-of-attraction?ref=discovery_category_newest,slainilluzion/laws-of-attraction,"Laws of Attraction is my Sophomore independent album. My goal through this project is to change the current state of mainstream media and music and demonstrate how making music with substance can both positively influence people while turning around a bigger profit than what I call ""Fast Food Music"". My background in the music industry is artist, graphic designer, web designer, artist manager, producer, marketing consultant, programmer, and a few more titles. I intend on using my education in these fields to set up one of the most powerful marketing campaigns in recent years by an indie artist. I am currently interning for Van Nuys Records, our top artist is Sabi who is featured on Cobra starships new single ""You Make Me Feel"" so I am in a great place right now in the music industry.If the kickstarter pledge goal is reached this will force the major record labels to want to back up this album and me as an artist and help me spread the message further and wider. I truly believe that our world is in for a big change and I want to be apart of helping usher in that change through the gifts and skills I have. For those who don't understand how the music industry works, millions of dollars goes into the creation and launching of an album in hopes that more millions will be made. Since I am my own engineer I will not be paying for studio time. The funds will be going towards a new microphone, production, marketing, and touring. I recently released a mixtape called ""Kush Eyez"" which has songs that were originally suppose to be on the album but now I am starting from the beginning. I want all you of to be a big part in this creation process, I want to touch the topics that you guys want to hear about just as long as they are in line with the message I am promoting. I am currently handling this whole album alone due to lack of professionals in Virginia. I am currently establishing Team Slain Illuzion which will be a grass roots promotional team worldwide. I know for a fact that if I can get this music on the right platform that it will be nominated for the 2012 Grammy awards and change the current state of the music industry. I am a Full Sail University student which is considered the Harvard of music schools. I am studying Entertainment Business with hopes that one day I will be a leader in major media. This project will assure my spot in the future and have made it one of my main goals to restructure this industry so that we will never experience another 10 years of pure nonsense every again.I want to thank you all for your support in advanced! and you can visit my website to hear the learn more about me .http://www.datpiff.com/Slain-Illuzion-Kush-Eyez-mixtape.279874.html (Kush Eyez Mixtape)http://www.wix.com/earthgang/slainilluzion The law of attraction is a metaphysical belief that ""like attracts like"", that positive and negative thinking bring about positive and negative physical results, respectively.[1][2][3][4] According to the law of attraction, the phrase ""I need more money"" allows the subject to continue to ""need more money"". If the subject wants to change this they would focus their thoughts on the goal (having more money) rather than the problem (needing more money). This might take the form of phrases such as ""I do have more money"" or ""I will have more money"".WHY YOU SHOULD SUPPORT THE CAUSEMy business goal is to bring about positive change in the world through music while demonstrating to the major labels that righteous music can gain support and make millions in record sales and merch, long term and short term. My personal goal is to begin making a living off of my music with out sacrificing the substances of the lyrics and production. With me interning for VNR right now and Sabi all over the place with Cobra Starship (Dancing with the Stars last night) I am in a great position to gain the attention of the Big Wigs. When the album begins doing numbers they will notice and reach out. It is harder and harder for me to listen to the radio because the quality of the content in the music is poison for my spirit. I named the album ""Laws of Attraction"" because that is the universal law that has changed my life and made me into the crystalline being of light that I am becoming. Spreading this message through music effectively activates frequency's in others to begin breaking the chains of the bondage on their minds so they can begin manifesting people, events, and experiences in their lives that serve them.  The fact is people get influenced by mainstream media and ranting and raving about The Bankers is doing little. Media is their tool for mind control so before anything can change we must change who our entertainers are. Just because someone looks good doesn't mean they deserve to hold the platform they do if they are not speaking music to the soul. Working in the music industry and studying under my uncle for years I know the steps that go into launching a successful project, that's why the pledge goal is $200,000.00 (which is still less than what major projects get). Most businesses fail because they start off under funded, the message of Peace, Love, Hope, and Harmony is too important to fall by the wayside, honestly our world needs to hear this message now and it isn't to many artist who understand how to create positive commercial music.  We've had 10 years of toxic music starting with Lil Jon and I'm using the Law of Attraction to make sure that will never happen again. My overall goal is to help create a better future for my son and every other child, woman and man just like Martin Luther King did for me. Funding this project will be one step in the right direction. Men who promote murder, drugs, demoralizing the image of the woman, etc get millions in funding from the labels!  Maybach Music Group got millions from Warner because they needed rappers and all those artist are doing are hurting the peoples minds, spirits, and the body by their negative influences. Don't you agree it's time to change that? Business can be constructive and make way more short term and long term rather than destroying. Occupy Music, I hope you support Amy thanks. In Love 333",,https://www.kickstarter.com/projects/slainilluzion/occupy-music-vol-1?ref=discovery_category_newest,slainilluzion/occupy-music-vol-1,"Occupy Music Sponsor, Investor, and Contributor Letter  Executive Summary:  Music is very important to me.  I started making music at age 12 and ever since it has been the deciding factor in my life. It has helped me to inspire and motivate others, be in charge of my emotions from love to anger, and allowed me to find something worth living for. Music is a tool given from the creator so we may share experience and was designed to spark positivity in the souls of the people listening. It hurts me to know that the corporations have lost sight of the art and refuse to act responsibly about the kind of music the fund and distribute. It seems to me people are looking for a change, for the music that meant something to them, and Occupy Music is the start of taking our music back. (Savion “Slain Illuzion” Hays) Mission: Occupy Music is a sister movement from the over all Occupy Wall Street Movement.  The entertainment industry is a very important tool used by corporate America to create and dictate trends & lifestyle for the purpose of controlling the minds of the people in society. Many physiological experiments and experts are used for every artist and product that is released to the consumer market.   YD Entertainment aims to bring a corporate responsibility to create constructive music that promotes the topics of love, harmony, fun, hope, peace, non violence, and other subjects aligned with these emotions.  By creating music ready for radio and that can be considered commercial, Occupy Music will begin to gain the ears and hearts of millions worldwide and allow for one of the greatest tools man kind has which is music to be used for good and no the destruction of the mind.  For this movement to become successful we will need a financial budget that can grow to eventually trump the budgets of the major corporations. It takes millions if not billions of dollars to successfully launch a product with incredible music, promotions, merchandise, and advertisement. We intend to use the monies made from these projects to bring awareness and help end social and political injustices and create and responsible music industry environment for generations to enjoy through out the years. As a sponsor, investor, and contributor we can make a difference while still making a profit.  Background and Structure:  EarthGang is a movement that was thought of in California in 2010 and has since begun to gain worldwide support. The philosophy of Earth Gang is that we are all brothers and sisters under the eye of God and as brothers and sisters we need to work together to make a better world for the future and present. Currently Earth Gang consist of 4 YD Entertainment artist (Slain Illuzion (founder, MarQ, Controversy, and Kevin Ryan) based out of Virginia and Co founder Martial Artist (Albert Clark) in California.  Through intensive market research Slain has learned that the artist who sell the most records are not the “One Hit Wonder” artist but the people who have succeed in making their music important to the consumer. Through proper education through music, movies, tv, athletics, fashion, and food we will change the world for the better. We are The New Age Renaissance, looking to spark the light in the hearts of the human race to create better to become better.  How Can You Help:  There are 3 main ways you can help “Occupy Music”.  Many things are needed to launch a successful music campaign which include but not limited to recording cost, promotions, distribution, performances, radio play, tv ad space, billboard ad space, etc.  •	First we are asking that everyone who supports “Occupy Music” and/or the causes we represent to donate $3.33 every week via paypal to help cover these cost. Our goal is to create a project that can compete with mainstream media and show them these kinds of messages are profitable. 333 is a spiritual number that represents the Holy Trinity (Father, Son, Holy Spirit).   •	Next we are asking business owners of all professions and services providers to sponsor the movement. This not only allows for Earth Gang to promote your business while providing us with tools needed to get the message and incentives across to our followers and consumers.  Sponsorship can range from transportation; venues, apparel, food, software, hardware, music equipment, video cameras, and anything that will help us get this movement across. All sponsors will be promoted on the Occupy Music albums and all events that Earth Gang headline and attend. •	Lastly we are seeking investors who are willing to first discuss how returns will be made from their financial investments.  We are looking to create jobs through this new entertainment format and need a HQ and a strong budget to assure these products reaches the awareness of the consumer so they will support through buying the product.  Occupy Music will lead to many new business in the agriculture, entertainment, food, construction, fashion, political, technology and many more emerging industries and industries that need an upgrade. By investing in the Occupy Music Movement you assure that children, teens, and adults alike are hearing the proper music content.

Alternatives like fruits based smoothies, vegetable smoothies, salads, organic pastries and healthier meals for consumers on the go.I’ve had the chance to work in the lunch program in various schools in Maplewood, NJ and I often hear the kids complain about the foods and cry for healthier alternatives. I thought the food was pretty healthy compared to what I had as a kid. I thought to myself, “They have salads I never had salads,” but that wasn’t enough for them. I remember one second grader asking to speak to my supervisor so they could get more fruit and better lunch options. When he and his friends spoke to my boss they shared concern that they often bring lunch everyday because they do not want to eat the school lunch because they feel that it isn’t healthy enough. Shortly after, we began to offer yogurts with fruits and granola, chicken wraps, fruits salads, and more.  Within the first week kids who brought their lunch from home began buying lunch. The first time in years.  It was a huge success. The second time that I encountered a want for healthier options is one day leaving the gym. My boyfriend and I often after leaving the gym can’t find something healthy to eat. We often would drive almost 30-40 mins away from the gym and even our own house to get something healthy to eat. Often before we would even get there we would be so frustrated that we would give up and by the nearest thing often a Mc Donald’s. After weeks of this I said aloud “I should open my own business that provides healthier foods to everyone.” And that’s exactly what I want to do.Being able to provide healthier options to people as they leave the gym, or kids as they leave school or just in general is most important. Being mobile allows me to be several places, I can visit several locations and allow kids in my own neighborhood, as well as other kids in neighboring towns the opportunity to grab a smoothie or a fruit cup.Currently I’m asking for help to raise 7k which will help me have a down payment towards my business loan. First 30 people donating $100 or more will get our recipe book of some of my favorite recipes for smoothies, organic pastries or healthy lunches and even dinner. Any financial institutions that offer business loans I will provide them with my business plan if requested.","While they aren’t any physical locations near by that offer what I offer, because there is a need and an outcry for this sort of business I would love to be on the streets prior to any business setting up.",https://www.kickstarter.com/projects/1744378312/the-best-little-smoothie-stand-on-wheels?ref=discovery_category_newest,1744378312/the-best-little-smoothie-stand-on-wheels,"Hello everyone,Welcome to my world of This Little Juice Stand. A health restaurant stand on wheels. Just imagine walking out of the gym and not wanting to ruin the 3000 calories that you just worked off with some fast food meal. As you walk out of the gym you see this truck and it’s looks cool, walking closer you realize that it a smoothie stand, restaurant and healthy stop all in one. As you walk close you see that you can make your own drink, add what you want to it; protein powder, whey, flax seed, etc and what makes this stand on wheels even more perfect they offer salads. As you order and pay and get your purchase of breakfast smoothie and a salad for lunch you can feel that you’ve made healthier choices. As you get your purchase and walk away you sip some of your smoothie and realize that it’s delicious, you look back and wave and realize it’s not a restaurant it’s a food truck, a Smoothie Stand On Wheels.....But FirstI’m getting a little ahead of myself. Let me tell you a little about me before I introduce my business. Hi my name is Ayisha (see pictures below). I’m silly, energetic, determined, strong willed with an amazing sense of humor. I’m the friend that you may have that forces you to karaoke loudly on vacation at the bar where no one knows you or the one you call in a crisis helping you step by step how to solve the impossible. I guess I often think of myself as a superhero, just playing I can’t fly or walk thru walls. As a kid I’d be the one baking something sweet to cheer you up, cooking dinner so my mother wouldn’t have to worry about one more thing for the day, or just throwing a meal together with random things found in your pantry because I came over and now we are both starving. I still do that by the way. My real passion is throwing fruits and vegetables in a blender, combining them naturally adding spices and making you the best smoothie. I got into juicing about 4 years ago. First I would just blend random fruits and vegetables together in hopes that I’d created something tasty. Sometimes it didn’t turn out that way but as I got better at it I began to understand what fruits and vegetables worked well together even going as far as adding cayenne pepper, ginger or cinnamon. I would often blend something for myself and put it in a cup place it in the fridge and come back 10 mins later to it being gone, my mother would drink it. She would share my conclusions with her friends and they began “calling in their orders”, bringing my the ingredients to make them a smoothie mix to solve their hunger, hangover, jump start their day or detox for the day. I have had a strong passion for blending fruits and vegetables for years. I’ve used this as a mechanism to help me lose weight, get over a hangover, detox for a day/week, get over a breakup (without gaining that break up weight) or just to replace a meal because I don’t actually have time to sit at a table and eat. The feeling I get from mixing these items together made me feel like a mad scientist, scrolling thru books that tells me what fruit, vegetable and spices can be combined and do to the body. I then began to dive into salads, often watching cooking shows, learning how to make those salads and putting my own twist onto them. Adding beans, cheese, ginger, pasta, etc. You name it I have probably tried it in a salad. This turned into requests from friend and family for salads after coming over and trying them. After realizing that no one in my area offered anything like this I decided that instead of making it for free, I could open a business and I can expose my talent to more people then my family members. I realized that while my friends and family may like it I began to get popular with this healthy foods. Being mobile will just give me the ability to travel exposing everyone to my healthy concoctions. You may ask what experience do I have in any kind of business.I’ve worked in many areas in retail often starting at the very bottom, stock and working my way up to management. I have filled roles like assistant manager, HR manager, event coordinator to store management. I have to say I’m years of retail nothing fit me better then my role as an event manager. Often planing everything from the staff to the foods. Working with food vendors to create a menu that would be easily accessible for customers as they moved around thru the event. My passion of creating meals like lettuce leaf with everything that you would have in a salad that you can have in one bite to blending fruits and vegetables that customers could drink as they walked around the store. Planning the event meals or appetizers for the season and easy to eat. I would often hear feedback from corporate about how great the food was and how much my location superseded expect-ions and asking for me to over see other events in other stores. That feeling hasn’t stopped.Currently I work in the schools system within the lunch program for the Maplewood and South Orange Schools. This job has given me insight into kids and their eating habits. Gone are the days where kids would run from vegetables, now they are more likely to want to eat healthy. Recently a child (3rd grader) asked if he and two friends could to speak to me after school, with a hesitant “sure come on down” I say, not really sure what he wanted. When he and his friends came down with serious faces I sat down with them thinking maybe they were having trouble with other kids at recess. That couldn’t be farther from what was on their minds, they wanted to know how they could request healthier foods. Stating things like “we bring lunch because school lunch is so gross and not healthy” they went on “most of the kids in this school bring lunch because of that, there aren’t enough fruits or vegetables” to be honest it took me off guard. I explained to them that I would not only pass their message along I would request a meeting with my director so we could work on some sort of compromise. That exactly what I did, while we made few changes immediately we saw a huge response to kids wanting to by lunch. And as we started making a steady increase of healthy options it surprised us as to how many kids now wanted to buy lunch. This increased my want to open a business that could reach out to who want to eat healthy. Having a smoothie stand on wheels and being easily accessible near schools as kids leave going to their afternoon activities, or near a park as they play sports allowing their parents to grab them something healthy to eat or drink before or after their sports.Being accessible to kids while they are part of my customer base, they aren’t the most important part. Adults wanting to eat healthier is my most important goal. Like most people I work out in the gym and like most most people I can use my gym membership where ever there is a gym. The one thing I realized going to these gym is that there isn’t anything near by, or inside the gym to help gym goers to continue their healthy lifestyle. For instance near one of my gym locations there has been a high turn over of “fried chicken” stores. Which often only last about a year before they close and relocate. Honestly after working off 1000 or more calories who really wants to go eat something so unhealthy ruining all of their hard work. I myself would either drive about 40 mins away or just wait till I get home (depending on the time if day) to eat something healthy. For me being able to be in-front of the gym as customers go in providing them with a protein shake that helps with building muscles, meal replacement as they go to work or my own signature blend that detox for the day. Being on wheels allows me to travel to different locations, being y healthy goodness to everyone that wants it. What I’m asking for is your help with fixing up the truck below. As you can see it needs a little love, paining, adding equipment needed and replacing some parts. What I’m asking for is $5000.00. Please help me to to get this smoothie stand on wheels on the road. ","My biggest challenge is fixing up the truck to get on the road before the weather changes.  As I stated I’d like to be located near parks and such once it starts to get colder kids are less likely to be in parks, practicing sports.  Being able to get on the road soon will allow me to build a following that and a presence that will ensure that parents and kids will look out for my truck knowing that it will be a great food stop."

How many times has someone said, “I saw a great recipe on Facebook but I can’t find it” Or asks, “have you seen the recipe for “bacon wrapped asparagus?” Well, now with your help, they will be in one place! Of course, not all can be in one book, (you wouldn’t be able to lift it), but this first cookbook will have approximately 100 recipes and is Vol I, with more volumes to follow.From snacks to dinner recipes, and some helpful hints, each recipe will be printed just as the user posted it (with some spelling corrections and editing/formatting for print). All recipes include any comments, photos, websites, names, etc. as originally shared and posted on Facebook. The creator/submitter is fully credited on the recipe.WHY AM I DOING THIS?I actually thought of this project about a year ago when searching for a recipe I saw on Facebook. I found it and then couldn’t find it again! So, I started saving them to a page I created. I still had trouble finding a particular recipe on that page, so I started downloading them. Then I thought, wow! What if others have the same experience? Wouldn't it be wonderful to have all the shared Facebook recipes bundled in a nice book? And a project was born!I am so excited to be sharing this project with you all! The recipes cover a wide range of items from breakfast to midnight snacks, but printed just as posted! What fun! Two of my favorite things: cooking, and Facebook!The money from this Kickstarter will be used for editing, formatting, finishing the design of the book, publish an E-book and printing, publishing and marketing of the printed book.PROJECT TIMELINEI hope to complete the cookbook prior to these projections but they are estimated as:I will do my very best to keep everyone posted about the progress of the book.Any delay will be announced and I will do anything I can do to overcome them.I really hope you will take part of it and help me reach my goal.","Although my goal of $9,000 may seem high, it essentially covers my costs for publishing, copyrights, design, editing and printing and postage for rewards.

A Cookbook compiling recipes shared and posted by Facebook users! All shared in one place!I have created something truly original- a cookbook of Facebook friend’s shared favorites!How many times has someone said, “I saw a great recipe on Facebook but I can’t find it” Or asks, “have you seen the recipe for “bacon wrapped asparagus?” Well, now with your help, they will be in one place! Of course, not all can be in one book, (you wouldn’t be able to lift it), but this first cookbook has approximately 100 recipes and is Vol I, with more volumes to follow.From snacks to dinner recipes, and some helpful hints, each recipe is printed just as the user posted it (with some spelling corrections and editing/formatting for print). All recipes include any comments, photos, websites, names, etc. as originally shared and posted on Facebook. The creator/submitter is fully credited on the recipe.WHY AM I DOING THIS?I actually thought of this project about a year ago when searching for a recipe I saw on Facebook. I found it and then couldn’t find it again! So, I started saving them to a page I created. I still had trouble finding a particular recipe on that page, so I started downloading them. Then I thought, wow! What if others have the same experience? Wouldn't it be wonderful to have all the shared Facebook recipes bundled in a nice book? And a project was born! I am so excited to be sharing this project with you all! The recipes cover a wide range of items from breakfast to midnight snacks, but printed just as posted! What fun! Two of my favorite things: cooking, and Facebook!A LITTLE ABOUT MEI have personally edited and published 8 fiction E-books and formatted 4 for print on Amazon. So, with that experience, I have self-published the E-book version of the cookbook ( you can see it here --books2read.com/fbfavs.) HOWEVER, I will have the print format professionally done.in a beautiful hardback book.WHAT DO I NEED THE MONEY FOR?Printing is expensive. To realize the project, I need to raise $5,000. I want to make a beautiful hardback cookbook .I really hope you will take part of it and help me reach my goal.  The money from this Kickstarter will be used for editing, formatting, finishing the design , printing, publishing and marketing of the printed book.PROJECT TIMELINEI hope to complete the cookbook prior to these projections but they are estimated as:• January: Kickstarter campaign!•	February: finalizing of the design of the cookbook for printing.• Mid to Late March: Cookbook sent to all the backers!I will do my very best to keep everyone posted about the progress of the book. Any delay will be announced and I will do anything I can do to overcome them. I really hope you will take part of it and help me reach my goal.","Risks and challenges Although my goal of $5,000 may seem high, it essentially covers my costs for publishing, copyrights, design, editing and printing and postage for rewards. It also includes the Kickstarter fees, cost of marketing and trade shows to promote the book. If I raise more than enough to fully complete the project to success, it will be used to start Volume II.

We still have props, wardrobe, and set locations to pay for as well as food for the on both shoot days which are coming up very shortly. I want to make this a fun filled event that people remember and respond well to after it's over, so that this can continue on through them and me.

Please help us financial destroy our worries by getting the things we need to make this film all I know it can be.The story takes us through the ripped apart world of our main actor, a middle aged german man named Friedrich. The War is nearly over, and Friedrich is a deserter. He's lost his entire family due to his countries decisions and is fighting a tougher internal battle inside than out. Friedrich tries to keep his life and emotional state at a controllable level. Temptation and frustration become too much for him as he goes off in search of a fight. Does humanity exist in a soul ripped apart?","As a filmmaker that has many things going on from weddings, business commercials, vlogs, and short films it is difficult to keep everything in tact. I potentially see the editing process taking up much time as I try to work everything else going on into my workflow. I am able to delegate editing task to dedicated associates that can speed up and keep the creative juices going once the project has been completely funded.Right now the big issues that exist are funds for wardrobe as all the museums and war reenactment groups fell through. Props go right along with wardrobe in that department of failure. We also need a bit of money to lock down location No. 2, which is an old war home in Cambridge City, IN.

The graphics, sound and selection of games available on mobile devices now equalwhat most gamers have at home on their dedicated gaming consoles and hand-helds. With one exception... virtual buttons!!A poll of any group of gamers on why they do not play games on mobile phones or tablets will always yield the same answer at the top of the list, ""Lack of real, physical controls."" Virtual buttons and controls displayed on the device's screen lack the physical location and response that our thumbs require to tell our brains when we are hitting the buttons or missing them. As we play, we experience Virtual Button Drift, whereby our thumbs naturally drift off of the virtual controls, leading to severe lack of control and fun with our games.So... is it possible to enjoy games requiring precise button controls on your mobile device?Phantom GP Virtual Button Caps...are translucent 5mm vinyl adhesive markers that are removeable, repositionable and specially designed to be positioned over the many sizes of virtual buttons found in almost every mobile game on the market today. They allow gamers to feel the placement of the virtual buttons. Phantom GP VB Caps can be placed over the virtual buttons of one game, removed and replaced over the buttons of another game many times before having to be replaced!""Embossed"" Phantom GP Virtual Button Caps™ ...mean that the center of each circular or cross-shaped Phantom GP Virtual Button Cap is raised. So not only can you feel where the buttons are, but you can feel the up, down, left, right and centers of each button for enhanced control!   Play all the action games you've wanted! Finally! Break out your action, FPS, Racing, Action RPG, Twin-stick, Shooters and Arcade games... and PLAY!Phantom GP Virtual Button Caps were designed specifically to put the feel and control back into your action games! Dust off and load up your favorite games that you wrote off as too frustrating to play on your mobile phone or tablets. You'll need that extra battery pack now!Phantom GP Virtual Button Caps SpecificationsThese series of videos were shot at a local barcade. The production is meant to match the spirit of the videos - raw and unrehearsed. The folks in these videos truly are not actors. The only payment they received were two drink tickets and a pack of Phantom GP Virtual Button Caps to keep for their time. They were not coached in either their answers or their reactions to the button caps in any way. So, when you see their reactions to trying a pre-loaded action game on the game pad with the Virtual Button Caps affixed, it is truly genuine. It is the exact same reaction the development team had when receiving their beta units. The simplicity of what is required to enjoy action games on mobile devices is profound. So back this project to enjoy the same reaction for yourself!","This Phantom GP Virtual Button Cap campaign on Kickstarter is intended to raise awareness and working capital for a full retail release.

The graphics, sound and selection of games available on mobile devices now equal what most gamers have at home on their dedicated gaming consoles and hand-helds. With one exception... virtual buttons!!A poll of any group of gamers on why they do not play games on mobile phones or tablets will always yield the same answer at the top of the list, ""Lack of real, physical controls."" Virtual buttons and controls displayed on the device's screen lack the physical location and response that our thumbs require to tell our brains when we are hitting the buttons or missing them. As we play, we experience Virtual Button Drift, whereby our thumbs naturally drift off of the virtual controls, leading to severe lack of control and fun with our games. So... is it possible to enjoy games requiring precise button controls on your mobile device?Phantom GP Virtual Button Caps ...are translucent 5mm vinyl adhesive markers that are removeable, repositionable and specially designed to be positioned over the many sizes of virtual buttons found in almost every mobile game on the market today. They allow gamers to feel the placement of the virtual buttons. Phantom GP VB Caps can be placed over the virtual buttons of one game, removed and replaced over the buttons of another game many times before having to be replaced! ""Embossed"" Phantom GP Virtual Button Caps™ ...mean that the center of each circular or cross-shaped Phantom GP Virtual Button Cap is raised. So not only can you feel where the buttons are, but you can feel the up, down, left, right and centers of each button for enhanced control! Play all the action games you've wanted! Finally! Break out your action, FPS, Racing, Action RPG, Twin-stick, Shooters and Arcade games... and PLAY!Phantom GP Virtual Button Caps were designed specifically to put the feel and control back into your action games!

The production is meant to match the spirit of the videos - raw and unrehearsed.  The folks in these videos truly are not actors.  The only payment they received were two drink tickets and a pack of Phantom GP Virtual Button Caps to keep for their time.  They were not coached in either their answers or their reactions to the button caps in any way. So, when you see their reactions to trying a pre-loaded action game on the game pad with the Virtual Button Caps affixed, it is truly genuine.  It is the exact same reaction the development team had when receiving their beta units. The simplicity of what is required to enjoy action games on mobile devices is profound. So back this project to enjoy the same reaction for yourself! Many Kickstarters are starting to realize that shipping can be a campaign killer. The cost of shipping can increase wildly from region to region. It is very difficult to have a flat rate and keep from losing all margin, rendering an otherwise successful campaign a loss. With this product, there is very little margin so a loss incurred by shipping has the potential to be disastrous. For that reason, actual shipping will be charged. There will be no mark-up for handling or even the shipping envelope. We will only charge the actual shipping. Each backer will be informed of the shipping charge and will be charged as part of the campaign manager process sent out after the campaign has been complete.","This Phantom GP Virtual Button Cap campaign on Kickstarter is intended to raise awareness and working capital for a full retail release.

https://www.kickstarter.com/projects/1914456250/a-year-of-art?ref=discovery_category_newest,1914456250/a-year-of-art,"For the last 24 years my mother has been raising two kids, myself and my sister. Being a divorced mother of two, my mother worked many different jobs ranging from waitress, fast food worker, to (finally) office worker. She is also a talented painter and artist. But as a single mother of two rambunctious girls, combined with working jobs that crushed her creativity, my mother's art has taken a back seat. Currently she is working an office job that makes her miserable when all she wants to do is make art. The only reason she doesn't is the need to pay the bills. This campaign is designed to allow my mother to be able to take a year away from work in order to focus on her art. My mother has done so much for me and my sister. From getting us all away safely from a domestic violence situation to helping where she could with getting my sister and I through college, my mother never asked for anything in return other then our love and respect. And now I want to give back to her so she can do something that makes her truly happy.","With every artistic project there are plenty of risks and challenges. These range from the time it takes to make the rewards, and a need to get all of the materials. But my mother is uniquely qualified to deal with these, because she has produced art under much more difficult circumstances.",https://www.kickstarter.com/projects/1914456250/commies-in-the-water?ref=discovery_category_newest,1914456250/commies-in-the-water,"In August of 1932, at Smith Lake in at Washington Park in Denver, CO, a riot broke out between park patrons and a group of white communists and African American youth. At the time, Smith Lake was a white's only swimming spot and the riot came out of an effort to forcefully integrate it. Several African Americans and communists were arrested by police after being chased and beaten by park patrons. Having grown up in Denver myself, and having gone to an elementary school only a few blocks from the park, I myself only learned about the riot when researching the park for a paper in graduate school. The goal of this project is to ultimately write a book not only about the riot, but a history about both Denver's forgotten civil rights and communist histories. Civil rights stories outside the south, and outside the 1950s and 60s, are often left out of discussions of the topic. Occasionally someone will talk about the connections made in those years between civil rights figures and communism. The money I am raising will go towards funding my research and eventual publication costs (assuming that I can't find a publisher).","There are of course many risks and challenges to writing a book. These can range from issues with accessing certain documents to finding a publishing method (either self-publishing or through a publisher). But I feel that I can manage, due to experience with writing my Master's Thesis in 2017/2018. This process included traveling to access out of state materials for research purposes."

I became inspired by the characteristics of organically grown food, from the taste to the color spectrums displayed by the ripening process along with the wild structural shapes.Each piece of food, or medicine as a I call it, is a work of art in its own right. I have spent time objectifying these natural medicines on black and/or white backgrounds. They are centered to draw viewers in for a good look at what food really looks like.This visual documentary project will be an ongoing process. I am donating my time to a local organic farm in New Milford, CT this summer to learn and to document the process and results of how organic food is created.Right now I am in need of funds to display works already created.Please view my works at:http:www.beckermanarchive.comPlease help support the visual arts and the food revolution.",,https://www.kickstarter.com/projects/1968490542/campaign-for-sustainable-living?ref=discovery_category_newest,1968490542/campaign-for-sustainable-living,"Spreading awareness for the sustainable living movement is hard work and requires financial assistance. I spent the last 3 years gearing up to display my work. Recently I completed building a traveling store out of recycled woods for displaying, branding and selling unique products containing imagery from my personal series:"" Campaign For Sustainable Living"" (read artist statement below). I will be selling limited edition fine art originals, limited edition organic t-shirts, prints, collection of greeting cards, inspirational magnets, organic seeds, accompanied by some of my up-cycled furniture designs. I am in need of start up capital to purchase goods and create trademarks.These powerful images displayed on organic t-shirts / made in America and other items aim to connect the public with a visual of what healthy food looks like and thus will inspire a conversation about organic agriculture bringing a bit of awareness into the hearts and minds the public. My story of raising each item serves as an example that anyone can grow there own food. The local organic revolution is the answer to many of the world issues. Please support.For each Item sold I will donate 10% to organically feed low income families while supporting local agriculture. This will be acomplished by teaming up with local organic farms and social workers.Jonathan Beckerman, Campaign For Sustainable LivingArtist’s Statement Campaign For Sustainable LivingDeciding to change is immediate; activating the change is devotional.  This body of photographs is reactionary, collectively a document of the sustainable lifestyle I actively cultivate.  In the shadow of the insatiable monopolized GMO food crop industry and the unforgiving political terrain it has landscaped for farming practices worldwide, the civilian allure of organic living rings out.  The local world of indigenous material accessed, it is now my means of survival:  nourishing the land that nourishes me.  I grow what I use and use what I grow in a cyclical world of utility and discovery.The photographs center on food, both animal and vegetable, that I raised.  Detached from their natural contexts, each portrait recasts its organic subject as a model, static, posing to pronounce its formal beauty and sensitive abstraction.  The black ground on which each figure suspends is immaterial, rendering the figures planetary, their scale irrelative.  They hang harmoniously centered, frozen in isolated moments that heighten viewers’ awareness of the world of detail that comprises them—a mirror to the intimate experience of growing something by my own hands.And yet they remain glimpses of objects inherently bound to the natural cycle.  Having spent time living with Native American farmers in Arizona, I learned that the natural world is both familiar and unpredictable.  My intuition develops, but I remain an agent to nature’s unstoppable process.  And while the objects seem idealized in solitude, they are still pensive, waiting monk-like, having seemingly arrived there through considered reflection and meditation.  Each began as an individuated personal episode, from the first tomato I ever grew to the ear of Indian corn I harvested alongside a Hopi tribe.  They are both modest and monolithic, symbols of a change and a tradition.","After exposing the first round of test products to the  public the response was extremely positive,.The risk of this project is minimal. Beautiful imagery with a positive message that promotes health in multiple ways; including but not limited to, when worn, when spoken about, when purchased, and how they are created.From a financial stand point it is important to find venues that inspire sustainable living to encourage sales in larger quantities and higher price ranges. These venues could be farmers markets, fairs, festivals, college campuses, organic living stores or retailers, etc. They could even be created as customs for restaurants, farms, and or plow to plate programs.These items have been developed with a lot of care for the well being of all and sell themselves. Your generosity is helpful and it is necessary."

Similar observation in political anthropology was made by Ancient Greek philosopher Plato in his Republic ( book 8;546bcd ): after some X period of time defined by the perfect number certain loss of vital power of the states and some X generation suddenly emerge in order to change a type of regime entirely.This Plato's passage called Number of Plato Enigmais notoriously the most difficult place in his writing.The literature of the subject is immense. The difficulty lies in mathematics behind Plato's passage but not in the Greek. Passage suggests many impossible things, for example, an existence of some super constant ""measuring the Earth is lord of better and worse birth""; unexpected periodic perfectnumbers andpossibility of periodic revolutions controlled by Plato perfect number.Despite all attempts of generations of historians, philosophers, translators, mathematicians ( Euler, Berneoulli ) and even artists ( Leonardo da Vinci :1498) during last 2000 years conjecture remains unsolved.Following M. Ficino's De Numero Fatali (1496) there must exist two different Plato's Universes as well as two Plato's mathematics: ""Divine ""arithmetic of periodic perfect numbers defined "" the three distances and four limits"" of all historical metamorphoses ,and, ""Nuptial"" arithmetic considering the ways of calculation of the Platonicus anus (Plato's Great Cycle) based on unknown generalization of Pythagoras theorem. In 1996-1999 I made an attempt to reconstruct Plato's impossible or Divine arithmetic. I supposed that iff this periodicity of the perfect numbers will work as expected, it might be computable in computer experiments.After hard 2 years of discussions with the Editor ( famous French algebraist) my findings were published in Bulletin des Sciences Mathematiques (1999;123 pp 29-31). I showed an existence of first three periodic perfect numbers, namely:496;33 550 336;2658459915698311744654692615953842176.In other words I had found formula to calculate all Plato's periodic perfect numbers which nobody knew before. Mystery is that my conjecture also is connected with the theorem of famous self educated Indian mathematician of the 20th century Srinivasa Ramanujan! Thus, mathematically New Periodic Perfect numbers must exist.Problem is to use more powerful computational tools to establish further large periodic perfect numbers as well as the violations of Plato's conjecture.Phraise for my article :""Here we wish to mention another source for perfect numbers ( usualluy overlooked by the the Historians of mathematics) in ancient times, namely Plato's Republic, where the so- called periodic perfect numbers were introduced. It is remarkable that 2000 years later when Euler proves the converse of (1) he makes no reference to Euclid. However, Euler makes reference to Plato's periodic perfect numbers. M.A.Popov (1999) says that Euler's proof was probably inspired by Plato ""Handbook of Number Theory, Volume 2, p 17. By Jozsef Sandor, B.Crstici. Springer.2004WHAT FOR ?1. Nobody knows how many perfect and periodic perfect numbers exist. This is the most known fundamental unsolved problem of today's mathematics. Thus, our search of the next periodic perfect numbers is connected with such problem.2. Plato suggested that there is finite number of periodic perfect numbers. In other words, following Plato we can find some last periodic perfect number at all!3. Following my result, any perfect number can be expressed by merely difference between two even numbers. Thus, I had found unexpected simplification when we can avoid hard search of Mersenne prime numbers ( such primes are usually used to compute perfect numbers ). Moreover, because perfect numbers are essentual in DNA coding theory we can use periodic perfect number 496 for understanding cancer coding pathology! Thus, our search for alternative theory of perfect numbers inspired by Plato's Enigma has a sense.HOW MUCH ?Wolfram corporation manager informed me recently that packet and license for Mathematika ( software for calculations of larger perfect numbers ) costs GBP2035 for Single Mashine, thus, together with the cost of programmer work we must have minimum GBP 4000 for calculation at least 4th and 5th periodic perfect numbers.","I am awaiting that 4th perfect number could behaive mysteriously. Ramanujan theorem said nothing about it, correspondingly, gap between 3 and 4 periodic numbers lies beyond trivial mathematics. I had found some very simple ways to overcome such difficulties in Ramanujan' Lost Notebook. However, that needs new understanding of Mersenne primes .I'd like to hope that we can find support of independent and institutional computer practitioners which can offer unexpected solution in this very interesting nontrivial mathematical adventure of the 21st century ( may be in area of Parallel Programming or Quantum Simulations !)",https://www.kickstarter.com/projects/1779437608/doubting-gravitational-waves-was-einstein-right?ref=discovery_category_newest,1779437608/doubting-gravitational-waves-was-einstein-right,"In 1936 Einstein wrote to Max Born telling him that together with Nathan Rosen he had arrived at the interesting result that what he predicted in 1916 - gravitational waves - did not exist! In June 1936 Einstein and Rosen sent the paper entitled ""Do Gravitational Waves Exist?"" for publication in The Physical Review . However, the Editor informed Einstein that they cannot publish such sort of paper in The Physical Review... After this incident Einstein never published again in this physical journal.He submitted new version of the paper to the Journal of the Franklin Institute in November 1937. In 1938 Einstein again obtained the result that there could be no gravitational waves at all. Today when all physical community celebrates discovery of gravitational waves ( please see video ), Einstein's attempt to say that there are gravitational phenomena in which gravity reveals its wave-like character and others in which gravity reveals particle - like character (graviton) - having an analogy with Einstein photoelectric effect in theory of electromagnetic interactions- became well-forgotten.Following Einstein's heuristic we can await that gravity behaves like a shower of gravitons, but not like wave. Wave - like gravitation is faced with a difficulty : how can a moving graviton have anything to do with a wave ?Hence, main goal of my project is to attract attention to Einstein's alternative in physics and cosmology of gravitational waves. Einstein suggested particle - likenonnonsensial understanding of gravity when we must reject old Riemanian Spacetime (as is known string theory attempts to save Riemann Spacetime, gravitational waves ) andto develop completely ""crazy"" post - Riemanian geometry with new theory of time at all! Who knows what kind of new imagination ( I'd like to start to explore it ! )we are needed and what kind of graviton detectors ( I'd like to describe mathematically in our OLab)we may produce in future , at least it is obvious nowthat Einstein wasnot believer in future of gravitational waves. And he had sufficient foundation to do itSHORTLY.In other words, Einstein realized that he made elementary mistake but In order to change theory or even reject own General Relativityhe needs new MAD post Riemannian geometry ! Today physicists try to Ignore it.We must find such solution before physics degradation in orderto have long term space missions - our planet is TRAP created by the dogmas of Relativity theory !REFERENCES Einstein,A and Rosen, N.(1937) On Gravitational Waves.Journal of the Franklin Institute, 223; 43-54Einstein, Infeld, Hoffmann (1938) The gravitational equation and the problem of motion.

To most, a staircase might just be that....an architectural feature that gets you from one floor to another, you grab the hand rail for stability, etc....but show a staircase to a skater and they see something totally different, they see POTENTIAL.Flip the lens and look at a skater for instance, many people see a skater as a rule-breaker, a trouble maker and even sometimes a nuisance to society, but when we look at a skater we see POTENTIAL. We see a person that keeps on trying even when they fall, we see someone that looks at the world and sees things that are not obvious to others, we see creativity and innovation, we see persistence and determination,....Denver is bustling with amazing outdoor skateparks, but the Skatuary is a place we hope that will be more than a skatepark. Skatuary is a place that is filled with volunteers, local teachers, artists, business owners and more that want to see these youth in Denver see their potential and equip them with skills and foster ideas to change the future of Denver!This kickstarter will help us to keep the doors open for this incredible youth center, rebuild the delapitating ramps, and bring in local artists to repaint the wall. It will also be a catalyst to help start our camps and after-school programming, including the Create-A-Skate program that teaches STEM, Art & Design through building a skateboard. We envision local teachers, artists and business owners mentoring these skaters and investing in them. We also hope to create a generation that gives back and serves the community we live in.Currently, we have already launch our FREE community skateboarding lessons and are seeing mom and dads bringing their kids, spending quality time together, exercising and learning together.Fridays we offer Skate Church, with free skateboarding and dinner cooked up by our volunteers. Sometimes this is the only meal our skaters see all day. Fridays can either be a night many of these kids from broken homes go our and make bad choices but instead, Skatuary is providing a place that feed them physically and spiritually.Throughout the week we offer nights for girls, those over 30, camps, clinics and more.Here is what we hope to see in the future at Skatuary:","Skatuary has gone through leadership changes in the last six months. Uli Frallicciardi, founder of Christian Skaters, found the ministry so vital to Denver that he relocated temporarily from Florida to help make the changes needed to keep this park going and create a place that impacts skaters and families for years to come. Our challenge is rebuilding what was neglected and regaining the support of those who were left discouraged in the transition process. We are working on rebuilding a solid volunteer team and regaining community support. We see the potential but we can not do this alone. It takes a team.",https://www.kickstarter.com/projects/christianskaters/science-of-action-sports-steam-education-curriculum?ref=discovery_category_newest,christianskaters/science-of-action-sports-steam-education-curriculum,"Help us educate a generation with HANDS-ON LEARNING THROUGH ACTION SCIENCE with Surf Skate Science!Surf skate Science is a STEAM education program that teaches students science and design through skateboarding. What is STEAM? STEAM is an educational approach to learning that uses Science, Technology, Engineering, the Arts and Mathematics as access points for guiding student inquiry, dialogue and critical thinking.What is Surf Skate Science?22 Years ago Uli & Toni met at a Skate shop. Toni had just returned from 3 years of studying Engineering at Florida Tech. They got married, had kids and eventually began working with Ramp 48 Skatepark in South Florida. There they were given the opportunity to invest in the lives of South Florida skaters and fully develop a top-notch skate facility.During the 15 years of running the park we were also able to help others around the world start skate projects in countries like Ethiopia, Guatemala, Colombia, England, Uganda, Rwanda, South Africa, Costa Rica, Mexico, and multiple other locations.""Our love of science and teaching kids was a catalyst to bring the in the Create-A-Skate program to Ramp 48. This program was developed by Paul Schmitt who is a legend in the skateboard world.""Create-A-Skate shared STEM principles way before STEM was a hot button word in the the educational world. In Create-A-Skate, students learned about the environmental science, engineering, materials, physics and more that are part of skateboarding, Each student used basic wood working skills and art and design principles as they created their own custom skateboard deck. During the years at Ramp 48, Uli and Toni were able to incorporate this curriculum into schools, museums, events, and our park camps. Then, on February 14th, 2017 their community was shaken by the shooting at Marjory Stoneman Douglas High School just a few blocks from their home. Serving after the tragedy they met many students and families. And they say their local homeschool community exploded in numbers overnight. As homeschool parents of 3 kids, they thought it would be great to take this program a step further and combine their love of surfing, skateboarding and science in order to give kids a way to enjoy learning again. Hence, Surf Skate Science was born!A SCIENCE CLASS LIKE NO OTHER: Hands-On Active Learning & Community BuildingSurf Skate Science takes the principles of physics, engineering, architecture, environmental science, marine biology, ecology and more to teach kids in an active way through the science he surrounds action sports. Students do 45 minutes of active science labs, then then jump on a board to put what they learned into practice. Their local skatepark of surf break becomes the science lab and they become the scientists.PHASE 1: Surf Skate Science on Wheels - Mobile Science LabAfter testing the class for two years in South Florida, we have seen it's sucess at teaching the students STEAM principles, building confidence through Action Sports, and creating community.Our next step is to expand this program further. SURF SKATE SCIENCE ON WHEELS will be a mobile science lab that will enable Surf Skate Science to travel to schools, parks & events. It will be a full mobile STEAM education center that will serve youth in South Florida.The bus will include everything to enable students to participate in STEAM based science labs. We will add a rack and storage container to the top of the bus for surfboards, skateboards and helmets. The interior will feature installations that include the history of skateboarding and science principles in surf and skate. We will utilize as many sustainable materials as possible in the renovation process.Surf Skate Science was one of the 10 recipients for the 2019 Skate for a Cause grant from the Sheckler Foundation. You contribution will be combined with this grant to bring Surf Skate Science on Wheels to life!Funds raised will provided materials needed to completely refurbish the bus, purchase lab equipment, and provide surfboards and skateboards for the students to use during classes.PHASE 2: Surf Skate Science Written & Digital CurriculumThis mobile science lab is just the start! Surf Skate Science will also reproduce our curriculum to use at skate projects & schools around the world. If we exceed our goal, the remaining funding will allow us to create these materials for others to use. Both printed and digital content will be created ad translated into multiple languages for educators to use.","Our challenge is to build a mobile science lab equipped with lab supplies that shares the STEAM involved around Action Sports. We must also stock the vehicle with skateboards, helps, & foam top surfboards for our time in the water and at the local skatepark. Renovating a school bus is challenging and wil be a learning curve but we are excited about the potential."

The average BBQ Sauce has between 45 and 70 calories per two table serving.What does that mean for you? If you are trying to lose weight, cut out sugars, or just want to eat healthier, BBQ Sauce has to go.Low Kalz BBQ Sauce is a low-calorie, sugar-free, and gluten-free BBQ sauce. You won’t have to worry about cutting out BBQ Sauce anymore if you decide to eat healthier or worry about eating too much sugar because Low Kalz is sugar-free.What is Low Kalz?Low Kalz is more than just a brand; it’s a lifestyle. A deliciously healthy lifestyle. Unlike other brands, you no longer have to worry whether what you’re eating is healthy or not because Low Kalz is a brand that focuses on having low-calorie, low-sugar, and gluten-free products.

Some of the benefits include Vitamin A, Vitamin E, glowing skin, and it is known for being a great anti-aging remedy because of the Vitamin A, which helps reduce wrinkles and improve complexion and more.What Will We Do with the Funding? As you may know, it’s not easy launching a food company, let alone one that focuses on making sure all of its products are healthy and delicious. There’s a lot that goes into launching just one flavor of a BBQ sauce, including sourcing ingredients, packaging, shipping, designs, and researching nutritional values, and many more. It can be overwhelming to do, but we at Low Kalz are up to the challenge and luckily for us, we have a manufacturer that is ready and willing to handle all of that for us. If you build it, they will come. But how will they come if they don’t know that you built it? Or Where to find it? Launching a product is the easy part; actually getting it into the hands of customers, keeping them satisfied, and returning is the hard part. Luckily for us, we will have you as our first customers so you can provide us with feedback about what you like and areas we need to improve on. Unlike other companies, we will never keep you out of the loop and will keep you around to get feedback on all our future flavors and new product lines. Most importantly, we will always ship them to your door for free. So, how can you say no to that? We look forward to seeing your donations.","Risks and business go hand in hand. Every new business will have risk and obstacles to overcome; some will have more than others. Our major areas of concern are marketing and manufacturing.The BBQ sauce industry is a very crowded industry, but that doesn’t mean you can’t launch a new company. After all, people always want to try the new “it” thing. Our biggest challenge is becoming that “it” thing. If you go to your local store shelf, you will see that majority of the BBQ sauces are full of sugar, high in calories, and very unhealthy. By having a successful kick starter campaign, it will show that we already have a market of people interested in a healthier alternative BBQ sauce that has low calorie, sugar-free, and gluten-free.",https://www.kickstarter.com/projects/weighfit/low-kalz-low-calorie-organic-protein-bars?ref=discovery_category_newest,weighfit/low-kalz-low-calorie-organic-protein-bars,"Aren't you tired of buying protein bars only to find out that they're all copycats of each other?

Foods such as cookies, cakes, and pastas, which are made with refined wheat are known for their high carbs and low fats and fiber content. That is why most times, when you buy a box of cookies, with the intension of having just one piece, you end up eating the whole box. Foods with refined wheat are known for causing high spikes in blood sugar levels, followed by a rapid drop similar to a roller coaster ride, which ends up leading to you feeling hungry, tired, and craving more cookies.FruitsApples (Apple Cranberry Bars)Have you heard the term “An apple a day keeps the doctor away”? A diet consisting mainly fruits and veggies lowers the risk of many chronic conditions. Apples, in particular, are known for being one of the most nutritious fruits for consumption. Not only are apples low on calories, they're also known for being a great filling snack. Dried Cranberries (Apple Cranberry Bars)Cranberries are 90% made of water, yet are not grown in water; they’re grown on vines. Similar to apples, cranberries are known for being a great very low in calorie - one cup contains approximately 46 kilocalories.Bananas (Banana Chocolate Bars)Have you ever woken up during sleep to a sudden pain in your leg? Have you ever felt a sudden painful stiffness in your legs or arms and couldn’t move them? These are common symptoms of cramps. Bananas are extremely rich in potassium and high in fiber.Mango Powder (Tropical Blueberry Bars)Have you ever wondered why offering someone a basket of mangoes is considered a gesture of friendship? Mangoes, similar to coconuts, olives, and dates are a member of the drupe family. They’re also in the same family of cashews and ivy. As you can see, mangoes bring people together, and even fellow fruits and plants. Dried Blueberries (Tropical Blueberry Bars)Blueberries are known as ‘slow carbs’ and similar to almond flour, they’re popular low glycemic index foods, which are absorbed slowly.Whey Protein PowderNothing beats a great workout while listening to your favorite pumped up songs and getting “wheysted” afterwards. Although you can get your daily dose of protein through nuts, meats, and cheese, not everyone has the time to cook. Whey protein powder is a convenient source of protein for both pre and post workout meals. 100% Apple Juice ConcentrateA juice concentrate means that the water content from the fruit has been removed, and when baked, it provides a more flavorful taste. We use 100% Apple juice concentrate, with no added sugar, artificial coloring, nor preservatives. 100% Pineapple ConcentrateThe Pineapple juice concentrate that we use is also gluten-free, with no added sugar, artificial coloring, nor preservatives. Pineapples are highly nutritious fruits which supplies the body with a lot of nutritional benefits such as Vitamin B, Thiamine, and Vitamin C, without packing on extra calories. ChocolatesChocolate aids with the blood flow to your brain, which helps improve your memory, attention span, and problem-solving skills.CinnamonCinnamon is a highly delicious spice that comes from the branches of wild trees that belong to the genus ""Cinnamomum.” Cinnamon is one of the greatest natural alternatives to sugar.GingerGinger adds a spicy flavor to foods, and helps in combating nausea, vomiting, and even sea sickness. The spicy stimulates saliva, which helps speed up your metabolism; faster metabolism helps support weight loss.Pure Vanilla ExtractVanilla extract is gotten by dissolving vanilla beans in alcohols to get the scent of vanilla and supplies your body with anti-oxidants.Pure Almond ExtractAlmond extract is rich in proteins, vitamins, and minerals. It’s great for strengthening your body.Orange ExtractOrange extracts help enhance the flavors of orange in baked foods. It is a rich source of Vitamin E, and is full of antioxidants. What Makes Us Different?We are not just another protein bar. Yes, the protein bar market is saturated, and people have an endless supply of protein bars to choose from. Our main competitors, RX Bar, Perfect Bar, The Best Ever Bar, and Fresh Bar are available throughout a lot of retail stores in South Florida and Nation-wide. Despite the fact that the protein bar market is crowded, people are always looking to try the new “it” thing. What makes Low Kalz bars the new “It” thing is that our bars are preserved by refrigeration, they contain no preservatives, they’re soft-baked, and have low-calorie content.Where do you usually preserve your left-overs? That’s right - the refrigerator. The refrigerator is one of the most natural preservatives known to man, and it’s hard to find a home without one. Protein bars have earned a reputation of being glorified candy bars, full of sugar and processed ingredients. With today’s consumers becoming more health conscious, many are looking for organic and preservation-free options. Low Kalz bars prides ourselves on not using any preservatives in our recipe.Quest Bars are considered the Apple and Nike of the protein bar industry, and they have dominated the market since their launch in 2010. It’s hard to find a retail store that carries protein bar that does not have Quest bars available. With all of that success comes a lot of copy cats. Now, most protein bars you find are chewy, with a gum-like texture that gives your jaws a good workout. Low Kalz Bars are soft-baked, digestible, made with almond flour, and have a muffin like texture.Low Kalz is more than just a brand, it’s a lifestyle. We started off as a low-calorie snack monthly subscription box that shipped low-calorie drinks & snacks such as Bai drinks, Pop Chips, and Nutri Grain bars. Our protein bars are targeted towards everyday people wobbling to put on their favorite pair of jeans, or setting fitness goals for themselves; people that are looking to grab a quick delicious, low-calorie protein bar on the go. Despite having a similar bite size to RX Bars and Lara Bars, which all have flavors in the 200+ calorie range, our bars are lower in calories, but taste just as good.","Risks and business go hand in hand. Every new business will have risk and obstacles to overcome; some will have more than others. Our major areas of concern are marketing and sales. The money will be used for manufacturing a bigger batch and ordering custom packaging.It can be hard to get your product on retail shelves, so by having a successful Kickstarter campaign, it will show that we already have a market of people interested in a healthier and organic protein bar that isn't full of all those nasty preservatives."

Yet, he doesn't satisfy his appetite with merely the typical feline diet. He eats... anything. And those things make him bigger. He just keeps eating and eating, and biggering and biggering. ""Cats don't eat cars!"" Miss Veronica stated. Meowsome Cat doesn't care, he ate her hybrid.Meowsome Cat can become SOOO big, that he'll eat the planet. What's left then for him? Other planets. See, Meowsome Cat is space-worthy, and travels often. Other planets contain different ecosystem and flavors worthy of a cultured cat.Welcome to the game where everything is edible. Mice, Fish, Trash Cans, Cars, Houses, Mountains, Planets, Galaxies. Nothing is too small when your big enough to eat everything.This is a game of infinite, relentless expansion. Explore the universe by consuming it all. From within the innocence of a pixelated kitty cat.The concept is simple: if it’s smaller than you, then it is edible. As you eat these things, you get larger. With literally NO LIMIT! there will always be something bigger than you, and you will always be able to get bigger to eat it.Experience the freedom. Savor the gluttony. Wonder at the universe within your tummy.The game will be released for iPhone and iPad. And will be free on the app store for everyone to enjoy.Everything within the game will be randomly generated and therefore a different universe everytime you play. You will start out very small, about the size of a seed. And grow bigger infinitely, even up to solar systems and galaxies. Then as you grow even larger, those galaxies will be the molecules that comprise cells, and you will seamlessly cycle into being incredibly small, and continue eating you way back up!The goal of the game is to check off sets of achievements. Things like ""eat 50 mice"" or ""soar 1000 meters"" or even ""balance a house on your head for 30 seconds"".As you accomplish these sets of achievements you will unlock characters with new skills and capabilities, new planet ecosystems, and various other features.There will be other creatures that will be able to hurt you, or big enough to eat you. So get as big as you can without dying. It will progressively get more difficult, but also more interesting.If you get knocked out you will have the opportunity to use credits to continue. Just like the old stand up arcades. And they will be a quarter a continue, as a nod to the classic style of play. This will enable anyone to download the game for free, but keep the game supported to allow updates and new games. Ever since I was 4 years old I was drawing out video game levels and pretending to play them by following my finger across the page. This medium has spoken to me throughout my life. In elementary school I would make elaborate custom maps in Starcraft. In middle school I would fill notebooks with my role playing game creations. I always knew I wanted to create games. But the feedback I got from the outside world, and my own personal lack of faith in my capability, drove me to seek to get a ""practical"" job. I went to college for a while, dropped out and worked all sorts of different jobs.Eventually I got into graphic design, and even had the opportunity to make some art and some music for a few games. I really wanted to design games, I would come up with many ideas, and I dreamed of somebody programming it for me.I had worked on an idea for a long time, and sought long for a developer to help make it a reality. Eventually I decided to just do it myself, and started teaching myself programming. The resources available online were vast, and the community was incredibly welcoming and helpful. I am finally on my way of becoming a true game developer and designer. With your guys' help, I can make this a reality.Here's a video of a game I started making everything for before called Rowdy Cannon:",It will take about 6 months or so to finish development. It's possible that can be delayed or altered slightly. The production and and delivering the rewards dates will depend on many factors but they should be before the game is finished.,https://www.kickstarter.com/projects/1823840092/swifty-cat?ref=discovery_category_newest,1823840092/swifty-cat,"Let's make a game!I've been craving a good rpg experience, especially on my phone. I seem to have trouble finding a fair one. You know, without those in-game purchases in order to continue within the game.I also hate in game ads. Lets trash those. And while were at it, let's make it a free game.So now that we know what we don't want lets see what we can include.Turn based battles are great, Hp, defense all those basic good stats. But lets keep it as simple as possible.Instead of focusing on a long term play, we'll shorten the adventure time more suited for a mobile experience. Maybe 15-30 per adventure.We can have 21 total characters (most needing to be unlocked). Each with their own quest. You follow along their adventure, facing bosses, until you get to their final challenge.Progress can go across a gameboard, with various forks in the road. Different parts will sway you across different types of terrain. Each with their own types of enemies, and battle conditions. Roll a dice and see who you will end up fighting!We are printing t-shirts as the rewards for this project. There are two options:SwiftyCat T-Shirt on Canvas Tri-BlendSuper soft tri-blend t-shirt.

https://www.kickstarter.com/projects/thingybot/thingy-bot-3d-printer-a-large-printer-at-a-low-pri?ref=discovery_category_newest,thingybot/thingy-bot-3d-printer-a-large-printer-at-a-low-pri,"Hello! I'm Matt and I have designed a 3D printer that is strong, low cost, and easy to assemble and maintain.3D printing is honestly amazing. Creating a tangible object from a roll of plastic is exciting and fun. When you first start 3D printing you will understand just how entertaining and incredible it really is. After we have successfully assembled and shipped all of the printers to our backers, we will start selling them online and start development of other models. I made the design so that it can easily be redesigned for smaller or larger applications. Don't expect us to rush any other models out the door for a while though! These are only ideas!Another important thing we would like to do is help educate students on 3D printing. We will make it easy for schools to request printers at a discounted price. We will also be educating students on what 3D printing is as well as how to do it, and providing other education resources. Education is key in bringing not only our 3D printers, but all 3D printers to the mainstream market!Our goal is to have every printer assembled and shipped by June 2015. Most likely the printers will be delivered earlier, but we wanted to include a date that we can meet, even with long delays.The DesignI began designing the Thingy Bot almost one year ago. At the time my idea was to make a printer with a stationary bed. My design back then was a little different and was only drawn on paper. After many redesigns, revisions, part testing, and frustration, I have created what I think is the perfect printer.It is all based around a central frame. The frame will be made out of aluminum and painted to match your printer color. Some additional parts will be 3D printed, but we made sure that we can print them fast and easily. We originally wanted to go with plastic for the frame and additional parts, but it proved too expensive. We would need to charge 4-5x the dollar amount per printer! The aluminum and 3D printed parts will ensure that the design is both strong and functional, as well as affordable. The aluminum will be 1/8"" thick.. thats strong!The entire frame contains the Y and X movements, with the printhead in the middle. The frame moves up and down, forming the Z axis movement by using two threaded rods connected to two stepper motors on the bottom of the case.The CaseThe case is made of aluminum: cut and riveted together. The aluminum makes the case very sturdy, I was able to put over 150 pounds on the case without any flex! It sits on 4 plastic feet that help hold the Z axis smooth rods in place.I am offering three color choices; black, white, and a limited edition terra cotta color. The aluminum case will be powder coated. The paint will be very durable and the color will last.The SpecsThe Thingy Bothas a 1.75mm hot end and can be used with PLA and ABS filament.The build volume is a little more than 8 x 8 x 8, and each printer will now include a PCB heated print bed!The printer prints at a .1 mm layer height, meaning a 100 micron resolution. This is very high resolution. The nozzle on the hot end is .4mm.I have decided to use the Printrboard because it is extremely easy to operate and what I have been using for a while. The board will be powered by an ATX power supply while allows even more flexibility for future upgrades.Rewards BreakdownWe are offering five different tiers for the Thingy Bot.The first is the standalone printer (black or white). This is meant for users who have the tools and supplies necessary to start printing.The second reward is the printer starter pack. This includes the Thingy Bot, a 1 kg spool of PLA filament (random colors), a 2.5mm hex driver (for bed leveling and repairs), a plastic putty knife for removing prints from the bed, and a roll of blue tape for the bed.The third reward we are offering is our limited edition terracotta model.There will only be 15 terracotta models ever made. Eleven of them will be for sale here, and the others will be given away. If you are one of the people who receive the terracotta model, you will get two 1 kg spools of PLA filament (random colors), a 2.5mm hex screwdriver (for bed leveling), a plastic putty knife (for removing prints from the bed), and two rolls of blue tape for the bed.The fourth printer reward is the Big Spender Reward.If you buy this reward, you can pick a custom color for your aluminum case, 3 rolls of PLA filament, 3 rolls of blue tape, a 2.5mm hex driver, a putty knife, and a Thingy Bot T-Shirt. Only 2 will be available!For the fifth reward, we are offering a limited run of a kit. This is meant for people who have experience building, calibrating, and troubleshooting 3D printers. The kit comes with all parts necessary to assemble your printer, and instructions will be available. Once again, the kit is intended for experienced users, it comes completely disassembled! And finally, the Thingy Bot T-Shirt. You will be contacted through Kickstarter for your size after funding is complete! They range from Youth Small to 4XL.Why $15,000?In order to make our printer for a low price, we need to buy components in bulk. Since switching from the injection molded plastic parts to aluminum and 3D printed parts, we are able to make the printers at a slightly lower cost and in smaller quantities. Metal is not cheap, but it does yield a stronger product in the end that is easy to work with and worth the cost.SoftwareEach Thingy Botwill include a thumb drive containing instructions, drivers, and software to get up and running. The instructions will come in both written and video form. The instructions will be for both Mac OS X and Windows.We couldn't decide on which software to recommend. I have a lot of personal experience with both Cura and Repetier Host. Both are open source and great software. Because I couldn't decide, I will be including both on the thumb drive and instructions for both. This lets the user choose which program they like better!International OrdersThe Thingy Botis large. This causes a problem for shipping. Shipping in the United States is expensive enough, international shipping would cost an insane amount of money. At the time I cannot offer international shipping. I will try my hardest to find a viable shipping option, check back for updates regarding shipping in the future. When I figure it out, you'll be the first to know!If you help us reach our goal, we can do our part to bring 3D printing to the masses!","The hardest part of this project will be assembling and testing all of the printers. We have allowed ourselves more than enough time to build and test a lot more printers than our goal requires. The design is also simple enough that one can be assembled in less than an hour by a single person. Sourcing the parts should be easy, there will be some wait time for the plastic components and metal case, but we have included this delay in the time frame.",https://www.kickstarter.com/projects/thingybot/thingystock-the-expandable-open-delta-3d-printer?ref=discovery_category_newest,thingybot/thingystock-the-expandable-open-delta-3d-printer,"The Thingystock 3D Printer was first designed as a personal printer: one with as many 3D Printed parts as possible and that is fully expandable in the future. To do this, I decided to base it off of the amazing Rostockidea by Johann. The printer went together flawlessly and worked perfectly, so I decided to do a small scale launch of it, the perfect medium for which was Kickstarter! If it goes past the funding goal, great! If it doesn't reach it I will still release the files online for everyone to print! Be sure to check out the Thingybot website for more pictures of the printer and some print examples! The Thingystock was recently covered on Geeky Gadgets and 3DPrint.com! It's great to see others are liking the design! I am a firm believer that open source means everything, closed source models do not work any more. Especially not with new technology like 3D printing. Open source is the best option for users and manufacturers, it is one of the greatest examples of a ""win-win"" situation!The Thingystock is completely upgradeable by the user. The frame is made in 3 parts and, by simply adding additional pieces, can be expanded to support larger bed sizes. The rods can be replaced with taller ones, the arms can be replaced with longer ones.. the possibilities are endless. The 150x150x200mm circular build volume will be perfect for most users. The Thingystock has a circular build volume of 150x150x200mm and comes with an 1.75mm E3D V6 hot end. The inclusion of an E3D V6 is a great value and also one of the best performing hot ends ever. It can use E3D's upgrades such as the Volcano and can be easily disassembled for maintenance. The electronics that are running this printer are the RAMPS 1.4 system with an LCD Controller. By default there is no heated bed, however it would be easy to add one in the future if you so desire. By printing different bed clips, you can easily add support for a heated bed. Clip designs supporting the MK2b heatbed will be released.The printer can print at 150 microns, however it can be changed to print at higher resolutions by using different belt pulleys.There are three printer rewards available.The first is a hardware only kit. If you have a 200x200mm printer you will be able to print the parts yourself!The second is a kit. The kit will take less than 30 minutes to assemble and will only require the turn of a screwdriver and some clips! For more information check out the perks to the right!The third is a starter kit. It comes with everything from the regular kit, except it also includes a 1KG sample roll of PLA and some tools to get printing!For more sample prints and a way to contact us, visit www.thingybot3D.com","Because this is only a small scale campaign, there are not many risks to it. I have all of the hardware vendors locked down and have the designs ready to go. Once funding is completed, manufacturing starts!"

Here, You Can Watch How I Do Itand Share in the Process.The ArtistMy name is Arnel. As a child I immigrated tothe United States of America with my parents and little sister toescape the horrors of the Bosnian War. With little money and hardlyany resources, we did not have an easy life. I often found solace inart and I spent much of my time drawing. My sketches caught theattention of my teachers but it wasn’t till much later that I beganto consider art as a potential career option.My life changed the day I saw Pixar’s “ToyStory.” It was a magical moment – in an instant I knew thedirection my life would take from then on. The possibility of drawinga character and bringing it to life through animation was sofascinating that I decided that one day I would be a part of thismagnificent enterprise. My project is a step in this direction. The ProjectAs a tribute to Pixar, I will make 3D models ofevery character that has ever been created by the animation house. Iintend to complete making all the characters over the next year. But I will not merely be making these models onmy own. The entire process of creating each model will be made publicthrough pictures, videos and tutorials so that animation and 3Dmodelling enthusiasts and Pixar hopefuls from around the world toocan share in this creative process and learn from it. I have alreadtuploaded some of the pictures and videos of my creations and thereare many more to come.  The ChallengesThe project I’ve undertaken is by no means asimple one. No wonder I have often heard this repeated, “Arnel,it’s impossible. Are you crazy?” Wild as it may seem, this is aproject I am passionate about and I intend to see it through to asuccessful end.Pixar does not release any information orfootage on how they create their 3D models. In order to reproduce thecharacters, it is important to figure out the process from scratch. Time is another important factor. Pixar hascreated 200 characters over 29 years. I have about a year to completeall of them. What makes the challenge greater is the fact that Icannot devote all day to modeling. In an effort to make a living, Ispend a lot of time fixing computers and that leaves me with littletime for my passion. 3D modelling is time-consuming and involveshard work, but I find it a relaxing process.  The ExecutionI’ve already modeled 25 of the simplercharacters on my spare time. The more difficult characters are yet tobe made and I have to model 175 more to finish my project. It mightbe extremely difficult to accomplish this project with motivation andsupport. To make a financial contribution to the project, check the rewards on the rightNOT only will i just 3D model the character i will also be creating videos on how i create some of the characters Something Like Thisor this ","for the risk and challenges my computer could crash and all the work would be lost, i could start loosing motivation these are all the challenges that i will have but doing this full time is Fun relaxing so it will be like living my dream job even if it's for just one year.",https://www.kickstarter.com/projects/cgwhat/bugs-movie?ref=discovery_category_newest,cgwhat/bugs-movie,"Hi My Name is Arnel and ""i want to make a Full Feature 3D Animated Movie"" with my teamWe are in pre production stage working on StoryboardsConcept art3D modeling the characters, texturing & riggingListen to our story outline ""This is still a work in progress"" ""Click on the green dash to start playing the audio""Take a look at some of our concept art work and storyboardsOMG AMAZING MUST SEND $$$$$$$These are our MAIN CHARACTERSQUEEN FIRE ANT – The Queen of her colony by birth.

Big challenge is keeping everybody on track getting 3D modeling, Concept Art, storyboards all done on time is going to be key,  my second concern is how is it going to look once we have it 3D modeled, are we going to need to remodel some stuff, those are all going to be set backs. My inspiration for this is trying to get the movie to look like it came from Pixar as much as possible."

With our hands, using a pen or a pencil that is.These holidays, please support my art by sending beautiful postcards to your love ones.To make this happen I need your help in raising $2,174. Why? This is the only way you canreceivethese amazing postcards for such discounted price.You can see more of my photos at www.moshelevis.comPS - I will publish a page with ALL the selections (many of them) on the fifth day of this project.",The only risk was to make sure people get their postcards before the holidays so they can start sending them out. I eliminated that by limiting the duration of this project to only 10 days.I'll be able to send the postcards shortly after.,https://www.kickstarter.com/projects/levitate/growing-roots-in-california-make-100?ref=discovery_category_newest,levitate/growing-roots-in-california-make-100,"As a photographer, one of my biggest dreams is to have my own gallery show. As an artist, one of my biggest dreams is to have my own gallery show that touch people's hearts. As a human, one of my biggest dreams is to have my own gallery show that have the power to heal the world!My adventure started about 10 years ago, but the photo exhibit, Growing Roots in California, is about an adventure that started thousands of years ago. Yes, the never ending adventure of Californian trees.I feel love and connection to trees all over the world. I'm inspired by their shapes and colors and often amazed to discover their age, imagining what stories they would have told us if they could only talk. As a landscape photographer, it is my duty to try and tell the story of my surroundings. To express Mother Nature's emotions through my experience and point of view.This exhibit, Growing Roots in California, shows how I relate to some of the magnificent trees that reside here in California. Just like me, some of these trees were once aliens (no, not from outer space) to their environment. Just like me, when I first moved to California from Israel, some of them were lonely and quiet. Just like me, they did not know if they'll grow to inspire others.And just like them, there was only one thing I could do - stand up tall and believe that the future is bright.Photographing trees is a lot like shooting portraits. In order to photograph a tree, and inspire with it, you must capture its personality. You must express its feelings and tell its story in a way no one else can.If you think of it, you are not so different from your favorite tree. You both have strong emotions, you can be sad, mad, happy, loved, proud, neglected, cold, hot etc. You both can give life. You both need air and you both have a long heritage that connects you to the past and maybe even to the beginning of time.Without trees, we wouldn't survive, because the air would be unsuitable for breathing.Such exhibit will expose more people to realize how important trees are and how much we owe them for every breath we take.So, don't they deserve a gallery exhibit?To make this exhibit possible, choose one of the rewards I curated for you, on the right side of this page. All my limited edition photographs are limited to 10 so it's a first come first buy, until an edition is sold out.If you can't afford any reward, the least you can do is share it in your social circles.I will share a web page with the entire collection.A set of images that will beautify your desktop and keep you inspired every time you turn your computer on and tickets for you and your friend to join us at the opening night.One high quality, professionally printed, photograph from my World Wide Trees Collection.Each photograph is signed and titled on the back.Free shipping in the USA.One high quality, professionally printed, photograph from my World Wide Trees Collection.Each photograph is signed and titled on the back.Free shipping in the USA.One high quality, professionally printed, photograph from my World Wide Trees Collection.Each photograph is signed and titled on the back.Free shipping in the USA.Limited edition, museum quality photograph from the series Growing Roots in California.Each photograph is limited to only 10 prints and the first photograph normally starts at $1,200!

https://www.kickstarter.com/projects/bardic/bardic-brewing-a-local-family-friendly-brewpub?ref=discovery_category_newest,bardic/bardic-brewing-a-local-family-friendly-brewpub,"In the Spokane Valley area there are places creating great craft drinks. There are places with great food. And there are places that are family friendly. But there are no craft breweries that are all three. We want to create that place. Someplace that serves amazing craft drinks and equally amazing food where we can hang out with friends and bring the whole family. A place where we can play games and enjoy our community where our conversations won’t have to compete with TVs or loud music. When you walk in, you may see, at the table nearest the fireplace hearth, mugs of stouts being savored over conversations of ancient literature while at the next table over you’ll find a family laughing over a half finished pizza, next to friends enjoying a couple of ESBs, a cider, and a heated game of Magic the Gathering.We are Mark and Courtney Haney along with our two kiddos, Peter and Wendy (in case you doubted that we’re nerds). We love making drinks and food for people. We love getting to know people. We especially love celebrating with people!MarkMark started his brewing habit over 10 years ago with a couple of friends, a bucket from Courtney’s grandpa, and a ‘just add water’ kit. It was terrible. It sparked Mark’s interest in the process, however, and he has since taken that little plastic bucket and turned it into an 8 foot gravity fed home-brewing tower of deliciousness.With said tower of deliciousness he loves to brew rich, full-bodied beers like, Singularity, his Russian Imperial Stout and, Prefect's ESB, his Extra Special Bitter. When he’s not brewing, Mark likes to geek out to the latest and greatest in the tech and science worlds, lift heavy things, play video games and board games, plan world domination, and hang out with his amazing (and delightfully weird) family and friends.Mark at a glance:CourtneyCourtney started cider making in the last year after being inspired by the awesome, and sometimes wacky, local ciders she’s fallen in love with. She’s creating a method to her madness and it is resulting in ciders that pack a punch. Experimentation is the name of the game in Courtney’s book, whether it’s a holiday cider mixed with pineapple or a new caramel to augment her Apple Pie Cider, she’s happiest when trying new things.Outside the cider world Courtney paints happy little monsters, bakes foods that have too much butter, plays board games and video games, cosplays when she can (which isn’t often enough!), and reads big books.Courtney at a glance:""That which we call a roseBy any other name would smell as sweet.""		Romeo and Juliet (II, ii, 1-2)In the words of The Immortal Bard, William Shakespeare, a name has very little bearing on the thing itself. So then, why do we have a name for our brewpub? Chiefly because without a name how would people tell their friends about our place? They’d be all like, “Dude! I went to the most incredible pub over the weekend! The beer I had was life changing! I got a PhD just by attending their Pokemon cosplay night!” and their friend would be like, “Where is this place? I must go immediately!” And the first guy wouldn’t be able to tell him because we didn’t have a name. And we love people too much to put them in that kind of situation. So, we called ourselves Bardic Brewing.Besides, the bardic tradition is neat. The bards of this world studied hard, became masters of their trade over the course of years and decades, and entertained people while passing on stories and histories from one generation to the next. The bards of our imaginations are adventurers who scour the world for the greatest stories. They perform their masterpieces (sometimes with magic, sometimes not) to delighted audiences and they strive to add to the lives of all they meet. These are absolutely qualities we at Bardic Brewing can get behind.Now we come to the pièce de résistance: The beer! And cider! And craft soda! And local mead, wines, kombuchas, and guest beers and ciders! You read that right. We’re going to have all the drinks! How much do we love thee? Let us count the ways:We love thee 55 taps worth!	Once you’re at Bardic Brewing you’ll have several options for what to do with your one of 55 drink options. You can hang out inside our old world pub, soaking up the ambiance and chatting with your friends. You could also enjoy a lovely summer evening outside on our deck. You could grab one of the games from our extensive game library. We will have everything from Uno and Apples to Apples to Betrayal at House on the Hill and Red Dragon Inn. Of course, you should always feel free to bring in your own games, too. DnD anyone?Then there are our events. Trivia nights are fun and all but we like to think outside the box. That’s why we’re going to have drink pairing nights (which dessert really goes best with a smooth scotch ale), game nights (again, DnD anyone?), family flight nights (bring in the kids for soda flights), brewing competitions, cosplay contests, brewing demonstrations, specialty drink nights, nerd nights, and many others.We believe strongly in leaving the world a better place than we found it. To that end we will be partnering with several groups whose whole goal in life is to make things better. Because we live in the Spokane area we will be supporting local groups and because we recognize that we are all connected and affected by each other we will also be supporting national and international groups as well. And here’s the catch. We can’t do any of that without our patrons. So, rest assured, as you enjoy a cold drink and a warm meal you are also helping people in the Spokane area and people around the world. Go you!Now we come down to the fundraising. Why are we fundraising? What will your hard earned dollars (or other currency if you’re in another country) go towards? Those are great questions!This large of an undertaking requires several phases and we are hoping to raise enough money through this Kickstarter to make Phase 1 a reality. Phase 1 will be getting Bardic Brewing's cider house up and running. This includes getting a 3.5 bbl bright tank, fermenters, kegs, additional equipment, and small renovations of the cider house space. This will allow Mark and Courtney to begin commercial distribution that will create public awareness of the brand and lead to Phase 2. Moving forward towards Phase 2, whether through stretch goals or another campaign, will look like building Bardic Brewing's commercial brewery set-up. This will include getting a 2 bbl brewing system, a 3.5 bbl bright tank, fermenters, kegs, licenses, and additional equipment. Beyond Phase 2 our plan is open a simplified version of Bardic Brewing (Phase 3) followed by the complete and final(ish) version of Bardic Brewing (Phase 4). It's our hope that we will have Phase 4 finished within 2 years.We appreciate every ounce of support we get. Thank you for considering Bardic Brewing and know that if you choose to give, your money is going to help build the dream of people who are passionate about craft drinks and amazing food but even more so about creating a place of community.Cheers!","The two biggest challenges for Phase 1 of Bardic Brewing is putting the man hours in to set up the cider house once it's been funded and perfecting the recipes that will become our flagship ciders. Fortunately, we are committed to Bardic Brewing and have the support structures necessary to accommodate the man hours for both setting up the cider house and perfecting the recipes.We are also committed to honoring our backers. While there is the chance, however unlikely, that the manufacturing of the rewards will take longer than we have anticipated, we will maintain timely and thorough communication regarding any and all developments.",https://www.kickstarter.com/projects/bardic/the-bardic-taproom?ref=discovery_category_newest,bardic/the-bardic-taproom,"What are we even doing?We are opening the Bardic Brewing and Cider taproom in Spokane Valley, WA. We will be the first in the area to have a nearly 50-50 split of our own beer and cider. We'll also have delicious food, craft sodas, and lots of games. Our goal is to make this a place where it's easy to enjoy good drink, good food, and most of all, good company.Why even are we?It is our passion to give people the space to be comfortable, be who they are, and connect with their community. In the past we've done this by inviting people into our home for a home cooked meal and time to pass stories back and forth, play games, and laugh together. The problem then becomes there's only so much we can do out of our home. We have dreamed of being able to have a space big enough to offer more of that to more people. So that's where the Bardic Brewing and Cider taproom comes in.What will the money raised be for?We are currently working our way through the leasing process and once all the i's are dotted and t's crossed we will need to begin renovations. We want to pay for as much as possible with cash so our plan is to start simple and build as we grow. We do however have to start with some pretty big purchases and that's where the Kickstarter comes in. We will use the money raised for:Any extra money raised above and beyond our goal will go for:Who even are we?We are Mark and Courtney Haney and with our kiddos, Peter and Wendy, we are a nerdy, fun-loving family! We enjoy gaming (video and board), reading, hiking, and (of course) good food and drinks (beer and cider for the adults, craft soda for the young'uns).Mark started his brewing habit about 12 years ago with a couple of friends, a bucket from Courtney’s grandpa, and a ‘just add water’ kit. It was terrible. It sparked Mark’s interest in the process, however, and he has since taken that little plastic bucket and turned it into 50-gallon system of deliciousness.With said system of deliciousness he loves to brew rich, full-bodied beers, generally in the English, Irish, and Scottish styles.When he’s not brewing, Mark likes to geek out to the latest and greatest in the tech and science worlds, learn dead languages, lift heavy things, play video and board games, and hang out with his amazing (and delightfully weird) family and friends.Courtney started making her own cider about 3 years ago after falling in love with many of the amazing local ciders the northwest has to offer. She loves to experiment with flavors and use her baking background to make well-balanced, delightful ciders. Her favorite cider is Health Potion, an apple cider infused with hibiscus flowers and Courtney's own strawberry syrup.When not making cider or thinking about making cider, Courtney loves to read big books, do yoga, cosplay as much as possible (which isn't enough), be in the sun, and home-school Peter and Wendy.","The main risk we are facing is running out of money before we are able to open the taproom doors. Ways that we have already worked to overcome this is to only look at leases for places that are well within our projected budget for the first year, start with a smaller set of taps that fits within our budget, and have a plan for building to our full vision over the next several years as we earn the money. We are also currently distributing locally and hosting growler fill nights to help offset the costs of opening the taproom."

While the local authorities assured me that I was good to go without needing to replace the septic system the county was not and is now requiring the new septic system. The other requirements needed to open have been discussed at length with the county and the city since this was relieved which is why we've included the additional costs of the fires escape and the custom exhaust hood in addition to a $20,000.00 padding just in case there is still anything that will need to be done. Additionally I have monthly rental income and shares which vest every six months to fall back on if needed.

He spoke to me about His calling and asked if I was willing to work with Him? Those words are still very fresh in my heart. It was tough because my desire was to pursue another career path. After some pondering, with tears I vowed to abandon my plans to follow His will. He told me that He will use me for His glory which seemed impossible because I was born and raised in a tiny village located in the small West African nation of Sierra Leone. Well, years later, I have seen Him do incredible things in the lives of people through the ministry He has entrusted to us. Over the course of these few years I have been privileged to serve many people and I must say this; there has never been a time that I have seen such moments of despair, fear, hopelessness and anxiety like today. Sometimes you just can’t hold back the tears as you listen to stories upon stories of pain,hurt, grief, shame, disappointment, defeat, rejection, uncertainty, etc. The human suffering has taken a whole new level. We need to PASSIONATELY remind our world with everything in us that ONLY Jesus saves. He is the ONLY HOPE. He NEVER changes or fails. We must proclaim the power and authority of God. This is why we've put together these songs. Many of us need a NEW CHAPTER in our lives. We need to live in the NEW that God has prepared because everything else is fading and falling apart. We feel so honored to work with some of the best musicians here in Nashville. It is such an amazing and sacred experience to be an instrument in God’s hands. But YOU can be a part too. You can be that VESSEL that God can use too. We are inviting you to join us spread this good news. We NEED your FINANCIAL support. Our goal in this Kickstarter Campaign is to raise $ 5000 which will help us track, mix, master and make ready five brand new songs (EP) of worship and hope.By donating, you become a participant in advancing the Kingdom, a giver of hope and an instrument of worship in God’s hands.

Maybe even buy lunch for a Dodge Juggler or two. Your pledge? $1. Just one dollar. We want one million people (or more) to get behind this project, and kick in $1 each. The reward?

Anyways, between moving the rig camps and my job as a generator mechanic I dealt with power cables that had to be repaired. During the early stages of the oil boom there was more emphasis on getting work done than recycling, and as soon as I seen all of this waste I started rescuing as much of the scraps of wire as I could. I always planned on doing something with the wire (sculpture, trees, Dreamcatcher) but those pesky 80+ hour work weeks kept getting in the way.So now I'm back in Oregon from my ND adventure and I would like to turn my recycle collection into artworks for anyone that would like to enjoy them.",There really are not many risks or challenges. I have enough wires to make many trees. The biggest challenge is deciding what tree to make.
https://www.kickstarter.com/projects/roberthewitt/ancestral-ravens-an-environmental-fable?ref=discovery_category_newest,roberthewitt/ancestral-ravens-an-environmental-fable,"OVERVIEWAncestral Ravens: An Environmental Fable is an illustrated book, with art by award-winning illustrator and graphic designer Robert Hewitt. All of the art in Ancestral Ravens is original, most done especially for the book and the rest for an art-card series produced over the last fifteen years for sale to collectors, all of which has been sold.All of the rewards relate to the book, including bookmarks, a bookplate, and art cards featuring various Ancestral Ravens, as well as prints of original art used in the book and two pieces of original art featured in the Kickstarter video, as well as in the book.The campaign's goal is to fund production of a high-quality book in hardback and trade paperback and to pay for rewards associated with the campaign, with any surplus going to support other projects featuring the adventures of the super-smart and brave big birds.WHO ARE THE ANCESTRAL RAVENS?The Ancestral Ravens are the stars of an allegorical fable that begins when, fleeing environmental ruin, they happen across a previously unsuspected portal to an unspoiled world. The way in which these clever birds handle this second chance involves a lot of opposing goals - conservation, development, exploitation, or balanced planning. Then, just when they think they've fought through the worst of the hard choices, the ravens are confronted with another fight, this time with a blustering bully named Brutus who arrives from another time, threatening their existence if they do not agree to become one of his colonies and provide labor to exploit their resources for his benefit. Ancestral Ravens: An Environmental Fable shows what happens next.THE ARTIST.I'm Robert Hewitt, and I've lived my life in art. My parents joked that I was born with a pencil in my hand; my childhood goal was to work for Disney; I focused on art all the way through college; I was a draftsman in the Army; and I've worked in one aspect or another of art all my adult life. No computer pad, notebook, or even stray scrap of paper is safe in my presence - sketching is as unavoidable for me as breathing, and all sorts of little drawings of landscapes, architecture, and cartoon critters crowd my world. I've always been fascinated by animals, especially smart animals, and have long suspected they lead lives more complex than we're capable of understanding.Several years ago I began painting a series of art-card portraits called Ancestral Ravens, showing the different members of a colony of super-smart birds, each fulfilling an occupational role. All of that art has long since sold, but I kept thinking about the world those birds inhabited and how environmental crises were changing it. For me, climate change is the biggest, most universal issue of our times, and my ravens must deal with it as must all other creatures, including humans. All of that began to come together in my head, leading to Ancestral Ravens: An Environmental Fable. The big birds' story is already written and mostly illustrated, and I need your help to turn it into a high-quality book that will allow it wider distribution than is possible with individual pieces of art. Thanks for considering my Kickstarter project - I'd really appreciate your backing.THE REWARDS.All of the rewards relate directly to the book. All come with the secret link to the longer version of the execution of the painting featured in the Kickstarter video.Please note that each of the rewards will have a charge added that reflects the actual cost for shipping via the appropriate USPS mail service.Each bookmark in this set of five depicts one Ancestral Raven featured in the book Ancestral Ravens: An Environmental Fable. The ravens depicted include: Archivist, Costumer, Bully, Detective, and Cleric. Each is 2x6"" and is laminated, making the bookmarks usable as well as collectible.The trade paperback of Ancestral Ravens: An Environmental Fable is 8.5"" square and 80 pages long, with a well-printed, heavily illustrated, full-color interior and a heavyweight laminated glossy paper cover.The hardback of Ancestral Ravens: An Environmental Fable is 8.5"" square and 80 pages long, with a well-printed, heavily illustrated, full-color interior and a heavyweight case laminate cover. The hardback will be autographed by the author and will include a separate Ancestral Ravens 3x4"" bookplate on self-adhesive paper for you to customize and use in this book or elsewhere. Also included are two 2x6"" laminated bookmarks: The Court Painter and The Scribe.This 16x20"" art print is of the painting featured in the Kickstarter video and also in the secret link provided to all backers. The print depicts three ravens circling a Palladian folly in a fresh and appealing landscape. It is printed by a leading printer of art works on Epson Cold Press Bright Texture Watercolor Paper, considered one of the best papers for art reproduction, and has a hand-torn deckle edge. The image is of key importance in Ancestral Ravens: An Environmental Fable because the building holds the sphere that acts as an unsuspected portal to a new world into which the panicked ravens flee when the climate apocalypse forces them to take shelter in the little folly. This print shows the folly in its pristine state in the new world.Art cards are one of the oldest collectibles, as there is a centuries-old tradition of artists swapping their work on palm-sized cards. These cards are modern ACEO size, i.e., 2.5"" wide by 3.5"" high, and are printed on high-quality Epson Radiant White Watercolor paper. There's an artist-signed Certificate of Authenticity on the back of each. Each card is protected by a heavyweight acrylic holder. Each card features one raven from Ancestral Ravens: An Environmental Fable. The ravens included are: Court Painter, Astronomer, Architect, Scribe, Jester, Potter, Royal Armorer, Executioner, Mariner, Toymaker, Musician, and Astrologer. The frames around each image are part of the painted image.This 8x10"" art print is of the painting featured in the Kickstarter video and also in the secret link provided to all backers.

Each is 2x6"" and is laminated, making the bookmarks usable as well as collectible.STRETCH GOAL.If we hit $5,000, all backers at whatever level will receive with the rest of their reward a set of five Ancestral Ravens bookmarks not available elsewhere, featuring the Diplomat, Astronomer, Tea Lady, Gatekeeper, and Treasurer.LINKS TO ROBERT HEWITT'S WEBSITESThis is my first Kickstarter as a creator, so you might like to check out my creative websites. Here's the link to my art website. It shows some of the raven portraits sold years ago, as well as a sampling of some of the other kinds of art I produce. Here's the link to the website about my previously published books. It gives certain details about me and the books.","In a publication project such as this one, the primary challenge is getting the book ready for printing and then printed on time and in a high-quality manner. With Ancestral Ravens: An Environmental Fable, the text is ready, as are most of the illustrations, and over half the book has been designed and laid out (as you can see from the sample spreads earlier in the project description). As for the rewards, the art work is finished for those pieces to be printed, ready to go into production upon receipt of the Kickstarter funds. We have talked with vendors for both the book printing and the rewards production and selected those capable of delivering the expected output within the desired time frame. We have a track record with handling all sorts of projects. In our PR firm -  which created many campaigns for Fortune 50 clients - we dealt successfully with many different kinds of fulfillment challenges. If we cannot fulfill exactly as promised, we will notify backers promptly and take whatever other action is appropriate.",https://www.kickstarter.com/projects/roberthewitt/my-savannah?ref=discovery_category_newest,roberthewitt/my-savannah,"The purpose is to raise funds to publish in hardback and paperback formats my memoir of Savannah in the mid-1960s when I moved there, sight unseen, so that I could take a job with a fast-growing manufacturer of agricultural chemicals. I was just a kid, relatively speaking, newly married, embarking on what I thought would be a corporate career in the graphic arts, and my bride Linda and I considered the move a great adventure. With the book I invite the reader to look over my shoulder as I navigate the reality of being a young artist new to the corporate world even as we explore Savannah as it was pre-Historic District designation, pre-SCAD, pre-Midnight, long before what Lady Astor described as ""the beautiful lady with a dirty face"" was discovered by a wider world.WHY KICKSTARTER IS MY CHOICE FOR FUNDING AND DISTRIBUTION. I chose to go the Kickstarter route because Kickstarter allows the creator full control of projects, from presentation to a population likely to be interested, on to production deadlines, and through distribution, which is what I want for this very personal project. What this means is that, without the support of Kickstarter backers, the book will not be printed or distributed.BOOK DESCRIPTION. 11"" x 8.5"". 207 illustrations, including: 88 photographs taken 1964-1966; 3 original pen-and-ink drawings from 1964-1965; 33 original watercolors from that era or inspired by it; 25 antique postcards from 1907-1955 era; and 59 pen-and-ink sketches done especially for this book to illustrate anecdotes of places and people. Here are sample spreads.THE REWARDS. There are, including both formats of My Savannah:A Young Artist In The 1960s, nine different items offered in reward categories in this Kickstarter project. The list at right shows the specific rewards in which the item figures. Below, you'll find images of each with a description.SHIPPING. The digital ""thank you"" card will be emailed. Kickstarter is now recommending that all physical shipping be handled via a trackable method. For that reason, all other rewards will be shipped, properly packed, via USPS Priority Mail (1-3 days delivery) with tracking. If reward includes more than one item, each may be shipped separately. Shipping charges are allocated as per actual USPS amount, plus Kickstarter and payment processor fees. Shipping charges are stated with each reward and will be collected by Kickstarter payment processor at time of pledge collection for successful projects.HOW BACKERS WILL BE ACKNOWLEDGED. All backers at $5 and above will be acknowledged in both the hardback and paperback formats of My Savannah: A Young Artist In The 1960s,THE SIGNIFICANCE OF KICKSTARTER FOR MY SAVANNAH: A YOUNG ARTIST IN THE 1960s. This Kickstarter campaign is the only distribution mechanism currently anticipated for either format of the book and all the rewards pictured and described on this page.THE CREATOR. Robert Hewitt is an award-winning artist, graphic designer, and author. Obsessed with art all his life, he's always worked in some aspect of art or graphics. He cut his teeth in creative-services agencies, had a brief brush with the corporate world as an advertising production manager in a manufacturing firm, was sole proprietor of a creative-services firm specializing in corporate clients, and with his wife Linda founded and operated Hewitt & Hewitt, Inc., an Atlanta public-relations boutique serving corporate officers and senior managers with communications strategies, campaigns, print and video materials, and research.He now focuses on commissioned art and writing. His earlier books include: No Instructions Needed: An American Boyhood In The 1950s; Winnie & Gurley: The Best-Kept Family Secret; and What Your Cat Sees In You. Here is a brief video in which he demonstrates his watercolor process.The above budget, of necessity, makes certain assumptions as to final results of a successful campaign (that is, which rewards are chosen). This would affect both total numbers and percentages for each category. Also, the above budget does not include services and costs not specific to the Kickstarter campaign, in particular those associated with the writing, illustration, or design of (1) My Savannah: A Young Artist In The 1960s and (2) The Food Of My Savannah: A Few Very Personal Recipes or with the creation of original artwork offered as rewards.","The book - text, illustrations, and visuals - is complete, designed, print-proofed, and ready to go to the printers for the full run. Samples of the rewards - with the actual design produced - are in hand, costs confirmed, and delivery dates determined. Normally, with decades of experience in managing hundreds, if not thousands, of printing projects, I'd be feeling prepared for whatever lies ahead (something always lies ahead in printing). The biggest challenge this year, of course, is the unknown impact of ongoing logistical complications of the COVID-19 Pandemic and the fact that many publishers delayed spring publication, temporarily overloading printer capacity in the fall. For that reason, I'm prepared to monitor printing times even more closely than usual. Also, there's the chance that worsening pandemic conditions might affect vendor-delivery deadlines for other rewards. For that reason, I've indicated longer-than-usual delivery times for all rewards. All backers will be kept advised of any need to delay those deadlines. If it's possible to deliver rewards sooner, I'll do so.  If it proves impossible to deliver rewards, refunds will be made."

However, there is always the possibility of delays due to the process of disbursement of the part to be financed by the bank, and due to the time it takes to the printing company to acquire the recycled paper and to complete the job. But do not worry, we'll have you abreast of any eventuality...",https://www.kickstarter.com/projects/331365629/motivigrama-an-entertaining-motivational-booklet?ref=discovery_category_newest,331365629/motivigrama-an-entertaining-motivational-booklet,"First of all, please be patient with my English. Spanish is my first language, and I'm doing my best with the help of a translator... :-||God works in mysterious ways. And ""he"" uses us to achieve ""his"" purposes. Those who followed my previous project, know that it failed to reach the funding goal... I looked for other options to gradually raise the capital needed to make the first printing of the greeting cards, but this time without requesting bank funding, following the advice of a good friend.I developed then, what I called the Anuncigrama, which had an excellent acceptance, but was too laborious for what it collected. It could say that I worked for free after all. Then, while I was working with the Anuncigrama, God put an angel on my path that, without he knowing it, he inspired me to finally create the Motivigrama.This creation is a treasure to me because it collects, and presents in an entertaining way, all the tools that helped me to resurface in one of the most difficult moments of my life. These tools made me see and see life in a totally different way. They helped me to make peace with life, to have peace in my interior and to simply be happy...That is why I am proud of this project, because I can share this collection of tools with the world that still does not know them, starting with Hispanic population, so that they have the opportunity to benefit from them as I did. And believe me, if you are ready for them, they work!So, the greeting cards were paused because I am so much more passionate tothe Motivigrama, and it can have a greater positive impact on our lives and our world, which is the main objective of my creations.At the outset, my intention is to present the Motivigrama first in places where there is a greater need for these tools, such as Mental Health centers, rehabilitation centers for drug and alcohol users, clinics for cancer patients, mentioning some of them. The Motivigrama is an excellent therapeutic tool.How did I get to Kickstarter again? Believe me that with past experience I thought that I would never dare to run another crowdfunding campaign. But Kickstarter invited me to participate in its initiative called ""Make 100"", and here we are, because the Motivigrama worth the try, and unfortunately the experience has taught me that to make money, you have to have money.The money raised will be used to:If we exceed the funding goal, the extra money collected will be reserved for future printings of the Motivigrama or to support another creation that is developing at this time, which consists of a series of stories addressed to preadolescents, highlighting the values ​​of Responsibility, Honesty and Consciousness.So, welcome to this new adventure!With love, Zoly.Dios obra de formas misteriosos. Y nos utiliza para lograr sus propósitos. Los que siguieron mi proyecto anterior, saben que no logró llegar a la meta de recaudo... Busqué otras opciones para poco a poco recaudar el capital necesario para hacer la primera impresión de las tarjetas postales, pero esta vez sin solicitar financiamiento, siguiendo los consejos de un buen amigo.Desarrollé entonces, lo que llamé el Anuncigrama, el cual tuvo excelente acogida, pero era demasiado trabajoso para lo que recaudaba. Se podría decir que a fin de cuentas trabajaba de gratis. Entonces, mientras laboraba con el Anuncigrama, Dios me puso a un ángel en el camino que, sin él saberlo, me inspiró para finalmente crear el Motivigrama.Esta creación es un tesoro para mí porque él recopila, y presenta de una forma entretenida, todas las herramientas que me ayudaron a resurgir en uno de los momentos más difíciles de mi vida. Estas herramientas me hicieron verme y ver la vida de una manera totalmente distinta. Me ayudaron a hacer las paces con la vida, a tener paz en mi interior y a simplemente ser feliz...Por eso me enorgullece este proyecto, porque puedo compartir esta colección de herramientas con el mundo que aún no las conoce, empezando con la población Hispana, para que tengan la oportunidad de beneficiarse de ellas como lo hice yo. ¡Y créanme, si están listos para ellas, funcionan!Así que, las tarjetas postales se quedaron en pausa porque el Motivigrama me apasiona mucho más, y puede lograr un mayor impacto positivo en nuestras vidas y en nuestro mundo, que es el objetivo principal de mis creaciones.De entrada, mi intención es presentar primeramente el Motivigrama en los lugares donde hay mayor necesidad de estas herramientas, como lo son los centros de Salud Mental, los centros de rehabilitación para usuarios de drogas y alcohol, las clínicas para los pacientes de cáncer, por mencionar algunos de ellos. El Motivigrama es una excelente herramienta terapéutica.¿Que cómo llegué a Kickstarter nuevamente? Créanme que con la experiencia pasada pensé que nunca más me atrevería a correr otra campaña de ""crowdfunding"". Pero Kickstarter me invitó a participar en su iniciativa llamada ""Make 100"", y aquí estamos, porque el Motivigrama vale el intento, ylamentablemente la experiencia me ha enseñado que para hacer dinero, hay que tener dinero. El dinero recaudado se utilizará para:Si sobrepasamos la meta, el dinero extra recaudado se reservará para futuras impresiones del Motivigrama o para apoyar otra creación que se está desarrollando en este momento, que consiste en una serie de cuentos dirigidos a preadolescentes, donde se resaltan los valores de la responsabilidad, la honestidad y la conciencia.¡Así que, bienvenidos a esta nueva aventura!Con amor, Zoly.","As you know, funding on Kickstarter is ALL-OR-NOTHING.

Valerie, an obese, autistic Midwesterner who aspires to work in the hospitality industry, Radiesh, a boy from India who was bullied who aspires to be a scientist, and Johnson, a boy from England who thinks he’s God’s gift to women who aspires to be a Hollywood actor get laid off and team up in this unlikely trio to seek revenge in pursuit of the Leo Award, a parody of Madison Ave.’s Clio Award, which is awarded for the best television commercial.  But along the way, the 3 get entangled in a bizarre love triangle.  The story is in the same vain as The Nutty Professor meets 9-5.  In the scene, ""Who's on First, Dog on Buttocks"", Johnson is about to propose hosting their own television commercial critics show, with the intent of sabotaging their former boss’s television commercials, but is interrupted by a stray dog that causes pandemonium.In the scene,“Green Ketchup on a Hot Dog?” Radiesh is about to discuss progress on his invention for a new pet energy drink but is interrupted by Girl Sprouts and eventually gets entangled withHare Krishna.  In the scene, ""The Platinum Chef Will Whip You...Up A Souffle"", Radiesh's nemesis Bradley competes in the final round, the cooking round, but his best laid plan is a bomb when his hot dog turkey presentation doesn't go off as expected. The scenes in my project are adapted from my comedy book, ""And The Wiener...I Mean Winner Is..."" My hope is to attract viewers interested in comedy filled with puns, parodies, and mayhem so I may produce more comedies and post them on entertainment sites.","The challenge is having my animator draw characters, background, and action according to my vision of how the scenes will be computer generated.Also, the voices will be recorded by v.o. actors in a studio so my hope is the voices are correctly synched.",https://www.kickstarter.com/projects/whosonfirst/dog-and-cat-t-shirts?ref=discovery_category_newest,whosonfirst/dog-and-cat-t-shirts,"Seeking angel donors to help me start a t-shirt business designing cool, cute, and comedic dog and cat shirts. The money will be used to purchase inventory and to design my t-shirts.My success will begin selling t-shirts through my website by getting the word out to animal lovers and eventually selling to online retailers and later to brick and mortar and big box stores.Having compassion for animals, I will donate, from my own pocket, 10% of net proceeds to benefit animal shelters.So, whether you donate and/or purchase on your behalf or for friends and family during special occasions or holidays, you'll be making a strong statement for animals while impressing friends and family with cool, fashionable t-shirts.","With every business, there is an element of risk, especially capitalization. I plan to reinvest profits until the reasonable time comes to draw a small salary.Another concern is quick delivery of product. But by having printing done locally, that will cut delivery time of finished product and providing good customer service.Designs and production will be done entirely in the U.S.A., ensuring a quality product while keeping prices low.

I have realized another cost savings which allows me to add at least 10 more pages to the book.With this in mind, I’ve always looked to inspire others, to bring them happiness and joy. It doesn't matter if its through writing, remodeling, woodworking, conversation or photography. It's who I strive to be.I spend a great deal of time thinking about issues that affect people. Especially my closest friends and family. I’ve seen how harmful and destructive body image issues have become and how it creates so much pain. Men and women both suffer, mostly in silence, from their perceptions of themselves compared to what mass media portrays as the ""Perfect"" body.Because of this, I'm passionate about helping others see the best of themselves, to feel their inner and outer beauty while creating stunning art.For 3 years I’ve been using photography to help counter this collective cultural disfunction. My goal with this form of art, is to show people of all body types, with or without scars and and “imperfections”, how to reimagine themselves in a new and creative light.This collection is called, Light Becomes A Body.Light Becomes a Body has over 10,000 images of more than 60 models of all ages, sizes and shapes. The results are stunning and the quality is increasing with every shoot. Each session is a cooperative venture between myself and model. Projected images are unique to each model, once published. I will never recycle the projected art.I’ve focused on this technique for the last 3 years to find the best methods and I'm still surprised with new ideas for projections and how they land on someones body. Models who are a little shy, often open up to doing more both during the shoot and asking for another.Now, its time to put this collection into print.The Product TrajectoryPhoto Book: This is the main product of this collection. A book allows me show this work to prospective galleries and boutique art outlets. Books can be sold in trade shows and stores. But by far, the most potential is Amazon and other online sales outlets.Branding and Marketing: Every contact, either through social media or personal conversation, becomes part of branding and marketing. I post to Facebook, Instagram and other relevant sites weekly. My photography web site is dedicated to this project and visitor information is also requested there.Fulfillment: Fulfillment has several options. Producing and shipping books is a simple task as there is currently only one product. When the task becomes more complex there are several other options.Additional products: The options for new products are limitless.Themes include men, women, and couples combined with a myriad of projection ideas and poses. Individual prints are also available of my images.Expenses: Working capital allows me to pay models for their time. My photo studio, advertising, fees and equipment are some of the bigger expenses. Lets not forget marketing can take up to 30% or more of the production budget.To date I've had no outside investment in this project.Mentorship: I have a pool of mentors who advise me whenever I need. The printing company has also assigned a personal advisor which includes crowd source resources, planning and guidance.Here's your chance to help get this plan into motion.Several perks come with each investment. Your contributions are rewarded with individual photos, books and local photo sessions in many contributions.All books will be signed with a personal note.My dream is to make this world a more beautiful place for everyone and I believe this starts with ones perceptions of themselves.Could you help me reach my funding goal to create this book?I thank you in advance for all your support.Ken Stoneburg, Photographer and Artist315-708-4000","The greatest challenge is funding. Not having enough contacts to market to friends or groups I belong to. There is no risk to the contributors if my goal isn't reached, no money is charged to you. Other obstacles like a printer and book approval, writing, budgeting and other skills use third parties as consultants. Print Ninja has created a road map and assigned an individual to guide me. They even offer marketing help.My men's group is a source for mentorship and I often ask them for advice.The creation and sales of the book keep the project going and growing. Simply, without funding, and subsequent printing, the sales through trade shows and Amazon could not not happen.Thank you, and please click on your choice for your perk and help me get this work out to others like you.",https://www.kickstarter.com/projects/lightbecomesabody/light-becomes-a-body?ref=discovery_category_newest,lightbecomesabody/light-becomes-a-body,"Light Becomes a BodyThere are two narratives in this work. First, my desire to awaken every mind to see beyond the obvious, and second, to empower others in self discovery through photography.Light Becomes a Body is an exercise to provoke your brain to see beyond the external. It's an invitation to risk looking at yourself and others in a different way, a different light. I desire to plant the seed of personal transformation by suggesting that what you’re looking at, may not be what you’re seeing.In these images, patterns of light obscure and define the body beneath. The negative spaces require your eye to recreate lines and edges.Light Becomes A Body asks us to see more by showing less.There are thousands of photos to choose from. I have a selection of the best but there are many more to select from and I'd like your opinion. I have created a rating page so you can be part of the process. Find your favorite photos.Images of light projected on your body are not automatically life transforming, but it is a statement. On one level it's beautiful to look at, yet each image begs you to go beyond the first impression.The projections allow fears to fade. Exposure becomes a tool to express personal strength. It's a statement of courage.In my studio, I admire, bless and encourage each person to let go and be their true selves. We talk, laugh and learn, some cry. It's a deepening conversation about what all this means to us and how we evolve.It's time to see beyond what's obvious. Its time to really look.Who poses?The models in this collection are from all segments of society. Many wish to remain anonymous, some don’t care.They are parents, grand parents, yogis, cancer survivors, doctors, nurses, lawyers, neighbors, models, friends, strangers and, most of all, real. No bodies were modified in post production editing. Since lighting is necessarily dark, most images were tweaked to reduce background noise and increase exposure. There is no “air brushing” to make someone thinner, taller or “better”.These are real people with real curves, angles and blemishes. Thats the point.I intend to continue this series with different themed books, all with new designs and techniques.Kickstarter is a pledge based system. Nothing is charged to you unless the project is funded. When it is, your card is debited and your product officially ordered.As the campaign is running, the finishing touches will be put on the book. Once the ending date is reached and the money transferred, the book is ordered. Printing will take approximately 6 weeks and then shipments will begin.When you pledge to own your book, you're supporting it’s continuation, marketing, sales and the creation of additional books. I'll also add a personal note of thanks for reaching out to help.Most of all, your support helps real people see others and themselves in a different light.Can you help support this work by pledging to get your book today?Thank you,Ken Stoneburg - PhotographerKStoneburgPhoto.comI couldn't have done this without the encouragement of my brothers in my men's group. Thank you from my heart.","Time is my personal challenge. I have so many ideas running through my brain that I want to actualize, I get distracted. I'm learning to delegate and cooperate. Oh yah, to ask for help. Hence the Kickstarter campaign.Thankfully I have an amazing circle of men that I meet with every week to help me stay focused and get out of my own way. I owe so much to them."

https://www.kickstarter.com/projects/eoelliott/winona-inc-the-web-series?ref=discovery_category_newest,eoelliott/winona-inc-the-web-series,"WINONA, INC.? What's that? WINONA, INC. has been running as a web comic (I prefer to call it an ""illustrated series"") since April of 2013. But Winona the character has been with me in one form or another, starting as a hand-drawn comic strip, since the late 1980's. Since launching WINONA, INC. last year and creating the art for the web comic, I've been hearing their voices. And imagining the characters in motion somehow. Just about everyone who sees it says that it should be ""on tv"". Or ""made into a movie"". So I'm not crazy!! They can see it and hear it, too. But lately the idea of a WEB SERIES is suggested by fans of the web comic more than anything else. And I like that idea. A lot. And finally, no more failed attempts to hook up with somebody who knows somebody, who knows somebody else, with hopes of landing a pitch meeting or a development deal. I'm growing old waiting for that to happen. So after much deliberation, I've got on my BGP's and ready to take the Kickstarter plunge. This is it. It's do-or-die for WINONA, INC. My goal with this Kickstarter campaign is to raise funds to produce WINONA, INC. - The Web Series. Six animated episodes.Each one approximately 5 minutes in length. Uploaded to our own WINONA, INC. website, YouTube, and free streaming websites everywhere. A new episode will premiere weekly, same day, same time, just like a regular season on tv or cable. We will pursue and hopefully attract new sponsors. Fashion designers. Cosmetic companies. Upscale product lines. Then we can make more episodes!We'll also work on making the episodes available through streaming online services likeNetflix, Amazon and Hulu. Won't that be fun?But to make any of this happen, I need YOU. I need your support and your faith that my passion for this project and experience as a producer and art director for countless creative teams will allow me to build a staff of top-notch talent and make this web series a reality. So if you're with me and feeling WINONA, INC. like I am, join our family, spread the word and LET'S DO THIS!! What's it about?WINONA, INC. is all about the sexy and glamorous adventures of Winona Warner, a former supermodel from the South Bronx who now owns one of New York City's hottest modeling agencies. Still leggy and beautiful, Winona navigates the fashion industry now from the other side of the table. Relying on wicked instincts and the insatiable need to win at all costs, her ultimate goal is to be top dog once again in the thrilling and ruthless world of high fashion.What makes WINONA, INC. so special?Created for an adult audience, WINONA, INC. - The Web Series will be the first of it's kind—an animated web series featuring a forty-something African-American woman in the lead. With the popularity of such crossover hits as SCANDAL and BEING MARY JANE, we feel that the time is right for this breakthrough character.They are The Fabulous FourWinona has three best friends. There's Belle Baldwin, a former real estate agent to the stars, now working as a stripper (and loving it) to make ends meet. Desi Ortiz, a charming Euro-snob from Barcelona, lives a life of luxury with his wealthy boyfriend. And fueled by fine scotch and young men, Brooklyn-born Lourdis, an indie rock star, stays in high demand. Together these divas make up The Fabulous Four. In their 40's now, they've been together for a long, long time and have seen one another through everything—from juvenile delinquency and alcohol and drug addiction to bankruptcy and divorce. They are family. As thick as thieves. Winona runs with the Big Dogs!As a former supermodel, of course Winona knows everyone! Each episode will feature the celebrities, big shots and people of influence who pop in and out of her life daily.Fashion, Fashion and MORE Fashion!Fashion, of course, will play a major role in WINONA, INC. - The Web Series. Consider it one of the lead characters! I want the audience to tune in every week not only for Winona's latest adventure but to see what everyone is wearing! WINONA, INC. has remained relatively clean online as an illustrated series. But for the web series I'm cranking up the heat. After all, this is about grown folk. Living grown folk lives. And doing grown folk things.Is there an audience?Divas and fashionistas rule social media. 1000's of websites and blogs are devoted to the blended worlds of fashion, beauty and entertainment. My plan is to tap into the many avenues available and prep for WINONA, INC.'s debut far in advance. Our team will create an official website and blog, activate accounts on all social networking sites and with your help we will spread the news, build our audience and whip up big excitement for our unique new series! As everyone knows, animation is a very expensive process. Here's why we are asking for 333,300.00.There's equipment and software to acquire, and talent that includes artists, designers, computer techs, lighting techs, sound techs. This could come in the form of a fully-staffed production studio. Or a team of independent contractors. There's a scriptwriter to hire, music to rent, voice talent, marketing and pr talent, social media gurus, masters of web design—I'll be hands-on as much as I can, wherever I can, as producer, artist, designer and chief cookie baker. But after thoroughly researching industry rates for the various skills needed on an animation project like this, as well as costs for producing the rewards and incentives, packing and shipping them out, AND figuring in the Kickstarter and Amazon fees, it's going to take 333,300.00 to cover all the bases. But once the dust settles, we'll have a beautifully produced web series to present and a strong marketing team in place to promote it.Some will be intimidated by this goal, I know. 333,300.00 is a lot of dollars and you may wonder, ""how can my $5, $10 or $25 help?"" Just remember that every dollar moves us forward. Every single one. That's why CROWDFUNDING works. So don't be intimidated. Toss your dollars in the hat, whether it's a little or a lot, and become a part of the WINONA, INC. family! I really like the Kickstarter program's ALL OR NOTHING approach. The goal that's been set MUST be reached in pledges. Otherwise, the deal is off. No money changes hands. That works for me like a safety net because meeting the goal is the only guarantee that the funding is there to produce WINONA, INC. - The Web Series as intended. Slick and beautifully. AND make good on the cool rewards and incentives to you, our backers.I hope you like the rewards and incentives! They're the type of keepsakes I would want. And I am so pleased to introduce many of you to my online art gallery, FASHION+ART, and offer as rewards some of our most popular prints. It's a win-win all around!Please see the sidebar for a complete rundown of each pledge level and the goodies available. ","I'd like the animation style to remain consistent with the web comic. The current style has been well established and I wouldn't want to confuse those fans who have been following the comic with a different look. The challenge will be finding artists who can mimic this style TO MY SATISFACTION. I'm going to be pretty hard-nosed about this. And it won't be pretty. But it will never threaten completion of the project. There's always the possibility that the final budget will be larger than the goal originally set. I will then make the decision to produce fewer episodes. Or shorter episodes. In a case like this, where it's quality vs. quantity, quality always wins.Getting the incentives and rewards out will be a challenge, especially while in the process of producing the web series. The delivery dates are estimates. But I will do my absolute best to honor every one.DUANE PARK cabaret club and THE PENINSULA HOTEL are both well-established businesses in Manhattan. We have listed them as evening destinations for our Big Day of Shopping - Winona's Way. Scheduled for October of 2015, we feel pretty certain that both will be in operation then. But if something should happen, comparable venues will be selected.",https://www.kickstarter.com/projects/eoelliott/winona-inc-book-2?ref=discovery_category_newest,eoelliott/winona-inc-book-2,"Yes. You may have. WINONA, INC. Book 2 was originally released in Spring 2019 so it might seem familiar to you. Maybe it popped up on your Facebook or IG page back then. But for the next thirty days the window is open for a second printing! This time on a larger scale. Getting Book 2 into more hands is a must! Because Books 3, 4, and the rest of the series can’t go on without it.Meet WinonaAfter twenty years on the catwalk as one of the highest-paid models in the world, Supermodel Winona Warner calls it quits and opens her own modeling agency. Sure. She’s had drug issues in the past. Alcohol and anger issues, too. She was the bad girl that the tabloids and gossip rags loved to write about so no one believes that she, an ex-addict from the South Bronx, has what it takes to manage a business. But they underestimate Winona. With her keen instincts and many years of experience, WINONA, INC. quickly becomes the hottest modeling agency in New York.Leggy and beautiful, this 40-something rolls with the big dogs, cutting shrewd and savvy business deals while wearing haute couture fashion. Her life is fun, sexy, and it goes non-stop as she plants the heel of her Jimmy Choo squarely between the cheeks of the industry's old guard while rubbing elbows and other body parts with the movers and shakers of right now.When the idea to create a book from my WINONA, INC. online Illustrated series was originally suggested, I rejected it. Completely. My goal was animation. Still is. But the book idea took hold and instantly became the design project of my dreams. I'd spent my entire career waiting and hoping for the assignment that would bring all of my passions—fashion, illustration, design and storytelling—together. And this was it!I poured my soul into the book, belaboring over every page, and sent it to a list of carefully chosen publishers. But because the lead character is Black, it was determined that the book would be too expensive to produce ""for that audience"". So I licked my wounds, counted my coins, and refusing to accept their judgement, I decided to publish it myself. Free to design a book as rich and as luxurious as my purse strings allowed, it's 96 pages, hardcover with a dust cover, full color and at 10 x 10 inches, WINONA, INC. comes coffee-table ready.The reviews for Book 1 were pretty tremendous. Just about every one who purchased it raved about it. Many loved the story as well as the art and as far as I was concerned, the publishers who rejected WINONA, INC. were wrong! There IS a market for the grown-up adventures of a rich, middle-aged, Black American female fashion mogul. Why wouldn't there be?The response to the first book was such an inspiration for me and so encouraging, it gave me the incentive to keep going and create Book 2. But I can't raid the bank account again and do a big printing like before. That's where YOUR support comes in.In order to keep Book 2 affordable, we need to do a large initial print run. By backing the project ahead of production, you're not only making this possible, but you're integral to the continuation of the WINONA, INC. series. So please. May I present—WINONA, INC. Book 2 picks up where Book 1 left off, pulling you further into the fashion-driven, celebrity-filled life of our girl. Along with her three besties, Belle, Desi and Lourdis, Winona moves effortlessly between strictly business and stay-out-of-my business, living life to the hilt with the bells and whistles of New York City as her backdrop.Discovering in Book 1 that her record producer boyfriend, Riccardo Sims, not only has a son but that son is engaged to marry the great-granddaughter of Frank Sinatra, Book 2 begins just as the festivities kick off. The guest list for the wedding shower is loaded with Sinatras, Kennedys, music royalty and Mafia princesses from as far away as Las Vegas. The bridal purse grows and the gifts pile high while in a back room, curious secrets remain on the low-low. But secrets tend to find Winona. And she never tells.Chapter 1 - DON'T RAIN ON HER SHOWERChapter 2 - JUST ANOTHER DAY IN THE OFFICEAll hands are on deck when a rival agency owner with a personal axe to grind sets out to poach three of WINONA, INC.’s popular young models. With millions of yearly earnings at stake, Winona and her team go into swift action, calling in the heavy artillery to get everybody back in place and in formation.Chapter 3 - A FURY IN HELL’S KITCHENResident rock goddess Lourdis has a fight with her barely-out-of-diapers boyfriend. Nothing new there. But he walks out on the night that she and the band are set to perform at the mega-hot launch party for Winona, Inc.'s brand new website.Full of Jack Daniels and backstage melodrama, Lourdis threatens not to go on. But Winona, with a club full of temperamental superstars, is NOT having it.Gaga in Fendi, Tracee gushing over Mommy Diana, a club full of mega-stars old and new, WINONA, INC. Book 2 brings you three separate stories full of fun, frivolity and lots and lots of BIG DRAMA!In WINONA, INC. Book 2, of course her fashion game is tighter than tight! Loaded with one couture ensemble after the next, Book 2 features a wardrobe by Versace, Ungaro, Duro Olowu, Balmain, Ralph Lauren, Tom Ford, Carolina Herrera and many others. Here's a peek—Not only am I super-excited for a chance to present Book 2 to a larger audience, I'm also pretty hyped about the pledge rewards. And stretch goals. While Hollywood continues to ponder over WINONA, INC. The Animated Series (Yes. It's being shopped around as we speak), we've got some goodies to offer—Each pledge for Book 2 comes with a WINONA, INC. bookmark AND a digital download of WINONA, INC. Book 1.

I have from the very beginning and I will until the very end. There's never been anything like it and I have no doubt that there's an audience for her. My dream, to create an African-American female lead in an animated series for adults lives on! Digital copies of Book 1 will be delivered as soon as the funds are cleared by Kickstarter. We do have inventory for Book 1 but in the happy event of needing more copies, Book 1 and Book 2 will go to press immediately at the end of the Kickstarter campaign, when we know exactly how many copies are needed to fulfill our pledges. Delivery will happen as soon as the printer delivers the books and I get them wrapped and ready to ship.

Here's a list of just some of the things the money will be spent on.Film production is expensive, but with enough planning and diligence, we will be able to make an incredibly crafted movie. However, we need your help to make it happen!Deep in the suburban ocean of middle America, a killer clown lurks. He leaves a balloon with all of his victims several days before he attacks with the date that he's going to kill them written on it. A small west coast suburban town gets flipped upside down when the clown begins killing locals.Emma, a relaxed and fun-loving college freshman home for the summer, has kept her crippling phobia of clowns a close secret from her friends for years. This changes when a local girl is gruesomely murdered, supposedly by a circus clown, and Emma begins to panic. Her phobia causes her to have vivid nightmares about the clown until she finally asks her friends for help and admits that she's terrified.Her best friends, Heather and Jonah, insist that her phobia has gotten the best of her. She agrees until one day she comes home to find a balloon in her bedroom with the date ""5-17"" written on it. Emma insists that the clown is out to get her, while Heather and Jonah are sure that its a prank. In her state of terror, Emma begins to formulate a plan to avoid thesupposedattack.As you'll notice, we have a good mix of men and women in our cast of characters, including a female protagonist, which is important to me as a filmmaker. I do consider myself a feminist and I believe that the way women are represented in cinema needs to change. Too often we see movies, especially horror movies, where the women act as nothing but sex appeal. Only 15% of movie protagonists are women, and we hope movies like this can help change that. 51% of people on this planet are women, all of who are just as capable and strong as the men of the world. I believe that it's about time we see that reflected in the movies we watch.Writer and Director Aaron Mirteshas been making films for over ten years, winning awards at film festivals across the nation including four student Emmy awards.

He has composed a wide variety of music professionally including concert band pieces, symphonies, and film scores. This will be the eighth time Kris has collaborated with director Aaron Mirtes on a film.A note from the director and composer:We believe that music is one of the single most important parts of a production, and to ignore it is to ignore the emotional potential of a movie, especially in a horror film wheremusic is vital to making a scene truly bone-chilling. Since we believe this so firmly, we will be going the extra mile and will record the music for this film with a live group of musicians instead of using synthesizers. In the end, this will give us a high quality and one-of-a-kind soundtrack!We recorded our music live for our last short film, ""Bury The Hatchet"" with amazing results, and we can't wait to do it again. Check out a piece of music that Kris wrote and recorded for it below!If you aren't familiar with Kickstarter, it is an all-or-nothing system.

We truly couldn't do it without you!We'll leave you with some awesome behind the scenes photos from the original short film!","Filmmaking is always a complicated and involved process with room for many unforeseen problems. While out team is taking several extra steps to keep these problems from happening, there are always obstacles. We have given ourselves several extra weeks in pre-production to make sure that we avoid as many of these as possible. We have an amazing team and I know we'll figure out any problems that arise in a creative and effective way.

Afterreceiving one herself,Emma realizes that she has two days left to live, andmust fight against the clock to find a way to survive.The film is based on a short film we did called The Clown Statue (based on my favorite urban legend!)that has since gained a cult following online and has won awards at film festivals nationwide!For this movie, I've pulled inspiration from every corner of the horror genre, which I am a huge fan of! It would best be described as a haunted house/creature feature hybrid. I had someone describe it as an ""Americana nightmare"" and an ""electric circus"". Which I LOVE, and I think describes the film perfectly.I lovehorror movies, and I LOVEscary clowns! So you can imagine how upset I was to find out how few scary clown movies actually exist. So I wrote my own and set out on a crazy journey to bring the next great clown movie to life!After six months writing and perfecting the script, I left my Nashville home and met our crew out in Los Angeles to shoot the movie! The production was chugging along and we were getting amazing footage! Then, on the last day and a half of shooting, one of our key locations caught on fire just minutes before we arrived (thanks to the good ol' California drought). The best choice for our movie creatively, logistically, and safety-wise was to halt production.I returned home, we edited the film, and we figured out exactly what we needed to complete it (we have 90% of the film done!). In addition, we had the rare opportunity to be able to see our movie and write someamazing new scenes to make it even better!Now we need your help to finish it!We have the budget left over to shoot what we had originally intended. The trick is getting a new production up and running again, and paying to shoot the newly written scenes. Things like re-renting the camera equipment, paying the cast and crew, and paying location fees again cost a lot! All of this gets broken up into:So join the team, get your copy of the movie, and be a driving force in making the next great clown movie a reality!Brittany Belland plays Emma - With over a dozen films under her belt, Ohio-born Brittany Belland was more than excited to tackle the role of Emma: the story's protagonist who must race against the clock after learning that she will be killed by her greatest fear in two days' time. With her incredible dramatic abilities and attention to detail and nuance, Belland breathes an extra dimension of life and character into the extremely intense and demanding character.Eric Corbin plays Ribcage the Clown - LA actor Eric Corbin blew everyone away during auditions, bringing a sense of athleticism and ferocity to the character that nobody expected. Pulling from movie monsters throughout the years, Corbin truly built this creature from the ground up. In the end, he delivers a performance quite unlike anything you've seen before. Strong, animalistic, and inhuman Corbin makes Ribcage the Clown something to truly be feared.Monica Baker plays Heather - Michigan-native Monica Baker works as an actress and voice actress in Los Angeles. Baker plays Heather, Emma's big-mouthed, sweet-as-sugar-but-tough-as-nails best friend. When things begin to go downhill and Emma locks up with fear, Heather pushes her to move forward whether it's for better or for worse.Sean Patrick Murray plays Jonah - Emma and Heather's other partner in crime, Jonah, is played by Sean Patrick Murray, a Los Angeles based actor and producer. Jonah is sarcastic but totally down to Earth. However, (without spoiling anything) Emma quickly realizes that if she doesn't come up with a plan, her life might not be the only one at risk.Burt Culver plays Mr. Randal - Seattle native Burt Culver has appeared in over 40 TV shows and movies since his move to LA in 2012 (including a guest role in Criminal Minds). Culver plays Mr. Randal, the father of the clown's first victim. Out for revenge, he latches onto Emma.

Though he has always been an actor at heart. Seidman plays Pops, a local ice cream man who, while working with the police, starts to suspect there might be more than meets the eye with the case.Johnjay Fitih plays The Town Sheriff - British actor Johnjay Fitih plays the town Sheriff, who very quickly becomes the clown's favorite puppet.Caitlin Rigney plays Meghan - New York theatre actress Caitlin Rigney plays Meghan, Mr. Randal's daughter who haunts him in more ways than one after her gruesome death.","Filmmaking is always a complicated and involved process with room for many unforeseen problems (trust us).

Education is the driving force behind the 2014 Games. Education that shows that it's people, individuals like all of us, who are responsible for energy. From coal miners and linemen to gas drillers and windmill erectors, all are talented, well-trained and committed individuals. It's these energy workers, our neighbors, that produce power from the abundance of natural resources that are available throughout the Commonwealth.The PA Energy games demonstrate just how important this industry is to all of us. It's also a celebration of all things energy in a festival atmosphere. And while the entertainment serves to attract people to the Games; it is our hope that they will come away with a better sense of the workings of the industry and a broader understanding of energy production, distribution and support.Our hope is to raise enough funds to pay for the advertising and promotion of the festival and to provide educational displays as well as blocks of free tickets to youth groups and organizations.As Governor Tom Corbett said last year about the PA Energy Games:""Pennsylvania has a robust and diverse energy sector that is vital to our economic growth. PA Energy Games is committed to showcasing the Commonwealth's energy production, delivery and conservation, and I commend the organization and its volunteers and sponsors for organizing this event. It is my hope that PA Energy Games will continue to educate our community about the importance of natural resources in maintaining a strong economy and healthy environment for generations to come.""","The project team has decades of experience in producing festival events; and the board of directors all work within the industry. The challenges are to successfully organize an event that provides attendees with an enjoyable experience while educating them on all of the facets of energy production and usage.

The hope is to construct a larger Greenhouse; utilizing again repurposed materials from the existing structure, as well new & more efficient materials. Though, we will have to use a secondary greenhouse initially this season for start up. The hope is to have the new structure up & functional in time to meet the demands of this years start season. Just as my father & I built he first greenhouse at the beginning of my calling to farm, now Tess will help me as she begins her chapter, in this ongoing & endearing profession that has kept us healthy, happy & fed, as well as our surrounding community.","The biggest challenge is having to raise the existing greenhouse; again repurposing elements of that greenhouse and then erecting the new expanded greenhouse in a timely manner. We can utilize another smaller existing greenhouse to start our early seedlings, however there is not enough room for all we have to start with the single greenhouse, plus space for additional starts we need to propagate as we have expanded, using organic methods. With good cash flow early the anticipation is to be able to have the new greenhouse erected in time to meet the demands for greenhouse space come peek transplanting & plant plug propagation season."

Our mission is simple, our beginnings are humble and our aspirations are limitless. Created by Sean McCarthy and Ethan Percy, The Gravy Train is a Mobile Poutinerie that serves the Canadian comfort food in all of its' glory. French Fries and cheese curds covered in gravy, for those who are unfamiliar with poutines' awesomeness. Our goal is to spread that greatness to as many people as possible.Both originating from Northern New York near the Canadian border, Ethan and I wanted to spread our local comfort food flavors to an area of the country that has not experienced poutine, or even cheese curds before. We took our business backgrounds and business knowledge and brought The Gravy Train Food Trailer to Greenville, South Carolina. We have been operating our mobile Poutinerie since July 2016 and business could not have been kinder in our first quarter!Since opening July 10th, 2016, The Gravy Train has increased its' sales by 150% consecutively each month of its' first quarter of operations.Our social media pages have increased in followers exponentially. The statistics from thePoint-of-Sale Provider, Square, shows that consistently 70-80% of business done are returning customers. Having overcome the hurdles that come with small businesses, the food industry, and introducing an entirely new concept of food to a new region; We are extremely proud of these statistics! Instead of resting on immediate success, we are taking the next step and jumping into large scale vending. To reach our goal of spreading the good word of cheese curd, we are expanding our operation into music and arts festivals across the American (for starters) countryside. We have already reached out to quite a few organizations in the South-East and the positive feedback has been overwhelming! We are ready to make The Gravy Train a household name in the world of American Music and Arts Festivals!For starters, poutine is so good it practically sells itself! Besides bullet point number one,we prepare our cheese curds and our sauces ourselves, using quality ingredients. We are able to keep costs low, produce delicious home made meals, and pass that value onto our customers within reasonable prices. This is a great position to be in when aiming to showcase our craft at large festivals. A reasonable price point for our menu items has and will attract more traffic to our vending area. Although we will always serve the classic style of poutine, The Gravy Train's variety is second to none. We have branched out and created severaldifferent styles of poutine.

Our mission is simple, our beginnings are humble and our aspirations are limitless. Created by Sean McCarthy and Ethan Percy, The Gravy Train is a Mobile Poutinerie that serves the Canadian comfort food in all of its' glory. French Fries and cheese curds covered in gravy, for those who are unfamiliar with poutines' awesomeness. Our goal is to spread that greatness to as many people as possible.Both originating from Northern New York near the Canadian border, Ethan and I wanted to spread our local comfort food flavors to an area of the country that has not experienced poutine, or even cheese curds before. We took our business backgrounds and business knowledge and brought The Gravy Train Food Trailer to Greenville, South Carolina.  We have been operating our mobile Poutinerie since July 2016 and business could not have been kinder in our first quarter!Since opening July 10th, 2016, The Gravy Train has increased its' sales by 150% consecutively each month of its' first quarter of operations.Our social media pages have increased in followers exponentially.  The statistics from the Point-of-Sale Provider, Square, shows that consistently 70-80% of business done are returning customers.  Having overcome the hurdles that come with small businesses, the food industry, and introducing an entirely new concept of food to a new region; We are extremely proud of these statistics!Instead of resting on immediate success, we are taking the next step and jumping into large scale vending.  To reach our goal of spreading the good word of cheese curd, we are expanding our operation into music and arts festivals across the American (for starters) countryside.  We have already reached out to quite a few organizations in the South-East and the positive feedback has been overwhelming!  We are ready to make The Gravy Train a household name in the world of American Music and Arts Festivals!For starters, poutine is so good it practically sells itself!  Besides bullet point number one, we prepare our cheese curds and our sauces ourselves, using quality ingredients. We are able to keep costs low, produce delicious home made meals, and pass that value onto our customers within reasonable prices. This is a great position to be in when aiming to showcase our craft at large festivals. A reasonable price point for our menu items has and will attract more traffic to our vending area.  Although we will always serve the classic style of poutine, The Gravy Train's variety is second to none. We have branched out and created several different styles of poutine. We fondly refer to this as “Poutine-ifying” and the sky is quite literally the limit when it comes to creating delectabley smothered menu items.

My latest Ambient Highways was released in digital form and is proving to be my most successful thus far.  It has also won a couple of noteworthy music awards.   Several fans have noted they would like a signed copy of the CD if I released it in physical form.I also find that I need physical CDs in order to send to various music review sites as well as radio stations for potential airplay as this is generally the desired media they need and sometimes the only media they will accept.You can listen to samples of Ambient Highways on my website located here: http://www.krichiemusic.com/music/ambient_highways/Bronze Medal from Global Music Awards for October 2015http://www.globalmusicawards.com/The following reviews were given to Ambient Highways. My hope is that they will give you more encouragement to back me on this project.The funds I’m raising will cover the costs of manufacturing the initial run of the discs and promotional services for the album.I am a professional software developer, but when I'm not writing software, I love to make music!I first became obsessed with electronic music in the early 80’s by being exposed to the fascinating music of John Carpenter, and later Tangerine Dream which are two of my biggest influences. Additional major influences include Carbon Based Lifeforms, Enya, Deep Forest, Kraftwerk, Vangelis, and Christopher Franke. Most of my work reflects those major influences.My style is mostly Ambient, Symphonic Electronica, and Soundtrack.In 2006 I released my album The Maestoso Interstellar Suite. This album contains a continuous piece of space music split across 6 movements. In 2008 I released La Famille Du Solénoïde, which is a musical tour through our solar system, inspired by the book The Planets by Dava Sobel. Four years later in 2012 brought the release For the Willow Wept…. For the Willow Wept is a collection of soothing electronic music about those once lost and those found. March of the Inanimate was released in October 2014 which is a homage to the classic horror movie soundtracks produced by John Carpenter and Alan Howarth who co-wrote the music to classics such as Halloween, the Fog, and numerous others. Ambient Highways, released in August of 2015, represents what I believe is some of my best music yet. Starting with Neutrino and its particle like sequences that rise and fall throughout the track and then being thrown immediately into a 1940's noir like state with V Feeling (a homage to the classic Greek composer Vangelis), you won't feel as if this album is repetitive at all. The album’s title song Ambient Highways comprises lush pads and a soft melody surrounding the listener in a blanket of symphonic electronica. Additional songs on this release range from a melancholy like feeling to an exuberant state in their overall composition, yet pulls the listener through theses emotions with the albums crescendoing track Keeping the Dream Alive. If you're looking for some ambient-style music that is relaxing and easy to listen to, then check out Ambient Highways. I'm sure there is something to please just about everyone.Thank you for your consideration!Keith Richie ",I have released a few albums before and my fan base continues to grow. I have had lots of encouragement from my fans; my family; and my friends to continue making music.

This album will be a brand new experience for listeners. The original material will be cleaned up, enhanced, and remastered as well as extended onto a second disc of completely new material. A two-hour space music epic to ease the mind and calm the spirit. A new prelude will begin the experience and ease you into the parts and movements on a musical tour through interstellar space.I am also producing a “Behind the Music / Making of…” video series as the album progresses that will allow you to witness this album come together. I’ll be detailing additional motivations behind the project, as well as detailing my thoughts as I compose. You’ll get to hear and WATCH the album come together from the comfort of your home. You can watch the first video in the series below: All pledges, if the campaign is funded, will also receive a digital copy of my new album Skylines in high quality MP3, FLAC and WAV formats.  The bonus album will be delivered via a OneDrive link to the music.I would also encourage you to listen to samples of all of my albums by visiting my official website at http://music.krichie.com/music Lastly, if the campaign is funded, pledgers will also receive unique early access items (Tracks, etc) from the album as it is mixed, mastered and finalized for production.The funds I'm raising through this campaign will help escalate the release of the album in time for its official 10-year anniversary in June 2016. These funds will help cover the costs of professional mixing and mastering services as well as manufacturing the initial run of discs.Thank you very much for your time and consideration.

https://www.kickstarter.com/projects/ast25/drink-the-sustainable-organic-coffee-handmade-for-you?ref=discovery_category_newest,ast25/drink-the-sustainable-organic-coffee-handmade-for-you,"BackgroundCoffee is obtained from a tropical plant (coffee trees). Coffee trees produces coffee cherries and each cherry contains normally two beans. These beans are carefully dried to the form they can be roasted and eventually grinded to me used in the coffee.Currently, there are more than 124 different species coffee trees. But only two are responsible for 99% of world trade: Coffea Arabica and Coffea Canephora.Millions of producers around the world depend on coffee and in the effect this one has created around the world in different societies and cultures!But not only the history and the production conditions make coffee a special product. Very few drinks in the world have managed to be as popular and valued as a well-prepared cup of coffee. This drink has the ability to provide a complex flavour and experience that go far beyond being a simple stimulating drink. Its unmatched aroma and flavour offer a range of sensations. Like wine, it should be enjoyed, tasted and experienced.Always keep in mind that behind a cup of coffee, an espresso, a cappuccino, there is a history, dedication, effort and passion for what is well done.ObjectiveThe coffee producing nations such as Colombia and Ethiopia have the perfect environment for growing coffee. Coffee grows better in high altitudes which these countries can provide. Millions of producers around the world depend on sales of coffee. They are often farmers who live in poverty and sell through resellers and make minimum money. Whilst many programs have been implemented to improve the yield of coffee to the farmers (Fair Trade etc.), We will still feel that there is more to be done, especially in the community side. Due to the money, location (mountaineous, high altitude) and several other reasons, the education is an issue in small farming communities. Not all communities have school and the distance to closest school might be too far for many to attend, leading to lack of education for the communities children (and wifes).My objective is two fold - Produce more efficiently with the farmers and improve the education in the community.We want to buy a coffee plantation which allows us to produce coffee, invest in common use machinery and test different coffee products. More importantly, the plantation is a vehicle for finding ways to improve the quality of the living by producing education to, better income for and improve the working conditions of the community in need!We have identified a perfect coffee plantation in a small village in Colombia. The plantation has 12 500 coffee trees, mostly from Castillo (regarded as one of the best quality coffee tree species). The plantation is surrounded by dozens of farmers needing support in harvesting, help in equipment and transportation and of course educating their families.The idea is that while the parents are using the common tools and harvesting their land, the kids could be educated in make-shift school in our plantation. We would hire local teachers to provide education in our plantation.Maintaining organic coffee plantations have an important part in the eco-system. They act in a similar way as small forests. They provide a safe and secure habitat for many species of insects and birds that call coffee farms their home, some of which are rare.The current trend of mass production of coffee, driven by the technologically advanced growing methods, can heavily damage the forests and ecological areas. This is destroying the habitats of many species.In our community, the farmers with centuries of coffee growing knowledge will be working with us to develop and utilize eco-friendly methods of growing and harvesting. In addition to farming coffee, we would roast the beans onsite and export to US. The unroasted beans would be exported to the coffee roasters in North America and Europe.With the coffee export we will increase the yields of the farmers, therefore enhancing their living standards. We don't take any money from the other farmers to improve their harvest and get better yield. We do, however, will be selling also our coffee in future to finance the school and ecological development in the community.If the model works, we would copy the same operating model to different locations in Colombia and around the world.Goals1 - secure the plantation. To purchase the land we need to have 40 000 dollars. 50% should be paid by end of March 2020 and the rest in 12 instalments, if we want to participate in April-May harvest (this is the best harvest). The next harvest is in October-November. I am looking to secure 11 000 dollars for this purchase.2- acquire the common-use machinery and set up the make-shift school with books. This phase requires 2000 dollars. I have allocated 1000 dollars of the kickstarter funds for this.3 - as an extended goal, we would love to set up roasters and coffee shop in greater Miami area to showcase the coffee and the products from the Columbian region. This phase is estimated to require 60 000 dollars.","As with any business and project, things might not go as planned. I have studied the subject a lot and my relatives are coffee farmers. The biggest challenges are to meet the harvesting seasons. If the financing comes too late, I might miss key harvesting times and that will reduce the amount of coffee produced.",https://www.kickstarter.com/projects/ast25/buy-coffee-help-women-and-children-around-the-world?ref=discovery_category_newest,ast25/buy-coffee-help-women-and-children-around-the-world,"Very few drinks in the world have managed to be as popular and valued as a well-prepared cup of coffee.

They are often farmers who live in poverty and sell through resellers and make minimum money. Whilst many programs have been implemented to improve the yield of coffee to the farmers (Fair Trade etc.), We will still feel that there is more to be done, especially in the community side. Not all communities have school for kids and/or opportunities for women. We want to change that, but honoring and promoting the wonderful work of the passionate coffee families. For generations they have perfected their beans. The passion has driven generations to develop the coffee plants from simple Arabica to Castillo and further to include hints of Chocolate and other flavours. The collection, cleaning, drying and roasting of coffee are artforms which have been perfected over decades.The best place to learn and experience new coffee is the coffee shop. Did you know, that the coffee hops started appear in Venice, Italy after 1629. Although they were technically open for everyone, only the philosophers and highly educated had the courage to enter the facility as you were expected to participate in discussions about the philosophy, art and history.Currently the Coffee Shops are having its 3rd coming. This time people choose the coffee shops to study, meet friends, but mostly to indulge in the flavours and the experience. Like with best of chocolate and wine. We are setting up a brick-and-mortar Coffee Shop in Greater Miami Area to promote and sell our coffee + give people an opportunity to learn how to help women and children around the world. We will seek to offer a relaxing, no hassle environment to experience the best coffee blends. Our baristas can make you the coffee in the way you like.The total estimate to set up the shop is estimated to be 19 000 USD without own roasting capability.We are looking for 7500 dollars to secure our our own Coffee production in Colombia and sourcing coffee from other parts of the world, to finalize our distribution and webstore design, which allows us to sell subscription services to everyone who doesn't have access to our Coffee Shops yet.Our Coffee Shops will focus on selling the best coffee from organic, sustainable sources.We focus on supporting our souces. Our first location to offer support is in our sourced coffee plantation, Villa Cielo in Columbian mountains where there is strong and proud coffee farming community. We are there to help children and women get education they deserve and need. It is not only about providing books and teachers, but also buying machines to help produce coffee more sustainably and efficiently. This allows the people have more free time to actually participate into the studies.Our Four Leaf Coffee Shops will be equipped with the book exchange library and recycling corner. We also accept schooling equipment. The book exchange library is an idea from many airports. People can leave their books for others to buy at very small amount. That money will given directly to the Coffee Plantation community.The coffee producing nations such as Colombia and Ethiopia have the perfect environment for growing coffee.

The coffee beans we offer are hand picked, hand cleaned and roasted to perfection. Even the packages are painted by hand by Colombian Coffee farmers. The same applies for the coffee cups. The mugs have been painted by hand as well.The Coffee Table book is truly unique. Only 100 pieces will be made. All the photographs in the book are taken by the local people and in the plantation. Villa Cielo and the surrounding area is a safe haven for many rare bird and other animal spieces.Our subscription boxes are the ultimate gift or reward the Coffee Aficionados. We will provide the supporters with two premium coffee packages containing beans that are hand picked, hand cleaned and roasted to perfection.

The supporter can choose whether the beans should be readily grounded or sent as freshly roasted beans.","As with any business and project, things might not go as planned.

https://www.kickstarter.com/projects/703441506/hayes-and-sons-furniture?ref=discovery_category_newest,703441506/hayes-and-sons-furniture,"CHECK OUT AND LIKE OUR FACEBOOK PAGEHayes & Sons Furniture began as a hobby in 2003. I had recently moved on from the Drafting and Technology degree at the local college towards a full-time career in Television and Video Production. I always had a passion for creating anything I could with wood from household items in the kitchen, dining room, living room, or bedroom, to structural things like outdoor decks and roof remodels. When my wife and I married in 2003, I began Hayes & Sons Furniture with the thought in mind that I would one day leave a legacy of mine with my sons, and hopefully they with theirs. From early childhood, both of my sons have always showed interest in helping me in the woodshop. From holding nails or screws, to sanding and staining - they like to get their hands dirty. I've never had the need for them like I do now for this. Hayes & Sons Furniture is taking what we've done together as a hobby for over 10 years, and turns it into a family business. From indoor shaker-style to outdoor Adirondack furniture, we'll be doing it all - together. And not just my sons. This is a family deal. My wife and daughters will be creating and designing all of the upholstery necessary for the furniture we'll be selling. My family has a passion to work together as a team, and that is exactly what we'll be doing!The mindset behind our family business dates back many years. We've actually been developing this idea for multiple reasons. First off because we believe a family that builds a strong team together, is a force to be reckoned with. When two minds think alike, you have a strong team. We are a team of seven! And our desire to work together is unlike any other. I often get from people who know us, that we're something different, something unique. Someone once said that our family was meant for something, and we believe this is it.We want our business to eventually be nonprofit - and any profit we make will go back into our community, specifically families. In an effort to build my video production business, I moved my family to the other side of the world in 2008. Ok, maybe it was only the other side of the US, but it felt that way. We knew nothing. We had to learn a new culture, and how to survive. We quickly became aware of the struggling communities around us when we started seeing more and more families loose their homes. People who were close to us were loosing their jobs, and couldn't afford their bills. We ourselves had to make cuts down to bare minimum when clients didn't pay. We were fortunate enough to still have our home, and power. But several were without. You probably know a few yourself who are there, or close to it right now. We tried to do everything we could for those people, but sometimes that wasn't enough. What they needed, we couldn't give - security, relief, a chance, a job. At that moment we made it our goal to create some way to help families who were struggling by giving them what they needed most - hope! Its easy to sit back and enjoy a 9-5 job, I've been there. But until you feel it first-hand, you'll never know. Our goal with this business is to EMPLOY families. Families who just need a chance. I will be taking the men with me into the shop, my wife will take the women to do upholstery. For now, we start with one family. Then as we grow, we add more. Every dollar you give, you get something in return from this campaign. But you get more than that. You get the satisfaction knowing you're helping a family employ other families. Isn't that what this world should be about? A percent of all profits will go back into the business to help it grow. The remaining percentage will go to support families who are not employed by us. This could easily mean something as simple as paying someone's grocery bill, or paying off a cell phone debt so it can be turned back on. That's our vision ultimately with Hayes & Sons Furniture - to support families in need.We already have a buyer interested in our products! We had a national furniture rental chain approach us about designing a new line of outdoor furniture specific to fit their need. They buy large quantities of furniture and then rent them out to corporations nationwide for events and parties. When we were asked if we could undertake this type of project (large quantities), I explained to them that the reason we're doing this is to employ families in need. If they buy large quantities, I'll have to hire more families. Not only were they impressed by the idea Hayes & Sons employing families, but the fact that I was willing to customize my current product to fit their needs helped seal the deal. Once our business is up and running, we'll be presenting them with one of each of our products for review. After initial review, they'll make any necessary changes (add, remove, lengthen, heighten, shorten, etc) and once approved they'll have the ability to order a product they're happy with. This is one of our biggest reasons we're pushing to make Hayes & Sons Furniture happen - to present our product to other companies like this one who will continue to come back and buy in large quantities, and ultimately support a business who is in the business of helping others survive. We've been doing a lot of research over the past several years as we've been developing this idea. We didn't just randomly come up with $142,270. We also didn't add anything we didn't need - we're presenting you, our backer, with exactly what we need, down to the exact dollar amount. In fact, after second review of our budget we took out several things that we could live without to start. What equipment is needed to make the workflow easier, the cost of correct lumber (green versus kiln-dried), man-hours in labor, time-frame for product delivery, security equipment, tool warranties, building rental and insurance all go into fine details and scrutiny as we have created our budget for our first year. As with any start-up for a business, there are more costs than one would expect. We've run into that. We've developed a business plan, excel spreadsheet, and put together a board of directors which all aids in making sure everything will be sustainable for the first year as we build the business. In year two, after our business plan has a chance to take affect, we'll be hiring dedicated workers who will aid in sales and marketing for our brand to keep us going. Because of my background in marketing, I can do this in the interim, and then be able to train someone starting their career in marketing! Here is just a little insight into what we've put together over the years:BUILDING RENTAL VS BUILDING PURCHASE:With any business, both ideas have their upside as well as downside. We have to look at several angles, including building location and ease of access. We believe that purchasing a ""pole building"" type shop, and putting it on property wouldn't be cost-effective. We've found several outbuildings on properties already established that would be willing to rent to us. We've also found a few businesses around the Portland Metro area that are going to be either moving, or going out of business and will have their building up for lease around the time we will need it. There are several other options we're still looking into. Until we know for sure that our campaign is funded we're holding off on pursuing the leads we have. We have accounted for a one-year lease with utilities in our budget. TOOLS:I have worked with almost every brand of power tool out there. The higher-end, industrial tools are harder to get my hands on. Brands like, Dewalt, Hitachi, Delta, Ridgid, Ryobi, Porter-Cable, Makita, Bosch, Skil, and Milwaukee - are just a few to list what I've worked with over the years. I've also come across many off-brand and ""cheap"" tools that last the job - but would not hold out for the amount of load we'll be putting on them immediately. This is why I know what tools stand up to the wear and tear, and what tools will fall short.To start, I look at what equipment has proven to hold up over the years with consistent use put upon it. The second thing I look at is cost. Some name-brand items can charge more because you're buying the name. The third thing is the warranty. Some come with a standard in-store one year warranty, and for an additional price they'll let you buy a longer warranty. What does that warranty cover, and can I return the item to be repaired or fixed at the store I purchased it at, or does it have to be mailed in to the manufacturer at my cost? Just because the price might be cheap, doesn't mean the equipment will withstand the strain. I've also looked into purchasing used equipment from online. Whereas this might be a money-saver, there are no warranties, and anything that happens I have to cover the cost for repairs - ultimately resulting in higher costs in the long run.We will not be purchasing all of our equipment with the same retailer, or even from the same manufacturer. What might be quality in a drill, might not be in the scroll saw. We've put together an extremely detailed list of products we need, and have narrowed down our supply to what we can't get by without to start.These include, but are not completely limited to:Some of this equipment I already own, but some will not last the extent of it's use for the projects we'll be enduring. That is why I feel it best to purchase equipment that will.SAFETY:Because we'll be bringing on families who just need jobs, the men that will be working in the shop with my sons and I need to be properly fitted with safety gear. This is a minor detail that most do not think of.These include:STORAGE:I have budgeted to build all my own cabinets, and storage for hand tools within my shop. However, we are in need of a steel shelf unit to hold heavier gear while I build my other units. This unit can be purchased used and does not have to be pretty, just solid. We have budgeted for one steel shelf.ESSENTIALS:Obviously to start a business in furniture we need several essentials to start us out. Since we're rewarding you, our financial support, with products we'll be making we need to stalk our supply of a few things to make that possible. Here is our list of what fall under our ""Essential List"":FINISHING SUPPLIES:Once our products have gone through the initial building stage, every piece goes through a detailed finish. Our shop will have a clean room that will be moisture and temperature controlled where every piece of furniture that is scheduled for stain and/or polyurethane will undergo multiple coats of quality-controlled finishes. A consistent air-flow will also keep the clean room bug-free! Here is what goes into that:ELECTRICAL: CLEANING:General cleaning supplies will be needed to keep not only a clean working environment, but to keep all our equipment in top-running shape. Here's what we've budgeted for:SECURITY:We want to make sure all of our equipment is protected from vandalism, as well as theft. On the off-chance that something happens to one of our workers, this will also aid in review as to what happened to properly adjust our safety procedures. We have budgeted for a four-camera security system and digital video recorder.TRAILER:Our budget for a trailer was taken out after a second review. We plan on renting or borrowing a trailer for hauling wood until our finances improve, or we exceed our Kickstarter Campaign. OFFICE SUPPLIES:Until I have time to build office shelving units and counters, we will deal with limited office table-space. The office will also be location for our upholstery manufacturing. Here is what we've budgeted for:BUSINESS SET UP:With any business, profit or nonprofit, there are state business costs. Here's what we've budgeted for:INCIDENTALS:We expect there to be minor things that will have to be added last-minute once we start. To be prepared for this, we've budgeted the following:SALARIES:In our initial budget we had planned for several employees to start with us at the beginning. At this moment, after further review, we've dropped that number to two total salaries. With our goal being to hire families in need, we want to be wise with our start-up costs. If we exceed our campaign goal, we'll add a stretch goal to fill this need of two more salaries to hire a shop and upholstery worker. KICKSTARTER FEES:As with every Kickstarter Campaign, there are fees associated. If we don't meet our goal, no one gets charged anything. If we meet our goal, we are charged an additional 5% for every dollar raised which goes directly to Kickstarter. There is also a fee of 3-5% added to cover their Credit Card Processing. You, as our backer, are not charged any of these fees. So we've calculated that percentage of our total needed to start, into our Campaign total.Below you will find details to every product we will be offering once our online store is open in May.Hayes & Sons Outdoor ""Florida"" Furniture Line (coming soon):Hayes & Sons Shaker & Mission Furniture Line:Hayes & Sons Exclusive Kitchen Line:","So, we've successfully funded our goal! Now what?If we just meet our goal, the majority of work will be laid on my shoulders to complete the Kickstarter Rewards. You've helped us make this happen, and we couldn't have done it without you. But that's why we need everyone to give as much as they possibly can. Our budget only covers the basics to get us started. Because the purpose of Hayes & Sons Furniture is to support and employ families in need, we need everything you can give! This can not happen without you! Make a difference, and be rewarded for it in so many ways!As with any project, there are always risks and challenges. For us, our number one challenge is meeting our goal. We've cut out everything to get to the bare bones. The start-up costs for this type of business is normally high. Ours is extremely low because we've spent a lot of work to budget well. If we fall short, we will not be able to make this work. Not a day goes by that we haven't put our whole hearts into this, and we hope you see that. We hope you're driven to give not because of who we are, but because of what we're doing and why.",https://www.kickstarter.com/projects/703441506/blue-lives-matter-usa-wooden-plaque?ref=discovery_category_newest,703441506/blue-lives-matter-usa-wooden-plaque,"My name is Kevin Hayes, and I'm the proud father of these kids. I also own and operate Hayes & Sons Furniture (a custom furniture manufacturing company). I'm excited to help bring to life an idea my children had to show their support for the officers in their town, and those abroad.After recent events, my ambitious kids wanted to give something to every police officer in the US. I knew that would be difficult since there are more than 900,000 police officers nationwide. So they decided they wanted to do something simpler, and do one thing for each major police station in all 50 states. Being a proud supporter of our military and police, I wanted to do everything I could to make this happen. With my help, they came up with a design and created this Blue Lives Matter Plaque.They've had the privilege of meeting several of our local law enforcement. Officer Chris Macom of the Canby, Oregon Police Department has proven to them what a true officer of the badge does. He helped find a lost ipod when they thought it was gone forever. He also pulled over to check on our family when we were having vehicle issues.The Canby Police Department has already received their first donation, and are supporting the kids in their endeavor. After seeing the difficulty of cutting out 50 of these plaques by hand, we started looking into some options. They would like to purchase a CNC (Computer Numerical Control) Router which would (controlled by a computer) cut out the design they want. This particular size plaque would require a larger CNC Router than you can get at a woodworking store. When they realized the costs, they became very discouraged. So that's where Daddy comes in! I told them that not only was their idea very honorable, but I believed that many people would see this and want to get involved.Now that's where you come in! Not only will you receive one of these plaques yourself (at a Reward of $20 or more), but 50% of that money will go into a fund to purchase their CNC Router so they can create these beautiful pieces for each major police station in every state! If they exceed their goal, they'll be making more to give away to law enforcement as a way to say ""thanks"".Each plaque comes with 5 gold vinyl stick-on stars to allow you to place on the states within the plaque of your choice in memory of fallen officers. On the back of the plaque will be engraved, ""In Memory of The Officers Who Have Fallen in the Line of Duty"".I hope you see the value of this project as much as I do! The goal I've helped them set of $5500 breaks up like this:50% goes toward product to create enough plaques for the rewards. 50% goes toward the purchase of their CNC Router (and laptop with CNC Software) to be able to make 50 plaques to give away.As a furniture builder, I will be aiding them on the construction of each plaque, but this will be their project! Will you help? It only takes $20 to get started - $1 even helps! Check out the rewards you get for the amount you pledge, and do the most you can! And please, share this!! After they meet their goal, Kickstarter and their processing fees will take about 8%. Not only do we believe they'll meet their goal, but will quickly exceed it! Make sure you get on the ""Limited Rewards"" before they go!Don't just take my word for it! Let me introduce you to these awesome kids! Meet Jesse, Timna, Luca, and Liesl:""Hi! My name is Jeshua, some people call me Jesse for short. I am a helper of Hayes & Sons Furniture. As a side-project I like to make Beaver-Chewed Walking Sticks from wood I get along our river-side. I'm 12 years old and I like to swim, draw (because I'm an artist), and build forts (including a lean-to I'm currently working on). I have the reading knowledge of a 15-year old (which takes up a lot of my play-time). That's about it!""""Hello. I'm Timna. My daddy calls me 'Tim'. I'm 10 years old and I like to crochet! I've made scarves and hair bun holders. I work with the rest of my family making furniture. I help cut the wood, stain, and varnish. I'm also a good cleaner (ok, maybe daddy put that in)... I have lots of animals. I like to let them loose so I can catch them! My favorite animal is my little Banty Chicken name 'Jack' - she's a 'she'. :)""""I'm Luca. I'm 9 years old and I'm a runner! I've run three 5K's in the past year. I improve on my time each race. With my other siblings, I also help around the shop. I love to get stain all over me- I mean, the furniture! :) I also like sanding. When I'm not running or working with furniture, I like to play with my bunny rabbit, 'Sugar'. She's a Rex Velveteen. She runs FAST, and looks like she glows in the dark! I'm a math-geek, and love working with numbers in school. Should I go get Liesl now, daddy?""""Hi my name is Liesl. I have a bunny named 'Whiskers', she's very cute when she takes her paws up to her whiskers and licks them. Like my sister's she's also a Rex Velveteen. I help in the shop with my mom on 'finishing work' which can be anything from staining, to varnishing. I like to cook meals for my family. I can make spaghetti, mashed potatoes, chicken quesadillas, and my brother thinks I make the best hot chocolates - he slurps them right down! I'm a good swimmer - I'm really good at free-style, and just moved up in my swim class! I have a dog named Beau who likes to sleep with me. Thanks!""We might be just four kids in a small town in Oregon, but we're four kids who stand behind our police officers and support them. We know we're not alone, and want you to stand with us!Thank you for your support whether it be through financial contribution, or sharing this campaign! And make sure you follow us on Facebook!https://www.facebook.com/hayeskidscreations","With any wood-working tool the risks come with complications from tool issues. We have over 30 hand and power tools in our shop - and at some point, they break down. So researching the best CNC Router and knowing the warranty is very important. CNC Routers have drill ""bits"" that carve away the wood. These bits break over time. Depending on the number of orders we get, will determine how many bits we'll ""eat"" through. With the correct eye, ear, and mouth (respiratory) protection while operating any power tool, the personal injury risks go way down. And with the operation of any power tool, an adult must always be present."

The name PolStrat is just a rebrand of Poliword idea. https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cRj2YZetxgcPolstrat will provide the people of the world an opportunity to make real changes in their government and society.1. Introduction2. Who is the target group we aim for ?3. Why should You support it ?4. Project Overview5. Detailed description ( Stage I - VI )6. Project Features7. Summary8. Rewards in details9. About team Polstrat.org – a Project in the form of an internet website and is a rebrand of the Poliword project idea.What is this project about? - To provide people the power to shape the reality they live in.Our ultimate goal is to help provide people with more power and help influence decision making within their own country's government. This project will help ensure that politicians will not so easily disregard the ideas and will of their people. Furthermore, it will help to provide a more fair, transparent and people-centered system.Polstrat gives their users the option to create new votes, make decisions about their country systems, suggest their own, maybe better idea's/solutions for existing major problems. As well, the Polstrat user can help introduce totally new ideas for laws. Moreover, it might be used to help nominate themselves (or others) for public office as well as allowing people to express their opinion about ideas and rate them according to their own personal views.The origin of the Polstrat idea was born after realizing that people all over the world complain that their voice was not being heard and that the political class in concert with the controlled mass media was muting all perspectives (except those that are state-sanctioned.Many are beginning to feel that we do not live in truly democratic societies but in ""pseudo-democracies.""This project's goal is to change this. It is about allowing all voices to be heard, every vote to be counted, and to help reverse ""politically-correct” censorship or prioritization of few over to the detriment of the majority.What this means is that huge databases are going to be formed (allocated by country) and these will be slowly filled by site users themselves, all information being verified by all other users, commented on and rated.Polstrat will be a simple tool with powerful features for those who wish to include their own country into the Polstrat project. It was designed with the idea, based on the fundamental tenets of democracy, freedom of speech, and absolute independence from any form of exterior manipulation. It will help provide more of a say in the governance of and what is happening in their own country. Polstrat is for everybody who cares about his country, its people and its' democracy. It is for those who feel even slightly obligated about participating in the political process in order to secure a better future for all.It’s for those, who feel discriminated against, ignored and/or silenced by the overwhelming state/media narrative.Polstrat exists to give the power back to the people, in truly democratic way, bypassing much of thedisinformation of the controlled media that is controlled by money - not truth.This Project exists to fix and change all of this.This project has the potential to help people all over the world.1. Finance all technical matters connected to setting up few independent well secured servers. Every country will have its own individual data base, all of them connected to each other; that also means along with incidentals the costs will be substantial. We will will build a professional and independent website and it will be translated/organized for every “requested” country.Some countries have differing governmental structures (i.e. the United States) thus each state is unique in terms of laws and statutes, thus ensuring an abundance of work in terms of setting the project up.2. Finance crew-individual costs connected to the project (3 members/creators/top-moderators from France/Germany/Poland) + the possibility of third party members.3. Our job will be to maintain and keep the site independent and safe. The site will NEVER be sold nor will it be allowed for anyone to manipulate the data on the website, or mute/destroy anything posted.This site is to be one of the most independent free-speech/zone on the Internet where major decisions about every country's development will take place (according to the will of its citizens).The amount of money we ask for is the minimum that we require to launch. The project is actually not even just a single website; it will be a parent site with subsidiary sites connected to it.We planned Polstrat in this manner due to security issues and the required site organization (for the future stages and further plans for the development of Polstrat). The parent site will include two “countries” on default – “European Union” and “International”; every new country added to the project will have its customized website, with a structure most suitable for the special requirements of the respective country.What we ask for is not enough to setup our own servers with Polstrat.com, but to rent servers (to start).Polstrat is public portal based on freedom of speech and choice, and the content will be user generated. The idea is to allow the free flowing of speech and ideas and help eliminate oppression, discrimination, censure, lies, corrupted think-tank statistics and other forms of manipulation.Polstrat will have list of countries “added” to a database based on any user request, starting with countries like: Poland / Germany / France / United Kingdom / Sweden / the US. This list will grow based on the “requested” countries that will be included in the project. While browsing any chosen country entire page will be displayed in the country's official language. Each country profile will be developing itself based on number of registered users from the chosen country.All major features will be unlocked in a Six Stage Program, described below in detail. Site mechanics will limit admin intervention to minimum, so most of page features will be maintained by the users themselves and will be based on a ""voting system"" – where the content will be judged by the voting of the users.Admin’s will be chosen from among users, and admins will be controlled by the users so users (so that they may be removed at any time should they abuse the position). There will be five ranks of admins total, and even ordinary admins will have to vote together over subjects to make certain major decisions. The first word will always belong to the users.Below “Stage’s” being listed, with detailed description of what they introduce/unlock.STAGE I – Is all about creating a reliable database, for all basic features. At stage one user’s will build a database and begin rating its components to create the first statistics. This could be on subjects that range from politicians from their country, political parties in the arena, culture and values, law & regulations + political ideas. It’s important to know, that every vote you make, every component you add to the website data, will be visible in your account activity history, so if an account should need to be removed/closed or set to “hidden” status – all votes from that account will also be removed from statistics WITHOUT affecting created content (like your own political idea that people may rate, comment etc). It’s a security measure in case of possible trolling/spamming etc.STAGE II – Main feature of Stage 2, is a possibility to propose yourself as a possible public candidate. A new list for those types of profiles will be created. The candidate user profile will be more detailed, a similar structure to a politician's profile, where your activity history will be displayed, where anybody may read your self made description, see choices you made about specific subject/people, check what political ideas/agenda you support, oppose, simply to learn about you before you get elected for any public functions in the future. Thanks to Polstrat you may browse profiles of any candidate and see clearly what political ideas/values he supports, what he opposes, check his activity log, read his profile or watch a video his own personal introduction. Most liked candidates at this stage might obtain important functions in the website at stage III, and in the future might become a candidates for different functions in your own country government - a person chosen via Polstrat as a most competent, most reliable and trustworthy ambassador of the people from your country.By Polstrat anybody may ask any question to the candidate that will be displayed in public, or possible candidate may record interviews/speeches about different subjects that Polstrat users are concerned about. Also in Stage 2, Polstrat should become fully available and synchronized with smart phones as an APP.STAGE III – Adopting Polstrat features to specific state regulations/law restrictions and taxes, we want to introduce a “Polstrat National Budget” feature, that will work based on a ""Budget Donation” option. “Budget Donation” – is a donation in value not greater nor less than 1 euro monthly. Anyone from chosen country where feature has been already introduced, - is free to donate 1 euro monthly into the “Polstrat National Budget” that will be assigned to every registered country on Polstrat, (after a country will have enough users registered to unlock this feature). Every paid 1 euro, will be displayed on budget page and on a Donator profile itself.Under “Polstrat National Budget” menu - a list for “National Wishes”, will be displayed. The “National Wishes” list will be filled with new requests, and be cleared each month. Every user from a specific country will be able to “ADD” new ideas into the list, about what should the budget money be spent on. After certain amount of days, when list will be filled with those ideas- Users will be allowed to vote for most noble ideas and that budget will be spent on (or saved/stored for another month), for example:- Hospital XYZ has huge debt, they doing great job for people but they going bankrupt, let’s help them out with what we got.- Lone Mother with five children lost house and everything in fire, let’s donate the money to them- XYZ is working over ZYX Technology that might be revolutionary for our country, unfortunately he needs more money to finish his research, lets support him in his work.Every country with this feature unlocked, will have its own wish list, its own budget and team, chosen by people “administrators” + “messenger” responsible for maintaining “Polstrat National budget” + fulfilling people wishes + documenting everything and paying any necessary taxes from this operation.When the voting stage is finished, the national budget will be spent to support the chosen idea. Ideas with the most votes will have the highest priority to be realized. Polstrat users will pick one person from among themselves who will willingly agree to take responsibility over fulfilling “National Wishes”, also Polstrat users may reward their messenger by assigning certain amount of money for him as a payment for his services for Polstrat community.This feature is optimal for the Polstrat website, but it’s a first little step to give people power and the ability to do something good for their own country and people who live there.Also the budget might be spent on “events” from stage IV, like to sponsor a specific protest, demonstration etc.STAGE IV – “Open Letter” Feature will be added to the menu. It's a letter that anybody may generate on the Polstrat website, print it on his own at home and send to his government/politician or politician's party in order to request, ask or demand something what majority of Polstrat users from that specific country support (vote for) and expect from that person/party or whole government to do something about specific subject. The letter will be generated based on Polstrat statistic and displayed on Polstrat open letter board, and feature will be unlocked when a certain number of people will be willing to support it, what in practice means:>Lets say there are 1,200 000 registered users from Germany. One of these users comes up with the idea of: “lets legalize smoking cigarettes in public places”. 700 000 people voted “FOR” or claimed themselves “NEUTRAL” about this postulate, while only 50 000 German users voted “AGAINST”.So majority of registered citizens by a large majority, support or remain neutral about this proposition – thus you have now the option to generate a “Open Letter”, certain options will be unlocked in open letter generator based on the numbers of total German population + total number of German site users + total number of supporters + those who don’t mind + those who oppose.Any user with German citizenship may simply log in Polstrat, generate a letter, print it at home, and send it, on his own to the proper individual/political party or government requesting them to do something about specific subject, and at the same time use the “Letter printed statistic” taken from Polstrat data base, proving/giving them the idea, that there are a lot of German citizens, who also want this idea to become a reality.Its obvious that more German citizens will register themselves on Polstrat and more will vote on specific idea – more seriously: government will have to take the Polstrat database, and more people will generate and send open letters from Polstrat – the bigger will be an impact/effect on ruling parties, politicians.“Call an event” - a powerful feature that will not only allow to call “united” people over specific subject into action, but also plan and organize chosen “event” in detail.This feature will be used mostly to organize protests / rallies. Anyone may call for an event. Once the event gets enough votes supporting it – event details will be available to plan.For example:a. Event location.b. Event goals/objectives.c. Event leaders/organizers will be elected/chosen from among Polstrat users.d. Event plan introduced ( what we do, what we bring, what type of banners we prepare etc. )e. Event rules .f. Event members - People who will submit as willing to join you on the streets in the protest – this will allow protest leaders/organizers to know in advance, how many people will come to meet them at the event to hold their back, and if its worth to organize event in first place based on number of people who declare themselves as willing to come and take part in it.As always – the effectiveness of “events” depends on the number of people who support it and are willing to take part in it – so in first place it depends from number of Polstrat users from your country.STAGE VWill become active after 5% of country population will be registered on Polstrat.A new list will be introduced to the country menu on Polstrat and on the user personal profile.Every Polstrat user may declare on his profile what location he lives in, it will give him extra rights about voting/managing his City/Town/Village menu.Anybody may “ADD” any City/Town/Village into the list on “REQUEST”.STAGE VIIf users population from chosen country reach at least 15%.At this stage, same as above, same options, same possibilities and features but on a larger scale, not to a city/town/village but to entire regions/provinces/states.Everything will be configured and designed to suit the country's structure and its people.Summary of features:- Easy friendly interface, for example all information’s about chosen politician characteristic, views, ideas, his political agenda – will be listed, transparent and easy to compare with all other politicians and people who simply talk/wish to take part in politics.- Create/obtain most reliable and clear image of your country, its government and politicians, people, culture, values and tradition, law and regulations, political ideas.- Monitor activity of your actual politicians, entire government, and judge, take proper action based on your ideas/personal view and the support you have.- Create an alternative, to the controlled media.- Help people retake control over their country, government, areas they live in, by community organizing at the local and national level.- Unique site mechanics minimizing need for administrator’s intervention to a minimum.- Advanced notification feature, will always keep everybody well informed about new ideas/people to rate, about people responding to your comments. Also the notification system will inform you about important subjects like new events etc.- Performing any operations on our site will be always free, and every user will have equal rights, and responsibilities.- Thanks to National Polboard (imageboard mechanics) or specially designed mechanics of the unique “comment section”- for almost all site content, from political profiles, political ideas, laws & regulations, tradition & culture –. Final word belongs to majority in form of support or opposition. Most of voting pools have three options to chose from “SUPPORT/NEUTRAL/OPPOSE”It is designed like this for a reason, every vote matters, even those without an opinion.- All site mechanics has been deeply thought over / analyzed and designed to eliminate the problems of possible: Trolling / Content duplication / Content Troll Editing / Political ideas, laws and regulations “details”, sub menus and their own voting system / Faking nationality (especially at stage 4+) / Dealing with inactive profiles and outdated statistics / Possible spam of fake account’s or fake content etc.We are aware of the potential size as well as how important that this project is and what it has the ability to evolve into.Yourjourneyto better your life and country, might just start here, today, if youonly want want it to.

All startup donors, names or nicknames as well as their nationality, will be mentioned on the website credit list as supporters of the project, right below the names of the site’s creators. Supporters will remain on that list permanently in form of a “memorial wall”, honoring those who helped to found this project - and thus as those who helped people to regain control over their own country’s.Honestly, the best reward that I may think of is the creation of the website itself, as it provides an opportunity for all of you to do something for all of “us”. It’s about fixing and changing our respective countries, governments, the laws and the regulations that wefollowin everyday life.Help us put this project in motion.Polstrat Project Hero RewardHonorable mention on the website,as hero who helped all of us regain control over our countries, and helped to improve democracy world-wide.( If company logo - will remain visible near bottom-right corner of Polstrat main international page as ""project hero"" for 10 years. ) Also special reward awaits in the future. We are group of independent people from around Europe. We see the same problem in our countries, and we agree that this project might offer solution, might help all of us. We wish to professionally focus over this project, work over it and maintain it in the future.Key team members are:Grzegorz O. – project/website designer. (Poland)Julia.B. – website designer (Germany)Lucille M. - French cell. (France)Daniel S. - Analyst ( Portugal)Black Pigeon – Media / Independant consultant ! Those pictures are only samples, of possible graphic design for this website in the future !","Worst case scenario – Polstrat will become the most reliable/trustworthy database about “what internet users from your country think about your country government/laws etc.Best case scenario – The beginning of a revolution for the improvement of world democracy.The results of Polstrat project campaign will show in practice, how many  people, from all over the world, are able to unite in action and do more than only complain about any given situation. This idea might be our best chance, our last shot, to organize and effectively oppose corrupted system based on lies and manipulation. If you like this idea, this project, this world-scale operation to improve democracy in our countries to improve the world - help us. If you not able to donate, then spread the word among your friends. Let people know that there is a potential idea/a way to fix the system. All help is welcome: direct or indirect. The organization of this project is planned meticulously; we are trying to be prepared for every possible scenario. If this project will fail on international Kickstarter, we will try on another crowdfunding campaign in a more national arena ( Germany/France etc).This website will be created and will be setup as soon possible; it’s just a matter of time. Shutting down this project or stopping it otherwise will be very difficult, due to our closely-knit network of team members who are involved into this project.  Either way,  this project will be finished and released - one way or another.",https://www.kickstarter.com/projects/540068337/polstrat-stage-i?ref=discovery_category_newest,540068337/polstrat-stage-i,"Polstrat, while possessing a working name, reflects main goal of providing the world an opportunity for people to make real changes in their government and society, through the internet.We want to be sure we create tools that will generate more candidates for positions in governments, rather than supporting hand picked established career politicians. We want to be sure politicians will hear the people by making people decide who, how and what is to be a politician. A clear way to define facts and to prevent one narrative dominate over others. Are you for a bumpy ride? We certainly are.Polstrat Stage I kickstarter campaign, is a second attempt from the ""POLSTRAT - Take Back your democracy"" campaign, with full description available here:https://www.kickstarter.com/projects/540068337/polstrat-take-back-your-democracy?token=67d8e779Since we failed to collect all necessary funds with first campaign, we decided to divide funding into several stages, after each stage we will show progress of our work to people and whether it is necessary for more crowdfunding or the project gained sustainability.Planned progress looks as follows and may take less or different steps for completion:I. Mass Recruitment of additional crew and finalisation of the Polstrat website prototype development.II. Website prototype test with ""International"" section as default, we will try to locate security holes, and obtain user feedback for optimisation of the website functionality and design.III.

ATTENTION !We are looking forprogrammers, lawyers and National Admins. People who share our concerns about situation around the world, problems with democracy, economy, people with will to do something, to contribute, and with free time to spare.We are speciallylooking for people who would bewillingto devotethemselves to work over this project, and not only. In the future weplan to hire bestcontributors.Programmers - especially Ruby on rails developers | Front end Developers| Node js developers, BUT all are welcome.Lawyers - especially from countries: Germany, France, United Kingdom, Canada, USA, Italy, Sweden, Switzerland, Denmark, Holland, Belgium, Spain, Portugal, Poland, Czech Republlic, Hungary and ESPECIALLY Lawyers/Students of International Law.National Admins - Polstrat Ambassadors, organised people with good teamwork/social skills, from countries: France, United Kingdom, USA, Italy, Sweden, Switzerland, Denmark, Holland, Belgium, Spain, Portugal, Poland, Czech Republic, Australia3rd Party members, willing to contribute, animators, graphic designers, website designers, server technicians, consulting experts; among others.Professionals and students are welcome.Please, for all candidates willing to join and take part in this project - prepare a note mixed with CV, where in the note section you will write about reasons why you would like to participate in this project, with your personal view on world economy, situation in your country, especially politically, a short brief about what motivates you and, how well aware you are of world situation.Please, send all requests to following email: poliword4456@gmail.comTo join us please write to the email mentioned above.We thank you kindly for your cooperation!","Worst case scenario – Polstrat will become most reliable/trustworthy database about “what internet users from your country think about your country government/laws/happenings etc.Best case scenario – Beginning of improved planetary management with preservation of racial and ethnic diversity, control of population for preservation of the planetary resources and sustainable growth of world economies for further exploration of humans themselves and the  environment be it terrestrial or extraterrestrial.If you like this idea, this project, this world-scale operation to improve democracy, as first step, to improve the world, as intermediary step; - help us, don't expect from anybody else to do anything for you, do it by yourself. If you are not able to donate, then spread the word among your friends, give us a LIKE on Facebook community channel or subscribe to us on YouTube. Let people know that there is a way to fix this system. Every help is welcome, promote Polstrat or support directly. Help, if you care. The organisation of this project is planned meticulously; we are trying to be prepared for every possible scenario. If this project will fail on international Kickstarter, we will try another financing alternatives, although it will slow us down. The website will be created and will be setup as soon possible. Even if any key member will miss, die, disappear, get kidnapped or will suffer from ""accidental"" accidents there will be others who will continue the idea. Shutting down this project or stopping it otherwise will be very difficult, due to our closely-knit network of team members from all over the world who are involved into this project.Why do we pack all the countries into one project / “website” at this point? Few reasons, if project will fail in one country, it might succeed in another, also if project/website gets banned in one state, then might be pushed/supported from other. It's difficult to ban this type of project in the west, especially in countries that place freedom of speech and freedom of expression above all. It is obvious that if project will be trusted by more and more people, trusted way more than the national media or even government, the establishment or government will try to eliminate Polstrat from their ""national"" arena, discriminate us in any possible way and later probably some will start attacking our site directly in order to stop progress of giving too much power to the people. The more people are involved in the work of this project and its spreading the harder it will be to make it stop.Also another reason is popularity itself, this project might hardly gain popularity in some countries, but if it will gain popularity in neighbouring countries or simply around the world, good results will always find the way to spread without possibility for anyone to ban/censure/block progress. If one country won’t be able to verify this project/website as trustworthy because they have limited access to it or they heard too much negative  propaganda about it they will be able to check it by seeing other countries successes with it."

The past 5 years have been rough. I went through a really bad divorce and it caught me by surprise. I did a lot of reading and journaling to help me through the days. The most therapeutic was to find quotes that most help me through those dark and crazy days. On top of everything, I was let go from my company in May. It has been a blessing in disguise because my creative juices have been flowing and I started my company, WarmThoughts. I am raising funds to Kickstart my company, WarmThoughts. It is a line of motivational and inspirational quotes that are customized on a coffee sleeve. They will come in series and each quote is custom picked by me. I have already sought interest and have two meetings with prospective retail buyers. The funds donated will go to manufacturing Series 1, 2, 3 & 4. Each series will have 5 sets of quotes along with an option to purchase cups, lids, and other customized pieces from my WarmThoughts line. Also, there will be a website, shopwarmthoughts.com along with a photo shot and pictures to get ready for the meetings and for social media.Every sleeve that will be sold I will donate 5 cents to charities that support combating depression and help youth and adults journal and get through their darkest days. I have been lucky and I want to share my success and WarmThoughts with the world.Any help would be appreciated and thank you so much.

Now it's time for us to give our neighborhood a tea bar as fresh and free spirited as the folks who have made this place their home.You've watched the trends - it started with fine wine.  Then coffee got a closer look.  Then waters, craft beers and spices flooded the market. Now it's time for something you really love - tea.  The momentum is huge!TEA+ART will house hand-crafted TEAinTEXAS teas surrounded by fantastic art installations and vessels for a unique cuppa every time. Monthly shows will showcase student artists, weavers, pottery tournaments, french antiques and native jewelry at 613 1/3 19th St. [Behind Heights Glass]WHY DO IT?Tea drinkers have limited choices in restaurants: a box of tea bags on top of the coffee machine or an offering ofthe same brand you have at home. There’s no magic; there’s no joy. In exchange for our cash, we are presented with a cup of not-quite-hot-enough water with a bag hidden somewhere in the cloudy depths. Where did tea go so wrong?! THE TEAUnfortunately, most tea in HOUSTON is low grade black tea:  the ""dust"" from broken tea leavesto give a quick drink, losingmost of its essential oils. TEAinTEXAS has chosen full-leaf teas that are produced using 'orthodox' production, meaning the leaves are handled with great care so that, by the time they arrive in your cup, all their flavor andaroma potential been kept intact. We partner with herb farmers to blend natural fruits and herbs into each brew.This is where it gets interesting, as each tea requires different brewing specs. So while one black tea steeps for around 3 minutes with boiling water, a green might be best with 150 deg water brewed for only a minute. Let our tea baristas make a proper cup for youin our casual and inspiring warehouse gallery.WHERE YOU COME INLet's talk shop.We are hosting this campaign to raise money for the equipment and lighting we'll need to make amazing drinks for our neighborhood.

It might not sound like much, but it adds up to a scary amount - $17,000 to be exact.So we are asking for your support to get TEA+ART up and running on the best street in Houston; wherecultures, ideas, and neighborhood zest collide.$17,000 will get us our standard equipment, but if we raise more than our funding goal, we will be able to buy even better gear.$23,000 will get us a tea latte machine and Curtis brewer instead of a basic Bunn we have budgeted for. $27,000 will get us the first FUDI tea bagging machine in the city - to create silk sachets like the pros on the west coast.

We have created a process that works, and we are going to show you how you or someone you love can live a life that attracts an abundance of romance.We are creating content that is visually stimulating, culturally informative, entertaining and gives singles the tools to have fulfilling love lives, all while implementing the pillars we use to teach others how to become magnetic of love and sustain relationships.Our content is based in the most romantic settings around the world, making one episode each week that explains how different cultures demonstrate love in different ways and 2 other episodes that focus on becoming magnetic. We’ve found a videographer to join us so that our meaningful content can be the highest of quality. Creating excellent content costs and that’s why we need your help!Our content dives into our pillars as we teach style, communication, self-love, and how to host others so that those who watch can implement the tools provided to create and build long-lasting connections.These are the skills that are typically gained at home through the developmental years, but for many, they are not. Men are especially dis-fortuned in this aspect as we have transitioned from role-based relationships where women typically took care of most duties in the home to soulmate relationships and partnerships where women choose partners, and men without home skills can be seen as less desirable.This is a big problem because it leaves many singles all over the WORLD in a frustrating place where they don't understand what they are doing wrong and eventually may become discouraged by the idea of love or are forced to settle. The transition from role-based relationships to soul companion-type relationships, while the transition is beneficial for all, it makes dating much more difficult for many. Before, not pursuing marriage wasn’t much an option due to societal pressures and the chances were that you’d marry someone you grew up near, but now, we date much farther than the few blocks we grew up on, and dating is heavily focused on connecting lifestyles vs. family names.Why is this important today?There has never been an easier time to build connections between compatible singles than we see today. As we have the ability now to connect with thousands of people every day on our screens, there's essentially a 24-hour lounge for singles in our pocket!While that’s great, the problem is that more than ever do we see the lack of long-lasting connections and it’s not because people don’t want to connect.The root cause of the disconnect is simply that many singles don’t know how to utilize the tools around them to meet compatible singles that they could build real connections with.Our society has shifted from companionate marriages to soul-mate partnerships. We now get to go on this epic journey to find love, our better-half, and the person that we choose to do life with; thus creating what can be better described as, life-partnerships.Dating ineffectively has a cost, and if dating in the modern age isn’t taken seriously it can lead to a life where an individual never meets a soulmate or someone they are compatible with.Dating has CHANGED & the way we look at dating also has to CHANGE. Our project bridges the gap for those who weren't fortunate enough to obtain the skills they need to be an eligible bachelor/bachelorette and assists frustrated singles to go from stagnant dating to dating effectively.What about dating has changed?Almost all of it, including that because we now can date anyone practically anywhere, dating is much more competitive... unfortunately!As we are getting married later, the delays in marriage give young adults in their twenties a decade that once didn’t exist to explore what they want and how they want to live their life. This can serve as an advantage for many as studies have shown those who marry after 25 are less likely to divorce. However, this also can serve as a disadvantage for many who were not given the tools to maintain themselves as eligible in the dating world. Role-based relationships helped many because getting married young took off the pressure to maintain self-care while getting married later creates self-care as a newer lifestyle requirement, and one we haven’t seen before.While we chase careers and monetary success in western society, there is still an effort that has to be put into one's self to attract love from within and outside oneself, as well as the work that’s required to satisfy and sustain romantic and emotional needs.Who does this affect?This affects everyone, even those in relationships. As we strive for Instagrammable lives, who is to say that we don’t look at our personal lives with the same desire of rose-colored filters. Our work can help everyone live a more rose-colored life, but in particular, we assist singles.Becoming a better lover is possible, it requires self-love, learning new skills, and exploration of oneself. & It’s easier than it sounds! Marginal improvements make ripples for the waves of development. :)Is it scary?- Yes.Is it worth it?- Absolutely.This affects all singles, even the older singles who have been married before and join the new dating scene after a divorce! Dating in the modern times is easy if it’s done correctly, otherwise, it can be an endless loop of ghosting and “professional time wasters.”Who is an eligible bachelor/bachelorette/ non-binary dater?An eligible bachelor/ bachelorette/ non-binary dater is an individual who lives life in their best light by constantly putting their best foot forward. This person treats others well and is one who can communicate their desires and needs fluidly while practicing compassion, as they enthusiastically pursue the life of their dreams. This is someone who connects easily with others, attracts others easily to themselves, and consistently practices the tools needed to sustain relationships.The lifestyle difference between the eligible single and non-eligible single is the mental attitude towards life. Those who let life happen to them, get passed by in the world of dating, those who enjoy life, they experience an abundance of love.What makes this type of individual more attractive & magnetic of others?In the same way that misery loves company, so does joy! Many studies show that we as humans experience the most happiness when we have close connections, that we crave connection, and that we all look for a partner who is deemed as “eligible.” We’ve all experienced meeting another whose smile or inner joy radiates onto ourselves, that’s a skill that can be learned and taught, and a mindset that radiates joy is possible.We each have the ability to live inspired and date exceptionally. You, or someone you love that has been previously frustrated while dating, can become magnetic of love and live a life that is both vivacious and filled with an abundance of love.","Risk assessment has been a priority as we have laid our livelihoods on the line for the completion of this project.

https://www.kickstarter.com/projects/1332236260/dream-home-project?ref=discovery_category_newest,1332236260/dream-home-project,"Everyone has dreamed of that perfect home. Whether it's with an indoor pool, a 3 car garage, or an amazing loft, everyone has day dreamed of the perfect pad. However, not everyone can put their ideas down on paper, let alone design a realistic home. That's where I come in.IntroHi, my name is Micah Martin and I am currently an undergrad at Virginia Tech's school of Architecture + Design. I have been studying architecture for the past 2 years and absolutely love it! Ever since I was a little kid, I knew that when I grew up I would design buildings. On any given school day you could find sketches and doodles all over my class papers. Most of these sketches were floor plans of new ideas I had for my future house. In fact, it has never stopped because I am always coming up with better ideas. BackgroundThe idea for this project started at the end of my first year of architecture. My parents had moved from New York to Richmond, VA and I knew the upcoming summer was going to be absolutely boring without my friends. So what was I to do for 3 months after work? Well, going back a few years, I downloaded the amazing game called Minecraft. This game houses a world of infinite blocks, and could only make an architect drool. All I saw was an amazing platform for designing houses left and right. And that is exactly what I did.Fast forward back to the beginning of summer. So I had all these houses built in Minecraft but no one to share them with. Then, I had the idea to start an instagram page over summer (2013) of all my minecraft houses just to keep me busy. So, everyday after work I would come home and build in minecraft, and upload photos. That instagram page is still updated to this day @minecraftarchitects. Here are some examples.So, I enjoyed designing homes and sharing them with people, and I slowly grew a small fan base, but I wanted something more. I wanted to start designing for other people than myself. Where Did You Get the Idea for the Dream Home Project?Well, I wanted to start designing homes for other people, and exercising the skill of having some guidelines, and translating that to a floor plan. Minecraft is great, but it doesn't translate well to the real world, due to the fact everything is a 1x1m block. And even so, I wasn't designing for other people. So the question began, ""Where could I get a bunch of people to give me certain restraints to design a home, and at the same time help them get started with their dream home?"" Kick starter was the answer, but the summer was over. I would have to wait until summer 2014, and it's about here!What is the Goal for Dream Home Project?The goal is to get people started with ideas for their dream home, that may one day become a reality. The floor plan will be drawn on an 8.5x11 sheet of paper and is meant to be a starter plan/idea, to get people started on their dreams and thinking of new possibilities. These drawings will in no way qualify someone to immediately build the house from information given on the floor plan, house drawing, or section views. However, the design will enable said person to walk into an architecture firm and have them design a home based off the floor plan if they find they really love the layout. If not that, they could have a firm tweak the design to their liking. All floor plans will NOT be perfectly dimensioned or drawn to scale, but will be drawn with scale in mind to correctly portray the design.The goal for this project is NOT to design your dream home in one try. It is to get you started with ideas for how that perfect home may one day fit together.How Will this Goal Be Accomplished?Every supporter receiving a reward will need to email me with a few things major things you want to see in the design. Because of the scope of the project and time required to design these floor plans I will have to limit everyone to FIVE major things you want in the design. You may email me as many as you want but I will choose five.You may ask, ""But Micah, aren't you supposed to be designing this house off everything I want? I should be able to give you an exhaustive list of everything I've dreamed of."" Answer: Of course, but remember this is meant to be a starting floor plan to get your ideas and dreams flowing. Having a maximum of 5 desired things will certainly point you in the right direction to one day figure out that perfect home.Example of things to mention: Number of floors, number of bathrooms, characteristics like a loft, pool...etc. Anything big enough to influence a rough floor plan.Example of things NOT to mention: French doors, L shaped couch, Wood framed windows...etc. Anything not big enough to influence a rough floor plan.Also, concerning the size of the house, I am assuming everyone will want something that's below 5000ft². Let's just try to keep the size reasonable. Note: I won't limit the size you want, but keep in mind that the bigger it gets, the less detailed it will be.The goal will be accomplished by sketching and drawing floor plans, house drawings, and section views on 8.5x11 paper enabling the viewer to understand the layout of the house. These drawings will either be emailed or shipped depending on the award. You can find examples of rewards at the ksdreamhomeproject instagram in order to get a better understanding of what you'll be receiving. There's a link to that page in the BONUS section below, and I'll also show a few examples here. (The examples below do not correspond to one another.)(The last 2 rewards give the supporter 2 different ideas for the house. It's not just a copy of the same design, it's 2 different designs.)BONUSAll throughout the project I will be uploading selected photos of completed work to instagram. The account will be @ksdreamhomeproject. This way people can follow the project's progress, and see what other designs I'm coming up with. Also, be sure to follow my instagram @minecraftarchitects.","There are not many possible risks and challenges that could come up during this project. This project is mainly resting on my available time to work on it. I have tried hard to limit the quantities of rewards with the available time I will have over the summer so that the project will be easily accomplished by the end of August. However, one thing that does come to mind is the possible loss of a scanner. This would delay email deliveries and instagram updates, but only until I would buy a new scanner. Which of course would be immediately.",https://www.kickstarter.com/projects/1332236260/rulers-and-principalities?ref=discovery_category_newest,1332236260/rulers-and-principalities,"""I can tell you everything you need to know in one word, story."" -Hans ZimmerZimmer is 100% right, if you have story you have everything, and for over a year I have been weaving together a frightening emotional story that revolves around the moments immediately following the rapture. The focus of the short film centers on the ""Rulers and Principalities"" of the spiritual realm mentioned in the Bible, specifically in Ephesians 6:12.The film will run a little over 10 minutes, unfolding an emotional story of humans and their interaction with the 'Rulers and Principalities' of this world. I believe most Christians have forgotten or are unaware of our interaction with spiritual forces and I am excited to make a short film that brings what's mentioned in Eph 6:12 to light in a cinematic way.The last five years I have been rigorously studying Architecture at Virginia Tech's nationally 3rd ranked program. During which I studied many areas of design and recently floated back to film. My 'Christmas Story' moment as a kid was when I got my first video camera and ever since I have been filming anything I can, always wanting to visually entice people.As I've been organizing the movie's story board and working through all the details, I'm beginning to see why my favorite design passions fell into film making and architecture. Making a quality movie is very similar to producing an architectural drawing because of the planning, careful attention to detail, and time required to edit and re-edit so that you present the very best piece of work possible. Both mediums must visually entice people, and the success hinges on a strong creative mind that can turn a vision into a reality.I am excited to shoot and share this short story/film with people because of how hard I've worked to formulate this unique story-line. Yet, it will only happen with your support!Fun Fact: I went to the same high school as Rod Serling (the creator of the Twilight Zone) in Binghamton, NY which had a strong emphasis on visual arts.Movie expenses include but are not limited to; equipment, props, costumes, lighting, film locations, transportation.Poster printingprice has been quoted by the company I'll be partnering with.The desktop background and posters were designed by myself and the posters will be printed by a local printing company in Blacksburg. I limited the number of rewards with posters to 100 to keep myself from getting overwhelmed with shipping but will reconsider printing more depending on the project's success.Both movie posters give a nod to thematic elements of the film without giving away any of the plot.The size of 18""x 24"" was chosen as a standard size that would fit normal frames, and by using this size we can double up for each print which allows people to get 2 for the price of 1! Also, poster rewards will arrive sooner than the delivery of the movie. (Refer to timeline above)Note: The posters are not framed when delivered, I was just thinking ahead for you guys because custom framing is expensive!Note: Pledges receiving posters are getting one of each, The Garden and The Residence. For instance you may not request two of The Garden.Low Res SamplesThank you for even considering supporting this project! One great way for everyone to help is to share this project on Facebook with all your friends and family! Please help this project become a reality in whatever way you can!","Challenges ahead mainly boil down to financial instances which is why I placed a buffer in the budget to allow for unexpected expenses. However, even if financial problems occur beyond the budget's allowance they will be minimal and easily capable to handle out of pocket. Completing the project on time (early April) is the main challenge which is why I set the project length to June 2018, to allow for any problems that occur. But, the real goal for myself is to be completely done by April 2018.The challenge on the forefront of my mind is finding a couple people who will star in the film and understand my vision. Luckily, I work with college students at Virginia Tech and know plenty of great people allowing me to hand pick perfect fits for the film's roles.Lastly, shipping will be a small hassle which is why I limited the rewards to 100 as previously mentioned. I will ship those out immediately once I have the posters, shipping tubes, and postage."
