https://www.kickstarter.com/projects/888253265/a-new-hope-farm?ref=discovery_category_newest,888253265/a-new-hope-farm,"Our goal is to create a sustainable farm in Northwestern Connecticut. The main focus of the farm will be the production of fruits and vegetables from herbaceous perennials, shrubs, and trees. Some examples we have experience with are Lovage, Sorrel, Asparagus, Strawberries, Blueberries, Apples, Pears, and Paw paws. We will also grow some common staple crops such as corn, onions, and potatoes using no-till and sustainable methods. A small amount of livestock such as goats, chickens or ducks, and bees will be kept on the farm to increase biodiversity, produce sustainable resources, and aid in farm maintenance and pest control. A section of the farm will also be used for experimenting with new growing techniques and crops. The farm itself will be used as a meeting place for the community and a center for teaching about farming and ecological stewardship.Our first task is to find land to use as a location for the farm. We have looked at several options that will meet our need and a decision will be made depending on the level of funding we receive. After a location is picked, a farming plan based on the location and surrounding ecosystems will be drawn up. The farm plan will use the microclimates and the ecosystems on the property to harvest natural resources and to make sure plants and animals are in a healthy environment.After our plan is mapped out we will purchase seeds, stock plants, and livestock with our remaining funds. Most of the this money will be used towards livestock as we already have a variety of stock plants at various locations to propagate as well as seeds we save from annual crops.","Farming is known to be tough and challenging work. Weather, pests, and diseases can cripple a harvest with little or no warning. One way we can over come these problems is to grow the right plant in the right place. Blueberries love acidic soil, so if they are planted in neutral to alkiline soil they will grow poorly and be suseptable to pest and diseases. By planting the right plant in the right place, pest and diseaes problems will be minimised. Another safty net is diversification. Instead of having a monoculture crop like traditional farms, we will have a variety of fruit and vegetables to harvest, so if one crop does poorly in one season there will still be several other crops that can be harvested and sold. Lastly, we are determined. we have experienced set backs and failures in the past. These failures have served as learning experiences and have helped us grow our skills.

Or you can customize a pen for your own use or to add to your own personal collection. Whatever reason you might have, I hope you'll consider backing this campaign!Two Goals For This CampaignThe first goal is to raise the money necessary to purchase all of the materials needed to make and ship the backer rewards. The second goal is to be able to use this campaign for some market research.  There are dozens of potential combinations of pen styles, hardware colors and wood species to choose from in this campaign.  I'm hoping to be able to see which combinations are most popular and then add them to the line-up of pens I already sell.  By doing this it will also help me to keep costs down because I won't have to carry as much inventory because each pen will be exactly what someone wants. About the PensEach pen is handmade and goes through a 28 step finishing process that accentuates the grain of the wood, gives it depth and results in a high gloss finish that is incredibly smooth and durable.I have several styles of pens for you to choose from: twist, click, bolt action, rollerball and fountain.All of the twist, click and bolt action pens use Parker style ink cartridges. Replacement ink refill cartridges can be found at any office supply store. There is a wide variety of ink colors and tip sizes (fine, medium, etc.) available.The fountain pens will come with one ink cartridge and one siphon converter for use with your own bottled ink.About the WoodMuch of the wood that is used comes from small pieces of ""drops"" or scraps or even trees that came down in a storm.  I love being able to take something that would have been tossed in a fire or in a landfill and making it into a writing instrument that will be admired and used for years to come.Since the pens are made from wood there will naturally be some variation in the grain and the color. This is especially true with the spalted maple and curly walnut. Walnut, for example, can vary from medium to dark brown to sometimes almost black.Also remember that wood can be damaged - if you drop your pen there is a chance it will dent the wood. This is unfortunate but that is the nature of wood.Here are the Wood Options You Can Choose From: Here are the Pen Styles (Backer Rewards) You Can Choose From: ","The risks for this campaign are minimal.  I have multiple suppliers for the components and lots of wood on hand.  The main risk would be if the campaign really takes off and there are lots of backers.  If that happens the fulfillment time may need to get bumped out.  I will make and ship the rewards in the order that they were backed - so the sooner you back this campaign the sooner you will get your pen.  I will send updates after the end of the campaign so you'll know where I'm at in the process of fulfilling the rewards.I've been making pens for years so there is no learning curve and my process for making the pens is almost second nature.There are a few things you can do to help ensure that you receive your reward in a timely manner:1. Please be sure you have a valid email that you check regularly listed on Kickstarter. I'll be sending a survey to that email address so that you can make your selections of wood species and plating color. The longer it takes for you to respond to the survey, the longer it will take to get your item(s) ready for you.2. Please be sure your address in the survey is correct. I will cut and paste your address exactly as it's listed in the survey.3. Please be sure that your credit card information is up to date on Kickstarter. If it's not up to date, then your backing pledge will be declined at the end of the campaign and Kickstarter will drop you as a backer.You can also check us out on Etsy:  https://www.etsy.com/shop/FlemingFamilyDesigns?ref=hdr_shop_menu",https://www.kickstarter.com/projects/314771592/wood-with-a-story-handcrafted-pens-from-bethlehem?ref=discovery_category_newest,314771592/wood-with-a-story-handcrafted-pens-from-bethlehem,"Thanks for taking the time to check out my campaign!This campaign offers you the opportunity to own a piece of ancient history! Everyone loves wood with a story and if this wood could talk it would no doubt have some amazing stories.The wood used for the items in this campaign are shipped direct from Bethlehem to my shop.  These olive trees have been producing olives since the time of the Romans.  These trees have a rich history in both the religious and cultural life of the Middle East.  The olive tree or olive branch has a long history of being a symbol of peace.  Olive branches were formed into wreaths and used during the ancient Olympic games.  Olive oil was used as an ointment for the athletes in the Olympic games.  The oil was used as a fuel for lamps in the ancient Middle East and of course olive oil is  still used in cooking today.The wood used for this campaign was harvested from the olive trees during the normal, annual pruning process when non-producing branches are removed so that new growth can take place on the tree.  This pruning is what keeps the olive tree healthy and productive.  No tree was damaged or destroyed in the process of harvesting the wood for this campaign.I love cutting and turning Olive wood because it gives off a slightly spicy smell.  It's also enjoyable to see the grain patterns of the wood.  Typically Olive wood has a light tan to almost yellowish look with dark streaks of brown.  Quite often the dark streaks will swirl around also.  Take a look at the pictures of the items in this campaign and you can see the wide variety of grain patterns.Each pen is handmade and goes through a 28 step finishing process that accentuates the grain of the wood, gives it depth and results in a high gloss finish that is incredibly smooth and durable.

The project's name is a play on Jaco Pastorious' group featuring John McLaughlin and Tony Williams, a group that was composed of musical icons in the jazz and fusion music world. The resulting impact the Trio of Doom has had on me has called me to assemble a group of the best jazz and fusion players I have access to and I think you will be quite impressed with the vicious bite of the Quartet of Jazz Death. The project features the compositional debut of 10 brand new songs that I have written featuring myself on electric bass, Steve Langemo on guitar, Shawn Hanlon on keyboards, and Stefan Flores on drum set. We are going to record at one of the best studios in Colorado at Denver's own Colorado Sound Studios on July 27th, 2014.

This Kickstarter project isdesigned to help me progress my business into a more commercial market.I started Diffydolls around three years ago as a hobby whichprimarily sold handmade cards of a ‘colourful’ nature to friends and family. Withthe gaining popularity of this and the amount of positive feedback I received,I decided to start an Etsy shop. This again grew very popular within a shortamount of time, and, with the help of a few card designs going viral, I wassoon posting cards all around the world with demand quickly growing beyond my capabilityto supply.Should the full amount be raised by Kickstarter I will use themoney to stream line the business manufacturing process as-well as expandingthe Diffydolls product range.At the moment, all cards are designed, hand cut, printed andassembled by me and this is obviously very time consuming. I am wanting tostreamline the manufacturing process by having them professionally printed andpackaged to keep up with the increase in product demand. Leaving only thedesign down to myself. This leaves more time to develop designs for incorporationinto other products such as tote bags, wrapping paper, baby wear, mugs,notebooks, t-shirts and cushions just to name a few.Should the total money raised exceed the required amount,this would be put towards investing in professional marketing as-well asdeveloping the Diffydolls website.The research for business expansion has already beencompleted, with a printing, packaging and distribution resource found.As Diffydolls has been selling popular card designs over thelast three years, these will continue to be sold as-well as any new designsdeveloped in the coming months.Therefore, I foresee greeting card deliveries being made bythe end of October and garments etc. being made by the end of November due to alonger time frame required for manufacturing.","Although orders can never be guaranteed for any business in any industry, the sales in which Diffydolls has been receiving in the previous months proves that the product design and product quality will continue to sell at an increasing rate.In order to assure that sales do continue to increase, I plan on contacting businesses within the UK & USA with the possibility of them becoming permanent Diffydolls stockists. Hopefully this combined with added internet traffic will result in a large increase in business sales.",https://www.kickstarter.com/projects/1607953894/diffydolls-studio-alternative-greeting-cards-and-p?ref=discovery_category_newest,1607953894/diffydolls-studio-alternative-greeting-cards-and-p,"We at diffydolls need your help. We design greeting cards and posters for those with a sense of humour. We do not take ourselves seriously and you shouldn't either. I'm not going to lie, a lot of our work is based around toilet humour, because let's face it who doesn't find farts funny?The rest is mainly food related...because who doesn't like cake?Anyway, back to this important work lark. Have a look at our business ideas and then please pledge because I need your money!The money raised through the Kickstarter will allow me to have my stock professionally printed. I have sourced my printing firm and have everything in place ready to GO GO GO!I have had an excellent response to my designs online (which I sell through a third party). I have chosen my top 20 best sellers for the first print run which will be printed onto 300gsm white card and come packaged with a coordinating kraft envelope. The postcards will also be printed onto 300gsm card.The posters will be printed onto A4 250gsm coated paper. Again, I have chosen my most popular 20 designs.","The risks are that I am not as funny as I think I am. Only kidding, I know I am hilarious!I have confidence in my designs as they are tried and tested - I have been selling them online for a year and know that there is a demand. The reason I need help from the Kickstarter project is that the royalties that I am paid from selling through a 3rd party, do not allow me to save the amount I require within a reasonable time frame. My printing firm are a local company which I have previously used and know that their products are of high quality. As a precaution I have another company on standby should they let me down."

With that in mind, I began work on what I call the ultimate character development guide. It will contain 850 (or more) questions to help you look at your characters from every possible angle, along with an entire paragraph dedicated to get your mind turning as you contemplate your answers.These questions aren't meant to all be answered, but rather to get you thinking about character details you never imagined before, and watch them have an impact on your story.What It NeedsThe purpose of this campaign is to get this writing resource into your hands as quickly as possible. To do that, I need to purchase an ISBN number, I need to get an editor to peruse the work for mistakes, and I need to hire a professional to design the cover. And the more this project makes, the quicker I'll be able to finish it, as I'll be able to take more time away from my day job and dedicate it to this endeavor.Why You Should Support ItNo one has the time to sit down and establish the answers to a little less than one-thousand questions for every character in their novel or short story. That's not the point of this project. The point is to be a resource for creativity, to get you thinking about possibilities you might have never imagined before, and, especially, the enriching impact that they can have on your story.Sample QuestionChoosing a name is an essential step in the development of your character. A good name can come to embody everything your character is and represents. You can’t hear the names Indiana Jones, James Bond, or Darth Vader without immediately picturing the characters, their attributes, and what they stand for.Sometimes choosing a name can be arbitrary. In Avatar, there’s no indication that the name Jake Sully has any profound significance.Sometimes the name itself has significance. In The Hunger Games, Peeta’s name, as well as that of his country Panem, were chosen because of their connections to the themes of food and bread.Sometimes a character’s name is representative of his nationality or the time period he lives in. In Captain America: The First Avenger, Schmidt’s name is indicative of the fact that he is a German scientist. In The Lord of the Rings, Gandalf’s name is a reminder of the fantasy setting he lives in.Sometimes a character’s name is chosen specifically because of his attributes. In Toy Story, Woody and Buzz have names directly related to the types of action figures they are. In Legends of Tomorrow, Rip Hunter’s name is a very tongue-in-cheek reference to his multi-dimensional profession as a hunter of rips in the space-time continuum.","The questions themselves have already been written, along with paragraphs and examples for a great number of them. The biggest risk is that the project will not make enough to allow me to take a sabbatical from my day job, in which case, the struggles of daily life could threaten to push the release date back a month or so. Other than that, there isn't really much that could go wrong.",https://www.kickstarter.com/projects/qjmartin/if-so-why-850-questions-for-character-development?ref=discovery_category_newest,qjmartin/if-so-why-850-questions-for-character-development,"What It IsWhen I contemplated what I had to offer to the writing community, I realized that the answer was persistence and an eye for detail.

It will contain 850 (or more) questions to help you look at your characters from every possible angle, along with an entire paragraph dedicated to get your mind turning as you contemplate your answers.These questions aren't meant to all be answered, but rather to get you thinking about character details you never imagined before, and watch them have an impact on your story.What It NeedsThe purpose of this campaign is to get this writing resource into your hands as quickly as possible. To do that, I need to purchase an ISBN number, I need to get an editor to peruse the work for mistakes, and I need to hire a professional to design the cover. And the more this project makes, the quicker I'll be able to finish it, as I'll be able to take more time away from my day job and dedicate it to this endeavor.Why You Should Support ItNo one has the time to sit down and establish the answers to a little less than one-thousand questions for every character in their novel or short story. That's not the point of this project. The point is to be a resource for creativity, to get you thinking about possibilities you might have never imagined before, and, especially, the enriching impact that they can have on your story.Sample QuestionChoosing a name is an essential step in the development of your character. A good name can come to embody everything your character is and represents. You can’t hear the names Indiana Jones, James Bond, or Darth Vader without immediately picturing the characters, their attributes, and what they stand for.Sometimes choosing a name can be arbitrary. In Avatar, there’s no indication that the name Jake Sully has any profound significance.Sometimes the name itself has significance. In The Hunger Games, Peeta’s name, as well as that of his country Panem, were chosen because of their connections to the themes of food and bread.Sometimes a character’s name is representative of his nationality or the time period he lives in. In Captain America: The First Avenger, Schmidt’s name is indicative of the fact that he is a German scientist. In The Lord of the Rings, Gandalf’s name is a reminder of the fantasy setting he lives in.Sometimes a character’s name is chosen specifically because of his attributes. In Toy Story, Woody and Buzz have names directly related to the types of action figures they are. In Legends of Tomorrow, Rip Hunter’s name is a very tongue-in-cheek reference to his multi-dimensional profession as a hunter of rips in the space-time continuum.","There are almost no risks associated with this project. I already have it 3/4 written. It won't take long to finish, and KDP is easy enough to use to make paperbacks. I suppose I could get run over by a car. That would be about the extent of possible risks."

All supporters (even those giving less than $22) will have access to the campaign's updates where I will be making posts on the progress of the book's production. Any money you give to this Kickstarter campaign will help me raise the funds I need to print my book.Kickstarter is all or nothing. We'll need about 300 people to pre-order the book in order to reach our goal of $7,500. That's a lot of people! So if you have any family or friends that you feel would be interested in the Amazing Scriptures please let them know about this project. I could really use some help spreading the word.The Amazing Scriptures are exciting adventure books that retell the stories of the Book of Mormon using comics and mazes. The first book, tentatively titled The Missing Map, follows Laman as he attempts to procure the Brass Plates.The Amazing Scriptures is not like any maze you’ve ever played! In a typical maze book each page is a separate maze with its own start and finish, but one book of the Amazing Scriptures is one maze. What!? Picture a maze so big that it had to be chopped up into many pieces in order to fit into a book.Each page is interconnected and you won’t simply move sequentially from page to page. There might be a locked door on page 1 that takes you to page 2, but the key to that door might be on page 3. To make matters worse you might find that you’ll need to trade for that key, and the item required? It’s on page 5.Everyone knows the basic rules of mazes: Follow the path, and when you reach a dead end, start over. The Amazing Scriptures expounds on this simple formula by adding a game system inspired by tabletop role-playing games and video games.A great story makes an adventure truly epic! And the mazes of the Amazing Scriptures come to life with a comic style narrative. Comic segments accompany the quests and key events of the maze adding character to the adventure.The Amazing Scriptures Book 1: The Missing Map starts out with Nephi and his brothers returning to Jerusalem on a mission to retrieve the Brass Plates from Laban. They cast lots and it's decided that Laman will be the first to go into Jerusalem after the plates.Laman faces many challenges as he makes his way to the house of Laban, like helping an old woman make a potion, building a rope ladder, returning overdue books, and even escaping the evil clutches of a bounty hunter who's out to get him.I’m asking for help to raise the funds I need to print Book 1. This is how I’ll be spending the $7,500 raised from this Kickstarter campaign:The Amazing Scriptures will have my full attention. Here's my rough timeline:March: Kickstarter and spreading the wordApril - July: Finishing the interior artwork and coverAugust: Preparing the book for printingSeptember - October: Printing the bookNovember: Packing and shipping out booksDecember: DeliveryI'm Norman Shurtliff. I have drawn comics and mazes for a long time, but I've always seen it as a hobby. Then I met my wife who challenged me to pursue my dreams, so I left the Pulp and Paper Industry and we moved to Salt Lake City to attend the Art Institute. After art school I was faced with trying to figure out how I wanted to use my art, how I wanted to tell my stories and where I would fit in this new industry. Those questions along with a deep desire to create something kids could enjoy on Sundays lead me to create the Amazing Scriptures.You can find me on your favorite Social Media sites where I post art and updates about all of my projects.Facebook:https://www.facebook.com/squidmantisInstagram:https://www.instagram.com/squidmantisTwitter:https://twitter.com/squidmantisTumblr:http://squidmantis.tumblr.com","This is the first time I've taken on a project like this where I see it through from start to finish and there is bound to be some challenges that I don't foresee. It's also the first time I've made an order for hundreds of books.This is the only project I'm working on right now, so I am able to devote all my time to it. Giving this project all my attention will certainly overcome many of the issues with getting it finished in a timely manner. I feel like I've allotted myself an adequate amount of time so that you don't have to worry about delays.I'm working with a really great printer that has been a big help in planning out how this book will be on paper. I have no doubt that they'll make an amazing book for you to enjoy. I've never worked with a printer though, so I'm not exactly sure how long the proofing and printing stages will take. But they are quick responders so I think anything on their end will happen swiftly.I know that backing a Kickstarter, and especially one from a first timer, requires a lot of faith on your part. I take that very seriously. And I take my responsibility to deliver on my promises very seriously. I plan on being very transparent as things move forward.

For digital backers, add $2 to your pledge and you'll get a pog themed digital wallpaper.Hi, I'm Norman Shurtliff. I'm an illustrator and comic artist. One of my favorite things to collect at comic conventions is mini comics. This year I planned to release two of my own at my local comic festival, but due to ""you know what"" that event was cancelled. I'm now hoping to send these books out into the world on the wings of Kickstarter.Both comics are ideas I've been developing for years. Selling them at the comic festival was meant to be a sort of test to see how they'd be received by the real world, hence their titles Existential and Gotta Start Somewhere. They're both short books, but I think they're each dense with content.I planned to take 30 copies of each book to the comic festival. If I can sell that many comics through this campaign that would be incredible!Skull Cat is a fantasy story about a cat who works as the groundskeeper of a mysterious castle. Gotta Start Somewhere includes a short story in which the mystery of the castle is beginning to unfold and it seems like the clues lie in a collection of comics kept deep within the castle dungeons. Skull Cat will soon find that his destiny is tied to the fate of a ghost, the legend of a fallen hero, and the evils that sleep somewhere inside the castle.Skull Cat is part of a bigger world that I'd like to create someday. Gotta Start Somewhere is formatted a bit like a concept pitch for that world. It includes a 10 page short story, 3 faux covers, 1 map, and 2 more very short stories. Every epic story's gotta start somewhere, right?This comic is 7"" x 9"" with 16 full-color interior pages.Floppy softcover comic book.Way back in 2007, I started a comic strip called Norman's Day At Work to help me explain what I did at my new job in a pulp mill. It was meant to be a journal comic, but quickly spiraled out of control. The story has sort of followed me along ever since- even though I haven't necessarily kept drawing it all these years- evolving as my own life changed. Now I'm married, have kids, moved to a different country and that not-so-real journal comic has become The Soulmate Chronicles.I've always drawn these comic strips for my own enjoyment. In my own mind it's the Canadian version of Dragon Ball, but anyone else probably won't see that connection. Instead it seems more like a Calvin and Hobbes strip, only the imaginations are very real and very bonkers.This is the first time I've printed any of my strips since 2008. This book is set up like a small collection with both new and old comic strips. It contains a 7 page metaphor about having a baby and a 6 page battle against a virus-powered villain. Creating each of these stories helped me cope with change during difficult times. It's a little scary putting such personal stories out into the world- even if they aren't entirely based on reality.This comic is 7.5"" x 9.5"" with 32 black and white interior pages.Floppy softcover comic book.The books are finished and ready for the printer. All that's left for me to do is tell the printer how many books to print.Skull Cat Gotta Start Somewhere will be 7"" x 9"" with 16 full-color interior pages.The Existential Soulmate Chronicles will be 7.5"" x 9.5"" with 32 black and white interior pages.Both are floppy softcover comic books.","Just like any Kickstarter campaign there are risks and challenges associated with what I'm trying to accomplish. If this campaign funds successfully it will be my first successful campaign. Fulfillment can bring its own challenges, but these are stories that I love and I am committed to getting them into your hands.I've all ready got quotes from the printer. I've been printing through them for years. They create great products and have quick turn around times. They are located here in the USA, so I'll also receive the books pretty quick after they're printed. I'm giving myself an extra month after the campaign to make sure I'm all prepared for the shipping process."

I decided why not take something we love and turn it into something everyone else can enjoy as well! Seeing as everyone in my family are very much the gamer and nerd type. These past years have even become the era of the nerds if you will, with the gaming scene and comics exploding back into the box offices and your televisions.  So now taking two things we all love. I intend to make them a quality house hold item not just for looks but actual function. Bring a smile to everyone picking their favorite game or nerd culture inspired themes!",No doubt their come many risk when starting a home and family business.  We intend to give our all and improve our quality and keep our customer happy.  Taking feedback for our customer will be invaluable in the success of our product.  Hopefully the rewarded candles and the early product we make via this funding will give us a great opportunity to fine tune our product.,https://www.kickstarter.com/projects/298656769/nerdies-candle-company?ref=discovery_category_newest,298656769/nerdies-candle-company,"Nerdies Candles is an at home start up that is creating high quality scented soy candles that stimulate your sense of smell as well as fill you with nostalgia!

Tacos are the ultimate in handheld cuisine. If there is anything I have learned over my years working in foodservice, it's that you can put almost anything in a taco and people will eat it if the flavors work and the ingredients are of highest quality.That is my philosophy and the philosophy of Taco Revolution. Started as an extension of love for Mexican food, Taco Revolution takes the best of Tex/Mex and Mexican food and pairs it with the flavors of cuisine from around the world. Don't be surprised to see Vietnamese pork or kimchi in your taco. Our goal is to make Taco Revolution the most diversetaco stand you've ever seen.Taco Revolution cares about the ingredients we put in your food. That is why we will source many of our ingredients from local sources, including organic chicken, locally grown organic produce and handmade small-batch salsas and hot sauces made from fresh ingredients.We need this money to fund the startup costs of opening our stand at the Kutztown Fair this coming August. We must pay a registration fee and buy vendor's insurance. We have paid 25% of our fee for the space, enough to hold it for us, but we must raise enough to pay the rest of the registration fee by the time the event opens. Vendor insurance will cost a bit more than $100. The rest of the money will go towards equipment and signage.","This will be the first time we've taken Taco Revolution out to sell tacos. With loads of experience in foodservice, I'm sure we'll be successful. That being said, starting a business of this sort can be risky. So, there is a chance of failure. This is a calculated risk when investing in a project such as this.One potential issue could be food costs. While we're trying to get the best ingredients possible, we're also trying to make money. No matter how great the quality is, there's only so much people will pay for a taco at a local fair. Our goal is to find that perfect price point without sacrificing any quality. This is why we make all our own salsas and butcher as much of our own meat as possible. Since all of our employees share in the profit for this small venture, there are no time costs on labor. This means that if we can do as much prep as possible ourselves, we will save money.This is a brand new venture, so we're bound to make some mistakes along the way. Please bare with us as we experience these growing pains together.",https://www.kickstarter.com/projects/tacorevolution/taco-revolution-make-tacos-not-war?ref=discovery_category_newest,tacorevolution/taco-revolution-make-tacos-not-war,"Have you ever wondered what a taco would be like if it was made with fresh, local and organic food? Well, Taco Revolution wants to bring that concept to a fair or event near you.Owner and Head Chef Julia Zion has over 16 years of experience in foodservice and is finally branching out on her own to share her passion of tacos with the masses. She's been cooking since she was very young, starting out by helping with family dinners when she was three years old. She has always wanted to have her own restaurant. Taco Revolution is step one in the process necessary to fulfill her dream. No matter how small, or where she is set up, there are certain aspects to the industry of which she will never compromise.Taco Revolution stands by these aspects of the industry. Too many companies compromise by buying produce laced with chemical pesticides or get food shipped in from across the country. We will never compromise on anything that will lower the standards set by our owner, no matter what the cost. Everything at Taco Revolution is made by hand, every day, from the freshest ingredients we can find. That way, we can serve the best tacos possible.What do we make from scratch every day?Our MottoWhat does our motto, ""Make Tacos, Nor War,"" mean? It means that our revolution is peaceful. We are bringing a revolution of wonderful tacos to the masses. We are bringing a locally and ethically produced revolution that abhors violence and wants to encourage peace and bring delicious tacos to the masses.We need your help to make this concept a success. We are a very small revolution at this point, but we're looking to grow into one that can bring our message to many more places.We need your help to buy ecologically friendly, bio-degradable packaging. Bio-degradable packaging is about double the price per container than cheaper syrofoam. As a small startup, without your help, we may have trouble affording the ecologically friendly option. If we are successful in funding our campaign, we'll be able to start off earth friendly, lowering our trash output right from the beginning.Your help will also allow us to buy locally produced, humanely processed organic meats. While buying organic meats from local providers will be a little cheaper than buying them retail, it would be much cheaper still if we just gave up on our morals and bought meats processed in industrial factories under deplorable conditions. We want to stand up for our principles, and with your help we'll be able to do that. Your help will keep our initial costs down and allow us to keep prices competitive while still providing food from ethical sources.Finally, we need help with professional signage. The beautiful Taco Revolution logo needs to be seen at the forefront of our taco stand. Like our food, it needs to be big and bold to alert everyone to our presence. To be a success, we need to look like one. We need a large menu, advertisements, and we need shirts and buttons. A professional looking stand will bring in more people than a stand with nothing more than a menu written on paper. We need your help to get these things in a quality that can be reused so we can avoid having to waste paper printing out more menus in the future.Your donations go a long way to making Taco Revolution a success and help bring our message to Make Tacos, Not War to the masses. A donation of as little as $5 will help us meet our initial goal. Check out our rewards. Contribute as little or as much as you choose. No matter what, the revolution will go on, but your contributions will help us reach more and more of the masses every day.","There are many risks to creating and running a concept like Taco Revolution. Starting any business in food service is tough. Profit margins are small, making startup costs very important. Starting off strong will give us the head start we need to make us successful in the future.Our head chef, Julia Zion, has 16 years of experience in food service, doing everything from serving on a front line to cooking in a kitchen and managing a group of employees. Currently, she is working for Aramark at Kutztown University. During the fall and spring semesters, she works as opening grill cook in the Cub Cafe, inside the MacFarlane Student Union Building. She's well versed in many cooking techniques and is certified in food safety practices. Her experiences make her completely qualified to make Taco Revolution a success.Our first outing will be at the Kutztown Fair, from August 14th through 19th. If our Kickstarter is a success, we'll be able to buy all the best signage and uniforms. That way, we can look like a success even before we open up on the first day. That means we can make a good first impression before people even bite into their first taco. That's a good foundation on which to build. That foundation will help us appear at more and more events and fairs in the area.Even if our Kickstarter does not meet its goal, we'll still be able to run our stand. We just won't have a great foundation to start with. We can still be successful, but it won't be as simple as it would be with your help."

During the previous phase we were not ready for this request, but now, after we looked for talented young artists, we can give you what you asked...We involved a young italian female artist!! Her name is Stella! She painted for us some good prototypes and we loved them!! And we are ready!!!If you like the idea to support our project, we'll send you a form in which you can describe, by replying some standard questions, the region in which you want to set you RPG campaign (or your book, your comic, your fairytale, and so on...), and Stella will paint it in a unique handcrafted signed map, on heavy HQ paper, in A4 standard size, using her skills to give you a superb collectable object, reproducing the world of fantasy in which your adventures are set, making them real!! :)You can choose between the ""real paper"" edition, handprinted on heavy HQ paper A4 size (210 × 297 mm, scroll colored), or the ""digital"" edition, in which Stella will paint the region you'll describe and then render it in a HD file you'll receive by email (no shipping costs).In addition, we'll give you again the chance to have the previous phase's rewards (please check following description).Truly hoping in your support, We thank you so much, and start immediately to work hard to give you our best!!GOOD IDEASWho?Some infromations about the artist and her working tecnique:Stella, 22 y.o. student from Roma (Italy).

Our backers will be kept informed should any unforeseen delays occur, and what steps we are taking to resolve them.With our team in mind, these are the major challenges and how we plan to overcome them1. A large explorable galaxy = a lot of content to createIn order to create a galaxy that is varied and worthy of exploring we are employing the following strategiesa. 2d graphics instead of 3d graphics. This keeps costs down. In addition, 2d assets will be photoshopped and manipulated to produce additional assets. b. We are collaborating with our backers to create user inspired content to add into the game, on top of and beyond our designs. By collaborating with our backers, we will ensure every corner of the galaxy is unique and interesting.2. This game sounds ambitious in it's complexity. Are you sure you can pull it off?Our lead developer, Logan Penland, is a trained biologist with a deep understanding of interacting and emerging systems. Leveraging his technical expertise with his coding background, Logan has spent the last year developing our game engine to allow the world, characters, and story lines to evolve organically.3. Creating a coherent story experienceOne challenge we are excited to tackle is linking all of our prototyped systems together to create a coherent story experience. With building a game that switches between many game mechanics such as flight, landing, and platforming, it is important to us that the game feels like a singular experience, rather than a collection of disparate events.This will be our first challenge to tackle once production has begun in full. Our goal is to release early access with this challenge already creatively solved.",https://www.kickstarter.com/projects/ratki/relaxing-adventure-to-kaneki-island?ref=discovery_category_newest,ratki/relaxing-adventure-to-kaneki-island,"Six (6) languages actively supported!

Your generous donations will help me get the final art assets needed to enable the rest of the features!"" -Logan We will use the funds to upgrade the graphics (the HUD is first on the list!), add additional airships (for a total of 4), more enemies, characters, Pirate Shanty cards, and overall graphical polish.After the first update, the game will receive major updates once a week (as art is finished) until all planned features are implemented. Considering the project is nearly complete, the official build of the game will be finished within 2-3 months after this campaign ends.-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------We are so excited to have reached our initial funding goal in only 3 days!! Thank you so much to everyone who has pledged so far, you are making our dreams come true!!Thank you thank you thank you!As planned, we will use the funds raised thus far to add more graphics and features to Kaneki Island!Now that we are able to finish the game, we are looking forward to the future!We want everyone to be able to play Kaneki Island! So, with that in mind, we are hoping to raise a total of $2,000.Developing for iOs requires a Mac computer to compile and test the code in the iPhone's native environment. If we can meet our stretch goal, we will be able to purchase a used mac computer and get to work bringing Kaneki Island to the iPhone!-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------","The project is 80% complete. We need a little more funding to finish the graphics. Risk is minimal to none. All team members are capable, talented, and reliable. The game will be completed. Backers will receive regular updates to the game as development continues. Should any scheduled update suffer delay, backers will be notified with the reason and what we are doing to actively fix it."

We didn't fund, but that's ok.I've already gotten a message from one of our backers with some suggestions if we try this again. I really appreciate it and if anyone else has anything that want to suggest, I'll be happy to get the feedback. Thank you for faith in us and your support!***Update 2***At the time of this writing, we're at 13% of the goal with 18 hours to go. I'm not sure we're going to make it.That's ok. It's disappointing, but it's ok. We're still doing the podcast. First episodes should be up either at the end of July or the beginning of August. I wanted to say thank you to everyone who supported us. All of the contributors are amazing, even if we didn't fund. Thank you for your support. I want to thank Stephen Schleicher and Rob Rasmussen from majorspoilers.com for their support and Rob's kind words about our staff. I want to thank Scott Johnson and Brian Ibbot of The Morning Stream Podcast for helping us get the word out about our Kickstarter. I want to thank the guys over at When Nerds Collide Podcast, for letting me join them as a guest and gush about the Kickstarter and website.Everyone in this process has been wonderful.The downside is, the audio quality of the coming game will be lower than I would have liked. There are so many positives though. Our website nerdsdom.com has double the number of regular readers during the month this Kickstarter has been going. I've learned all about Kickstarters, and what to expect if I do it again. So many things ended up positive, and I just don't see this as a defeat. I see it as one more step on the way to great things. Thanks to everyone for your help, your support and your kind words.If we fund tomorrow, and I'm wrong, I'll be ecstatic. If we don't fund, all of us over at The Nerd's Domain will walk away from this experience a little wiser, a little smarter and with a few more friends.Thank you!***Update***So, we're down to 10 days left on the Kickstarter. We're at 12% of the total.Let me tell you why this podcast is going to be great. The 6 people I've assembled are amazing. They're all great role players (read amateur actors) that have great concepts and ideas for the characters they're going to play. The story, or adventure if you want to call it that, is dangerous and dreadful. There are parts of it that seem too harsh to me, and that's what makes it Call of Cthulhu. The characters will be in actual danger at all times. This isn't just a story they'll be along for the ride on, this is a story that they could turn the corner and BAM! dead investigator, and insane party.Let me tell you the last reason I love this Kickstarter. It's a passion for me. In high school I produced and directed our school TV announcements. It really made me want to get into TV. That was over a decade ago, and I regret being too lazy to follow through with it then, but now? Now I'm ready.The players are primed. The characters are made, outfitted and ready for most anything. I'm ready to tell you this amazing story and to bring you excitement and disaster as you listen to our investigators navigate the dangers of this story. We just need some money to make the recording as high quality as possible, so that all you here is the story, and not the small things that will draw you out.Consider donating. The rewards are amazing. John is a fantastic artist who just doesn't get a chance to produce enough great art work. There is an extra game session in there just for our backers. I don't know what we're going to do for it yet, but I know there's plenty of source material out there. Tell your friends, your family and anyone else you think might be interested. Help us get this dream to you in the quality it deserves.Who are we?Nerd's Domain is a website where we review geeky and nerdy items so that our readers can make informed decisions. These are all opinions, but we too often we've all been hesitant on what to buy and if the price tag is equal to the actual entertainment value. Nerd's Domain is there to answer that question. We've expanded a little into a podcast where we cover current movies once a month, Criterion Collection movies once a month and the other weeks we just talk about what's on our minds and what we've been doing. Also, We're Fighting the ZombieApocalypse One Review at a Time!Matt Quiett is a 15+ year gamer and game master. I'm currently the Editor-in-Chief over at nerdsdom.comand the producer of the website's podcasts. I started with Dungeons and Dragons in High School and has play a wide range of games since then.John Quiett is a 15+ year gamer and game master. He's currently one of the writers at nerdsdom.com, but more importantly the art director. All the art you see on this page, including in the video is from John. John started playing D&D in High School as well, being roped into it by his cousin Matt. John has a degree in Sequential Art (comic books and layouts) from the Savanah College of Artist and Design.Jestin Kimmet is an enigma. He often claims he's never gamed, and other times he tells grand adventures of the times that were. Jestin is currently a writer over atnerdsdom.com and his personal interests lay in some of the esoteric areas, like the SCA and panning for gold. Watch out for Jestin. The last time we played Call of Cthulhu, he abandoned the party to death while he ran away.Shirley Niedziecki is a relatively new gamer, with only 6 or so years under her belt. She currently is one of the writers for nerdsdom.comand the Marketing and Social Media guru. Shirley started gaming in LARPs, and that's where she met Matt and subsequently the rest of the Nerd's Domain crew. Shirley claims to be the token gamer girl, but she isn't a token anything and stands strongly as the female voice in most everything Nerd's Domain does.George Chimplesis a 10+ year veteran gamer. He started out his actual gaming with Dead City Productions at Northwestern University in 2002, playing a Vampire LARP. Since then, George has expanded to several table top games, like Exalted, Mage and D&D 4th edition. Scott Troianois a 33+ year gamer. Like most of us, he started with D&D, but he has expanded since then to several games, including LARPing for nearly 20 years. Scott is an outside the box thinker, and it fuels his roleplaying and gaming decisions. Scott is brand new to the Cthulhu rules set, but not to the concepts of Cthulhu.Jason Hall is a 20+ year gamer. Jason has LARPed and played a good number of both tabletop and online games. Jason is brand new to the Cthulhu rules set, but not to the concepts of Cthulhu.What is a podcast? What do you mean ""play podcast""?A podcast is like a radio program that you can download and listen to in your own time. All smart phones have free apps available for them, and they can be gotten through other programs like iTunes on your computer. Podcasts can cover anything, including History, Physics, comic book news, reviews, tech news, and cooking. There is literally a podcast out there for just about anything.There is a smaller group of podcasts, called play podcasts, where the focus is listening to a group of people play a role playing game. Role playing games range from Dungeon and Dragons to Vampire the Requiem to hundreds of other games available. Some play podcasts focus on teaching the rules or reviewing the game being played. Our play podcast will focus on telling a story through the game being played and the people playing.Think of it as a classic radio play, but with some rules, some dice rolling and a limited cast of characters.What are we doing?With the launch of the site, Shirley, John, Jestin and myself have a vision for a play podcast. The trouble we kept running into was equipment. It's costly and while we did get a hold of a mic and editing software for our Nerd's Domain Podcast, it just wouldn't work for a good play podcast.I decided in March that it was taking too long and we were waiting for money that just wasn't going to be available very soon. We all wanted this game and podcast to get off the ground, and Kickstarter seemed like a great place to crowd source the adventure I'd found.We will be playing 6th Edition Call of Cthulhu, produced by Chaosium. This is a great product from a great company. We're going to be using the core rule book, as well as the Call of Cthulhu 1920's Companion for rules and material.The adventure is amazing. I will be running the group through Masks of Nyarlothatep, a 6 chapter adventure. The adventure says that it should take about a year to run, but I'm guessing that it will take anywhere between 12 and 18 months, on our weekly release schedule of episodes.The Masks of Nyarlothatep is thoroughly one of the best thought out and engaging adventures I've ever read through. The mystery and intrigue are great. The threat to the world and the investigators is high and the adventure even warns you that character death and insanity will happen and gives plenty of ideas on how to replace the characters we'll lose.The people listed above are all great role players. I won’t say they’re professional actors, but all of them have years of experience taking a concept and making it unique and fun. You’ll notice that 6 out of 7 people involved in this project are or were LARPers. Live Action Role Play as a game type relies on the player to embody a character more thoroughly and teaches role play over dice rolling.Overall, this project is something all seven of us are passionate about. We’re all looking forward to getting started and we’re hoping you’ll join us. The next 12 to 18 months of games are going to be great. We have exciting plans for stretch goals and add ons once we fund, so keep an eye out for those.What is the Kickstarter funding?The money we raise will be used to purchase equipment, server space for hosting, music andunforeseenexpenses. The equipment includes a mixer as well as a headset and mic for each player and myself as keeper. The server space will be covered for a full 12 months and the music will be officially purchased from Josh Shoppe, our composer.Unforeseenexpense might include replacing any pieces of equipment that might fail, potentially an external hard drive for backup storage needs, or extra sever space for episodes past the 12 month mark.Why Should you consider supporting us?That's a fair question and the same question I ask before I ever support a Kickstarter project.We've got great rewards. You can see the avatars in the video and the banner. The black and white sketch is above, and this is a period sketch of you in the 1920s. The action shot art is also above, and again it's of you in the 1920's dealing with a Cthulhu monster. Both of these are from John Quiett, and he's ready to start working on those immediately. The extra session will be fun, and will show our players range as they embody new characters. Joining the group at dinner during Gen Con should be a blast and you'll get to meet the whole cast. There's NPCs to rename that will immortalize you in the story, as well as the big villain that could take your name as well. Finally the Skype game will be entertaining and I will be recording it so you can save it to listen to again and again.Beyond the rewards, the podcast itself promises to be 12 to 18 months of weekly podcasts. That's anywhere between 48 and 72 episodes, so between 50 and 100 hours of entertainment. We're using a quality story, and the players are more than skilled at role playing, so the overall adventure will be well told, well played and thoroughly enjoyable.Finally, this is going to be awesome. Not just for us playing and recording, this will be fun for our listeners too. We're going to provide tons of entertainment, and you get some extras by pledging too.Thanks for checking us out. If you love what we're doing here with the Kickstarter, be sure to pass our link along to your friends. We look forward to you joining our adventure.Update! May 21st 2013I promised a recording of Scott Troiano's character creation in last week's update. Here it is.I was going to just send this out as an update for backers, but it turns out it's too big to upload into an update.We're all still really excited. Over 10% of the way there, and still nearly 3 weeks to go!","We have a big challenge. Our website has been up for almost 9 months and we've been podcasting for almost 3 months, but our audience is still pretty small. Spreading the word about the Kickstarter is crucial, and while we have a plan, it could be a rough time getting people to come look at the page. So the challenge isn't in the actual end product, but in getting this Kickstarter marketed. The game will be great, and we're as prepared as we can be.Risk wise, there's a possibility that the Kickstarter would not fund. The podcast would probably still happen, but the material would not get the quality recording it deserves and we wouldn't be able to leave our episodes up indefinitely. Again, we don't have much risk in missing a recording session, as all our players and our keeper are ready to start now. Only the equipment is slowing us down.",https://www.kickstarter.com/projects/1391264180/nerds-domain-is-headed-to-indy-pop-con?ref=discovery_category_newest,1391264180/nerds-domain-is-headed-to-indy-pop-con,"Stretch Goals!!!We moved these to the top to make sure you saw them first.

In December of 2013 we joined with 3 other podcasts to form The Omega Nerds Network. We've got almost a year of podcasting up and ready for listeners, and getting more people listening is one of our goals for Nerd's Domain and The Omega Nerds Network.Where are we going with this?Indy Pop Con will be hosting it's inaugural convention this year in Indianapolis, and they're going to have a podcast alley. We're really excited about the convention and we'd love to have a table to set up to advertise our shows, hand out some swag and maybe sell a few T-Shirts as well. You can find more information on Indy Pop Con at indypopcon.com.Why do we need money?That's where this Kickstarter comes in. We need money to fund the table, buy some swag and get shirts printed for our website.

We also occasionally have guests on our podcast to look at different things, like running a publishing company, or self publishing through Amazon and what it takes.The Masks of Nyarlathotep Podcast is a weekly podcast where 6 players sit down to play Call of Cthulhu, run by Matt. The current adventure has them in playing the Masks of Nyarlathotep super adventure, with some side quest adventures thrown in from time to time.

Topics from podcasting to film punks to Oscar snubs, Joe and his crew give you their view of what's they're seeing.","There is a lot of planning that will go into fulfilling our pledges, mostly with working  out schedules to record. I've been organizing difficult schedules for 18 months, and I feel very comfortable that we can get something worked out with everyone.There is also a lot of planning that will go into getting out the prints and thank you cards. I don't know if this is really going to be a problem once we have everything here.Finally, there's setting up at the actual con and talking about the podcasts and website for hours on end. This is really the joy of the podcasts. We all like talking and meeting new people and we're all really passionate about our podcasts, so this is less of a challenge and more of an opportunity."

My name is Shrimpsel and I'm a pin creator and curator of kitschy cute things. One thing I've always wanted to create is cute wing enamel pins to wear on collars and decorate my ita bags with.With the help of kickstarter I want to fund some of these adorable dragon wings and share the cuteness with you guys! I've created 5 different color combos so hopefully there is a little something for everyone. Some even have glitter added!How does kickstarter work:Basically think of kickstarter as a pre order. It's a way for creators like me to help get the funding to have their projects come to life. You can pledge for whichever reward tier you'd like and if enough people pledge and we hit the funding goal, the pins will be made. If for whatever reason there isnt enough interest and we dont hit the funding goal, your card will not be charged and the pins will not be made. Keep in mind that kickstarter doesn't charge your card until after the campaign is over, so you are more than welcome to change your pledge as you please over the duration of the campaign!The pins:The initial goal of $500 will go towards funding these 5 color variants of the dragon wings. If we exceed that, I may add more wing styles and color variants as well.Each set includes (2) matching pins.Each pin will be made in either gold or black nickel plating depicted in the mockups. Pins will be made in hard enamel which makes for a more solid and shiny finish!Timeline:The manufacturer I've worked with before has a really great turn around time so you can expect to have pins in hand around the end of March, but I will keep everyone up to date as things progress.","With mass production of pins, there is always a chance that there could be slight delays/errors.

They are a way for people like myself to get a project realized through means of pledges. Think of it like a pre order for an enamel pin! Once you find a reward you like, you can pledge through the kickstarter platform and when the campaign ends, you get your desired pin!

A survey is sent out after the kickstarter ends asking for your specific enamel pin choices and shipping address.The Jackalope and Nessie are the main goals and both unlock at $300. Each pin after will unlock and be available as a reward when we hit each perspective stretch goal. Remember you can pledge for any design even if it's not unlocked. This will ensure that all the stretch goals are met. You can change your reward tier whenever you'd like during the campaign.Below is a rough breakdown of where the funds raised will be allocated.",With manufacturing delays can happen. I've worked with my current manufacturer for 10 designs now and I'm confident with their quality and speed.

It will be the first of a continuing series of LP's on my own imprint which will be called DJRONA and sold off my website STAG-HARE.NET.  So this is a fundraiser first for the ANGEL TECH LP, but also to help get the DJRONA label running as well.WHY VINYL RECORDS?I am very excited about ANGEL TECH, and believe it will make an excellent addition to any vinyl collection. I also wish to make something unique for those of you who are followers of the Stag Hare project as well as something which has more of a physical presence than digital audio files. Stag Hare for me has always been about music and sound, but also about visual elements and performance elements and so it is important to me, for a more full representation of this project, to have a more solid physical anchor for the music, which is where this record comes into play. I wish to make the LP a collectors item. Also I love the idea that if the electricity ever went down vinyl records can still be played while digital files cannot.... or you could take a wind up record player with you into the woods and listen to the record in your secret forest yurt without electricity.DRONES CASSETTEThe DRONES cassette will be available strictly to kickstarter backers. It will be a c45 professional dubbed cassette of new Stag Hare material recorded over the past 3 years. WHY CONTRIBUTE?Your money would, first and foremost, be getting you a copy of ANGEL TECH on vinyl, and/or the DRONES cassette. But it would also and most importantly be contributing towards the Stag Hare and DJRONA label project at large, enabling me to self-fund more records, videos, etc in the future. I have always envisioned all the Stag Hare albums as part of a continuing series, being able to release albums myself makes this so much more possible! It is also important for me to have as direct a connection with listeners as possible. This is only possible through self releasing my albums.I believe that getting funding for the ANGEL TECH LP will put me a good step in the right direction of being able to perpetuate more upcoming releases. I would love to eventually release for the first time on vinyl albums from the Stag Hare back catalog such as BLACK MEDICINE MUSIC, AHSPEN and SANDPAINTINGS. I have also already begun the work on a number of more albums which will follow up ANGEL TECH as collectible vinyl releases as soon as possible. Your support will be helping me make this dream come true. ABOUT THE ALBUMThe tracks were all recorded starting in 2010 and completed towards the end of 2013. Some layers and parts are older, some newer. The recordings took place in a number of locations as I moved around a lot during those years. Parts were recorded in Salt Lake City, Portland Oregon, New York City, and ultimately finished back in Salt Lake City. The final mixes and finishing touches as well as the overall structure of the album came together in September of 2013 shortly following the birth of my son Sebastian. The timing caught me by surprise as the tracks sort of all came together suddenly. The album concerns itself with intersections of the profane with the holy, secular with the religious, divine with the desolate. It is about seeing the ancient ritual and meaning in the contemporary and mundane. It is exploring the joyous being tragic, and the depression being beauty. It is intended to be a mythological series of folktales, simultaneously leading the listener through a series of archetypal ritual patterns while coloring the environment (being the room the music is listened to, or the internal space created through headphone listening) with a particularly placed and tuned series of tones and textures. It is meant to be decorative as well as functional.

I have been working on the Stag Hare project for about 6 years and am continually striving for a consistency in quality and focus. I am excited to expand the project into more music releases, performances and videos and installations relating to the project to unfold in the future.Besides Stag Hare I have been involved in a number of other music projects, including Seven Feathers Rainwater, Ariel, River Spirit Dragon, and Baug. I am also a film programmer for the Salt Lake City Film Festival and am working on a number of short film and video projects.**************************************************For downloads and streams of all Stag Hare albums visit:STAG-HARE.NETSTAGHARE.BANDCAMP.COM**************************************************","It is possible, due to record pressing availability, shifts in the creative concept, etc that the project may take longer to manifest than my estimated date of October 2014.

They will all be professionally dubbed cassettes with full color artwork on cardboard wrap around sleeves. Below is a rough draft of each of the albums, showing the front cover, two spines, and back cover. The first three releases are:Angel TechThis is a previously released album (Sept 2013 Space Slave Editions), which will be re-released with new artwork as the first official release on the Djrona label. Stream the album here.PortalsThis is a release of entirely new material. It hangs in a balance between pulsing rainbow drones and heartbeat rhythms.DronesThis album, as its title suggests, is specifically just drones. These are four carefully selected drone pieces which have been crafted, fine tuned, and then put through a process of performing a live mix from analogue tape through various effects processors and onto a computer.Each drone is a different little world, a different mood, different tone or color. They are designed to work each separately as well as fitting together as a full piece.Many many hours of thought and work have gone into the various stages of production on each of these releases. With just a little bit of funding I would be able to start getting these ideas to the people of the world.Thank you.*******************************************stag-hare.netstaghare.bandcamp.com","It is possible the cassette plant will take longer than anticipated, postponing the expected finish date."

I work for a large corporate company based in the UK near London, where suit's are the average attire. I constantly look for ways tosubtly add flare to the norm, whether that be pocket square, cuff links or tie clip. Nonetheless, I very rarely find singular lapel pins as commercially available as these.Hence I am solving my own problem by creating my own brand, and hopefully finding people along the way that that share a similar style.I invite you to join me on my journey, and together we can see the brand grow into new designs and new markets.Please check out the designs I have currently below.BestRob","Risks 1. Delayed Shipment from China - I shall keep backers updated regularly.2. Product poor quality - I shall ask for refund and re-order, i have found many suppliers.3. Not enough funding for website if backers want to buy more afterwards- I shall create an eBay store until then.",https://www.kickstarter.com/projects/urbaneuk/urbane-luxury-lapel-pins?ref=discovery_category_newest,urbaneuk/urbane-luxury-lapel-pins,"Hi Guys!So the idea for Urbane started when I was looking for lapel pins to interchange from day-to-day suits and blazers (I really like suits and blazers). I was surprised that I could not find any (online or in store) without either purchasing another suit (tempting), which came with one already on, or customising my own for an extortionate fee... I'm not the type to wait for somebody else to fill this gap, so I came up with my own designs and had them manufactured with the hope that others share a similar style to mix up their smart-casual/business attire.So far I have received feedback from my friends and colleagues on the 'Urbane Stag' Design, then I took this to the next design The 'Urbane Lion' and I'm very happy with how they turned out.Now I need to really EXPAND my feedback from a wider audience. As a backer for Urbane, you will be able to contribute and feedback on everything from the unboxing experience, look and feel of the product, to the compliments you receive.I will listen to you ALL, and create the online store and future of Urbane with designs based on YOUR feedback. This is an invitation for you to become a part of the brand.Based on the initial success, I aim to have my products placed firstly in a boutique stores, and then the larger retailers (John Lewis, House of Fraser etc.) But I can't do it without your help.So please - make a pledge, and join me in crafting Urbane into a truly awesome brand.BestRob",Risks and Challenges              - Manufacturers closing down.- Boutique stores not accepting the brand

This project is for a deck of cards to celebrate the wounderful magic collection and museum of Ken Klosterman, The Salon de Magie. The collection contains over 8000 books and 4000 pieces of magic apparatus. We will try and narrow that doen to the cream of the crop for this deck. Those of you who have visited the Salon know what an amazing place it is ....... 83 feet below the earths surface and full of magic history. For those who have not seen the Salon de Magie here is your chance to get a glimpse of its treasures.I am sorry to say that I do not have a finished back design to show you. Some of the money raised will be used to have my design ideas for the back professionally done. One design I am considering is a ""Bee Back"" style. Kens symbol is two K's placed back to back, and I am considering this symbol in a bee back pattern. Picture the KK's where the diamonds are on the regular back. Another Idea for the back is a picture of the Vault door opening(yes there is a real vault door ) that you walk thru to get into the salon. My problem with this idea is that it would be a ""One way "" back. I am a big fan of ambigrams, so I am also considering having Salon de Magie written in an ambigram on the back. If you order a deck I would like your input as to what you would like to see. If you have a favorite magician or piece of apparatus please let me know and if it is one of the best pieces in Kens collectionwe will consider it for the deck. Some items that most likely made the cut are. Kellars Satar head, houdini rose bush, Houdin light and heavy chest ( yesTHE light and heavy chest), Houdin crystal casket and clocks,Discovery of Witchcraft, Another idea not yet decided on is to not use the standard suits. I would like your opinion on this too. Instead of the hearts we may use an open book, the club may be three linked rings,the spade may be a ball vase, and the diamond may be the cups and ball. The decks will be printed at the US Playing Card Company on Bicyclebrand card stock. I would like to have the edges gold leaf coated, but as of the last time I spoke with them they did not offer this, but may in the future. If they do by the time we print the cards we will have it done.Thank you for looking at my newest project. If you love magic and magic history I know you will love these cards.

A little idea sparked in 2012 before the ghoulish season of Halloween. HORROR SERIES!So I messaged my friends to be involved, set up shoots, and did it! I photographed my models in their homes, outdoors, and wherever I felt suited each photo shoot idea. Then I edited the photos and had them up on my site before Halloween. Horror Series 2012 was a hit!The following year, 2013, I wanted to go BIGGER! I was amazed with the kindness of people wanting to be involved. New ideas sparked, so I gathered my models and did it all in 2 months time! Once again I shot at my model's homes, their own studios, and many outdoor locations. I got to host my very FIRST art show at a boutique in the Los Angeles area. A horror filled art show where I got the pleasure of showing my art to the world. Two of my pieces were then selected by a president who is in charge of a convention in Los Angeles and those pieces were showcased and one of them sold!It is now 2014 and I want to do it again....

https://www.kickstarter.com/projects/bobbi/bobbi-wilsons-solo-album?ref=discovery_category_newest,bobbi/bobbi-wilsons-solo-album,"This album is a compilation of re-imagined jazz standards and originals written by myself and my producer. Wow! Where do I start. This album is full of so many beautiful and cool spins on jazz. I wanted it to appeal to everyone who loves great music, not just jazz lovers. It ranges from duets with piano and guitar to intimate trios to large scale orchestral arrangements. I have the privilege of working with Phil Kelly, a Grammy nominated composer, and my producer Chris Alpiar is a recipient of the Quincy Jones Composition Award as well as being a brilliant musician and just the overall PB to my J throughoutthis project. Add to that the talented players, engineers, and recording at the state of the art 800 East Studios in Atlanta, etc. and you have got yourself one incredible debut album.It touches on the ups and downs of love and lust and patterns of temptation that we know will lead to the same place as before…yet we go there every time. I enjoy the irony of my greatest creative project (so far) coming from my frustration and utter inability to figure that aspect of my life out. But hey, It makes for some excellent art. My $11,000 goal is about 1/3rd of the full budget for my project. Because of Kickstarter’s all or nothing format I decided to set a smaller goal in hopes that the KS community, my fans, and friends will make great things happen.  This album is a huge stepping stone for me. Not only will it entertain, but professionally will give me the ability to book more live performances and shop for representation as well. Here is an idea of the budget I am looking at and a more exact idea of how funds will be used.Pre-production (ex: composing, arranging, music copyist, music licensing) $8,000 est.Production (ex: tracking and assistant engineers, talent, producer fees, contracting, studio) $12,000 est.Post – production (ex: mixing, mastering, graphic artist, photos, CD replication and misc.) $10,000 est.Feel free to ask me questions, check back for updates, check out the incentives I have for your support, tell your friends, and thank you in advance!!!www.youtube.com/watch?v=coggp6_sZRYwww.sonicbids.com/bobbiwilsonwww.youtube.com/watch?v=agQWp1ZhoF8A friend once said to me, “When you sing I feel something.” It remains one of my favorite compliments, and reminds me what my purpose as an artist is.

https://www.kickstarter.com/projects/2069184719/the-herd?ref=discovery_category_newest,2069184719/the-herd,"So ""The Herd"" is a reflex driven mobile game for Android. In the game you play a shepherd learning the value of patience and timing. Use your staff to guide the correct sheep in and herd the wrong sheep back to pasture. Use your slingshot to keep the wolves away!  This is the first full game that I have ever completed and after some ups and down in the production, mainly from learning how to do it in the first place, I was finally able to finish the gameplay and I am preparing to wrap up production and put it on Google Play.  As I come close to completion, I realize that my license for the program has ended and it needs to be renewed in order to publish it. So I need help and have come to Kickstarter in order to gain the funds to renew it.This License is a year long and the success of this Kickstarter will give me the chance to make atleast two other games before it is time to renew it once again. I always had a love for video games and I wanted to try a hand at making them. ""The Herd"" is my first official attempt at making a mobile game and I am excited that you are taking the opportunity to help me get it out to be played! During the campaign I will be posting updates as I begin to wrap everything up and prepare to publish.","As I have been working In order for the game to complete for release I gone threw many ideas and concepts that I would like to implement. But for the initial release, right now I need to only finish music/sounds effects and a short comic. Both of these will be finished by the end of the campaign.",https://www.kickstarter.com/projects/2069184719/the-herd-mobile?ref=discovery_category_newest,2069184719/the-herd-mobile,"Hi, I'm KV and I have come to Kickstarter for funding to get The Herd to market. I love gaming. Ever since I can remember I loved being a part of the adventure games provided. I also lived in a house with strong Christian values so we were encouraged to play games and music with strong moral values. As I grew older there were less games that met that criteria and also matched my growing need for stronger and more immersive storytelling with games. This in turn encouraged me to try and make my own. Concept Taking my first steps into development was a fun challenge. And now that I am so close to completion it is time to make The Herd accessible to the masses.  That's where you come in! With your help I can purchase the license needed to put The Herd on the Google Play store. This is a year long license so I will be able to create other games while it is still active.About The Herd  My main area of expertise has leaned toward animated films so I wanted to start off small on my first game. I decided something simple, easy, fun, and could express a biblical teaching. Some trial and error later I had come to develop The Herd. Based on the principle of being a good shepherd, The Herd was my way of expressing the idea of the importance of following God's instruction.RewardsA simple game needs simple tiers. In appreciation for your help and partnering with me in this endeavor every tier will receive a credit in the game. In the second tier we start to add on early access to the app. After that you get all the above plus a poster, the top tier will receive all posters! Here is one:Thank you for checking out our project. Thank you again if you decide to be a part of it by donating.","Production is almost wrapped up. Sound and music still needs some work and I may try and update the art on the sheep, shepherds, and wolves. The Herd will also feature a guided view comic in which the programming is set up and only needs the art. Overall I am in a good position to have the game ready to be published by the end of the campaign."

But I do hope it will launch a conversation about the different types of people that live in our world, as well as some curiosity about what sort of personality your child is living out of.Readers are asked where they feel like they are on a spectrum of Introversion to Extroversion, Examination to Imagination, Consideration to Emotion, and Organization to Improvisation. I take Carl Jung's thoughts on basic personality traits and gear them for a conversation with elementary school students.Rather than using the results to summarize personalities, the book asks further questions that line up with that personality type. Do you like to help others? Do you sometimes have big feelings? That way children are free to agree or disagree with the observations.",Our central challenge is getting the message out to enough people to give the project the needed momentum to get off the ground.

The Elementals, as they have been called, are forces of nature: the quintessence of the realm in which we reside, sentients unseen, perhaps even forgotten… Here, I’ve collected a history and substantially studied the undying. I bring a most curious and enlightening record vital to our understanding. I have not returned unchanged. The Elementals have spoken.Have we the mind to listen? -- Avery Ekland, your guide through Elementis• • • Hello and welcome from the Elementis crew!  We are a group of friends with an undying love and appreciation for fantasy, myth, monsters, deities, faeries, and now—the elements.The elements, as we typically know them, are earth, air, fire, and water. As a team, we have expanded our search to 26 different elements which will all be covered in this field guide!We have already worked to create a sense of wonder with our sample illustrations, and we plan to spend many hours on the rest of the artwork for this book. We will, also, enhance our elementals with collected journal entries and various facts to build our own lore with these subjects—to give them personalities that are not stereotypical but not out of place either. We will also provide tidbits of interesting educational material so that it's not completely a work of fiction. Who knows? Maybe you'll learn something new!We will be using an online printing service. We have ordered print samples from them and find them to be quite satisfactory. They will provide beautiful, high-quality pages.This book will contain over 52 illustrations and drawings of elementals, each devised by one of the artists on our team. Each page spread will include one element featuring details of the elementals. The pages will showcase illustrations coupled with journal entries which will be comprised of fictional stories, educational facts, and lore which will help you get to know the elementals and their real-world characteristics.Here are some examples of what the final pages may look like:The funding for this campaign will go to the creation process and delivery of Elementis. The breakdown of our $3,200 goal is as follows: 47% will go into the production and printing of the book, 10% will pay for the Kickstarter fees, 26% will contribute to the cost of shipping and handling, and the remaining 17% will go toward the artists’ and designers’ fees.Regarding FulfillmentThe artists for this project will begin work the moment we’ve reached our funding goal and will be completed near the end of October. This gives us November to finish formatting the book for publication and allows us to package and ship out your goods the beginning of December.

The greatest risk would come in the form of delays.One challenge that is always present is to balance the work required for a project of this magnitude with artists’ work, school, family, and other unexpected circumstances.  However, we have set a manageable timeline for everyone involved and are willing to pick up any slack where needed.  There could also be complications during printing leading us to push back our release date, though we believe it won't be pushed back more than a month.The artists, designers, and others assisting with this project are fully qualified and capable of completing the work during the allotted time.

https://www.kickstarter.com/projects/blisswhisperers/a-promise-of-non-ordinary-beings?ref=discovery_category_newest,blisswhisperers/a-promise-of-non-ordinary-beings,"My name is Lauren Sebastian... ...and I took the leap of becoming a full-time, professional, bliss-whispering artist and illustrator back in 2011. It was a pivotal moment when my partner and I chose to bypass fear and act upon our hearts' whispers. Life subsequently became rife with workaholic-ism and uncertainty (AKA adventure and possibility) and, low and behold, I love every single minute of it!The past five years have been the most fulfilling, eventful, challenging and happy-making yet. It gives me great delight to know that#TheArtOfLauren now hangs in various European countries, as well as Canada andAmerica, and my illustrations have been published with Tarcher/Penguin (an imprint of Penguin Random House, New York) in “Miraculous Silence” by Mitra Rahbar (hurrah!) - but, enough of all that jazz.The year 2015 brought winds of change and expansion with it. My guitar making partner Graham and I bit the bullet last October by following our dream of setting up a guitar workshop and an art studio in St.Ives, Cornwall. After six months of loooooooong hours, sweat, tears (thankfully, mostly of laughter) and lots of coffee, we have finally arrived at present day. The dream is now a reality, and we are incredibly proud of the spaces we've created. We invested pretty much everything we had into the move and now it's time to shout out and let people know what we are up to in wild and magical 'Kernow'!Utterly inspired by the mystical energy of South West Cornwall, my most recent paintings feature a promise ofNon-ordinary Beings and Gaia Elementals, which I suspect also have art therapeutic value. They arose from the notion of non-ordinary reality and those otherworldly dwelling places of sylphs, fairies, devas, lightworkers and the like. I began to meet these Beings in my imagination, they spoke of soulful things and called out to be painted and shared. The result is a growing collection of colourful, symbolic portraits, depicting various unique and vibrant characters. In the long run, I plan to convert them into a published deck of oracle cards with an accompanying book to whisper their messages for use in creative counselling and art therapy (a Kickstarter project for next year, no doubt). However, to begin with, I've hired the Salthouse Gallery in St.Ives to showcase a magical portrait exhibition of these Beings during the first week of October 2016 (with an un-private view opening the show at 6pm on Saturday, 1st October).One way or another I intend to put on the best solo show possible. Thus, I need to raise funds for more art materials (I'm midway through painting these beings as we speak); for gallery hire and insurance to exhibit; to uniquely frame each of the paintings in keeping with their individual natures (they are all acrylic on boards or canvas); to create accompanying giclee prints (making the work even more affordable); and to get publicity material printed.This Kickstarter is focussed on creating and preparing at least 15 Non-ordinary Beings for exhibition. Should we together surpass my initial goal during the process, then I will be delighted to set stretch goals for more Beings to be included as we go along... We have until 20 June 2016, the Summer Solstice, to get our 'wriggle on' (that's the finish-line date for making pledges to this campaign). I wonder how many Beings will be welcomed into ordinary reality by October?!I know that I could create a low-key exhibition at less cost, but my integrity just won't let me! I believe putting on a really fantastic show, without cutting any corners, will do these Non-ordinary Beings justice. I have a lifetime of ideas brewing inside me for future projects, and I couldn't be happier to be part of such a creative community here. It's a dream come true to be able to do what I do and I'm hugely grateful for any and all pledges that will enable me to realise my vision for this particular collection...If you do not feel a pull to make a pledge (or perhaps you'd love to but find you aren't in a position to do so), then I'd be hugely grateful if you would simply share my campaign on social media. That way it will reach a wider audience than I could ever reach on my own. And, if you ARE able to pledge, hurrah! For example, just 15 people each pledging for a limited edition giclee print of a Non-ordinary Being would make this Kickstarter a success (and, of course, there are many other pledge options with delightful rewards available too).STRETCH GOALS:Should the phenomenally amazing happen and we surpass my original goal, then I will gladly add stretch goals to include additionalBeings into the mix. AND, should we miraculously manage to reach a total of 33 Beings with time to spare, never fear, I have several other stretch goals up my sleeve... Squeeeee, I can hardly contain my excitement!Thank you so much for your time and all your good vibes from the bottom of my heart and on behalf of the Non-ordinary Beings.With love, Lauren xxxwww.laurensebastian.com********Breakdown of Costs: Art materials to create the rest of the artworks = £250; Gallery hire = £395; Framing of Non-ordinary Beings = £1200; Fine art prints = £1050; Posters & invites = £150; Exhibition insurance = £150; Private View costs = £100; A-frame print rack = £35Total = £3330Plus Kickstarter fees and bank charges (8-10% of pledges) = c.£333GRAND TOTAL = £3700********The following artworks feature as pledge rewards (some originals and some giclee prints). I thought it would be helpful for you to see what you can gain from making a pledge. NB I always find it fascinating to see which Non-ordinary Being 'speaks' to each soul who comes into my studio; now we can play that game here, too:","I am completely committed to this project; the Salthouse Gallery venue is already booked for the first week in October 2016 and I wholeheartedly intend for the exhibition to take place no matter what...Risks and challenges are as follows:~ Sickness: If I were to get seriously sick or incapacitated that would momentarily hinder this project because I am the artist. However, I'm currently fit as a fiddle and creating these artworks makes my soul sing, so I don't foresee sickness. In the absolute worst case scenario that I were to fall seriously ill (to the degree that I was unable to paint), then the project would only be postponed NOT cancelled.  ~ Meeting the exhibition deadline: I have 4 months to complete the artwork for my show, which is more than enough time for me to make at least 15 'Non-ordinary Beings' ready for exhibition (8 of which are already completed). In fact, there is plenty of time for me to create more artworks and it is my hope that the campaign will go so well that I'll be able to create stretch goals for a total of 33 'Non-ordinary Beings', in the end.~ Production of pledge rewards: There is no risk regarding the pledge rewards because they are readily available now e.g. giclee prints can be made up on request and the various pledge options featuring original artworks are for existing paintings (ready to be sent out to their new homes after the exhibition).I am a great believer that any hitch or challenge can be overcome with a big dollop of creativity and determination. It is my bliss to make magical art and such a joy to share it! Thanks once again for your time and I hope to see you at the un-private view, Lauren x",https://www.kickstarter.com/projects/blisswhisperers/grumpy-mermaids-seek-loving-homes?ref=discovery_category_newest,blisswhisperers/grumpy-mermaids-seek-loving-homes,"🧜🏻‍♀️ GRUMPY MERMAIDS COMING SOON...My name is Lauren Sebastian, professional Artist Illustrator & fledgling Silversmith of the Non-ordinary. I busy away in my (sometimes) sunny workspace, nestled in the heart of St Ives in deepest Cornwall, creating artwork of a whimsical nature as well as other mysterious artefacts.Lately, I’ve had a flurry of mermaids appearing in my art studio by the seaside... Colourful illustrations of mermaids, to be exact.And, while I always aim to translate my artwork into fine art prints for rosy-cheeked passers-by, I got to thinking about how lovely it would be to also have some mermaids available to people in the form of affordable keepsakes. Hence, the Grumpy Mermaids are destined to become large, glittery pins (4.5cm).I warmly invite you to back my Kickstarter campaign. Then, we can bring these mermaids to ‘life’ as gold-plated, colourful, hard enamel pins. Please don’t miss out on this opportunity, we don’t want Kigliw & Mélid to become even grumpier than they already are (wink)...UPDATE!Oh wow, oh wow! We smashed the initial goal of £333 in just 8 days and there are still 24 days left to go of this Mermaid Enamel Pin Kickstarter campaign! Therefore, as promised, I am revealing my surprise stretch goal. 🙌🏻 NB To be honest, it’s not so much a stretch goal, because I am going to do this anyway, regardless of whether we can double the mermaid enamel pin ‘fund’ to make an additional batch of pins for my studio. Instead, it’s more my gift to say thank you to all you wonderful people, whom had the kindness to pledge so quickly and to all the new pledgers to come over the next 3 weeks... 👋🏻So, what is it I have had up my sleeve, I hear you ask?Well, I would like to hand-ink and paint some surprise, dinky, little artworks on card featuring various animals that happen to be our mermaids’ friends. They cheer up the Grumpy Mermaids by telling stories of their adventures and will be accompanying the rewards of every single backer, when the time comes to post out to you all. Which means that anybody who has made a pledge (any pledge), whether it be for a “Kigliw“ Pin or a “Morgowlesen” Art Print (for example), will also receive a surprise, original artwork created by me. My way of showing gratitude, thank you, everybody, for all your support and encouragement; you are all extraordinary beings! ✨💘✨ ALL THE REWARDS TO CHOOSE FROM (BELOW): ✨","I do not foresee many risks or challenges in relation to this project, it is small in scale and not my first Kickstarter campaign. I have set September 2019 as a realistic month for dispatching the rewards to backers because I know the pins and art prints can all be comfortably manufactured by July/August. The only possible thing that could glitch (that’s beyond my control), for example, is if there should be a fault in the products when they reach me. However, in that situation both my art printers and the enamel pin company are long-established and very professional, they would rectify any fault by quickly re-producing my order. Therefore, I only have excitement bubbling in my belly for this project!"

Some of them we can't just forget and we have to live with them. There are so many suggestions how to cope with difficult situations in our lives, but sometimes we just need to change our vision on those things. Sometimes we don't even want to forget something, but we want to learn how to accept it. Life is fleeting so fast and all we can do is stop being afraid and weep about the past, but let it go. This pain makes us grow and we start appreciating little things that we have now.By creating personalised illustrations I want people to look on their bad events in a different way that can help them with acceptance of those events. No blood or darkness, just cute animals and flowers in a lovely colourful composition. I would be really happy to create something special and meaningful for you!All illustrations will be carved on lino and printed on special printmaking paper on approximately A4 size.With each lino print you will receive a magnet with a little version of your print on it. You can also have a glass tile pendant and 10 greeting cards with the design of your personal illustration.There is a variety of reward combinations to choose from. I offer greeting cards, magnets, key charms, glass tile pendants, brooches and pendants frompolymer clay.A set of 16 cards(4 cards of each design) 140x140 mm printed on trucard gloss paper.You can choose 5 40x40 mm magnets of your choice from existing designs. I have numbered all this stuff to make it easier for you to explain what exactly you would like to have.Also, I have created 12 pendant versions with these illustrations. Length of the chain is 62 cm.Inspired by lace I have created brooches and pendants from polymer clay with roses that are considered as a symbol of pain and growth.Polymer clay pendants are slightly longer.Also, there are 5 designs of key charms - thriving heart, leaf hearts and my lovely love planets.There are some things that we will never forget and memory causes us so much pain. I believe that seeing something in a different light can help us to change our vision and go through it easier.With love,Kate","As I am working on my main par-time job there can be delays if the amount of orders will be much more than I expected, but I will do my best and keep you updated.I can possibly forget my polymer clay stuff in the oven and burn it, what can also cause delays.Shipping of materials and orders from printing companies is quite fast, but something unexpected can happen and delays are possible.",https://www.kickstarter.com/projects/faikatryn/anatomy-enamel-pins?ref=discovery_category_newest,faikatryn/anatomy-enamel-pins,"Hi! My name is Kate and I love making cute art. But it's not always about being cute, I like my art to have a story.I always loved anatomy and one day came an idea of organs telling their own stories. Our bodies fight for us every single day and most of the time we take it for granted. I wanted to create something that people could relate to, I wanted it to be touching. I decided to create a set of 3 pins representing what our body speaks when we worry, feeling ill, out of control, expecting or simply being healthy. I wanted every single pin to have a personal story - your story. Everyone sees the world through their own prism and that's what I love about art.Once the funding goal is reached the project will be fulfilled in a set time, which is production + postage. You won't be charged anything until the end of campaign as well as if the set goal is not reached, what makes this platform safe for all of us.These are soft enamel pins with dark silver plating and a white rubber clutch fixing.If you want more of these pins for any extra just add to your order £6 per each.Hope you enjoy it and thank you!","The colours on every screen might be a bit different, but I will try to make everything for it to look as close as possible.Production delays are quite common.

https://www.kickstarter.com/projects/1129260597/death-always-wins?ref=discovery_category_newest,1129260597/death-always-wins,"'Death Always Wins' is a short, very dark, film project set in Chicago during the 1920s and the battles between police, feds, mobs, and something else. My name is Bill Albert and I am the storyteller, producer ,writer & director for this short film.What's The Film About?Joey, a mafia thug, has been wounded during a battle. Recovering in a dark and dirty operating room he tells the blood stained doctor who operated on him that he saw something after he'd been wounded. Is the sinister figure Joey claims to have seen a figment of his imagination? A side effect of the drugs? Or was it something much darker? As he tells his story Joey fears that not only was he aware of it, but it was aware of him. What if it followed him? The Talent.This was designed as a small scale production with two characters, one location, and one scene. The roles are being played by two actors with professional television and stage credits. The actor playing Joey appeared in the series 'Criminal Minds' and the actor playing the doctor had the lead role in a stage production of 'Dracula.' The photographer has ten year experience and hundreds of hours of material online.Where Do the Funds Go?Because of the complexity of the script, also a very dark shoot with several things happening behind the characters, I've decided to bring in the best editor I can find. I've seen her work, she's very good, and is in high demand. She has been offered large scale projects and getting her to consider this one on the side was no easy task. Your donation will go to the finest video artist around. The Final Product.This is being done under the umbrella of a local public access station. In exchange for giving them the rights to broadcast it we are able to use state-of-the-art HD cameras, lights, sound and other equipment. In addition to that it will be released on youtube and entered into local film and video contacts. I have also heavily promoted my previous projects online to other Public Access stations across the world. 'Secret Fortunes,' my first production was picked up and broadcast by a station in Cape Town, South Africa. I was recently contacted by Temple University Television in Philadelphia and all of my previous work, including the 57 min post-apocalyptic drama ""In the Shadows of November."" My films are being scheduled for broadcast to their 1,600,000 subscribers. Both of these titles are available on youtube. Thank you for taking the time to read this campaign and I sincerely hope you can help us by making a donation today. Respectfully, Bill Albert",This project has already been shot in its entirety so there are no risks or challenges.  I was originally planning on editing it myself but met someone with far more talent in editing.,https://www.kickstarter.com/projects/1129260597/who-wins-the-ultimate-battle?ref=discovery_category_newest,1129260597/who-wins-the-ultimate-battle,"THE IDEASThough ""Death Always Wins"" is a short film it touches on some very big ideas. Joey is a thug for the mafia in Chicago in the 1920's. He's loyal, strong, and deadly but not necessarily the brightest of Mr. Scapelli's busters. Sometimes it takes a lot for him to understand but, once he's got it, Scapelli knows Joey will get the job done. Once again Joey is on the wrong side of a gun on a hit and a doctor with less than stellar conditions has to save him. The difference this time is that Joey, after being wounded, has seen something. Something that scares even him and he has to tell the doctor about it and, despite his fear, Joey figures he's seen the worst and come out on top. After all, he beat death, didn't he?THE PRODUCTIONThis video has already been shot using professional, experienced actors and camera. The actor playing Joey has appeared in several professional production including an episode of ""Criminal Minds."" The actor who plays the doctor has had lots of stage experience including the lead role in a stage production of ""Dracula."" Behind the camera and lighting was the director of a local Public Access Station with ten years of field experience. You can see some of the raw unedited footage, including stock footage for newsreels that will be used to help establish time and place. 10:00 minutes is available at:https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-viHDwV8ZewTHE STORYTELLER:I have self-published several short stories on Kindle and the full length novels ""Time Web Tremors,"" ""The Secrets of Starpoint Mountain,"" and the ""The Shadows of Starpoint Mountain."" The next novel, ""The Ghosts of Starpoint Mountain,"" will be available this fall. I have also produced several dramatic videos and documentaries. I have extensively promoted my productions online and was recently contacted by Media Acquisitions at Temple University Television where it is being added for viewing by their 1,600,000 viewers.DRAMA - IN THE SHADOWS OF NOVEMBER PROMO:https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v49VaRVejRIDRAMA - IN THE SHADOWS OF NOVEMBER:https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zKvUttXyZigDOCU - THERE'S SOMETHING ABOUT THE DOCTOR:https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P5_YWLNhhQMWHERE THE MONEY WILL GO:I had originally planned to do the entire project myself and all the remains at this point is the editing. What has changed is the I have met someone more talented at that process than myself and would like to get her involved with the process. She is incredibly talented, a much better eye than I have, which makes her in high demand. Getting her involved and committing her to this would take it over the top. It is film festival quality work and her creativity will make it a real standout video.","THERE ARE NO RISKS.  The film, as I said, has been shot and will be finished.  With your support for her talent this editor will make a great film unforgettable."

It will be quite large 150cm by 150cm, with the shorter sides being 70cm and 80cm on peach skin fabric(which is a bit like a less shimmery satin)and there will be a zipper on one side so it can be stuffed with whatever filling you prefer(I prefer polyfill as it is very cheap and quite soft). Hurdle: The issue, however, is they aren't going to get made without you. Since they are so unique, they are going to be a pretty penny to make, and here's where you come in. Place your order, and once the thresh-hold is met, I will be able to place the order and get them made for everyone.Guarantee: I'm not going to rush you if you don't have the funds right now. I'm leaving the pre-order up for an entire month, until November 15th, so hopefully everyone who supports will have their pillows in time for the holidays.

My name is Bella Moreno and I am a cartoonist who specializes in creating colorful animal artwork.While this is my FIRST Kickstarter, I have experience in producing enamel pins, plushies, custom clothing, backpacks and much more.I really wanted to create an LGBT themed pin collection, so I thought lions were PERFECT for the task. Although I would like to include every flag right off the bat, I would also like to make the goal managable! So I've decided to start small and work my way through the different Pride Lion designs I've created. If any stretch goals aren't met, they will be reused in future campaigns as it is my goal to include ALL flags eventually!What happens to my money if the goal isn’t reached? Your card will only be charged if the project you’re backing is successfully funded and reaches its funding deadline. If the project does not reach its funding goal, your card is never charged. You can also change your pledge at any time or remove it.Why not include all of the flags at once? I personally WANT to be able to include them all right off the bat. I have created 16 individual designs. If I included every design upfront, the goal would be around $5,500-$7,000. I feel it would be easier to reach and manage (for me) to work in stretch goals. So any designs that may not be reached in this campaign, can be reused in a follow-up campaignI want the ___ lion pin but it hasn't unlocked yet.Please back anyway! If the design isn't unlocked before the campaign ends, you can always cancel your pledge and you won't be charged.Below are the specs and concepts for each of the pins. Each of them feature the the same mold, but they are each colored differently to resemble the different pride flags.","~ Colors may vary between your monitor and the physical product.~ Please be aware that I am just one person! I pack all of my orders by hand by myself with help from my mom (she rocks!) so patience is appreciated.~ There could be delays in production or shipping, hopefully nothing will interrupt the timeline but, life happens! I will do everything in my power to get your pins to you in a timely manner. The coronavirus has the possibility of picking back up again here in the states, so there could be shipping delays if things get any worse. ~ Please make sure all of your information is entered correctly.

My name is Bella and I am a freelance artist and merchandiser. I’ve been creating all types of merchandise for a couple of months now. I create many different things such as pins, backpacks, clothing and plush toys! You can find me and my work at the following: Twitter ~ Instagram ~ ShopWhile I am not entirely Panamanian, I’m whats considered a Panamerican! Meaning I come from both a north american and panamanian heritage. So I’d like to bring a little bit of my own culture into a project I can share with others. I've decided to create pin designs that feature the iconic sugar skulls and some cute, familiar faces. They are all inspired by one of my favorite holidays, Dia De Los Muertos! For those who are unfamiliar with the holiday, Dia De Los Muertos is a holiday celebrated throughout Mexico and other parts of south america, in particular the Central and Southern regions. If you ever observe the holiday, you’ll notice the beauty that comes with the celebration of life and death. Bright colors, intricate patterns and designs, marigold flowers and the infamous sugar calaveras or ”skulls”.so with that... here are my pin designs!each hard enamel pin features a character, a themed calavera (skull), and screen printing on the surface of the pin. some pins will feature different metal plating colors such as black nickel, rose gold and gold.These pins will be quite large as well. a total of 1.75 inches wide (height may vary) so the pins look uniform if placed together. Screen printing for the skulls comes at an additional cost so the price for these pins is a little more than normal. I hope the price is understandable :)How do I tell you which pin I want? A survey is sent out to all backers after the campaign ends. From there, you can choose a pin from the unlocked options.Will I be able to get these pins anywhere after the Kickstarter has ended? Yes, but only if we meet our goal! It is also worth noting that the prices for these pins are exclusive to those who back this project. After the campaign, pins will be for sale in my webstore at an increased price. Now is the best price and time to grab these pins?What happens to my money if the goal isn’t reached? Your card will only be charged if this Kickstarter meets the minimum goal within the deadline. If the goal isn’t met, your card will never be charged.What if the pin I want isn't unlocked yet? Back anyway! The more backers we have, the more funding we receive to unlock more pins. If the pin you want isn't unlocked by the end time, you can cancel or change your pledge.How are pins unlocked? As with all crowdfunding projects, we will only be able to produce products that are fully funded. So if we do not reach a certain stretch goal, that design will remain locked.NEW STRETCH GOALS! SHINY EDITION: due to the lack of color difference between Glaceon, Leafeon, and Flareom’s shiny versions, they will not be included in the Shiny Stretch goals. It would’ve resulted in the pins having only one or two alternate colors, which didn’t seem worth it. But, I hope you like these super colorful (and glittery) critters as much as I do!FREEBIE STRETCH GOAL","- You will only be charged if this Kickstarter reaches the goal!

My name is KEnnEth and I'm from Southern California. I am an artist, a science geek, a history nerd & a nature lover who takes great pride in being resourceful. I have actively enjoyed prospecting and geology for almost a decade now & I have been highly interested in nature and living off the land My whole life. Years ago I combined a passion for the science of magnetism, a love of geology and a fondness of world history into what I call a Magnetic Zen Garden. I have always found harvesting and working with magnetic blacksand extremely therapeutic & peaceful. I had seen people use different colored sand & decided to make a Zen Garden using magnetic blacksand. It was then that the geology lover in Me thought to use magnetic iron ore specimens for the decorative rock.. then the science geek in Me demanded that I also include actual magnets. Finally, My creation was born!  I even came up with the fancy catch phrase ""A Scientific Twist on an Ancient Tradition."" I have been producing these for years now. I'm the owner of a California Mineral Claim (CAMC310941) and personally hand harvest all of My own Magnetite & Hematite to make these Magnetic Zen Gardens. Let Me tell you: Iron is Heavy & it is Hard Work! Word travels fast these days. But I was shocked to recently discover that copycat distributors are mimicking My creation and selling poorly constructed versions. I have big dreams and goals for these awesome magnetic displays and I am even the proud owner of MagneticZenGardens.com I need your help! I am here to raise funds for Two Main Goals:Here is a video I made. It details a brief history of Zen Gardens, describes what a Magnetic Zen Garden is & briefly demonstrates setting one up.

I am a poor sketch artist. But here is a rough sketch of the potential Interactive Magnetic Zen Garden: Here is a quick little video showing different magnetic patterns: For those who are interested, here are a couple pictures of My California Mineral Claim, CAMC31o941: I clean up after Myself. I take a lot of time to clean up after other people too. In this line of work I am constantly coming across dump sites, abandoned furniture, shooting sites & random acts of violence in the middle of otherwise absolutely beautiful desert land. I can't tell you how many piles of garbage I have seen literally inside the San Andreas Fault Line. I have always tried to clean up any trash I find on or near sites I am visiting. If I have the power to harvest & haul 25o pounds of Iron Ore from a creek bed - I have the power to hike out any trash I come across. Here is an example of what a difference Everyone can make if we just put a little effort into cleaning up our deserts...","I believe that the risks and challenges are very minimal. I have set out an adequate time frame in which to harvest enough material, assemble & distribute the Backers Rewards I've offered.I own the mineral claim & have the experience - I simply lack the funding to make this all happen in a timely manner.",https://www.kickstarter.com/projects/994513914/bismuth-bowls-elemental-display-art-to-amaze?ref=discovery_category_newest,994513914/bismuth-bowls-elemental-display-art-to-amaze,"I am an artist and I have been working with Bismuth for about 2 years now. I started off just making crystals. But now I enjoy using Bismuth to make geodes, bowls, plates, blobs and just about anything else I can think of. The metal itself is rather heavy, the crystal formations that it creates are truly amazing and the rainbow of different colors it can reflect are absolutely beautiful!Bismuth is a chemical element with the symbol Bi and atomic number 83. It is a brittle metal with a white, silver-pink hue. Bismuth is one of very few materials that have a greater density as a liquid than as a solid. Only a few other materials such as water, gallium and germanium exhibit this property. The spiral, stair-stepped structure or ""Hopper Crystal"" of Bismuth is the result of a higher growth rate around the outside edges than on the inside edges. The variations in the thickness of the oxide layer that forms on the surface of the crystal causes different wavelengths of light to interfere upon reflection, thus displaying a rainbow of colors.The process of making Bismuth Bowls is simple enough: Melt your Bismuth, poor it into your bowl mold, allow the sides to cool and then poor off the remaining liquid metal before it solidifies completely. However, it is a lot harder than it sounds! To understand how the metallic crystals are formed is a science while perfecting the color, shape & overall appearance of the Bismuth is truly an art.Every one of the crystals, geodes & bowls that I make come out completely different & unique - each one is an absolute original. The pictures I have provided are all pieces that I have personally created. While they will give you a good idea of what your Bismuth Crystal, Geode or Bowl will look like - Please remember that every piece will be completely unique.I would like to do a series of Large Bismuth Bowls and I am here looking for funding for materials, supplies & tools. I already own a handful of tools & supplies. But I want to update/improve the setup that I am currently using. Bismuth as a raw metal sells anywhere from $1o-15/lb in bulk. I mentioned earlier that Bismuth has a greater density as a solid than as a liquid. As a result - I need around ten pounds of it just to create a three pound bowl. The remaining seven pounds are totally salvaged & reused! But if I were to melt down just three pounds, it would only make a bowl that weighed around half a pound at the most. . . So I need to buy a Lot of Bismuth to make a series of Large Bowls!I would also like to create a short video detailing how I make these Bismuth Crystals, Geodes & Bowls to educate everyone on the process. Ideally, it would be great if I could compile enough supplies to start offering Bismuth products online. My website currently offers PLENTY of art & art supplies - but this is the first time that I am making My Bismuth Art available online! =)The Rewards I have setup are simple enough:Here are a bunch of pictures! Everything from the raw metal to the cooking process, the crystals to the bowls & lots more!",The Risks & Challenges involved are extremely minimal!I am very experienced with making these bowls and have made over 1oox to date.I have set very quick turn-around times for the rewards as this whole project will take less than two weeks to complete.

Today I'm introducing four (now SIX!) designs to be made into rose gold hard enamel pins!These pins are for all my foodies, video game geeks, and Asian/Korean culture fans out there!(stretch goals will continue to be updated as we reach new milestones!):1. PEACH version of Soju-Mana Pin:*New Peach ver. Soju-mana pin to be unlocked at $2,800! (36mm, Rose gold hard enamel)2.""Shin"" Ramen pin:*New ""Shin"" Ramen pin to be unlocked at $3,000! (approx. 30mm, Rose gold hard enamel).-To add this pin (or additional pins in general) to your pledge, just add ($9/additional pin) to your current pledge for early birds ONLY OR add ($10/additional pin) to your current pledge for regular backers.Pin Specifics:Backing the campaign! Early birds pay $9/pin+get extra goodies like matching mini stickers and Regular backers pay $10/pin. Extra pins will be sold on my Etsy for $11+/pin. There are four designs that will be unlocked at their respective funding milestones (info in the graphic below).Pledging is risk free. Since Kickstarter is an all or nothing platform, your money won't leave your account unless the project succeeds. You are also able to change, or even cancel, your pledge at any time before the end of the campaign!Timeline*Please note that all of these dates are estimates of the timeline. Any major variations from this will laid out for you guys via Updates.","Date of fulfillment may be subject to changes due to Covid-19. I have worked with this manufacturer for several past pins and have good faith that there will also be no issues with the quality. I have also gotten these designs proofed and checked by my manufacturer so designs such be able to completed without major design changes. However, colors on screen differ from those that can be physically mixed so there may be slight differences in pin mockup colors versus the colors in the physical pins. As with any changes, I will be as transparent as possible and will update backers timely!"

It's an artistic vision for you to wear.You love to bake, you enjoy cute whacky things that no one else may enjoy (talking to your appliances at home perhaps), and most importantly you love to wear it, but you can't seem to find that perfect shirt to show it. This is where Floral Oven T-Shirts come in. They show off your love for the cute, the strange and the baker status you own so proudly.Inspired by the craving of baked goods and desire for greenery behind concrete walls at work one day, the thought of combining both scenarios illustrated itself on my sketchbook. It’s time to escape the daily rush and embrace the whacky baker within.If you are interested in learning more about me and my work, check me out Instagramor my online store!As the first goal of the campaign, the Home-Styled Sakura design will be screen-printed on a white 100% cotton T-Shirt. The design is approximately 13"" x 17"" inches (32cm x 43cm) and will fund at $800.At the end of the campaign, a survey will be sent to all backers in order to confirm what you would like depending on the amount you pledge and shirt sizes.Whether or not you can get a shirt, you can certainly be part of the Floral Bake Sale! LIMITED EDITION5"" x 7"" holographic prints will be available as a pledge along with a limited run of sticker sheets (can be pledged in a bundle) and an EXCLUSIVEKickstarter sticker.May-June: Kickstarter campaignJune-August: Production of t-shirts, prints, and stickersAugust-September: Packaging and Shipping rewards!*Delays and anything of that nature will be known through Kickstarter and Instagram.Interested in buying extra shirts or stickers for a friend, family member, or yourself? Add the amount of any of these extras to your pledge and email me with the information! I will have a backer survey at the end of the campaign if it is fully funded.","Risks that come with this project is a conversion of current colors to Pantone colors and possible changes in designs, as they are in the early stages. I will be using Awesome Merchandise as my manufacturer for both the cotton shirts and sticker sheets, and have been given a rough estimate of production time and price based on the amount of colors for the shirt.*Delays and anything of that nature will be known through Kickstarter and Instagram.",https://www.kickstarter.com/projects/celestium/sakura-petals-resin-jar-hard-enamel-pins?ref=discovery_category_newest,celestium/sakura-petals-resin-jar-hard-enamel-pins,"Hello, my name is Celeste. I am digital artist currently attending art school as a BFA Cartooning major who has been doing art seriously for 2 years now.Inspired by the time I spent making resin jars with my friends at their dorm, I thought that it would be interesting to try and make a digital version.And so, doodling in my sketchbook for a few days while looking at references and my own jar that wasn't fully complete, I came up with this design. The creation of this jar stems from a bonding moment and I would love to share that with you all in a more tangible form.WebsiteInstagramEach hard enamel pin will be approximately 1.5 inches (38mm) and have gold plating. The original pin design and its color variant feature clouds and sakura petals!*Add-On prices are 40% off the original shop price. Please let me know what add-ons you have pledged for!Stretch GoalsAlthough I would love to fund both pins right of the get-go, funding each one at a time is definitely more realistic! After reaching the minimum $350 there will be a stretch goal of the second pin and I will be adding more depending if we get past $700!For this project I aiming to raise $350 to cover the following fees:If anything changes during production and assembly, I will keep backers up to date via Instagram and Kickstarter!","About a year or two back I did two Kickstarters and have learned so much from that time. I realized that my goals weren't exactly realistic and that I needed more communication with the manufacturer to understand pricing.Although this is my first time ordering enamel pins, the reviews and transparency for this manufacture are of a strong reputation. I have been following a multitude of artists and their journeys in making enamel pins so I am not a stranger to the process.I have ordered merchandise (washi tape, acrylic charms, and lanyards) through Chinese manufactures so I understand that communication and transparency are very important. Delays due to customs, errors in making, and any other issues related to the production process may happen but I will make sure to be upfront with you my backers through these next few months.Once the pins are in my possession I will be checking over them for any errors before shipment. International orders will take a little longer to arrive, but I will do all that's in my power to make the journey smooth as possible."

All manner of jazz language has been heard coming from local and regional talent; names including Eric Hofbauer and Lilly Maase have graced the stage. Now it's time we brought another heavyweight into the fold. John Ellis is highly regarded as being one of the best sax players and band leaders around. If you aren't familiar, check him out with his killing band, Double Wide:He has been a semi-finalist in the Thelonius Monk International Saxophone Competition multiple times, played with musicians ranging from Mos Def and Norah Jones to Kurt Elling and Jason Marsalis, performed all over the globe, has a wide ranging discography in which he covers just about every type of jazz you could think of...and the list goes on! This year he has been invited to play the prestiguous Newport Jazz Festival, one of the oldest and most storied festivals of all time, and because he'll be in the area he has agreed to the possiblility of performing on the August 3rd ""Is This Jazz?"" show!This is an opportunity we as jazz fans cannot pass up. Think about it like this: you could pay $80 to watch (from quite a distance) John perform for only 45 minutes, while being crammed next to hundreds of other people in the hot summer sun, paying ridiculous food and drink prices OR you could donate here, and go see him play for an hour and a half at an incredible local Providence club with outstanding food and drink, and be mere inches from the music as he tears down the house! Now, I think the answer is pretty clear. Please donate to this cause, to get John Ellis to Providence, to help grow a blossoming jazz scene, and to be part of bringing world class, phenomenal music to ""Is This Jazz?"" for all to enjoy. Thank you!John Ellis:http://www.johnaxsonellis.com/Is This Jazz?:http://isthisjazz.tumblr.com/",,https://www.kickstarter.com/projects/503771131/bring-eric-hofbauer-back-to-is-this-jazz?ref=discovery_category_newest,503771131/bring-eric-hofbauer-back-to-is-this-jazz,"October is going to bring with it some more amazing jazz to Providence in the form of the incredible Eric Hofbauer. That's right, Boston's own avant guitar virtuoso is looking to come back to the ""Is This Jazz?"" stage, and this time he's bringing a quartet to join in the fun. Perfoming with Hofbauer will be Pandelis Karayorgis on piano, Jacob William on bass, and Luther Gray on drums; a quartet of musicians playing music that is both indescribable and familiar. This is jazz that needs to be heard and experienced live, and this is your chance to do just that. Check out some of Hofbauer's music below and you'll understand why you absolutely need to come.As is the way of the world, these guys need money to make ends meet, so we have to raise a little bit to get them to Prov. However, Eric has agreed to give those who donate $25 or more, a special perk: your choice of one of his albums! WIth your donation, you get a free copy of American Vanity, American Fear, Myth Understanding, LEVEL, Lady Of Khartoum, or People I Like; all amazing albums to choose from, and one can be yours. You'll get that PLUS free admission and a poster. So don't wait, please donate, and help make this concert one of the best nights Providence will see this year!About Eric Hofbauer:“It’s guitarists like Eric Hofbauer that can make life so very interesting,” declares PopMatters.com’s John Garratt. Critics have called his music “intriguingly original” (Bill Milkowski, JazzTimes), “unique and distinct” (Tom Greenland, AllAboutJazz-New York), “both mischievous and playful” (Edwin Pouncey, Jazzwise) and “as unassumingly compelling as anything out there” (Nic Jones, AllAboutJazz.com). “No other guitarist in jazz,” adds The Boston Globe’s Andrew Gilbert, “has developed a solo approach as rigorous, evocative, and thoughtful as Hofbauer.”Known as “a crucial instigator in Boston’s DIY avant-jazz scene” (Jon Garelick, Boston Phoenix), Hofbauer has been one of the city’s most active musicians and organizers for the past decade. When not documenting his own distinctive approach as a solo guitarist, or leading his working quartet, The Infrared Band, he is performing and recording with such ensembles as the Garrison Fewell/Eric Hofbauer Duo, Garrison Fewell’s Variable Density Sound Orchestra and Charlie Kohlhase’s Explorer’s Club. He is also a 2009 recipient of the Massachusetts Cultural Council Artist Fellowship in Music Composition, and a teacher of jazz guitar,  jazz history, and composition at Emerson College and The University of Rhode Island.http://isthisjazz.tumblr.com",

Help grow our Honey Bee population in Southern Arizona.Help Us Help the Honey Bee and share in their gifts!Let's keep those busy bees buzzing! Honey Bees are incredibly important pollinators and hold a vital role in the food chain you and I enjoy. For a long time I’ve been mindful that we are losing many colonies to Colony Collapse Disorder (CCD) and there has also been a declining number of beekeepers to help steward colonies. I have always made sure my gardens and ponds have been Pro pollinator and helping of the local beneficial wild life. I would like to thank you all for taking the time to review this project and hopefully you will sign up with a pledge to support us in this project. I love honey as well as other gifts from the hive and look forward to a very mutually beneficial relationship with the bees. #savethebees #beethesolutionHelp us Bee the SolutionMy Wife and I have recently gotten property outside off Bisbee that we playfully call the “the D20 Ranch” and this month we will have a well and pond on the property and the first project I have is a new apiary (bee yard) and you are invited to help the bees as well as become a virtual beekeeper, which makes it completely safe and almost impossible to get stung :D I am hoping to find  backers to fund the bees, hive boxes, protective gear, smoker, tools, honey extractor, and assorted beekeeping supplies. Any extra funds will go to adding additional hives and more pollen rich plants that can thrive in the Southern Arizona country side such as Cactus, Mesquite, Cat Claw, Palo Verde, lavender, and other desert floral for an easy food source. Our long term goal is to add two hives each spring to other properties in our area as well. As a podcaster I want to share the plight of the Bee and If we meet out stretch goal to stream the colony’s ongoing adventures online, by installing a webcam feet away from one of our active hives at D20 Ranch Apiary, we hope that people will come to appreciate the honeybee for the fascinating and complex insect it is, in addition to its vital role in our ecosystem. Thanks for your support in getting to this level as we couldn’t do it without you!(Some Reference materials) Global Crisis: Honey Bee Population on the Decline (Scitable, June 24th, 2013) The Plight of the Honey Bee (National Geographic, May 10, 2013) Selecting Plants for Pollinators (The Pollinator Partnership, 2015) We are asking for $500, here's a break down on how the money will be spent. ·         $100+ tools ( Veil, Bee Brush, Frame Grip, Smoker, Hive tool, )·         $225 Honey extractor. ·         $375 Two Bee Hives.·         $280 two boxes of Live Bees. ·         $100 Estimated Credit Card and Kickstarter fees.Granted this adds up to more than $500 but We've already ordered the bees before the merchants sold out this upcoming this season. Plus we've been planning to follow up with a indigo go once we know what the Honey yields look like and we know how many shares we have with the Kickstarter.Early Bee Bonus!The First 15 folks to sign up at the $25 ""Honey Pot"" level or higher will get an additional portion of honey from anysurplus honey after our supporters have been covered. Stretch goals:$1000.00Three Hives are better than two!If we meet this goal we can afford to set up on occupy a third hive in the Apiary, that adds more options and supplies.*More too come!*","Risks and challenges1)    The bees: As with all environmental based projects there is always an element of risk. The highest of which would be to lose the bees that provide the honey we need to make the project a success. In order to mitigate this risk we have approached other beer keepers in the local area and they have offered their support to this project by assisting in providing personal experience and the amount of needs a bee population of this level requires for it to succeed. I'm a little apprehensive about offering honey as a reward. I just can't guarantee that there will be extra honey our first year so we will be adding Co-op of any additional honey to those over ---- level and a Busy Bee Bonus after we know for sure won't be taking from the bee's winter storage.   2)    The Sharing:There are obvious obstacles to having everyone observe the doorway to a honey bee colony. People are naturally cautious about being near these amazing insects with the potential to receive a sting. After much talk about how to share these amazing insects with others, we hit upon the idea of streaming video of the hive entrance for at least one season.                                                                               3)    The Marketing: This project will have many useful byproducts for the basic gift of honey for eating and making candy, using as a healing aid/antiseptic to wax used in candle making and balms/lotions. In this area we will be initially weak, due to a lack of experience in this field. That being said, we have found and contacted many outlets that say they would be interested in stocking our bee related products as they become available. Further research is still been carried out to get a real picture of the full long term opportunities, and although we are not certified organic, you can count on it being nectar from primarily urban and wild flowers surrounding Bisbee/Douglas area. To me personally the biggest risk to not do this project, with the influx of ‘Fake honey’ hitting our stores and a loss of one of the world’s biggest pollinators I truly want to do something that as the seasons go will scale up better and better projects and If this project succeeds I’ve already been asked to add it to our blog.",https://www.kickstarter.com/projects/1540288459/help-launch-season-five-of-dnd-journey-of-the-fift?ref=discovery_category_newest,1540288459/help-launch-season-five-of-dnd-journey-of-the-fift,"The D&D Journey of the fifth edition and the Creative Play and podcast Network aren’t in any danger of going away because all of us love and adore creating and sharing our adventures each week, and we won’t be stopping anytime soon! So why the Kickstarter you ask? While we vastly enjoy what we do, we want to be able to do a better job! Because D&D and Role playing games has always been a hobby we have enjoyed through the years, back in 2014 we decided to start sharing out game sessions online so we would remember were we left off in games and so I began my adventure in learning how to podcast, with our game sessions being recorded and edited in my spare time and I’ll admit some of those earlier episodes I had less time then others. We are asking for your support so we can give you a better Show along with extra perks like bringing you our listeners onto the show. We really care about our viewers and listeners and want to give you the best of what we've got; after all we listen to us too! Our first priority is Hosting for the podcasts, website and subscriptions. Believe it or not, you have to pay for these things. If were really lucky we will even use the Kickstarter stretch goals to add new podcasts, groups and functionality to the website like forums and galleries for the amazing fan art and fan submissions we’ve received. Our next priority is new equipment. The sound quality of some of our early episodes has been suspect to say the least. We could very easily decide to pick up recording again like we currently do, but we would like more options. Gone could be the days of random, last minute recording sessions at random venues. We definitely want to step up our games for you and would love if we hit the goal to record in a set up studio and host more online recording gaming events. Finally, we just really want to make cool swag and have a way to distribute it to our listeners. Creating things like t-shirts and dice bags are super fun, and this is an easy way for us to make things happen. We’re also pleased to announce that we will be including dice with our hand crafted dice bags.The D&D Journey of the fifth edition and our other podcasts have been a fantastic experience so far and we want to make it even better. We'd really like to purchase new audio equipment (mics, etc.) and more importantly hire artists to draw characters, places and events from the show. Jim would also like to dedicate himself to working on our podcasts full time, but this is just going to be his use of the ‘Wish’ spell if he ever gets so lucky. The better our Kickstart does the more episodes and things we can do! Here is a more detailed list of what you'll be getting.• A guaranteed 50+ episodes of D&D Journey of the fifth edition podcast a year. (Now that’s not including the other podcasts well be doing on Ragnarok and Roll and Creative play and podcast network)• An overall better sound quality on the show itself.• At least 4 Live episodes a year.• More Youtube content and videos of the cast.• A ""Welcome to Dungeon"" guide for new fans. So please, help us bring the D&D Journey of the fifth edition Podcast to the next level (so we can get that more Spells per day).Early Bird backersThe First 5 backers will be invited to a tabletop game day at a local game store or on Roll20 a week after the Kickstarter finishes!

Well set it up so you only have to listen  the podcasts you want to see! $6000 More Games!Well add another game system/podcast to the network as voted by the fans!","Risks and challengesAs long as all of the hosts stay healthy and sane, there will be no troubles in completing this project. Audio quality is a high standard that has became increasingly difficult to maintain, due to the inconsistency in recording locales which we try and keep to Local Game Stores. We didn’t know from week-to-week where we were going to be or even if we were going to record. Game stores, Hotels, garages, conference rooms... we have recorded at least one episode in all of them. I’m concerned that it might get to the point where the burden and uncertainty could be too much and we decided to stop the show, but that’s not happening anytime soon!Due to the nature of DnD, your favorite character could possibly die, but the host will have the option to replace their lost character. One of the biggest risks of us failing to reach the amount is that the project may not be as refined and fleshed out as imagined. The project will run into difficulties and scheduling problems, that's the nature of these projects. Its our ability to adapt to them that will help us gain the experience the industry expects us to have for similar projects.Individual episodes may not be ready in time or perhaps due to personal matters a cast member may not be able to record on a particular week. These problems would result in a couple of day’s extension.Guest appearances and play sessions will be conducted via Skype and Roll20. You will be expected to have a computer, internet connection and microphone to participate. Guest appearances will normally take place on Wednesdays and Thursdays at 830pm EST. Play sessions will be scheduled for weeknights between 8pm and 12am EST or weekends at various times between 10am and 10pm. Your first choice for scheduling may not be available, but we will do our best to get you a time that will work."
https://www.kickstarter.com/projects/474428175/artificial-reef?ref=discovery_category_newest,474428175/artificial-reef,"I am fond of fish. Like to see them, keep them, paint them, eat them...(Yep! That too!). In my blog 'A Queer Fish' I publish short stories and pictures on strange fish. The Banggai Cardinal, officially known as Pterapogon kauderni, is a well known fish in the aquarium trade. It's only found on one location in the ocean.With this project, the ARTificial Reef, I want to achieve two goals:First I will create a worldwide 'reef' or wall of handpainted fish. Each fish is a handmade painting of the Banggai Cardinal on a flat rock of approximately 15x15cm (depth 4cm), finished with glossy varnish. You may use the painting as a sculpture, a standing painting, a paperweight or even include it in your (new to built) wall. A multifunctional art object! Secondly, anyone supporting the first goal is asked to send me a 'Selfie' with the Art Rock (or card) in front of, or at least near a waterway. Rivulets, waterfalls, ocean shores, use tapwater if you like, any type of water will do. The Selfies will be published on a special website including a map with all localities where the Selfies were made. Thus creating an 'artificial reef' and an event to help celebrate World Oceans Day June 8, 2016.To built the ARTificial Reef all over the world I will create at least 195 Art Rocks. One for each country on Earth. Will you help me finishing this project? ",Please remind that every Art Rock will be handpainted.,https://www.kickstarter.com/projects/474428175/sos-6?ref=discovery_category_newest,474428175/sos-6,"With the release of ‘Finding Dory’ the industry fears an increase in the demand for Paracanthurus hepatus; the fish we know as Dory. Alas, Dory, or ‘Letter Six’ as it is known in Indonesia, is not yet reproduced in captivity. Taking care of these delicate fish is certainly not as easy as keeping Clownfish. And even though the IUCN states this species is not yet in danger (status: Least Concern); studies on the boundaries of its habitat are limited while the number of specimens in the wild remains unknown.Scientists and professionals in the aquariumtrade have reported that, due to the popularity of the first movie, sales numbers of Clownfish (Amphiprion spec.) increased 25%. As Clownfish are ‘easy’ to breed (note: for professionals and experienced hobbyists!), the additional sales hardly effected import of the lovely clowns. A variety of fancy forms has been developed. Hobbyists therefor nicknamed the Clownfish ‘Guppies of the sea’, referring to the popular and very productive freshwater guppy. Despite this similarity, keeping Clownfish is not as easy as keeping Guppies. Taking care of a marine aquarium has become much easier during the last few years; however, a regular tropical aquarium with fresh water still is the best way to start this hobby.SAIA (Sustainable Aquarium Industry Association) fears that the increase in import, may effect local populations of ‘Dory’. June 2015 SAIA already launched a campaign for awareness about Dory’s situation and to warn about overfishing due to the expected popularity of the Disney movie. Please take a look at the documentary ‘Searching for Letter Six’, available on the SAIA website. This movie tells it all...(Photo above: sample piece, small framed artwork)Letter six refers to the color pattern on the dorsal of the ‘Palette Surgeon’ (Wow! There really are many names for this fish!). The pattern resembles a perfect six. This project intends to help raising awareness of the situation of Paracanthurus hepatus.  My goal is to sell T-shirts and Mugs with the SOS-6 logo, asking you to help spreading this message on your social media. Except for the Tees and Mugs, I will create a limited number of handmade paintings, boxed in a glass frame. Yes, you can have your own fish without harming natural resources! (Note: every artwork is handmade, sand mixed with acrylics on paper, and includes the morse code ""S.O.S. 6"". Each item individually numbered and handsigned. Including a Certificate of Authenticity).Enjoy watching the Disney movie, but remember the real Dory may be hard to find in the wild and, if nothing will be done, become extinct at locations where fishermen catch aquarium specimens. Please spread this message on your social media (feel free to use my SOS-6 logo but don't cut off my signature); link it to the SAIA-site and show your concern by wearing an SOS-6 Tee.The best way to obtain your own Letter Six? Buy one of my unique, handmade artworks. Valuable collectibles wich do not harm or endanger wild populations!My goal? Raising awareness is the main goal. As you are reading this, I feel a part of the goal has already been achieved…Creating the artworks is an additional tool. Creating this many will be a challenge. Dare me!Stretched goals: ","What are the risks? Creating art is what I do. No unforeseeable risks there. Unfortunately the risks are all on Dory, Letter Six, the Palette Surgeon…right: Paracanthurus hepatus."

There is nothing more satisfying than creating something beautiful that everyone can enjoy.It has always been a dream of mine to be a mediocre oil painter, but the so-called ""good art"" is so hard to relate to. Who actually ""gets"" abstract art or enjoys shock art? Sometimes you just want a nice looking painting to stick above your fireplace without being embarrassed when guests come over. Trust me, it's easier to hang a mountainscape than defend your sexuality to your grandmother after she sees that collage of male genitalia in your bathroom. Also, does anyone actually want a painting of a chubby little naked cherub?So again: I am making normal art for normal people, and I'm selling it at a price point that normal people can afford. Let the rich snobby people have their literal cans of shit and naked baby paintings. We're better than that. We're normal.I am trying to make my first etsy sale, and I am raising money for new paint, brushes, and canvas so that I can keep practicing! I am not trying to make a profit off this project, nor am I trying to attack a lofty business plan using crowd funding. I am simply a dedicated hobbyist looking for help so that I can keep doing paintings like these:I paint a lot of waterfalls. Bitches love waterfalls.You can check out my etsy page and buy one!https://www.etsy.com/shop/GeoPaintingOr, better yet, pledge $125 and I'll make a new one. Well, I'll probably just follow Bob Ross again, but it will be new to me. ","Maybe there are a lot of people passionate about 40"" collages of male genitalia, crafted into the shape of *yet another* phallus.  If that's the case, then I guess I'm boned.I think sending a bunch of paintings to people in the mail will legitimately be fun.  I can't possibly comprehend a way where this won't be the best time of my god damn life.I plan to overcome any obstacles by embracing masochism and debasing myself for other people's amusement.  How?  No clue.  I guess you'll have to pledge a few bucks and find out.If my project isn't for you but you still think it's AWESOME, please use the share buttons above and help spread the word!

I will then digitize these paintings and ship them to a some amazing backers. I'll also upload a time lapse video for each painting on youtube. I strive to produce the best work that I can, and I'm always looking for new ways to hone the craft. There is nothing more satisfying than making something beautiful that everyone can enjoy.I am going to paint 30 episodes from ""The Joy of Painting"" in 30 days. I will then digitize these Bob Ross classics and ship them to a some amazing backers. You will be helping me spread a love for art and you'll possibly even get a very affordable painting out of it. Heads up, though: I will not be painting the same episode twice. If it comes up, we will deal with priority on a ""first come first serve"". Gotta keep it fun and fair, ya know?Here are some cool examples of paintings that I have done already, just to give you an idea of the quality of my stuff:There are tons more where these came from! Check it out:http://imgur.com/a/cK7Jd I cant wait to get some new paintings done! I have been painting for a long time, and I have a fairly strong grasp on the amount of material that is required to complete a project of this scale. The only financially tenable means of completing this project is for me to donate my entire personal stock of paint, brushes, and equipment towards this goal. I have managed to reduce the required funds for each painting to roughly $11, as broken down in the following chart:See that, right there? That's transparency. Don't let the number fool you, though. The true value of each painting will be set by the time and effort that goes into each one. The physical materials are the smallest cost for this type of project.I look forward to any questions that you may have regarding this project.Thanks for your support! ""Happy painting, and God bless you, my friend.""","I think sending a bunch of paintings to people in the mail will legitimately be fun. No sarcasm.  Paintings like this are already what I do to relax, and I'm really excited at the idea of doing A LOT of them in quick succession. The biggest problem I'm going to have is finding space to put all of these paintings while they dry.  Oil paintings do NOT dry quickly, and I'll need to find a storage solution that will keep so many of them getting the slightest bit dusty.My experience with etsy has pretty much hammered out all of the other logistical questions for a project this size.  I have a very good idea how much money and time this project is going to take to complete.  I have the scanning and uploading process down to a science. I can't wait!If I am unable to complete 30 paintings in 30 days, I will meet my obligation to my backers by volunteering my current art collection (15 of my own paintings) to make up the difference.  That's not exactly Plan A, though  ;)If my project isn't for you but you still think it's AWESOME, please use the share buttons above and help spread the word!

Funded means that at the very least, I get to print and distribute 4 original designs in the form of some cool Stickers (and T-Shirts) to a lot of awesome people who are into the same genres, hobbies, and lifestyle as myself - Science Fiction, Steampunk, Comic Books, Video Games, etc..Going over the Funding Goal and hitting Stretch Goals means that I can print the Stickers on better stock or add Contour-Cutting (Custom Shape Cutting), and another Series of Designs could go live and become Add-On's. I have designs lined up for Stickers such as Geeked On Zombies, Geeked On Vampires, Geeked On Cosplay, Geeked On Fantasy... I could do Geeked on Graphic Novels, Concept Art... Ninja's... Mech's... well, you get the idea. The list of designs could go on forever.As for the t-shirts, we're starting off with variations of the same designs from the Series 1 stickers, but stretch goals will include t-shirts for Series 2, option to buy Hoodies, and possibly upgrading from limited color silk screen printing to high quality full color sublimation printing.What's next? How about designs requested by YOU! Do we have enough people who want a Geeked on Role Playing Games Sticker? Let's make it! This whole idea came about because I saw an opportunity to create items that would allow people to express their geeky-ness for things they love.Whether you're a fan of these Pop Culture or know someone who is, this is your chance to contribute to my cause and help make these ideas come to life. Fund my project and you'll get some cool stuff in return!Thanks for helping,Ray Williams / Artiphats Graphics","The major parts of this project are the designing of the stickers, the production of the stickers, and the shipping of the stickers, as well as the production and shipping of the t-shirts. The designing is already being completed and new designs are already on the drawing board for Series Two and Bonus Items. Production will be done in part by printers that I have worked with in the past and in part by my self. I have direct access to oversize printers and presses and will personally be involved in all stages of production from concept of each design to shipping. The only real challenge will be to get everyone their exact order if I end up with thousands of backers, but that is a problem I would love to have. For the record, however, you might want to know that I worked in shipping for several years so I think I can handle any amount of shipping, mailing, and packing that will need to be done. As my first Kickstarter project, I'm making sure everything is pretty straightforward and as fool-proof (and smart-proof) as possible.",https://www.kickstarter.com/projects/489498824/make100-oil-abstracted-paintings-by-raymond-patric?ref=discovery_category_newest,489498824/make100-oil-abstracted-paintings-by-raymond-patric,"UPDATE 1-16-18: See table below for New Funding Goals!For the last few months I have been creating abstract oil paintings as a way to experiment with color combinations and texture. The paintings are done with different palette knives instead of brushes, and I use high grade oil paint from a few of the top brands.When I saw the announcement for the MAKE/100 event, I knew this was the perfect opportunity to share a limited run of the paintings with the public.This specific run of paintings will all be done on 8x10 canvas panel. The size allows for easy and inexpensive shipping that I can include in the price of the pledge, and is a standard frame size for those that want to add a frame for display. (Frames not included.)The photos shown are paintings that I have done in various sizes but in similar style to the 100 I will make for this project. These new paintings will be 100% original, each one unique and will only be revealed as each backer receives their painting.First and foremost, support the arts! Visual Art is a vital way for many people to express themselves. Sadly art is too often thought of as unimportant, when more than anything it is our creativity as humans that greatly separates us from the rest of the animal kingdom. Keep art alive!Yes and no. Ideally I would love to have the freedom to just ""create"" each painting as I do them. My goal, if nothing else, is to absolutely make a beautiful piece of art that would look stunning in a nice frame, hanging on the wall of your home or office. I do understand that at minimum some people will have a color palette preference, so I will give each backer the opportunity to give me the main color to use in their painting and I will create it from there. The surprise will be part of the fun and I am more than confident that you will love the painting.Once all paintings have been shipped and received, I will upload photos of each one to my website and to social media. This way everyone gets to see all of the paintings together. In the future I may do a book or set of postcards and may also include these images in those collections. Please note that although I do retain some rights to the usage of these paintings I will NOT be making individual prints or duplicates of these 100 specific paintings available to anyone else at any later date.Please share this project on Social Media and thank you for your support.",There will not be any risks or challenges in this project that I cannot quickly take care of. I have priced all of the materials and shipping and I have already been doing similar paintings for a few months.

The following are the risks and challenges we have seen in our 40years of dressmaking journey.1. Fabric Issues: Yes, the risk of shrinkage or expansion is there in any loosely woven fabrics. Linen is unpredictable; either can expand or shrink if not correctly maintained. We do the heavy lifting initially by soaking the fabric for 12 hrs in water, shade drying it and ironing before cutting begins. This tedious process has been giving us favourable results and excellent feedback from our clients. Please follow the instructions mentioned in the 'Fabric Care Instructions' section. The supplier who supplies us the fabric has been with since 1990, and we are joint at the hip. 2. Sewing Issues: We are the people who cut and stitch, and that's all we know. We put our heart and soul in each craft we make in our workshop. We have our quality standards, and the piece gets replaced without a second thought if it fails the quality test. Buttons are hand-sewn and so as the detailing. Each shirt part gets hand-pressed before it reaches the machine. We have artisans who are still working in their 70s that is why I called my team an Old school. 3. Fit Issue: Yes, unfortunately, God's creation is not uniform; humans come with different shapes and build. To address this issue, we ask you to tell us your body type and body measurements after the campaign end. We will give you the best fitment if you give us accurate information about your body. We love to see your picture in your best fit shirt if you are serious about your fitment.4. Data Capture: This is the most significant risk of all mentioned above. We need your information after the campaign to proceed further. Any delay in providing your size and colour information may have a domino effect on later processes. 5. Shipping: We use a reliable shipping company that never failed us thus far. We also have a fallback to cover the risk of shipping delays. 6. I didn't like this shirt! - Returns are not accepted on Kickstarter items because we use your funds to cover production and other costs. We never failed to impress our clients, and we mean it. 7. COVID-19 Delay: Considering COVID-19, we pushed the delivery date to Feb 2021, but if things get better, you will get your shirt well before the promised time.

With the right machine we will also be able to expand our inventory of fine wooden gifts. The laser engraver that we are interested in purchasing is $12,000. In addition, each award will cost in materials and time.  We realize that this is an incredibly high goal so we have decided to make the laser engraver our ""stretch goal.""","Our biggest risk is time management! We are ages 13, 14, 16, and 17 and are busy in other areas of our lives. We have a dog business, selling German Shorthaired Pointers and Labrador Retriever puppies.

We had a lot of fun with it and we already have Jesse Heiman wanting to come back on the podcast over the summer (listen to his first episode here). The show is just a free form conversation between nerdy friends to discuss whatever comes to their minds which is typically nerdy subjects in their day to day lives. We also have some other podcast ideas that we think would be fun to do.We occasionally interview people either at comic book shops, or just sitting down one-on-one with them to discuss their lives. We have a number of awesome future guests that want to come on the show like filmmakers, comic book writers, and more, but we can't do a show without the proper funding. We want to promote our guests work, but without a podcast, it would be a little hard. No matter how much you pledge, our eternal thanks go out to you!NerdSync Productions has a lot of shows on YouTube that are just starting out. Check out the 30-second trailer below to see if anything strikes your fancy:Your pledges will go towards producing one year’s worth of podcasts including hosting fees, better audio equipment, and making your backer rewards. Any amount we go over will go straight to us producing our plethora of YouTube shows. Our goal is literally the least amount of funding we need to get started. With your generosity, we can upgrade further to produce better quality content for you all.As a backer, you could get your hands on some sweet rewards like these!If you pledge $100 or more, you may choose from either the COMIC MISCONCEPTIONS BUNDLE or the RENEGADE BUNDLE as your reward. Every reward tier afterwards will also include your choice of either of the two $100 bundles.Stay up to date with all the latest NerdSync news!Please spread this around to corners of the internet to help us reach our goal. Thank you for all of your help!",We are all struggling college students that just like to have fun doing the things we love at the expense of our wallets only. We do not want to charge in any way for any of our content. We honestly want to continue the podcast and still keep it free for everyone. Most of us are full-time students working one or more jobs and devoting all our money to keep this thing going. It's a struggle. This is why we need your help. We honestly won't be able to continue the show without your generosity. Our fate is in your hands now. Please spread the word and keep us up and running. Thank you all so much!,https://www.kickstarter.com/projects/nerdsync/the-nerdsync-podcast-0?ref=discovery_category_newest,nerdsync/the-nerdsync-podcast-0,"Every Monday, the NerdSync gang likes to sit down and tackle a topic that is on their hearts from video games, movies, comics, and more! There will occasionally be special guests on the show so you don't get bored with us. Guests range from YouTubers, fellow nerdy friends, and even celebrities!Remember: There are no nerdy things, only nerdy people. If you are a nerdy person, then this is for you! Take a listen to it right here on iTunes.You guys deserve the best. This Kickstarter project exists so we (you and us) can create the NerdSync recording studio!Season 1 of the podcast from 2012 was rough using only built-in computer microphones to record. In Season 2 (which is going on right now), we upgraded to a USB microphone that we all crowd around.That is not the best way to record. It picks up lots of room noise and causes some people to be louder than others depending on their position relative to the mic.Since we want to deliver the best content possible, we want to upgrade our equipment to make Season 3 sound much better for your ears! The third season will start recording on May 2, 2014.Our goal by the end of this Kickstarter is to fund a professional recording studio in which we can record season 3 of the NerdSync Podcast!We want to be as transparent as possible with you, so we've broken down the costs of exactly what we're going to be investing in. So here's a handy chart. We like charts!For the microphones, we are planning on investing in threeAudio-Technica AT2020 Side Address Cardioid Condenser Studio Microphones for about $80 each. (UPDATE: The microphones are now on sale for only $50 each which puts us closer to our $400 initial goal instead of the $500 stretch goal!)These microphones need to go somewhere, right? So we are buying twoNEEWER Broadcasting Studio Microphone Suspension Boom Scissor Arm standsfor $30 each. The reason we are buying two and not three is because we already own (and love) one of them. No need to buy a third one.To hook the mics up to the stands, and to protect from additional noise of us accidentally hitting the table, we are going to be getting threeLarge Diaphragm Condenser Microphone Shock Mounts for $12 each.We are also going to invest in threeFoam Windscreens for $20 each.To record to our computer, we need a mixer. The Behringer XENYX 1202 12-Input Mixerseems to suit our purpose just fine at $90.To go from the mixer to the computer, we need theBehringer UCA202 Audio Interface which sells for $30.You may notice that after adding that all up and calculating for shipping and tax, the total is closer to $500. So why is our goal only $400? Well, we do not want to put all of the effort on you wonderful people. We don't get paid for our podcast. We are just poor college kids. However, we plan on putting what little money we have in covering the rest of the total. We don't want you to think we're freeloaders!If you guys REALLY love us and we go over our goal, we would love to invest in another microphone, stand, shock mount, and pop filter so we can start getting more in-studio guests! That's about an additional $135 for another full setup.After that, we wanted to get someFoam Acoustic Panels to help reduce the reverb coming off the walls. That'll be about $50 more.Maybe if we go way over our goal, we can finally get that website up and running so you guys who don't like to use iTunes can listen to and download the podcast right through your favorite browser. That's going to be about $200 in order for that to happen.Keep spreading the word around so we can give you all the audio quality you deserve!","As I stated above, we are just a bunch of poor college kids with most of our money going to car payments and food (and one of us is getting married soon, so that's costly too). The podcast really depends solely on the immense generosity of you awesome folks!"

This passion was birthed through pain and hardship in his life, leading him to begin a movement called UN>LIKELY. In 1 Corinthians 1 we are told: ""God uses the weak and foolish (unlikely) people of this world to bring to shame the proud."" By the end of the chapter we see that God uses those people so that He gets all the glory! How amazing is that?!? The God of the Universe using unlikely people to bring Him glory! It doesn't matter what these people have done in their past, where they are from, or what they look like. God's grace is amazing and real, and Jordan's music brings this reality to life for others.Jordan began writing and recording music in April 2011 after God called him to take a leap of faith into the unknown world of the music industry. Since then, he has traveled the United States, touring, sharing his testimony through music, and watching as the Gospel of Jesus Christ impacts and transforms lives. Since Jordan has been performing music professionally, God has opened many doors that only He could have opened and has done many things through those opportunities that Jordan never would have thought possible. This includes witnessing to and discipling secular music artists, all of whom are now using their musical talents to glorify God! Not only that, Jordan's raw and honest music, his powerful testimony, and his unshakable faith have led countless concert-goers to have radical encounters with Christ's love. And what does Jordan say about this wild n' amazing Kingdom journey he's been on?""God gets the glory.""https://jordancopas.com/https://www.youtube.com/jordancopas  https://www.facebook.com/JordanCopashttps://www.instagram.com/jordancopasig/  https://twitter.com/jordancopas  ","Honestly, None!EVERYTHING I DO, I WANT TO DO IN EXCELLENCE.I believe there's no risks involved with you backing this project.

Billing is precise to the number of total minutes worked. The app works by capturing work screens every minute when the mouse has moved or the keyboard has been tapped recently. For example, if your worked 37.42 hours at $30 per hour the total bill is $1,122.60, down to the penny. It's that simple.Distractions If you walk away for a cup ofcoffeeor the dog needs attention, no worries, the work screen capturing stops and resumes as soon as you move the mouse or tap a key upon return to work.Types of Work What types of work can you capture? Any computer work in accounting, research, writing, project management, graphic design, website or mobile programming. You can also enter hours per day not spent capturing computer work screens such as meeting times.Filter Apps WorkScreens will only screen capture apps you approve on Windows and Mac. For example, if you have five apps visible on your desktop, say Word for Mac, Excel for Mac, Coda text editor, email, and Skype, then you can set WorkScreens to capture only Word, Excel, and Code app windows - all other parts of the screen capture including email and Skype window areas are set black. How cool is that?Filter Screens Before producing total work hours, you have the option to rapidly iterate through each work screen captured anddelete any undesired work screen.Traveling Advantage If you are traveling on a work vacation, you can show and bill on your midnight to 3am make-up work. No Problem-O.Employing You can use WorkScreens to successfully track your remote programming contract work and keep integrity with accurate and transparent billing hours.Cloud Integration WorkScreens Pro will allow you to show your work screens from your DropBox or other cloud account.Bill Reports The WorkScreens Pro version will allow you to email attached orHTMLthemed billing reports.","A working code base has been used reliably the past few years. A few risk points and challenges remain.1) Programming screen storage on DropBox is straightforward. I have considerable experience in mobile cloud programming and will be expanding WorkScreens to GoogleDrive, OneDrive, Amazon S3 or Zocalo.2) Filtering to capture only desired apps (everything else on screen is black) on Mac is partially coded and the Windows code remains to be created. The Windows app filter ought to be straight forward, since I have coded on Windows over three decades using languages Java, 'C#', 'C++', 'C', Visual Basic, and Python.3) The keyboard tap remains to be coded.

https://www.kickstarter.com/projects/811020717/left-sound-bbq?ref=discovery_category_newest,811020717/left-sound-bbq,"7 years ago, I went to me first crawfish boil Louisiana. I was hooked. I loved the social dinning and community of a crawfish feed. I threw my first crawfish party that summer in Belfair, WA.Each year since that first one, I have thrown a big party and tried to exceed the previous years performance. As each year past, I added more and more grilling and BBQ to the party. That is where I really fell in love. Last year I did brisket and pork, but with the equipment I had, it was exceptionally difficult to make enough food and keep the quality high.I want to make greatbbq. This last party showed me that. My pulled pork and brisket were some of the best I have ever done. I would even go as far as saying the brisket was the best I ever had. I want to enter bbq competitions this year and do some festivals or catering events. The only way to make this happen is to get a great smoker and excellent equipment. Without good equipment, the whole dream will fall apart.To make my dream come true, I will need a high quality smoker, a pop up tent, mobile wash station, a travel refrigerator, a small generator, and a digital thermostat. What’s this going to cost? The minimum cost is going to be $3000. That’s a lot of cash. But I know how to make it worth it! I will be hosting a Summer BBQ series from June to September. It should be between 5 and 6 events. 3 will be at my home in Belfair and 2 will be somewhere on the Eastside of Lake Washington (Between Bothell and Marymoor Park). The Eastside events will be in August and September. Dates will not be confirmed until we reach our goal due to the reservation costs for King County Parks.Summer Series Specifics: Lots of parking at my house in Belfair, WA. This isn’t a potluck, this is an event. There will be food, lawn games and entertainment. Here is the BBQ you will get at the party:I will also be providing hot dogs, hamburgers, coleslaw, macaroni salad, and potato salad. Plus an array of non-alcoholic beverages to wash it all down. Not all donations will result in being able to attend the party. Of course the best value donations are the multiple ticket donations. Please visit our facebook page for updates on the project and details https://www.facebook.com/leftsoundbbq . Thanks for your support. T-shirts will have this logo on it:Sky blue t-shirt:Criteria for events at your location (Catering and Oatmeal Packages)-Selection of date needs to not conflict with any pre-scheduled cooking events -Your location needs to be able to be accessible from street with level grading-Outdoor space for kitchen setup (10' x 10' Tent, plus 5'x10' for smoker)-BBQ team will need at access to location at least 6 Hours before event start for setup and proper cooking time-Host to select start time between 1 and 5 PM.-Garbage, Recycling, and Compost is the responsibility of the host location.",Some of the smokers have an 8 week grill time. This would delay the start of the Left Sound Summer BBQ series.,https://www.kickstarter.com/projects/811020717/left-sound-bbq-music-festival?ref=discovery_category_newest,811020717/left-sound-bbq-music-festival,"This is my second attempt at a Kickstarter, and this one is a much smaller goal. I already have a smoker and I just need to get a few things to start me rolling. The goal is to get a temperature control system for the smoker. On long cooks (brisket, pork) the more consistent the temperature, the better the quality of the bbq. The fan system will maintain the correct temperature and alert me if the temp fall below a specific level if the fuel (wood) runs out.For being a fan of my food, I will get you some food. We have a great location on Tahuya Lake in Bremerton that will be a perfect place for some BBQ. We also will have one of the great new bands from the Kitsap Peninsula 'Citizen Z' playing some great music at the lake. No alcoholic beverages are being provided as a part of this project or event.Our goal is just to have at least 20 people pledge. With a goal of $400 we will be able to buy the fan system. All funds above that goal will be used for the catering license, business license, WLCB catering license, food storage, thermometers, foil, seasoning shakers, ice chests, folding tables, chafing dishes, pop up tent, food slicer, latex gloves, firewood, charcoal, and heavy duty tin foil!The event will by held on August 1st. If you want to back and can't make that date, let me know. I will be doing test cooks all summer long and you can come out to my place and do a pre-tasting if you can't attend the big event.We also have swag in t-shirts and bottle coozies.The last of the rewards are private catering events at your location. Event will be BBQ Delivered to your location for up to 10 people. Date of your catering event will need to be approved at least 3 weeks prior to requested date. We can also give you a more personalized menu if needed. The 'obscene backer' package is serious. If you want to throw cash at us, we will take it!","I have made the goal for this project attainable.

It creates vibrant shades and blends like nothing else. Since it is a dry medium, it is somewhat delicate and needs to be displayed behind glass with a mat.I use artist grade pastel sticks, pencils, and the new pan pastels. I paint with these pastels on Crescent Utra-Black Mounting Boards. The materials I use are of the highest quality and will last a lifetime.I decided to do this Kickstarter because my 8 year old daughter needs a full-sized piano to continue her piano lessons. She has been using a smaller keyboard, but has outgrown it and now needs a full-sized keyboard with weighted keys. I have found a good one that costs $400.Normally, I would just purchase it with the proceeds from my normal art sales, but my wife is currently not working full time due to being in clinicals to become a midwife, so my art sales are being put towards our normal living expenses.Anything over the $400 will be put towards building a art studio for myself. I currently create my art in our dining room. It is not ideal. I have a perfect space for a studio, but it needs some renovations, most importantly heat and air conditioning.Stretch Goal #1 $400 - Unlocked!Fully Funded! If we are fully funded every backer will receive a thank you note signed by my daughter for her new piano!Stretch Goal #2 $1400Air conditioning for my new studio! If we get to $1400 every backer will receive a 5"" X 7"" limited edition signed and numbered print of one of my paintings!Stretch goal #3 $2500Fully renovated new studio! If we get to $2500 every backer at or over the ""6"" X 9"" Animal Portrait - Artists Choice"" tier will recieve a 8"" X 10""limited edition signed and numbered print of one of my paintings!You may have your 6"" X 9"" or 9"" X 12"" painting professionally framed by myself. This ensures that it is framed properly and will offer additional protection to the painting. It will be a simple black wooden frame with a white mat.The cost of a mat and frame for a 6"" X 9"" painting is $25.The cost of a mat and frame for a 9"" X 12"" painting is $35.This includes the additional shipping cost.Due to it's large size and fragility of the large frame, frames are not available for the 15"" X 20"" artwork.Add-on instructions: To add an add-on to your pledge, follow these steps:I can create one 9"" X 12"" painting a day, and I will start creating as soon as backers come in. I plan on creating and shipping the paintings in the order they are received. When you receive your painting will all depend on how many backers there are and when you backed this Kickstarter. I hope to have everything shipped out by the end of May, 2017.Shipping will be done via the USPS. I have shipped art all over the world through this service with no problems.","The risks are minimal. There is always the possibility I could get injured and have to delay the creation process and there is always the possibility of a delay in shipping. However, these are very unlikely."

We have banded together in our love of creative (and consistent) storytelling to show you what the imagination of a handful of people with a common goal can do to change the world.What is ""LEGENDS""?Legends is an online, creator-owned comic/graphic novel set in the modern day in a world very similar to our own, but also so very different. Legends is intended to be an ongoing full colour graphic novel series that is targeted towards an audience that are fans of science fiction and fantasy that desire a well written, consistent universe with explained rules that consist of clear and permanent consequences.Our story line sets us apart from everything else by following these guidelines we have set for our characters, the excuse of “because its magic” will never be used as well as death being a permanent for every character minor or otherwise (exceptions will be made for zombies, mummies and necromancers etc).Note: Digital and printed copies are 20 pages (not including front and back cover)In this universe there are monsters hiding in the dark, things that go bump in the night. All the classic creatures of myth, but with a fresh coat of paint (so to speak). But also our own original characters thrown into the mix. Find out more when you meet some of the main protagonists of our storyline such as:Legends is not for everyone, there is no particular emphasis on romance,horror,mystery or comedy, the overall tone of the universe is dark with a dark sense of humour.Help Us OutHelp us out and take a look at some cool designs that we have to offer on our Redbubble Or follow us on Facebook.RedbubbleTableFlip-Entertainment","Major risks and challenges we faced along the way, was primarily finding the funding to make our dream come to.

Frustrated by a series of failed attempts to launch a comic, we tried one last time, set out to launch our first issue. Full time University Students, as you know, don’t have much in the way of disposable income, but we worked hard, saved up and within that time we had done it! Issue #1 of Legends was complete, and now only a few months later we’re almost ready to launch Legends Issue #2! (With your help)We at Tableflip are a small group of imaginative thinkers and doers. We grew up during a veritable golden age of entertainment media, from cartoons to comic books to video games, and now we are faced with a dark age. We each started on this path many years ago, each on a different corner of the globe and through chance/circumstance we crossed paths. Call it fate, call it destiny, call it really good luck, something brought us together to form Tableflip Entertainment with one singular purpose: to deliver our stories and our ideas. Tableflip’s ultimate goal is an ambitious one: to deliver a massive coherent and interconnected narrative Universe. When Marvel claimed “endgame” was the most ambitious crossover in history, we said “Hold my beer”, and we intend to prove them wrong.What is Legends?It is said that there is a kernel of truth in every myth, of every legend. Come with us on an adventure to discover the truth behind the legendary figures behind the myths! The Last Knight Lancelot, The Holy Maiden Joan of Arc, and the Menacing Blackbeard to name a few. All household names, their stories known to us all, but how much of those stories are true? Which parts have been amplified through the passage of time, and which parts have been omitted from history? and the most important question, what heroes has history forgotten?The first Arc of Legends serves as an introduction into the forgotten parts of our world and will explore a number of characters as they rise to the cause of defending Earth from the greatest threat it’s ever seen, our story begins with Lancelot, last surviving Knight of the Round Table as he follow the trail of an evil sorcerer who’s dark schemes are once again threatening humanity itself.As an introduction to the greater Tableflip Universe, Legends will set the tone going forward. The Universe is a violent place, steeped in untold ages of conflict, as such the tone will be grim, dark, but with a speck of hope of an end to the conflict. In Legends the heroes are flawed, and though they are often very old and powerful, they are still human: they make mistakes, they are unsure, they feel fear and despair, and have to reconcile with themselves, with the things they must do. We aim to explore the burden that those we call heroes must bear. However sometimes monsters are needed to do the things that heroes cannot.More than anything Legends is a first step on a journey into a world we promise will be unlike any other, and we hope that you will come with us.SNEAK PEAKSTRETCH GOALSCOVERSWho will enjoy it?Legends is a story that will focus primarily on mystery and exploration, with a particular focus on figures and locations from real world myth, this is an introduction into the planned Tableflip Universe.

Legends has common elements with:","With the current world crisis COVID-19 there are greater risks than would normally be present.

I opened my shop this year in September and my first Kickstarter was funded successfully! I am so happy to see a lot of people love my pin designs! I love making people happy with my pin designs and I love my shop because it has brought me happiness and warmth and distraction and I'm so glad I found this outlet! I've created more pin designs based on my favorite Disney and Ghibli characters, and gave them a bit of a holiday spin! I would love to get all four of these pins made in time for the holidays which is why I am giving this project two weeks to get funded! I hope to completely get it funded so I can get these cute pins brought to life and see people wear them on their jackets and purses and what not! If you enjoy these characters as much as I do, please help me fund this project! The pins will be 1.5 - 2.0 inches in size, and I want to have their background be a white sparkly glitter kind of background!

She was a lovable little angel, and she was always so soft and cute. I'm sure her spirit is up there running around on some grass, having the time of her life! Unfortunately she passed away from an accident involving my grandma's dogs.Poopy the dog, he was a terrier and chihuahua mix and he was the most energetic dog I've ever had the pleasure of knowing. He wasn't afraid of anything, and was always hangin' around his pal Hige who was a Siberian Husky (I would like to do an enamel pin on him, depending on how well this goes I'll design his pin too) and Poopy always waited for me and an old ex-boyfriend of mine to come home, he always waited right by the gate. I loved this little dog so much, the way he passed is heart breaking and always hard to talk about. He passed away long with his pal Hige in an accident involving the freeway...they somehow got out of the gate, and we looked for a week before I got a call saying that my little dog was found on the freeway. One of the hardest things I've ever had to go through in my life. I miss him very much, and I know he's up there with Hige running around in the grass like he always did.Cake was a feisty little kitten. I got her from a friend of mine and later found out she had Gluacoma, she had to get surgery to get her eye removed. It was a week later that Cake somehow managed to escape outside, and my mom found her dead...till this day I am not sure what happened to her, as there was no sign of distress or any injuries. I was so heartbroken by this, I did not know how to handle it. It was one of the biggest shocks of my life. The short days she did have, she lived fully. She was always surrounded by people who loved her and I miss her very much.Chickilin was a rooster that I raised growing up. He was a tiny little baby bird when I first got him from some chicken warehouse, and he grew up to be a huge little rooster. He had so much energy, you never knew if he was going to peck at you or just let you give him hugs! I miss him very much, and he also passed away from an accident. I'm sure he's up there with his rooster friends having a grand ol' time.",Some risks and challenges include just making sure I can reach my goals and that there is a waiting period of course from when this is funded to getting the funds to getting the pins made and sent over. But all will be worth the while!

https://www.kickstarter.com/projects/joshchrist27/tale-of-tales?ref=discovery_category_newest,joshchrist27/tale-of-tales,"When I was a kid in elementary and middle school, I was enthralled by a trilogy of short little books filled with terrifying artwork and chilling tales. Many children of the 90's and 2000's can nowadays attest that that series, Scary Stories to Tell In the Dark, left a lasting impression on them.However, while many people remember little snatches of those scary stories, and many more have the books' startling images seared into their minds forever, what few seem to have realized is that the stories they were perusing have a far older history (which is likely why I never found any other scary story collection with quite the same staying power). Alvin Schwartz, the author of Scary Stories, is in fact a folklorist by trade, not a children's author, and like great lore anthologies of old such as Grimm's Hausmarchen, his stories are not original but rather edited-for-clarity-and-conciseness retellings of either literary tales with folk roots or word-of-mouth stories passed on to him by children and former-children alike. This, in fact, is why it is so ironic that Schwartz's books were so often banned from schools for being too dark and gruesome for children; Schwartz collected them precisely because they were so popular already with kids!It reminds me of the old quote attributed to G. K. Chesterton: ""Fairy tales do not tell children the dragons exist. Children already know that dragons exist. Fairy tales tell children the dragons can be killed."" Many modern readers might object to calling the tales in Scary Stories ""fairy tales"", yet at their heart they fall into the same category of lore; as I mentioned earlier, Schwartz is simply the most modern in a long tradition of Western writers who pass on their own versions of popular folk and children's tales to the next generation of both readers and scholars. (Schwartz's books comes with introduction and afterwords written to be equally accessible to children and academics, and his endnotes display a high level of scholarly integrity and competence.) In fact, quite a few of his tales have antecedents in much older European tales collected by early folklorists such as the Brothers Grimm themselves. The Grimms, like Schwartz, wrote their fairy tale anthology Kinder- und Hausmarchen (""Children's and Household Folktales"") based on stories transmitted to them by children and former children (that is to say: adults recollecting their favorite childhood stories). These were not the Disneyfied pop fairy tales that we typically encounter today, but rather campfire stories and action-adventure tales that served the same purpose as Schwartz' work: thrilling and terrifying audiences of all ages, no matter the level of death or destruction involved. In fact, the oral stories the Grimms collected were so gruesome that they had to edit them for future editions to limit the bone-chilling weirdness. (For instance, many genuine biological parents were changed to stepparents to make their evil schemes less jarring, and more violent or pessimistic, or even scandalously sexual, content was toned down to be more acceptable; for instance, Rapunzel's out-of-wedlock pregnancy in the original tale gets omitted in later versions.) Children, it seems, are not blind to the dark and disturbing qualities of the world we live in; rather, they embrace them, since telling stories about them helps them recognize the dangers lurking around them and try to plan around them. It's for this reason that fairy tale writers like Charles Perrault included explicit morals at the end of their tales -- to help connect the fantasy scenarios of the fairy tale back into the real world experiences of his readers. What good, after all, is a story about a little red-hooded girl who inadvertently falls into the clutches of a ravenous talking wolf, if we are unable to notice its real-life implications for blossoming young women trying to navigate oncoming advances from men with dubious intentions?Of course, folklore isn't just for children. Just because children gobble it up in droves (no matter how much we might wish they didn't), that doesn't mean stories of demons, elves, goblins, witches, ghosts, and even just ordinary humans going about their daily lives, don't have immense appeal for humans of all ages. Children have always been consuming and creating folklore, but so have adults. In fact, it is often unclear where the divide occurs between myths (stories told to deliver life lessons that are generally accepted by both teller and audience as factual or semi-factual) and folktales (stories told to deliver life lessons that are generally understood by both teller and audience to be manufactured and not based closely on real, specific events). As Schwartz notes, most all tales ""are based on things that people saw or heard or experienced -- or thought they did"", but folktales seem to inhabit a realm in the human imagination in which a story can be impactful and instructive without its plot, characters, or story elements necessarily having clear, historic real-life bases. Myths, however, rely on an assumption that the events described really happened, even if perhaps not the exact way they're described. The distinction is both clear and unclear in many ways; for instance, many folktales have their basis in ancient myths -- Beauty and the Beast comes from the Roman myth of Psyche and Cupid, and Cinderella may have developed out of the legend of a slave-girl named Rhodopis who might have actually existed and been a friend of the famous fable-writer Aesop. In both cases, though, there is a lesson embedded in the tale that is meant to be drawn out for the audience's personal benefit.Of course, most storytellers of the Western oral tradition understood that audiences don't necessarily need a story's moral or message spelled out clearly for them; more often than not, the storyteller relies on the conciseness of the narrative and the moral reasoning of the audience to quickly identify what it is the characters of the story are doing right or wrong, and therefore adapt their own worldview accordingly. A teller might, for instance, tell a story of a person encountering a poor beggar and being commended for offering them food, with the understanding that the audience will then unconsciously get that ""giving food to poor people = good"". Other times, the story's moral bent may be less clear, but the teller still drops subtle hints to indicate for the audience what course of action is best, otherwise relying on the audience's own rationale and moral compass to lead them to figure out what the point of the story is. The charm of these stories, in fact, lies in just how comfortable the teller often is with allowing their audience to piece things together themselves, or fill in details as need be. In our current high-consumption, low-patience culture, stories must often be heavily detailed and perfectly strung together in order to be satisfying; we expect every bit of minutiae to be explained to us and very little to be left to the imagination. However, with these tales, you are only ever given just as many details as you need, as you need them; descriptions are spare, action is snappy and fast-paced, and so-called ""plot holes"" are left gaping wide with the understanding that the audience will either gloss over them or fill them in themselves. This interactive role on the part of the audience is in fact very important to how these tales get told and retold so often; tellers will leave out, add in, and alter details as they see fit in order to better the story, and this results in the massive collection of widespread variants we can have of a story. Cinderella, for instance, has come a long way from its supposed Greek-Egyptian roots, with incredibly diverse and localized versions in practically every country on the planet. Quite a bit of the fun of exploring folktales is tracing the family tree of a given story to find all the strange and disparate branches on it, drawing connections between legends that at first seem totally different but in the end have a distinctly similar core or prototype.So where do I fit into all of this? I'm currently a graduate student at Florida State University with experience in High School English teaching and a Bachelor's Degree in Religion with a minor in Literature. I've been exploring folklore from all over the world from the moment I cracked open the pages of Schwartz's book and became addicted to the compelling, thrilling cadence of those old stories. With your help I'd like to start a monthly, two-hour podcast called Tale of Tales, after the Italian fairy-tale anthology by Giambattiste Basile, in which I explore the oral storytelling tradition by delving into different stories from across history, examining oral and literary folktales (particularly the grimmer, darker ones) and not only telling them for my audience, but taking the time to talk about where they fall within the greater family of folklore. My endeavor will be different from other popular storytelling podcasts in that I'm interested first and foremost in telling these stories in a way that preserves the integral shape of the folktale, that snappy, spare rhythmic quality, and secondly in that I also want to dig into them and figure out what makes them tick. Why were these stories so compelling for their original audiences? Why are they still grabbing people even today?

Many children of the 90's and 2000's can nowadays attest that that series, Scary Stories to Tell In the Dark, left a lasting impression on them.However, while many people remember little snatches of those scary stories, and many more have the books' startling images seared into their minds forever, what few seem to have realized is that the stories they were perusing have a far older history (which is likely why I never found any other scary story collection with quite the same staying power). Alvin Schwartz, the author of Scary Stories, is in fact a folklorist by trade, not a children's author, and like great lore anthologies of old such as Grimm's Hausmarchen, his stories are not original but rather edited-for-clarity-and-conciseness retellings of either literary tales with folk roots or word-of-mouth stories passed on to him by children and former-children alike. This, in fact, is why it is so ironic that Schwartz's books were so often banned from schools for being too dark and gruesome for children; Schwartz collected them precisely because they were so popular already with kids!It reminds me of the old quote attributed to G. K. Chesterton: ""Fairy tales do not tell children the dragons exist. Children already know that dragons exist. Fairy tales tell children the dragons can be killed."" Many modern readers might object to calling the tales in Scary Stories ""fairy tales"", yet at their heart they fall into the same category of lore; as I mentioned earlier, Schwartz is simply the most modern in a long tradition of Western writers who pass on their own versions of popular folk and children's tales to the next generation of both readers and scholars. (Schwartz's books comes with introduction and afterwords written to be equally accessible to children and academics, and his endnotes display a high level of scholarly integrity and competence.) In fact, quite a few of his tales have antecedents in much older European tales collected by early folklorists such as the Brothers Grimm themselves. The Grimms, like Schwartz, wrote their fairy tale anthology Kinder- und Hausmarchen (""Children's and Household Folktales"") based on stories transmitted to them by children and former children (that is to say: adults recollecting their favorite childhood stories). These were not the Disneyfied pop fairy tales that we typically encounter today, but rather campfire stories and action-adventure tales that served the same purpose as Schwartz' work: thrilling and terrifying audiences of all ages, no matter the level of death or destruction involved. In fact, the oral stories the Grimms collected were so gruesome that they had to edit them for future editions to limit the bone-chilling weirdness. (For instance, many genuine biological parents were changed to stepparents to make their evil schemes less jarring, and more violent or pessimistic, or even scandalously sexual, content was toned down to be more acceptable; for instance, Rapunzel's out-of-wedlock pregnancy in the original tale gets omitted in later versions.) Children, it seems, are not blind to the dark and disturbing qualities of the world we live in; rather, they embrace them, since telling stories about them helps them recognize the dangers lurking around them and try to plan around them. It's for this reason that fairy tale writers like Charles Perrault included explicit morals at the end of their tales -- to help connect the fantasy scenarios of the fairy tale back into the real world experiences of his readers. What good, after all, is a story about a little red-hooded girl who inadvertently falls into the clutches of a ravenous talking wolf, if we are unable to notice its real-life implications for blossoming young women trying to navigate oncoming advances from men with dubious intentions?Of course, folklore isn't just for children. Just because children gobble it up in droves (no matter how much we might wish they didn't), that doesn't mean stories of demons, elves, goblins, witches, ghosts, and even just ordinary humans going about their daily lives, don't have immense appeal for humans of all ages. Children have always been consuming and creating folklore, but so have adults. In fact, it is often unclear where the divide occurs between myths (stories told to deliver life lessons that are generally accepted by both teller and audience as factual or semi-factual) and folktales (stories told to deliver life lessons that are generally understood by both teller and audience to be manufactured and not based closely on real, specific events). As Schwartz notes, most all tales ""are based on things that people saw or heard or experienced -- or thought they did"", but folktales seem to inhabit a realm in the human imagination in which a story can be impactful and instructive without its plot, characters, or story elements necessarily having clear, historic real-life bases. Myths, however, rely on an assumption that the events described really happened, even if perhaps not the exact way they're described. The distinction is both clear and unclear in many ways; for instance, many folktales have their basis in ancient myths -- Beauty and the Beast comes from the Roman myth of Psyche and Cupid, and Cinderella may have developed out of the legend of a slave-girl named Rhodopis who might have actually existed and been a friend of the famous fable-writer Aesop. In both cases, though, there is a lesson embedded in the tale that is meant to be drawn out for the audience's personal benefit.Of course, most storytellers of the Western oral tradition understood that audiences don't necessarily need a story's moral or message spelled out clearly for them; more often than not, the storyteller relies on the conciseness of the narrative and the moral reasoning of the audience to quickly identify what it is the characters of the story are doing right or wrong, and therefore adapt their own worldview accordingly. A teller might, for instance, tell a story of a person encountering a poor beggar and being commended for offering them food, with the understanding that the audience will then unconsciously get that ""giving food to poor people = good"". Other times, the story's moral bent may be less clear, but the teller still drops subtle hints to indicate for the audience what course of action is best, otherwise relying on the audience's own rationale and moral compass to lead them to figure out what the point of the story is. The charm of these stories, in fact, lies in just how comfortable the teller often is with allowing their audience to piece things together themselves, or fill in details as need be. In our current high-consumption, low-patience culture, stories must often be heavily detailed and perfectly strung together in order to be satisfying; we expect every bit of minutiae to be explained to us and very little to be left to the imagination. However, with these tales, you are only ever given just as many details as you need, as you need them; descriptions are spare, action is snappy and fast-paced, and so-called ""plot holes"" are left gaping wide with the understanding that the audience will either gloss over them or fill them in themselves. This interactive role on the part of the audience is in fact very important to how these tales get told and retold so often; tellers will leave out, add in, and alter details as they see fit in order to better the story, and this results in the massive collection of widespread variants we can have of a story. Cinderella, for instance, has come a long way from its supposed Greek-Egyptian roots, with incredibly diverse and localized versions in practically every country on the planet. Quite a bit of the fun of exploring folktales is tracing the family tree of a given story to find all the strange and disparate branches on it, drawing connections between legends that at first seem totally different but in the end have a distinctly similar core or prototype.So where do I fit into all of this? I'm currently a graduate student at Florida State University with experience in High School English teaching and a Bachelor's Degree in Religion with a minor in Literature. I've been exploring folklore from all over the world from the moment I cracked open the pages of Schwartz's book and became addicted to the compelling, thrilling cadence of those old stories. With your help I'd like to start a monthly, two-hour podcast called Tale of Tales, after the Italian fairy-tale anthology by Giambattiste Basile, in which I explore the oral storytelling tradition by delving into different stories from across history, examining oral and literary folktales (particularly the grimmer, darker ones) and not only telling them for my audience, but taking the time to talk about where they fall within the greater family of folklore. My endeavor will be different from other popular storytelling podcasts in that I'm interested first and foremost in telling these stories in a way that preserves the integral shape of the folktale, that snappy, spare rhythmic quality, and secondly in that I also want to dig into them and figure out what makes them tick. Why were these stories so compelling for their original audiences? Why are they still grabbing people even today? And what lessons do they impart even on us modern audiences when we allow them to serve as a mirror for our own thoughts and actions?The $400 goal is meant to first pay for the sort of equipment necessary to make a quality podcast -- microphones, editing software, and research resources -- and to also help pay my way as I get into the hang of carving out time to research, craft, and record these episodes.Unlike other crowdfunding sites, Kickstarter asks for a one-time-only pledge that isn't taken out of your account until the project is fully funded -- so you don't have to worry about committing to any long-term repeated donations!I've got a few tiers of rewards that build on each other based on how much you're willing to donate. For as little as $3, you can get a shout-out on the first episode of the show -- a personal, public thank-you from me for helping make this dream a reality. Add $10 to that (lucky number 13!) and you also get to suggest a story (or theme) for me to cover on an episode of the show, with credit given to you for suggesting it! (In the case of both of these options, I'll shout-out whatever name you prefer -- if you're microphone-shy, you can make up something for me to say so that your identity stays between us!)If you're willing to give $33, I'll send you a signed copy of one of my episode scripts -- whichever one you want, whether it's an episode you suggested or one you just happen to be excited about. Best of all, if you can double that sum, I'll feature your face in the episode art for an episode you choose -- you'll have the chance to be portrayed as one of the characters of the stories I discuss!Thank you so much for your time, and I hope you'll help me keep this storytelling tradition alive at least in my little pocket of the world!","The greatest risk for this project right now is time.

As we start this new year, the team from Nowhere California would love to evolveour production and give our listeners the best product possible. Our upgrades will be basic and theseadvancements will take us to a whole new level, a level we could only dream about.  Since Nowhere's beginning, we've always been a basic set up and we'll keep it that way, as our needs are only to upgrade our sound equipment (e.g. improved microphones and sound recorders) and editing equipment/software. Now, throughout this page and over thenext few weeks, our goal will be to inform you of our history and ourgoals within the world of Nowhere California.Before we go any further, let's answer a question that you might have and something we have answered multiple times. That question is ... A podcast is a program that ismade available in a digital format for automatic download over the internet. The typical podcast is set up in a discussion style format. As the concept of podcastingis still new, the list of categories and shows are endless.The show of Nowhere California is a small production in comparison to other podcasts,but our history will show that we could stand toe to toe with the larger names of the podcasting worldandkeep ourindependent heart in a mainstream world.The following is a short highlight reel of a few recent episodes of Nowhere California. During the run of this project, we willpost links to special reissues of past episodes in updatesand you can experience Nowhere's past, so you can help with the evolution of our future.Remember, wehavesaid our show is a nerdy and off-color love letter to the world of pop culture, so some of the content may not be suitable for all.Here are a few link for more information about the Nowhere California Podcast..https://www.facebook.com/NowhereCaliforniahttp://nowhere-california.podomatic.com/https://itunes.apple.com/us/podcast/nowherecalifornia-podcast/id476105788?mt=2","When it comes to the risks of this project, one of our heroes said it best...“There's no present. There's only the immediate future and the recent past.” -George CarlinThe words of Carlin fit perfectly to this situation, because our history shows that we will survive even if we come up short. In the past 3 years, we have over came a lot of speed bumps, some small and some huge, but we continued to record and release the best episodes we could.I guess, on the other side of the coin, the only risks that we see in a successfully funded project are positive. The risks will be to find our next challenge and to continue bringing our listeners the best production we possibly can.",https://www.kickstarter.com/projects/nowhere-josh/lowering-the-bar?ref=discovery_category_newest,nowhere-josh/lowering-the-bar,"In 2011, when Nowhere California first took to the digital airwaves, podcasts were a relatively uncharted territory. Today, as our founder Joshua Gilmore so eloquently puts it; ""You can't throw a rock without hitting a new podcast and damaging your computer."" What began as a passion of two lifelong friends, Nowhere California quickly evolved into a four man operation that has attended movie premiers, covered top industry conventions, and has conducted interviews with talent that spans the pop culture spectrum. Six years later and Nowhere California has branched out onto FaceBook, Twitter, Instagram, and our very own website. in six years, Nowhere California has gone from a listening audience of a few friends to over 45,000 plays in the U.S. as well as the U.K., Australia, Germany, and even a few in Russia.The entire Nowhere California team are prepared for the journey ahead and there will be no need for a cheat code or Game Genie to speed this adventure along. We will be ready for the boss stages and we are ready to level up the world of Nowhere California through these following goals..LEVEL 1- CLEAR SAILING FOR 2018.. This is a simple goal to reach and will allow Nowhere California to have a stress free entry into the upcoming year. This goal will allow us to pay for the website and podcast memory. Also, if we can jump this hurdle, Nowhere California can return to the road and kick a few doors open in our evolution.LEVEL 2- GEAR FOR THE ROAD..(Stretch Goal- $100.00) We have reached LEVEL 2 and we are looking to improve our interviews from the road. This goal is simple, we want to upgrade our digital recorder and add some clip-on microphones to our conversations.In the beginning, there was a lot of things and, for the Nowhere California team, our world started with some insanity behind a microphone. In this section, you will have the opportunity to listen to some specially selected episodes from Nowhere’s past.Episode 81- R.A.R.E or Rage Against Rebooting Entertainment Originally Posted-08/10/2015-- The guys from Nowhere take a look at Hollywood’s current obsession with the past. In this episode the team attempts to   take a look at the past, present, and future of reboots. Also, the discussion delves into the reason why a ""reboot"" can expose a lot of different emotions.Episode 97- The Crossroads Of Logic And Insanity.. Originally Posted- 07/20/2016-- In this edition of Nowhere California, the team takes a look at the growing and strange world of fan theories. ""Fan Theories"" are concepts and ideas behind some of the biggest moments in entertainment that the ""fans"" have created, when the minds behind the project let the story fade to black.WHY NOT #17- Why Not The Birdcage?Originally Posted- 08/15/2015-- After multiple traditional episodes of Nowhere California, the team decided to spin-off into a series of episodes that strictly dissect a specially chosen movie that might have gotten lost in the mainstream shuffle and ask the sometimes difficult question “Why Not?”In the edition of “Why Not?” the guys from Nowhere take a special look at the 1996 Robin Williams classic “The Birdcage”  The normal or (in some cases) abnormal episodes of Nowhere California are the foundation of this universe. The guys from Nowhere have expanded and built upon this foundation over the years. These expansions have taken many forms, but for the case of this section we will focus on the interviews from Nowhere’s past.When the chance to break into the world of conventions and conduct interviews presented itself, the team took upon themselves to stay away from the boring interview structures and focus on the conversation.In this section, you will be able to listen to some selected conversation for the Nowhere California catalogue.Nowhere California Presents Our Conversation With Heather LangenkampThis conversation took place at the 2013 Day of the Dead convention in Los Angeles and this convention happened to be the team’s first adventure into the world of convention coverage. The guys from Nowhere had a lot of highlights from this convention and this is one of the big ones. In this conversation the guys from Nowhere talk with the legendary Heather Langenkamp, Nancy Thompson from the iconic 1984 “A Nightmare On Elm Street”Nowhere California Presents Our Conversation With Rob PaulsenThis conversation took place at the 2013 Long Beach Comic And Horror Convention, which was the second convention on the Nowhere California resume. During this event the team talked with voice talent legend, Rob Paulsen. The conversation ranges from his amazing career in the world of animation to his WTF moment on the set of “Body Double” and everything in between.Nowhere California Presents Our Coverage Of The Queen Gorya Pilot Premiere PartyAt the 2013 Los Angeles Days of the Dead Convention the guys from Nowhere met Satu and Steve J Palmer. They were in attendance to promote their project known as ""Queen Gorya"" and the guys from Nowhere fell in love with this project.Since that chance meeting, a friendship has continued and a pilot has been made.In this installment of Nowhere California Presents, Phil and Josh cover the world premiere of the Queen Gorya pilot.If you wish to fall further down our rabbit hole, you can listen to the complete Nowhere California catalogue on-line and you can find this digital insanity through your favorite podcast search engines.This project page is only a taste of the world that we have created. Since the beginning of Nowhere California, we worked hard at leaving our mark on the vast internet wasteland.

The real risk here is just to our pride (and perhaps Josh's sanity). We WILL continue to press on should we not reach our goal but it would make our future something much more manageable. That is why we reach out to you, our fans, or perhaps the passerby that believes in a homegrown project, to lend us a hand so we can continue doing what we love and what we love sharing with you."

https://www.kickstarter.com/projects/247375582/yorkshire-challenge-coin?ref=discovery_category_newest,247375582/yorkshire-challenge-coin,"I love Yorkshire, the rolling hills of the moors, the captivating beauty of the beaches to the yellow stone typical of our city centres. Over the last few years my home seems to have grown a small challenge coin collection, most of them are actually from Kickstarter and are fantasy based, others are military, brought back by my husband when he's been away. One of the coins however, is from Edinburgh and says Scotland with a bagpiper on the back. Living down in the West Midlands I was feeling a bit homesick and I wondered ""If Scotland and Edinburgh have Challenge coins I wonder if Yorkshire does?"" thinking it would cheer me up I typed ""Yorkshire Challenge coin"" into Google and...Nada. Nothing. There were some for the Yorkshire regiment and various clubs, but nothing depicting the beauty of our flag or the history of the Ridings. The front of our coin was the easiest part - The white rose of Yorkshire on its blue background. Although only approved by the flag institute in 2008 it's a design that, according to the flag institute, has been used from the 1960's or earlier.  It's a symbol I automatically associate with Yorkshire so it seemed perfect to go on the front. The back of the coin took some thought. I wanted something to typify Yorkshire as a whole but also its separate parts. I considered having the flag and making it a double-sided coin. That did seem the lazy way out though so that was filed under ‘desperation only’. Yorkshire terriers and puddings came and went... I then remembered a map my grandmother had given me a few years ago. It had come free with a newspaper and it showed – Yorkshire’s Ridings. Riding comes from an old word meaning three or a third part of. Yorkshire has three Ridings: The North Riding, The East Riding and The West Riding.  These Ridings ceased to have administrative meanings in 1974, but they still remain today. Intrigued by this I decided to use the Ridings and drew out a line diagram of Yorkshire split into its Ridings. I liked the shape it made; I also liked the way the boundary lines met in our historic capital York. I felt that York deserved a symbol and added the star and name to the map. It still seemed to be missing something though so I went back to the archives. The different county councils used to have their own coats of arms and different versions of the county councils have had their different mottos over time - many of them are no longer in use. West Yorkshire’s common one was ‘Heed Counsel’, North Yorkshire’s ‘Stronger by union’. East Yorkshire was debatable; their old one translates roughly from Latin as ‘Behold the rising sun’ the current East Riding council’s motto is ‘Tradition and progress’. Although it’s longer, I preferred the ‘Behold the rising sun’ as it reminded me of holidays to Bridlington and Hornsea watching the sunrise over the beach. •  Reward #1 Ta very much!

The numbers on any additional coins will be randomly selected by us from those leftover at the end of the Kickstarter, and may be above 1000. Only one coin per backer can be guaranteed to be within a given numerical range. In the event of more than 1000 coins being pledged for, we may produce coins over 1000 as a ""Series B""... these will still be numbered starting from 001, but will be of a slightly different design to incorporate the phrase ""Series B"". At the end of the Kickstarter, a survey will be sent out asking for details of what you would like to spend any extra pledged money on... if you would like your second or subsequent coins to be within a particular range, please state this in the ""comments"" field, but this will be subject to availability and on a first-come, first-served basis.Bob would like three coins, but he’d also like a coin from the 006-009 range. The PDF does have different lyrics to the traditional one (which can be found in many places online.

It is possible that when we move to mixing and mastering we will have to hire more than one professional and therefore incur higher finishing costs.It is also possible that to get the right mix and master files we will have to wait in line to have our tracks completed by the right professional. Finally, we may encounter delays in professionally printing artwork, or delivering our music to market. We are committed to delivering our product on time and of the highest quality afforded by our budget. We have identified backup options for mixing and mastering professionals should the ones we choose not work out. We can always take money from our pockets, which we did for the recording process, to cover unforeseen delays and time overruns."

In the South, heat waves and droughts ravage the land. In the North the great ice wall weeps. The nights watch has dwindled from its former numbers, barely a thousand patrol the wall and the realm beyond. Wildlings from beyond the wall sense the weakness of the nights watch and are eager to press their advantage. Grasson Ryswell, the Lord Commander of the Nights Watch has ordered a few of his most trusted and experienced officers to lead a group of new recruits to establish an outpost beyond the wall in the Wildling village of Whitetree. You have been chosen to reinforce their garrison at Whitetree. And now your watch begins...Choose from between three unique classes: Rangers, Builders, and Stewards. Each class has 3 subclasses to pick from so you can have a specialized skill set.Defend the town against hoards of Wildlings, dire wolves, and other fearsome foes that dwell in the haunted forest.We have a great location, perfect setting for a primitive Wildling village.Find us on Facebook and RSVP to our events! www.facebook.com/beyondthewalllarpRewards:""Paper"" $1 or more.

We want to make sure players have the best experience possible and get the most bang for their buck.The Kickstarter campaign will help us hit the ground running and start the game in its fully realized state. That said, we inevitably have to make changes to the rulebook and location to better accommodate players.One of the biggest challenges is publicity. LARP is a growing hobby in the US but it is still relatively small, especially in the state of Maine. Part reason for this is the negative stereotypes associated with LARP in the US. BW is trying to help change that by having a game inspired by Game of Thrones, and therefore more accessible to casual players.",https://www.kickstarter.com/projects/810459335/beyond-the-wall-0?ref=discovery_category_newest,810459335/beyond-the-wall-0,"Beyond the Wallis a Live Action Role Playing Game (LARP)where players must work together as a team to defend a remote outpost against what dwells in the haunted forest.

https://www.kickstarter.com/projects/sharicbui/quadrant-75?ref=discovery_category_newest,sharicbui/quadrant-75,"In the fall of 1966, NASA and the Department of Strategic Affairs, a hidden branch within the U.S. government, secretly sent an astronaut to Mars. The mission was highly-classified and went by the codename QUADRANT 75.The objective of the mission was perilous: send an astronaut to Mars with limited technology to drop an atomic bomb onto its surface from orbit. This specialized bomb, when detonated, would trigger an atmospheric shock wave meant to terraform the planet for future colonization.To pull off such a feat, QUADRANT 75 would secretly piggyback off the Apollo space program. The vast majority of NASA personnel was kept in the dark to protect the integrity of the mission. This allowed NASA to work secretly with very little suspicion.The astronaut selected for QUADRANT 75 was Lisa Summerhill. She was an unknown test pilot who was hand-picked by the Department of Strategic Affairs to carry out the mission. Two months after Lisa left Earth to Mars, she was pronounced dead by the U.S. government.This is her untold story.I have been working on this graphic novel for a considerable amount of time. The storyline and character designs have already been finished. Hopefully, this campaign will enable me to share this amazing story with the world.Below are the first three pages of Chapter 2. The illustrations are designed to be graphical, bold, and minimal. Yet, they are rich enough to immerse the reader into the story. I strategically used contrasting colors to emphasize location, mood, and atmosphere.I’m a multidisciplinary designer from Toronto, Canada, who possesses a diverse background in fashion, design, and illustration. I love to create engaging experiences through my artistic ventures.QUADRANT 75 is my first graphic novel; it combines my love for storytelling and anything related to cosmology/astronomy.If you wish to see my other creative adventures, you can visit me on Dribbble.I have created a first edition stamp for selected rewards (CAD $38 and above). This special stamp will be used to authenticate your reward. I will also couple this stamp with my signature (in red ink) to validate your first edition copy of QUADRANT 75.QUADRANT 75 GRAPHIC NOVELThe cover is designed to resemble the classified files from the 1960s. The book will be a high-quality hardcover, with full-color pages printed on uncoated off-white paper. Depending on your pledge amount, each copy will be signed and stamped with a first edition seal. The dimension of the book is 7x9 in.SOTERIA 11 ENAMEL PINNASA designed a unique patch for every Apollo Program Mission. These patches were then worn proudly by NASA astronauts. I wanted to incorporate this history into my story, so I created a mission patch for QUADRANT 75 to carry on this tradition.This patch is recreated in the shape of an enamel pin to enrich the story further. The dimension of this enamel pin is approximately 1x1 in.ORIGINAL SKETCHDepending on the pledge amount, you will receive an original pencil sketch on archival paper that is hand-selected from one of the panels/scenes from the story.Every sketch will be numbered, signed, and stamped to prove its authenticity.TOP-SECRET FILESThese top-secret files expose classified details of QUADRANT 75. This folder contains blueprints, memorandums, and letters that were hidden from the public for decades.All the files you receive for this award will be uncensored. There are additional rewards within this folder, which will be revealed at a later date.Below are four special pledges that are available exclusively for Kickstarter backers.","All merchandise will be produced by trusted printers and manufacturers, both in Canada and overseas. I will ensure everything meets my standards within reasonable allowances. Please note that actual products might be slightly different in terms of designs and colors.I want to deliver the best possible book. Therefore, the established goal was calculated to allow me to fully dedicate my time and resources into finishing the book, printing, and shipping alone.

I first dreamt of creating my own animated series when I become obsessed with shows like Family Guy, Futurama and American Dad whilst still in high school. We started Fake Grapes productions in the living room of my family home in Melbourne about five years ago, as a means to bring all the creative ideas that we had to life. We had so much fun getting together and throwing around all the ideas we had for movies and TV shows. For me personally there's no greater joy than when you see and feel something you've created start to come to life. I'm starting to see that now with Life Sucks, but there's one final step to make it a reality. The funds.This Kickstarter is the final step in making something that we've dreamed about and worked on for the past two and half years a reality, and you can be part of that, even if it's a small part of it. Any contribution that you make will earn you my, and the whole Fake Grapes team, eternal gratitude. That's probably poor consolation for helping us live out our dreams, but we hope to pay you back by producing kick arse content and making you laugh, think and cry.Our ultimate goal is to use the funds we raise here as a real springboard for not only our show ""Life Sucks"" but also for Fake Grapes and to create a platform where all creative people can come to live their dreams and really express themselves, be it through comedy, animation or short films. This so that creative people always have full control and you, the audience, can gain unfettered access to the content that they are ultimately creating for you.","The biggest challenge that we face is getting our show out there. There's a lot of online content and things can easily become lost in the depths of the internet. The initial funds that we intend to raise here are only the beginning, and we need the show to gain traction and get support if we can continue to live out our dream and work on the show, and with the characters, that we've grown to love. However, we think with the right social media platform, and friends like you to support us along the way, we can really make it happen and get our show out to the broader public.",https://www.kickstarter.com/projects/1158032192/fake-grapes-life-sucks?ref=discovery_category_newest,1158032192/fake-grapes-life-sucks,"""If it is to be, it is up to me.""We really want to bring our show Life Sucks to life, so here we are again. We want to make this happen, but we cannot do it alone. We need your support. This project is a the culmination of 2 and a half years of planning and about 10 years of dreaming. Even providing a small amount of support would go a long way to helping our team live out this dream. That's pretty cool and amazing when you think about it. How many opportunities do you have to help someone else live out their dream?We have everything lined up and ready to go but the one thing we need is the money to really launch this show and bring it to your screen.

We will be working full time to bring this project to completion within as few months as possible. We will be hiring on a few extra animators to speed up the work flow and get the best quality available for the finished movie.

Along the way he finds a very valuable and powerful object. The object threatens to destroy an entire kingdom. But that's not the only problem Velasco faces, He is also threatened to be destroyed by the king when the Princess goes missing and he is the one blamed for the kidnapping. All evidence points to Velasco until his friends start an investigation to find the truth behind the kidnapping and where the Princess is really being held hostage. Aside from the kidnapping, the entire city is in a mess of trouble as problems continue to arise. The king has passed a law that states the need for an army of Jubas to fill a roll of better control in the city. Many of the Jubas resent the idea of joining an army to control the lives of other Jubas. Someone has to solve all the problems and bring peace back to the city. In the midst of chaos, the object is lost and a map filled with mysterious clues is needed to retrieve the object. A Juba named Borgan is sucked into leading a search for the object as the King heads out in hot pursuit to take control of the situation. Someone has to save the Princess and free Velasco from prison before he is destroyed completely. Scott, Jaxon and Borgan must find the object to free their friend and save the kingdom before it's to late. All in all the movie is filled with comedy, action, adventure, love and mystery. The story twists the imagination in a very captivating way, providing a series of non-stop excitement and mystery.Below is a link to the teaser for the project. (Keep in mind that no design or footage from the teaser will be used in the final movie) :http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vhRLzUwXMzsWe have spent over 10 years in the film industry with a great number of accomplishments and successes.

The biggest obstacle we face right now is having the computer power to get the project back on its feet. Once we get the funding for the project, and purchase new Computer Systems, we will be well on our way to success. As a production company, we are hired to work on other film projects and therefore may put the movie on hold for a number of weeks during production. When our time is finished on other projects we will go back into full production on this project.

In the first several years of a child's life, they will learn things that will stick with them for the rest of their lives. It is good to instill good morals and behaviors into children while they are still young. Over the last several years, Hollywood has used story telling to create a lot of who people are today. Hollywood has created a standard of living that people believe is somehow a dream they can live. There are many ways to affect the people around us, but the media has proven to be one of the greatest tools. We want to change the future and show children what truth is, what real friendship is and how to be someone responsible. This animated adventure, filled with action, comedy, great characters, and fascinating worlds, will captivate and build children's imaginations. But far above that, they will be shown the reality of who we are in what we do.Deception is a story about a Juba (Fictional character named, Velasco), who feels the pain and frustration of living alone. And even when someone is alone, it doesn't mean without company, but deep down in his heart, he has no friends. He has been mocked and made fun of to the extent of feeling helpless and unwanted. He feels his last hope lies in leaving his home and finding a place where he is wanted as a friend. The Journey begins and all hope seams to rise up inside Velasco as he fixes his vision on a distant city where his dreams break free. But shortly after his arrival, he is accused of kidnapping the King's daughter and thrown in prison. Feeling even more hopeless than before, he faces his lingering doom to be destroyed, not knowing his friends of the past have set out to find him. Questions start to arise as the King's best Juba is sent out for investigation and no clues are to be found. The King himself has ruled with an Iron fist, and searches for an object of legend that will allow him to enslave the entire city under his command. But when Velasco's previous friends learn about all the deception the king is using to enslave everyone, they find themselves racing to obtain the object of power that the king so eagerly searches for. The race for time begins, but not without difficulty. The King has given Velasco an opportunity to join him in power and make his mark as someone great. The King reassures Velasco that no one needs friends when you have power. But Velasco's friends have other plans. Their hope to save Velasco and free the city from bondage, has caused them to make new friends themselves and gain a position of respect. Their efforts for justice are soon rewarded with great joy and friendship.This story is told from the perspective of a grandfather to his grandson. Leading up to this point, the grandson has been bullied and rejected by other children at school, leaving him with no friends. The grandfather uses this story as a means to point out a relationship with a friend who sticks closer than a brother. He explains to his grandson what it means to have a relationship with Jesus. He also talks to him about how sin is used to destroy people's lives, while Christ came to save people from destruction.Deception is a powerful story that teaches a good lesson and points to a relationship with God. We have spent the past several months working hard to pull this project together. We have spent time talking to investors, and people like you, to help us get this feature film on its feet. We have decided to take things one step at a time. Because we know that steps will lead to a goal as long as they aren't steps backward. Right now we need to raise the money needed to get the concept artist started on the project. Our concept artist is Luke Sure from Italy Rome, who has signed a contract to start the artwork right away. But as we all know, quality takes money. With the Images Luke puts together we will have a picture of what the world, characters, ext, will look like for the movie. This will allow us to have a foundation to intrigue Investors and get people like you more interested in what we are doing. These images will also be forwarded to the 3D artists who will create the worlds for the film and give it life. There will be hundreds of 3d models created and then brought to life through animation. Among these, we plan to create around 200 different styles of characters that will represent the population of our worlds. From there we will proceed to make this project comparable in quality to a Hollywood movie.1- Pay the Concept Artist2- Pay for a script review from Act One. (Act one is a Hollywood company that professionally critiques film scripts and writes reviews)The Script has been sent off to be evaluated by a professional writer who has replied with much excitement about his first look at the story. Rex is a professional writer who is working on making the script into a finished piece of artwork. He told me over the phone, ""I had a hard time putting the script down when I first read it. It really kept me going. I wanted to know what happened next. I really like the action sequences and the overall story line. I'm very excited to see this turned into a movie!"" I was very excited to hear his input and hope it sparks something in you as well. We plan to put the script into the hands of several more people for review and look forward to the input and excitement they have for the project.The script has been written to fill 120 minutes of screen time/a 2 hour feature.During the last few months we have had some time to work on creating some images that will hopefully give your imagination something to work off of:Beyond the Mask:www.beyondthemaskmovie.comInvolved in: 3D Modeling, Set Building, Stunt Double, Acting, Catering, Set Dressing, Concept Art and Other small on set duties.Uberkanone:Uberkanone LinkInvolved in: Grip and Electric, Acting Double, Set Dressing, Art and Camera.Also visit ourwebsite to get a better idea of what we are about:www.sideaffectproductions.weebly.com","After months of work, we have evaluated many aspects of the project and are ready to face any challenge that attempts to get in our way.

Along the way there will be points where we may have possible equipment failure or other similar issues. The chances are small, but we are prepared to face each one with an answer and push forward. We would like to get this movie in theaters and into stores as well. We know it will be lots of hard work and perseverance, but each challenge will drive us to something more. We will be successful with your help and change the world one step at a time.You may have noticed my other project, Chic Fashion. Chic Fashion has been set up for my wife, which in no way involves itself with Deception."

Landbound Turtles is a small business run by a De-Facto couple in New Zealand, Siah, and Val. We are two young adult artists, and art is the biggest hobby that we both share.IF we raise over $1800, we will create another enamel pin (based on your opinions!) and we will include them in the end rewards!We are hoping to fill our goal so we can create the Enamel Pins we've always wanted to create! The Enamel Pins we are looking to create consist of three custom made designs by us. If you are an Early-Bird purchaser, we will throw in art prints and/or stickers that we have also made, for free!We care so much about this project as art is our biggest hobby, and we are hoping to create the Enamel Pins we are looking forward to sell at a convention, Overload, here in Auckland, New Zealand, in September! We are going to be producing 200 of each Enamel Pin, and out of all 600 pins, 235 will be available via this kickstarter. If we still have stock at the end of the convention, we will sell them in one of our artists' Etsy store.As soon as the Kickstarter is completed, around April 20, 2019, we will place our order for the Enamel Pins to be made. We will receive the stock around one or two months after the order has been made.This kickstarter will be updated throughout the time it runs to show you all the art prints we have up for grabs. As of 05/03/19, we only have one art print, and only one artist has completed their sets of stickers. Siah is working very hard to get his sets done, and they should be done around or before 19/03/19. The art prints are currently only being done by Val, and she will be including hers when they are finished as well!Here is the first art print that Val has created:And our stickers are super cute! These are some of the ones available at the moment to be included in pledges!The BNHA stickers are also an example of Val's chibis if a commission is included in your reward!","If there are any delays in the producing of enamel pins/stickers/art prints/commissions, we will contact you immediately, as soon as we know. However, this is unlikely - but the chance is always there.

It's Val here from Landbound Turtles, and I have created a set of soft enamel pins, featuring a variety of kittens and flowers! All funds in this kickstarter will go to the producing and shipping of the enamel pins, along with kickstarter fees.Please do not wait to pledge if you are interested in snatching one of these babies up, even if the pin you want is not currently unlocked! Pledging early will ensure that they will eventually be unlocked, and you can pick up your favorite pin (or pins!) from this set.As soon as the kickstarter is finished and funded, I will place the order in for these darling kittens to be created as soft enamel pins. They will be gold plated, with a black rubber clutch for the back. They will be 25mm in size, which is just about an inch! The enamel pins will take about a month to make, so they should arrive around June, and will start to be dispatched as soon as possible, and therefore, you should start receiving the pins around July! Sticker sets are handmade, hand printed and hand cut!The pins will unlock as follows:Maine Coon (first unlocked once the kickstarter has been funded, at $450 NZD)Siamese Kitten (second unlocked once the kickstarter has been funded, at $810 NZD)Scottish Fold (third unlocked once the kickstarter has been funded, at $1170 NZD)Sphynx Baby (last unlocked once the kickstarter has been funded, at $1530 NZD)Shipping costs are as follows:STICKERS ONLY- International: $3 NZD (No tracking.

The finished products colours may appear different in person when compared to your monitor screen, and the design may be altered slightly for the enamel pin, but it will not be major."

I am a product designer living in Hesperia, California, and the Boby necklace is a product I am extremely passionate about. I first came up with the idea when I heard about Maria Shireen's Hairband Bracelet. I thought it was such a cool product, and I wanted to make something like it for bobby pins, which eventually led me to the Boby Necklace. The ideation and iterations took a month, during which I also reached out to different manufactures to see if they could make samples of the necklace. Another month later, and here I am!The Boby necklace comes in four colors: Rose gold, gold, silver, and black. The necklace also comes in two chain lengths: 20 inches and 33 inches.Although the necklace is beautiful in and of itself, what makes the Boby really special is that it can carry up to five two-inch bobby pins inside the necklace.The bobby pins can be easily removed by first pushing the bobby pins out from the bottom: Then taking out the pins with two fingers:The Boby necklace is made out of 100% steel and will be packaged in 100% cotton Eco-friendly muslin bags.

In it, we honor the past and remember those who came before us.  It helps shape our attitude about death, not considering it sad or frightening, but rather just another step in our journey.  For the past 3 years, we have been working on and developing a collection of 54 paintings, which blend this special holiday with another Mexican institution, the Bingo game, ‘Loteria’.  We chose to bring these two traditions together to bring an authentic voice to the beauty and history of Mexican culture, and to help others connect with this culture in a way that is playful, meaningful and educational.The 54 images will consist of both traditional iconic elements of the original game, such as “La Sirena” and “El Sol”, and elements emblematic of Mexican culture, such as “El Luchador” and “La Virgen”.  Each piece is an original 9x12 painting consisting of a smiling skull with the corresponding loteria image painted on its forehead.  Patterns and designs used reflect some aspect of the culture, whether they be drawn from textiles, folk art, historical artifactsor popular culture.

Plus building enough content for a premium subscription option later that would offer additional exclusive content for those subscribers.Server costs, Host, and getting my domain name. Site design will be the most expensive. Having a SSL for the whole site. A Shopping cart so you can buy items.A VIP membership will be for the people who want custom and exclusive items from me. I will announce the price at a later time. Thanks for looking and hope to get this site up and running! I feel we can do this together real quick! Kisses.",There is very low risk. It isn't done overnight but will take time. I will keep you updated on the progress every step of the way! I've already pulled together most of the funds needed for this project and will pay for any shortfall out of pocket.,https://www.kickstarter.com/projects/nicolemclee/artistic-nude-website-and-studio?ref=discovery_category_newest,nicolemclee/artistic-nude-website-and-studio,"Hi Everyone!My nameNicole McLee, I'm a independentmodel that loves art!

UPDATE:I have a host and Domain. Still need SSL for checkout.This painting was of me and really has no true meaning behind it. I was always told we are like 60% water and how our soul makes us who we are, It seems there was always two sides or me, Dry and Wet.This one was taken with a sheet and a box fan, I love the flow of this and painted it. I called it motion light.This was inspired by newly married couple, he said his wife would cook nude. So I painted the model cooking nude. The model that did the photo shoot was actually a maid, So I made the theme look colorful to express her personality and named it Maid.This painting took a while as the model slept I painted her, She had stated going through her break-up was painful. This one here I'm still finishing up, but wanted to share. I did this a Lake Michigan last year.This painting was done at a Casino, The model informed me that someone once called her a ""milf"" and said she had a mid-life crisis. So that's what inspired me to name it that.Art Studio & Art SupplyRecently I got a studio so that is outta the way, now I got somewhere to put my paintings and art supply. Donating will help me get new items needed like paint brushes, canvas and possibility a better camera So I can do more photo shoots with models.Backer UpdatesBackers will get updates including behind-the-scenes photos and videos of the studio, paintings, and insights into what I am doing.Funding Project funds will be used to complete more photo shoots in pursuit of ever better images and Paintings, to compensate models, and of course to ship the rewards to you.

As you guys know my original goal was $2,500 but it didn't make it, so let's try it again! We smashed the $500 goal in two days! So lets do this. The stretch Goal will go toward fulfilling rewards faster and it will also go towards me showing my art in a an actual Gallery so I can sell my art and make a name for my self. I will be able to pay for travel, Fix up my art studio. Also this would help me get top of the line artutensils. If the stretch Goal is not met, it'll be fine! We got the big part outta the way and I thank everyone so much.- Nicole",There is very low risk. I already have the paintings and images prepared. The website is almost finished.

https://www.kickstarter.com/projects/397896513/the-great-ocarina-project?ref=discovery_category_newest,397896513/the-great-ocarina-project,"I am attempting to create at least 3 new designs of ocarina including my first attempts at a 12 hole perfectly tuned version. I will be making the prototype out of plastiscene clay and making a Hydrostone air release mold for each. Each piece will then be pressed using a 2000 lb home made press . I will then assemble each component, and tune each ocarina. They will then be dried, finished and bisque fired. Once they survive this process I will glaze each piece and fire them a second time. Once they emerge from the kiln they will be ready to be shipped to you.","Along the way I expect a few molds to crack and explode due to pressure and use. I will undoubtedly loose a few pieces in the kiln to air bubbles or too much moisture causing them to explode due to heat. There will be a few that glaze themselves to the kiln shelves and will be nearly impossible to separate. All of which is just part of the alchemy of working with ceramics and high temperatures. This will be taken with a grain of salt and second, third, or even tenth attempts will be made until the final product is perfect. As much as I hate to see a piece explode, it facinates me to learn why, and how to avoid it in the next firing.",https://www.kickstarter.com/projects/397896513/from-mud-to-music-a-journey-to-a-12-hole-ocarina?ref=discovery_category_newest,397896513/from-mud-to-music-a-journey-to-a-12-hole-ocarina,"Some of the glazes we offerThe video below is an example of the molds I want to make and how they work plus a how to make an ocarina..My name is Alex Betsill. I have spent the last 7 years making ocarinas for someone else. I have made over 15,000 ocarinas in both 4 hole and 6 hole versions. I have decided to go out on my own and make ocarinas for myself. I have already begun to make both 4 hole and 6 hole ocarinas in my own style and sell them online and at Comic-Cons and Renaissance Festivals throughout the U.S.A. I have decided to take on the awesome task of making a fully chromatic and perfectly tuned, professional quality 12 hole ocarina. This will test my abilities in mold making, in clay manipulation, firing,glazing, and tuning techniques. At the end of this en devour I plan to have a fully functional professional quality instrument capable of being used in any symphony. I also hope to make these ocarinas works or art as well as high quality instruments.We have become regular fixtures at the Space City Con in Houston, and now Galveston, Texas.I and my beautiful wife Amy also do a few Renaissance Festivals and this year for the first time , we will have our ocarinas for sale at the Scarborough Renaissance Festival. We are super excited !As you can see, most of my equipment is invented and built by me. I have devised my own methods using new materials to make tradition molds and a mold press, by hand, from scratch. Most of this equipment runs in the thousands of dollars to buy, but I have invented ways to make it for far less using unconventional methods and materials.","In the process of making these molds, it's entirely possible the explode into fragments during their first use causing a second or third attempt. Once the molds are finished it will take all my skill with clay to hand assemble the parts and properly tune the instrument once assembled. Even once the ocarina is finished with tuning and assembly it may still explode in the kiln due to an imperfection or air bubble in the clay. After an initial successful firing then I have to apply the glaze properly to avoid filling any of the tuning holes improperly and fire the ocarina for a final time. After all of this, only then will the instrument be complete and ready for testing to affirm it survived with the proper tuning still intact. If all of these factors are correct, and the tuning proper, only then will it be ready to call a true musical instrument."

Prices listed are in Canadian dollars.When you pledge, the amount will be converted into US dollars automatically by Kickstarter. For your convenience I have supplied the expected conversion(in brackets). The final conversion may be slightly different from the conversion I have done. Don't worry, the currency conversion cost is NOT charged to the person making a pledge.In addition to the dedicated front and rear fixtures, I am also offering a universal ISO fixture. This single fixture can be used to attach either front or rear tabs in the standard locations.Add disc tabs to your frame and fork.If you are upgrading an older frame or building a new one, you will probably want to add disc brake mounts.Disc brakes were first popularized on mountain bikes. Now cyclocross, touring, commuting and even road bikes are using them. With these fixtures you can add disc mounting tabs to any frame, new or old.This Kickstarter project aims to produce a set of disc tab mounting fixtures.These tools are for bicycle framebuilders, or anyone who wants to add disc brake mounts to a frame or fork. You don't need to be a frame builder or even a professional welder to put these tools to work. They are simple too use. The fixtures provide the strength and rigidity you need to hold the tabs in place during welding or brazing. At the same time, the form factor is minimal, so the fixtures do not obstruct the welding or brazing torch.The fixtures are for attaching bicycle industry ISO standard tabs. This is the standard found on almost all bicycle frames and forks. It allows you to run older model disc brake calipers, or newer post mount calipers(with adapters). The two mounting holes are 51mm apart, and in the correct position relative to the axle as per ISO standards. The ISO tab and fixture design assumes that a 160mm diameter disc rotor will be used. Other rotor sizes require adapters, which are widely available. Front and rear fixtures are not interchangeable. The front fixture must be used to attach the fork tab, and the rear fixture must be used to attach the frame tab.Any ISO standard disc tabs may be used, and may be purchased from other suppliers if the ones offered here are not selected.The examples shown here were attached using these fixtures. The tabs were attached to an older steel frame and fork, originally manufactured for rim brakes. The entire process took about an hour for an experienced machinist and welder. The cost was minimal, and far below what a new frame and fork would have cost.The fixtures are also useful for bicycle mechanics and others in the bicycle industry. They can be used to verify whether disc tabs already attached to frames are misaligned or improperly positioned.The installation process is exactly the same for the fork and the frame.Secure the dummy axle into the dropout, with fixture attached.Install the tab into the fixture. Rotate the fixture until the tab is in the desired location.Decide on the cut line for the tab that will best match the profile of the frame or fork.If you want to experiment before cutting the metal tab, you can trace it onto cardboard and modify the cardboard cutout first. Once you are satisfied with the fit, you can cut the metal tab using the profile of the cardboard mock up.Trace the contour of the frame/fork onto the tab.Remove the tab and machine, cut and file as required.
