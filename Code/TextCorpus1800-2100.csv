These names are synonymous with with Slasher Horror. Classic icons of a genre that have stood the test of time. Today there are many modern slashers rising up to challenge for the thorn, like Victor Crowley, and Chrome Skull. New Slasher icons preparing to carry the genre for the next twenty-years. Though one most wonder where are the ladies in all this? Why are there no female slasher icons? This is a question we began asking ourselves over a year ago. Of course there are women in horror, some pretty evil and frighten ones too, but none that truly fit the slasher archetype, until now that is. The story follows six friends on a tubing trip through the back bays of New Jersey when they stumble across a small secluded island. Despite the warnings of an old fisherman the friends decide to let curiosity get the best of them and check it out. We’re sure you can figure out where it goes from there.WHAT IS A SLASHER?When I think of Slashers I think of seemingly supernatural beings that are practically  impervious to pain. A killing machine trapped somewhere between life and death, created by some sort of tragic event in their past. They are fueled by hate and revenge.Slashers can not die.Not truly anyway. They may lie dormant for a period of time but they are never truly dead. They can be shot, stabbed, electrocuted, burned, drowned, covered in toxic waste, but it doesn't matter. Somehow they always get back up.The Glass Girl is a Slasher in this sense.WHAT SETS BOTTLENECK BEACH APART FROM OTHER SLASHER FILMS?Character. Bottleneck Beach is a very character driven film. In many Slasher movies, especially more modern ones the characters are little more than extreme kills waiting to happen. As audience we don't care much about who lives or dies, as long as there is a lot of gore involved.Now Bottleneck Beach will have plenty of that over the top gore that Slasher fans love, but it will also have characters you want to see survive. These aren't just one dimensional characters waiting to have their heads lopped off. These aren't real people, with dreams, and desires, who have found themselves in real danger. The development of these characters is one thing that helps set Bottleneck Beach apart from other modern Slasher films. In early 2012 pre-production began on Bottleneck Beach, and the problems began almost immediately after. Creative differences between the producer and the director lead to the original director leaving the project forcing the the start date to be pushed back, causing a scheduling conflict with one of the actors.Finally in July 0f 2012 filming was set to begin, and would have if not for an issue with the filming location. A local retirement home close to the beach where filming was taking place had issues with the movies content and the city decided that to keep the residents happy we would no longer be able to use their beach. This set back was the straw that broke the camel's back as it were and the producer pulled out leaving Bottleneck Beach dead in the water....We know this is a long shot but this is a project we believe in, it's a story we'd love to tell, and an idea we hope could be franchisable.With your help we hope to create a fun enjoyable Horror movie with lots of scares, and laughs. Oh and of course a lot of gore.WHO WE ARE We are a group of Atlantic City based performers and artist with a deep love for creating and entertaining.Bottleneck Beach was written by Atlantic City based Comedian Chris Librizzi after noticing a shortage of female slasher icons. Chris' dark and twisted sense of humor has gained him a small following in the South Jersey and Philadelphia Comedy Scene, but Chris' heart truly belongs ripped out of his chest and splatter all over the horror genre.The Film is set to star Dupree Lee another Atlantic City comedian who has made quite a name for himself on the East Cost, performing at such clubs as Helium comedy club in Philadelphia, Comedy Stop AC and Borgata Comedy Club.Also from the original cast Atlantic City Slam poet and performance artist Keith Egan.",Many of the same challenges are still there. From finding new locations to re-casting some parts (some of the original cast has expressed interest in coming back) To assembling the crew and getting the proper equipment.,https://www.kickstarter.com/projects/1660456339/the-clucking-truth?ref=discovery_category_newest,1660456339/the-clucking-truth,"In 2013 with the help of filmmaker MB McClain, Chris Librizzi asked the question""Why did the chicken cross the road?""Now he intends to answer it.Little to nothing is known about this Chicken, it has managed to stay off the radar since 2001 but now with your help we can flush this fowl and finally bring the truth to light. It is time we as a nation pull together and get the answers we rightfully deserve.At great personal risk Chris Librizzi plans to document his journey to find the truth behind the Chicken that crossed the road that faithful September morning.OKAY SO HERE IS THE DEAL FOR REALAtlantic City based stand-up comedian Chris Librizzi and performance artist Keith Egan are joining forces to make a strange and dark mockumentary. Expanding on the idea presented in the video above. We have the crew, the script, just about everything we need to go, except the funds to actually go.And that is, (hopefully) where you come in.With your generous donation we'll be able to fuel up, rest up, and eat up, while out on the road filming what very well could be the most elaborate version of the classic ""Chicken crosses the road"" joke.",Besides the obvious dangers of trying to uncover one of America's darkest secrets?

https://www.kickstarter.com/projects/1222593459/k-franklin-custom-guitars?ref=discovery_category_newest,1222593459/k-franklin-custom-guitars,"Usually when I tell people I enjoy building and painting guitars the first question they ask is why? Am I trying to reinvent the modern electric guitar or improve the weaknesses of other companies? The answer is complicated but can be summarized as no.I hold nothing against any of the major brands currently available. In fact, their size is their strength in that they have the resources to make affordable instruments in large numbers, something that is not possible for a small operation like myself. But I was always a bit fussy and was never completely satisfied with an off-the-rack guitar. Something is always wrong and I always end up changing so much that it was more trouble than it was worth. And the custom jobs that would have made me happy? That is where the giants stumble. It is easy for those companies to make one-thousand $200 guitars; much more difficult to make one custom guitar. That is why asking for something unique is really, REALLY expensive.So to summarize... they have the low-cost advantage; I have the custom option advantage.What is currently holding me back is a lack of tools. I've been moving slowly because I don't have all the tools I need. I'm not lacking a lot, but enough to keep me moving at a snail's pace. With a little help and a lot of work I can start making one-of-a-kind guitars that people will love.","Selling what I make is a huge challenge. I can make as many guitars as I want but I will have to let some of them go when they are finished.In all seriousness, sales is something that I'm still working through. I've sold through websites like eBay and Etsy but those are slow and unpredictable. I'm not surprised by this. Many people are leery of buying any musical instrument online. What if you receive the instrument and hate it? It is always more safe to go to a store and play it first. This is even more true when it comes to an unknown brand.In the coming months I am going to begin looking for a few locally owned shops to discuss selling what I make (I already have a few in mind). I will probably begin by selling on consignment. As I move forward I might branch out and look for shops further away, maybe even search online for shops at great distances from myself.",https://www.kickstarter.com/projects/1222593459/buffalo-grove-handcrafted-pens?ref=discovery_category_newest,1222593459/buffalo-grove-handcrafted-pens,"I started making these pens because of my guitar building. To build an electric guitar body you start with a ""body blank"" which is usually around 20"" x 14"" x 2"". Immediately you make a rough cut of the shape you want to remove at least 30% of that wood. I quickly started getting an inventory of various hardwood ""scraps"". I couldn't bring myself to throw it all out. It wasn't immediately needed but was still a valuable raw material. What should I do with this?Thinking about this problem I remember watching a video of someone turning wood on a lathe to make a pen. I thought, ""I could do that... maybe... probably."" Having that though and a bit of spare wood I bought a few tools. Turns out I can do it. In fact, the process of turning wood is fun, entertaining, rewards, and addictive.The new problem becomes this: I can't indefinitely make pens unless I sell pens. How many different pens does one person need, right? So I'm trying to raise a bit of money to make more pens. I know that doesn't make sense, but it will. On hand I do not have enough inventory to set up a stand at local craft shows and flea markets. With more supplies I could get enough to start selling at events, build a reputation, make more pens, so on, so forth.I'll continue makes guitars as well... they're fun too!","The challenges that I face right now I building momentum to get started. I have the motivation, I have the tools, I enjoy what I am doing, but I don't have the funds necessary to take it beyond my work shop."

From that time forward, Leonard Cohen, Spanky and Our Gang, Harry Nilsson, Freddie Mercury, Willie Nelson, Johnny Cash, Patsy Cline, Kanye West, Eminem, and about 100 other connected souls, collaborated with each other to teach us the power of synchronicity and by doing so, became the inspiration for ""Cookie Karma"".We began gathering bits of wisdom contributed by our customers. Verses passed down from a grandmother, profound quotes, even one-liners written by customers like, ""A balanced diet is a cookie in each hand!"" or ""Life's too short to eat bad cookies!""Then we began printing them on little fortune-cookie-like papers that we drop into every bag of our cookies!They becam like thousands of ""messages in a bottle"" and amazingly over the last 6 months we've sent over 200,000 messages into the universe, over 400 different ""messages in a bag"" that connect the sender and receiver in a unique and intimate way.

I’ve stepped on many a boards and have ridden some of the tastiest of waves. I consider the ocean my home and so do many others. So, if I make something that goes into the ocean, it has to abide by the rules of nature! Let’s get real about our environment for a minute. Pollution in our oceans is a devastating reality due to the engine of industry. So many irresponsible and reckless manufacturers, pipelines ripping through coastal shores, carelessness and waste products working their way into our water ways. I wanted to make a responsible product and not contribute to the misuse of our planet. What came to mind? Surf wax! Millions of Diddler’s all over the planet just like me use it every day. We surf! Anything used on a global scale like surf wax is going to make an impact. Trust, Mr. Diddles Kush WAX will not only compliment your skin (made with all natural organic ingredients) it is environmentally safe technology! It has no petroleum or paraffin products in the making. They’ll tell you petroleum is biodegradable, but if Mother Nature intended for us to wear it or ingest it, she would have put it in our reach, not forcing us to dig below for it. In addition, Millennials and KUSH enthusiasts all over the world will be happy to know, each bar of Mr. Diddle’s KUSH Wax comes with HEMP infused oils. Yep, you read that right! Hemp seed oil is a high source of polyunsaturated and essential fatty acids! In other words, your Dr. approves of its use and so does Mr. Diddle’s! To top it all off, Mr. Diddles Kush Wax works awesome! Our Cold and Warm Water formulas are beautifully tacky while keeping in mind the most sensitive of skins. It won’t irritate your shell bro! That is why we only use natural/organic materials to make every handcrafted bar. We don’t use machines either; every bar is hand poured and inspected by me.The process to make these guys is something I’ve mastered through trial and error. I have my own laboratory of sorts, a clean, safe workshop environment where I make these little guys. I only buy ingredients from reputable organic vendors and all my equipment is sterilized between production. I make everything myself right now, but the greater demand for the product requires me to grow outside my environment. I will firstly, recruit family and friends who believe in what I’m doing, and in so doing, keeping a reigns on the quality of what we put out. That’s so important to me to keep this product at its basic elements, made with love. To get this to market and how the funding will help? I’ll need more equipment, a larger working facility and staffing. Production has already increased because of its popularity and I am already networking with local surf shops, dispensaries for store placement and distributors for order fulfillment. A larger facility will also help me logistically in order to store and ship this product worldwide. There’s Diddler’s everywhere! Once Mr. Diddles is a widely used staple, you better believe I’ve got other great products in mind, using similar elements; to enhance other areas of our lives! Mr. Diddles says “Stay Sticky!”It's hard to believe I've come this far with it all. I was happy making Mr. Diddle's for myself and then a buddy of mine had the bright idea I should forgo sleep for the next couple of years and drop every loving penny I had into this hobby. Turns out, it was the best decision I've ever made. I've met some of the greatest enthusiasts and conservationists along my journey along with makers of organic materials, that are strictly used for Mr. Diddles Kush Wax. A central ingredient in surf wax is Bee Wax. I purchase this ingredient from local bee farmers ensuring the highest quality and care of its makers, the bees. They are loved. Coconut Oil is another main ingredient in which I am supplied from only true organic sources. Coconut oil is a fantastic product with many applications and can last up to 6 months without rancidification at 24 °C (75 °F). If the oil spoils, it's no good to Mr. Diddles. Only the freshest of ingredients will be used in my product. Of course, I have a secret mix that sets us apart from the masses and will continue to create more products in the coming months with these organic ingredients made of love.""Bottom-line, the wax is high-quality and affordable.The wax has attitude all on its own. Love it"".Hector Rios - Santa Cruz, CA.(excerpt from letter to Mr. Diddles)""I live in Raleigh and have to makea trek to surf. My favorite shop Sweetwater Surf Shop doesn't carry Mr.Diddles' Surf Wax yet. Can you make that happen? My friend from Cali hooked me up and my bar is almost done. I'm gonna fiend here soon!

I currently have a garage and all the tools necessary to construct the modules.  In addition, I have experience in construction and fabrication to build the components.  I'm confident that I will have no problem building, documenting the process on video and creating good blueprints, supply lists and drawings to develop a functional $1000 Warmpod.My design, especially the curved fiberglass roof with pins, is new.  The only potential challenge will be determining what final design will be light enough to be carried, easy enough to construct by most ""do-it-yourselfers"" and structurally sound.  However, through the building process, I will find the best possible solution and present it in the videos.  Even if I have to contribute my own money, which I plan on doing, I will build this and be successful in communicating methods so that a $1000 portable shelter will be available to give warmth to those that seek comfort.  I ask your help in making this journey happen.",https://www.kickstarter.com/projects/1277526577/how-warm-is-a-warmpod?ref=discovery_category_newest,1277526577/how-warm-is-a-warmpod,"Like the name says, the Warmpod is intended to standardize a super energy efficient tiny structure that can provide warmth to those in need.I've already completed the prototype Warmpod which is extremely strong and structurally sound. In addition, I've created plans and videos which are currently available at www.warmpod.comI need additional funding to complete three main goals:(a) Measure and publish the energy efficiency of the Warmpod. Funding will be necessary to establish the rate of BTU/hr necessary to keep this design warm enough to keep a person alive. I will need to purchase rigid foam insulation, a temperature measuring device, a heat source and fuel.(b) Maintain a free website. It will cost about $100/year to have server space for www.warmpod.com. In addition, I will need some money for hiring professional help to get issues resolved with html coding, to keep the site updated, etc... (c) Continued research and development. It will be necessary to have funding to cover expenses such as paint, resin, fiberglass, flashing and wood to determine the best configuration for practical waterproofing methods. Future videos, pictures and plans will reflect the latest findings.","The biggest risk/challenge was producing a sturdy structure... which is no longer an issue.  I took the biggest chance by funding the construction of the prototype Warmpod personally.  Now, I need help to continue communicating results, innovation, fine tuning and free-to-use plans."

The funds raised from this kickstarter will be used to build a 3D fabrication platform that will print biologically compatible polymers that will build the inserts.An insert is a 3D scaffolding material that cells will attach onto to grow. 3D inserts provides a 3D environment and increase the surface area while reducing the amount of materials needed to grow cells. These inserts can also be used with small seeds and placed into pots to grow vegetables. The inserts will provide a volumized platform for the seed to germinate. This is a 3D CAD Model of what one of the inserts will look like. Its inter-connective allows for nutrient supply to cells deep within the scaffold:These 3D platform will be fabricated from a 3D printer that has the deposition capabilities to print biological polymers.

I have always been against using potentially harmful chemicals on plants, especially those that grow vegetables which we eventually eat! I need these funds to be able to make it easier for people to use this daily fertilizer and make the chemical-free product more appealing. So far I am in works with manipulating the product I have more by making it more efficient and easier to use and I need your funds to get me there. I will also use funds to further research the effect of using my fertilizer versus other competitors. So far my research has concluded that my fertilizer produces better results than using Miracle-Gro, while staying chemical-free! I want to use these funds to do more research on other fertilizers on the market today.Thank you for your contributions and let's make the world a better place one plant at a time.",Potential challenges will be making the product easier to use for people to use more effectively.,https://www.kickstarter.com/projects/cupofgrow/cup-of-grow-effective-plant-boosting-fertilizer?ref=discovery_category_newest,cupofgrow/cup-of-grow-effective-plant-boosting-fertilizer,"My name is Braxton Miller and I am a sophomore studying accounting at the Kelley School of Business. My family and I have always been committed to growing our personal gardens every year so that we can enjoy the fresh vegetables they produce. However, some years we weren't as fortunate to receive the benefits of our hard work as our plants would shrivel up and die during the season. We tried using fertilizers (chemical and non-chemical), and other watering solutions but we still came across the same problem. Eventually, we accepted the fact that some seasons were better than others and it was simply Mother Nature making its impact on our plants.One day, I decided enough was enough as it was time to create my own fertilizer while keeping harmful chemicals out of the mix. Through extensive research, I was able to create the perfect formula and test it with indoor/outdoor plants, vegetables, shrubs, and so much more! The results were extraordinary as the mixture contains the perfect amount of macro and micro nutrients for all purpose plants without the use of any chemicals! Our findings also left us with research that showed Cup of Grow works more effectively and makes plants stronger and healthier than any other fertilizer on the market today!I am raising money so that I can provide this product in different sizes and so that I can afford an extensive fertilizer analysis to provide to all my consumers. Any funds are much appreciated as I hope to make the world a better place by providing a chemical-free alternative to fertilizers, while being more effective than other chemical fertilizers on the market.As an accounting major at the Kelley School of Business, I have continued to work on Cup of Grow to get it into the hands of all gardeners who want to enrich their plants. I am eager to sell this product as I can happily say it has benefited our plants for three straight years without any problems. Compared to other fertilizers and plant boosting solutions on the market, Cup of Grow is by far the best and I can't wait for you to give it a try. I have done the hard work to find the perfect solution for you so now its time for you to make the switch to the most effective daily solution on the market today!","A challenge for my product is getting it into the hands of consumers as it is fairly new. Even though I have seen its tremendous potential and impact on gardens, plants, etc., I need help showing other people the boost it brings."

'It was unfortunate that Micka had to leave the group because he was always great to hang around and just an awesome person in general' lead singer Colton, referring to guitarist and co-founding member 'Micka'.Remaining members, lead singer, Colton Goldie and drummer, Will Hegarty discussed whether they could continue on without Micka. They didn't want to replace him, so the only option was to do it themselves. Luckily both members are pretty good all around musicians. As well as being the lead singer Colton also has a background as guitarist for the group 'Millperra' who were known for technical riffs and a heavy sporadic playing as well as being a skilled sound engineer, guitar technician and producer. Drummer Will, also has a background as a guitarist, bassist and percussionist in various types of groups as well as a background in song writing and production, studying sound engineering in collage.So the pair knew they could do it, they just had to figure out how to make it work. They had to figure it out quickly as well because they had shows booked in Queensland and NSW. The pair flushed out a new set, played a few shows then flew to Brisbane and continued to play shows over the week where they were received extremely well by audiences and knew they had what it took to continue.Both Colt and Will saw this new arrangement as a challenge and an opportunity to be able to incorperate all their skills to the group.They quickly constructed a new sound, taking the best of their chaotic heavy sound they were known for and incorperated their love of electronic music to make their set a non stop ride from start to finish.The group then began work on their debut album ‘DISTRACTIONS’, the duo wanted to give people kind of inside look at how they are going about recording, so they are producing a mini series with short movies documenting the recording of the project.

The group really wants you to see the process of recording during the series and what it takes to keep going as a group, the troubles of recording on a budget, the lengths they go to get the sounds they need and all while having some fun and trying to deliver some entertaining content along the way.The reason for the group is raising money is to get the album mixed & mastered, while the pair write, play, record themselves, the final process is an expensive part. The duo want to deliver the most dynamic, sonically impressive project they have ever done but to achieve this they will need your help! The production for the album will be around $10,000 but the pair are only asking for $3000, with their intention on ‘rocking shows’ and whatever extra jobs they can get their hands on to pay for the remaining bulk.

I am 24 years old and I am an aspiring film director. I wish to create films as a career, and A Life Alone is my stepping stone project.The funding for my kickstarter account is going towards marketing the movie and post production stages. The movie itself is being made with what little money I have; but I need your help to get it out to be seen by the world!A HDTrailerfor the project is available on:http://youtu.be/EFGRkJhz2QMMy Facebook account is available on:https://m.facebook.com/profile.php?id=1517075208565280My project is named ""A Life Alone"".My Film follows the life of a man named Tom Chaser. He isunemployed and low on money, struggling to keep his possessions and trying toreturn to work in a world that has too few jobs to offer. He stumbles across a secret family recipe for a lifechanging tonic that removes sadness and depression; promoting task orientation,and he decides to developa life changing business. A business named 'Kindness'; an organisation set to help stop world suffering with his life changing drink. He only has one problem; he cant sell. Lin Austin, (sonof Austin pharmaceutical industries CEO)discoversTom's product in an encounter, which leads them to be business partners.After a few years and 'Kindness' growing worldwide withthe lowest reports of crime in history,Tom begins to realise his product doesn't have the same effect it used to. People seem to act more like drones. An investigation into Linleads him towards a dark path. He mustchoose betweenhelping mankindor making money; but most of all he needs to survive what he has created..Here is an Excerpt from the script of A Life Alone(c) 2014. written by Joel Bristowe-Browne.Today is a new day. ANew light dawns a new sky with new heights. Life is to reach out and be takenby the reigns; unless of course you’re alone and unemployed. Then those reignsare shorter - and feel more around your neck.I grew up with my parents and an older sister only a suburbaway. I graduated high school with a fresh perspective in 2007 and went on to completea medley of studies and jobs. Seemingly heading in random directions in aneffort to try and “figure out” my existence.This will be my third month unemployed I have a mortgage, a car, memberships, bills, things. A bunchof “things”; These things define me in society. Time and time again I hear that‘I mustn’t be fairing too badly’. I mean I have a place to sleep and a means oftransport. This is true, however limited my money options are I do in factstill own my own apartment and a car.How much longer I own them for is the relevant mystery.Of all the aspects of social misery, nothing can be asheartbreaking as unemployment. I don’t go out. I don’t really socialise… What’sthe point? Upon socialising status directly reflects character, and nowadays myonce tireless, assertive working life has been transformed in the eyes of mypeers towards a lazy, indulging sponge that would rather be at home thenworking. The problem is unseen. Silenced by those affected andfantasy for those overlooking. Unemployment diminishes people and leisureenlarges them. For those with work, my existence is seemingly only leisure. They slave for hours at a time at work whilst Iam sitting at home; it does seem like the ultimate screw-over.But what goes unseen are the nights wide awake, the constantevaluation of the calendar in a depressing countdown to defaulting on my loan,or the repossession of my car. The denied purchases, and turn down after turndown on job offers.- Sometimes ill make a lucky break; Ill make a few bucks and besafe for a week or two. Before long however, foresight returns and my hopefades.The realities of life start to sink in after a few weeks of self-examinationand exploration. The relentless resentment for those who have wronged me inthe past, or jealousy for what others have done or will do in the future heldme down. I never really stopped to think about the now. About thedivine chances of my existence coming to be. About the indescribable beauty that thisplanet has to offer.For once I felt rich. Not rich with power or money. But richwith purpose. You see I discovered how to sell. Just not in the sense that mostwould understand.I could sell you cars, tablets, technology, clothing andadvise. I just have to create a need. However even with the ability to sellanything, I would not be able to grant myself satisfaction.I decided to sell kindness.Before you go psychoanalysing my answer too much, I dounderstand that the process of selling is defined as the exchange for goods orservices. Yes I made and sold kindness.However not the action kindness you would normally think of. Little viles of kindness.This is howI began…","Some risks involved with making films will always be fairly constant. Insufficient lighting or camera/ filming equipment, Weather can change, Abilities or permissions to shoot in certain places can be rejected. Availability of actors and cast with the motivation for continuation in a project can present problems. The story itself is set up to combat a lot of these issues by remaining quite simple. It is about one person and only 10 to 15 volunteers would be needed to complete the storyline. Good backing up of software and film would ensure no technological malfunctions would affect the post production process and before each shoot proper planning can help ease with filming. Then there is the editing or post production taking time to be prepared and rendered with a means for distribution to be organised. But with good software and a well set up computer issues can be prevented.",https://www.kickstarter.com/projects/joelbrisfilms/wolf?ref=discovery_category_newest,joelbrisfilms/wolf,"The funding for this project is going towards the creation of the first series of a children's animation short named Wolf.Written by my grandmother Helen Whiteley, Wolf is a hunter that is not aware of his wild genes. He thinks he is an adorable puppy and longs to play with the children in the village; but cant figure out why they are all too terrified of him.The initial Pilot episode has been created with the use of converting real life images to cartoon and animating the images with stop motion animation.The goal of my kickstarter is to be able to purchase a flash or similar animation program and create the first season of Wolf. Then to pitch the idea to television and web sites such as the ABC for exposure.The kickstarter funding will go towards - Adobe Flash, Marketing the film and creating the series.If the kickstarter funding picks up i will be creating plush toys and merchandise for the series.","The risks involve include deadlines for the series and underexposure. Creating a project, especially a series can be a lot of time and effort expended. Deadlines can sometimes present an issue with the release of the episode but underexposure of the project is the main challenge to be address. Marketing of the series will be the main focus after the creation to get the name out for commercial use."

I’ve decide to come to Kickstarter for help not onlyfor monetary reasons, but personal goals as well. The truth is, I make thesefun piece because I love doing it. I never get an order, then sigh, and dreadthe upcoming work to do. No! Not ever! Creating these pieces makes me feel alive,and it makes me feel free; Especially since my time in the military has triedto squash out my individuality at every opportunity they have. I’m a square pegthey’re trying to chop down to fit into a round, cookie-cutter hole. No thank you! My time in the service is coming to end because I could not be broken. That leads me to my true reason for Kickstarter. Ireally don’t care if I reach the $1000 goal because my true reward is that Imay inspire someone else to strive for that freedom from the nine to fivedoldrums and pursue their passions. That’s why I’ve chosen a much smaller amountthan my last campaign, because it’s not about the money, its bout how you getthere being the worthier part (RIP Shepherd Book). If just one person isinspired, I call that a landslide of a win. So, let’s do this together and find that specialfreedom. Hell, we may all still have to trudge through the trenches of a nineto five to make ends meet, that may never go away. However, to me, theknowledge that I go home to my woodshop and just make anything and everything Iwant is the equivalent of body armor.

https://www.kickstarter.com/projects/squaredmedia/home-return-to-earth?ref=discovery_category_newest,squaredmedia/home-return-to-earth,"Humanity was forced to flee Earth during the Great War. Nuclear fallout and radiation poisoning made the planet uninhabitable. InterAg, the richest corporation on the planet, spearheaded the mass exodus and helped humanity set up a colony on Mars. For hundreds of years humans have survived only to come to the realization that a permanent establishment is not just unlikely, it is impossible. With famine and starvation ravaging Mars, InterAg once again sends explorers out to find salvation--this time back on Earth, where they hope to find a welcoming home once more. Instead, when they arrive they find that things are not quite as they were lead to believe. Something survived the Great War and it is furious at being left behind.A new production company based in the Chicago area. We have been working on short films for the last couple years and have the passion to push forward with more ambitiousprojects. We will handle pre-production and post-production work including pulling together crew and cast, pre-visualization, editing, post effects, and marketing and festival submissions. One of the founding members of Squared Media, Christopher has been chosen to spearhead the project. He is most known for directing 'Case #21: The Slender Man' and the upcoming short film, 'Men of Iniquity'. He's worked on set for several great projects and hopes to utilize that experience in order to make his vision of 'Home' a reality.Brandon Bardwell is a stunning FX and make-up artist who works in the Chicago area. His work can most recently be seen in the upcoming zombie-apocalyptic thriller, 'Seeing Dead'. He's an elite talent and his role is integral in turning 'Home' into the project it needs to be to succeed.Here's a breakdown list of what we will be using the donation towards:Thank you for your help bringing this project to life! Below are the different designs for tier rewards. To show your commitment mugs and posters will be personalized with your name on it!As we already have backers in certain tiers we can not edit the tiers directly but there are changes as listed below.Any donation $25 and above shall receive a digital copy of the film in a H264, MP4 format.Any donation $250 and above will receive a high quality signed DVD copy of the film.","Any great undertaking runs the risk of even greater hurdles. The process of making an elaborate short film, such as 'Home', absolutely requires the commitment, time, and money of talented individuals. Our first hurdle will be pulling together the staff necessary to make this film on the shoe-string budget we are anticipating. We want to pull in some name talent to anchor the film and that will require all sorts of things to go our way.The second hurdle we face will be the renting out of expensive locations. The 'Home' screenplay spends most of its time in lush, and beautiful, forests. Naturally we'll be utilizing the parks of Chicago as our setting. It's not cheap to get permits, gear, and personnel on location and even little things like weather could delay us.The last hurdle isn't so much one of difficulty, but more of timing. 'Home' is set in late Summer, early Fall. In order to capture the film we see in our hearts we will need to get things done quickly this year. If we are forced to we will delay shooting until after this rapidly approaching winter.",https://www.kickstarter.com/projects/squaredmedia/ghebbar-woods?ref=discovery_category_newest,squaredmedia/ghebbar-woods,"Most people outside of the industry don't realize that the work doesn't even start until the film is finished.

https://www.kickstarter.com/projects/1483915078/nekos-tea-room?ref=discovery_category_newest,1483915078/nekos-tea-room,"I want to open a simple vintage tea room but with a twist.  The tea room will have a group of cats living in it, roaming freely among the customers.  The key aims are to make money, to increase awareness of animal care and re-homing issues and provide a happy and peaceful sanctuary for the feline residents and human visitors alike.The first cat café opened in Taiwan in 1998.  It became very popular and attracted much tourism from the Japanese, who then went on to open their first cat café in 2004.  Since then, Tokyo alone has opened at least 39 cat cafés and brought in tourists from around the world.  More recently, the trend has started to spread and spill out across the globe.Here in the UK, Totnes cat café opened in Devon in 2013, but has since had to close due to the owners ill health.  The only operating cat café in the UK is Lady Dinha’s in London.  They boast a high popularity with a need for 30 day advance booking.  This shows a huge demand for this very desirable service which only one place in the south is offering.  Nothing further north has this.Many people want to visit a place like this, but with London holding the only one in the UK, it is too far most people in the north to travel. I believe that this venture will bring people from all around Yorkshire and beyond to have tea with a feline friend.I plan to create a vintage setting and serve mostly traditional tea room items. No cooked meals. I will have tea pots and french press coffee, sandwiches and scones, tea cakes, cake and biscuits. An afternoon tea service will be the specialty with a platter holding a mixture of all of the above. As well as food and drink, I also intend to sell cat related trinkets.","So far, the main problems I have encountered have been those of animal welfare and food hygiene.Animal welfare is one of the highest priorities for me.  As you will see in my bio, I have a national diploma in animal management.  I have studied such issues of animal exploitation for human gain, which I am well aware some people do see this to be.  And to a degree, they are right.  The cats are the hook in the business and the business stands to make capitol because of them.  But with my back ground, I intend to make my point very clear that the cats come first.  Both with information on display on the premises and on the website and facebook page.  The cats will be adopted rescue pets.  I will have literature and information readily available on responsible pet ownership and adoption.  Care schedules on all the cats will be on show to indicate their flea/worm treatments, health checks, any medications, grooming and their back ground for micro chipping and spaying/neutering.There will also be rules in place to protect the cats from being hounded.    They will be able to move around anywhere they wish and have areas to hide if they do not want to be with people.  I also plan to ask for cat specialists to monitor them on a regular basis to ensure they are healthy and comfortable.The hygiene issue is both easy and difficult to address depending on who you speak to.  Using a basic survey, I have so far identified that the majority of people are not worried about the tea room being safe to eat in.  Many have pets or have eaten in friends or relatives homes with pets around.  They (and I) feel that as long as you clean and keep animals away from the food prep area, there is nothing to worry about.  I do plan to make a big deal about a strict cleaning regiment.  I have also asked for opinions on my survey as to what would make people feel more comfortable eating there.  Many suggestions are ones I have also thought of myself and are not complicated to carry out.  Regular cleaning of the tables and whole area, a wall chart showing cleaning task marked off as and when completed, a hand washing area, antiseptic table wipes and the cats themselves looking healthy and groomed.If you require any further details about any aspect of this project, then please do feel free to contact me at any time.Thank you.",https://www.kickstarter.com/projects/1483915078/nekos-kitty-comforts?ref=discovery_category_newest,1483915078/nekos-kitty-comforts,"I am soon going to be opening Neko's Tea Room in Wakefield. This will be Yorkshire's first cat cafe and will have resident felines roaming around as you enjoy a nice cup of tea in pretty vintage surroundings.Our lovely rescue cats will be wanting to live in style and comfort (don't we all) so we are wanting to raise some funds to provide them with bespoke cat furniture, all designed and created just for them by creative, local individuals.Cats will need to have fun and active things to do. It is in their nature to climb, jump and play. These items will help by giving them plenty to climb around and do lots of jumping.They also love to lounge in comfort, so beautiful beds in all kinds of places and at all sorts of levels will give them the option to get in the best and most comfortable places to nap.Another thing they like is to get up to a high point and observe. This makes them feel secure, like a lion on top of a mountain, looking out over their land.We all like to get away from everything sometimes too. We need nice little places for kitties to hide when they are feeling tired or afraid, overwhelmed or just anti-social. These are a few examples of the type of items we are wanting to fund.","When it comes to the cat furniture, there should not be too many problems.  I already know many creative people who can help to turn basic items in to beautiful things."

The ARPG is becomingmore and more popular with each passing year as game developers of all sizes are jumping on board with this play style of gaming. The time is now that we recognize ARPGs for their own unique contributions to the industry of gaming.What’s this Kickstarter about then? Well, read the wholething and you’ll know. But to summarize, this Kickstarter is to help ARPGamer,an up-and-coming gaming news source, launch a quarterly magazine that will bemuch more awesome than the website we'll also be launching to complement it.Don’t believe us? Take a look at theprototypes we’ve worked up below.The ARPG market is booming thanks to popular game serieslike Diablo and Torchlight. What this means for you is that there are soongoing to be a lot more games for you to go hack ‘n slash crazy on (there are a lot presently, but there'll be more to come shortly). And whatthat means for us is that there are a lot of games that need to be brought tothe attention of the public. It’s practically a win-win situation for you, the gamer, and us, the reviewer.And while we may reference Torchlight and Diablo a lot here,these two games aren’t going to be the only focus of our content. There arecountless more games already released as well as in development. Let’s discoverthose other games that seem to slip through the cracks and help boost the ARPGgenre in its entirety. We will be featuring game previews, reviews, exclusiveinterviews with developers, our own short dungeon crawler story series, and amazinggame artwork.Much as we’d like to develop this magazine on a monthlybasis, we just don’t have the resources for it presently. Maybe with time we’llbe able to deliver on such a goal, but that’ll be down the road. In the meanwhile,you can expect to see ARPGamer in all its well-designed bliss on a quarterlybasis. We’ll be making up for the lack of issue release frequency by theawesomeness of the content. If we get sufficient backers and generate enoughcontributor interest, then the possibility of a monthly release schedule wouldn’t be all that bad of an idea.To show you how much we love you, our backers, as well asARPGs in general, we’ll also be launching a daily news website to complementthe magazine. This site will be filled with daily content regarding the latestand greatest news in the gaming industry. Since the magazine obviously can’tcover much time-sensitive information due to its quarterly nature, we’ll beoffering the daily news website to cover the big stories as they happen.Where will that news be? None other than our very ownwebsite, ARPGamer.com, which is currently undergoing construction. Upon thesuccessful conclusion of this Kickstarter, we’ll be launching the daily newswebsite as a celebration as well as demonstration of our dedication to creatingthis magazine.In high school, we were those recluses who played videogames all day and spoke in gaming references during class. We enveloped ourlives in the world of ARPGs and gave countless hours of our existence to titleslike Diablo, Zelda, and Torchlight. We did other things too, but mostly gaming. And now, here we are, all big and grown up.ARPGamer’s motley crew is made up of passionate gamers and professional writers. Several of us have made a career of writing, and this is our opportunity to get into an industry we love: gaming. We are just people who love to game and want to share ourlove of the ARPG genre with the community. And most of us happen to write for a living,so that helps with the quality of content too.We plan on releasing our first ARPGamer e-magazine issue onApril 2, 2013. We would do it on the first of the month, but everyone would likely suspect this as a cruel April Fool's joke. Which it isn't.It'd make for a rather lameprank when you download your copy that morning. Because it’d be real. And notfake. So, instead, everyone is going to have to wait an extra day to escape the negative associations of April 1.This launch date was set five months from now as the magazine itself stillrequires extensive design work as well as content development and obtaining copyright clearances from game developers for in-game screenshots. Plus, we’ll betrying to deliver you daily news on our website, so that’s just a lot of work tojuggle at the start. But once the first issue is released, you can expect to see futureissues on a perfectly harmonious quarterly basis that will never be interrupteduntil the Sun burns out or the zombie apocalypse happens, whichever comes first(hopefully the latter, because that would be amazing).ARPGamer is intended for an online audience, and as suchwill be available to the modern reader via PDF and EPUB formats. With time wehope to expand that level of availability to MOBI and any other e-reader formatyou may be using by that point. For the time being, expect to only see this magazine electronically as a PDFor EPUB. But if you back us for $75, then you’ll be one of the rare fewgetting an actual paper copy of our first issue. It seems a bit medieval of usto do, but people have asked for it.The vast majority of the money we raise will go towardbuilding the magazine itself. This includes all of the nerdy stuff you lovelike further refining the design of the magazine, paying contributors and illustrators for their work, implementing it on iOS and Android, andgetting a handle on distribution and subscription methods to make it asseamless as possible. The Kickstarter also includes building the foundation we’llneed to maintain an online presence. This will be everything from merchant portalsfor accepting subscription payments to webhosting for the daily news aspect ofour service. And party confetti. Lots of confetti.We’d like to think you want to help fund us because you wantto read ARPGamer. We’re huge gaming buffs and we share a passion for the ARPGgenre of gaming that simply cannot be contained. It runs in our veins likegiant radioactive rubber pants! We’ve been dedicated backers for numerous game developersto simply facilitate the growth of the gaming industry generally and the ARPGgenre specifically. Back us, and we’ll be able to make something truly amazing for the genre as a whole and help drive up the success of other indie game studios.What if I want aprinted copy of ARPGamer magazine?Simply open the PDF or EPUB and click “Print.” Or visit aKinkos. Or, even better, you can get a printed edition of our first issue inthe Mithril Edition reward for $75!What if I don’t havea smartphone, tablet, or ebook reader? Can I still read the magazine?The PDF and EPUB versions can both be viewedthrough the use of reader applications on your desktop or laptop PC (or Mac ifyou’re a weirdo). But it’ll look a lot more awesome on a tablet. Just sayin’.Will this be offeredas MOBI?While it would seem easy to accommodate MOBI as an ebookformat, it does not meet with the scope of our plans immediately. Should thepopularity of ARPGamer and the feedback we receive warrant for such a move, wewill accommodate readers by providing it in future issues.Are there any goodARPGs coming out soon?Sir, it sounds like you need to subscribe to ARPGamermagazine and find out for yourself! In each issue, we’ll have a lengthy list ofupcoming ARPG titles and when you can expect to get your greasy little hands onthem. But to answer your question, yes, a lot of ARPGs are coming out soon that would be worth your attention and investment.Can I contribute toARPGamer?Certainly! We have so many different things we’re hoping todo that we would stand to benefit largely from the addition of a wide range of skills. If youhave any experience in the following areas, by all means, let us know: onlineadvertising, distribution, video creation/editing, writing, editing, graphic design, andillustration. If you or anyone you know suffers from excessive skill in any ofthose areas, please let us know at info@arpgamer.com.How can I keep up to date with ARPGamer news currently?Glad you asked! You can find us online at Facebook and Twitter.","Even once we’re funded, the main challenge we will be faced with is continuing to create high-quality content and finding contributors. Maintaining a daily news website in addition to a magazine is very time consuming, but we are confident once the first issue of the magazine is released and the daily news website gain traction, we’ll be barraged by interested writers. We fully intend on paying people for their work as money is always an attractive prospect for starving writers.Of all our risks, the largest is that people won’t actually be willing to pay for content and ARPGamer won’t be sustainable for the long-haul. We’re hoping that you will help us prove overwise. We believe in ARPGs and the countless gaming studios developing titles for it as the genre continues to gain in popularity. We hope you value the people that make gaming so enjoyable, just like we hope you value those of us who want to keep you informed of industry news.One final risk is that too many ARPGs will be released at once and we'll get caught up playing them all. Let’s face it, a lot of good game titles are coming out soon and there are only so many hours in the day for us to choose between playing and writing. Okay, fine, if you insist, we’ll keep writing when we could be playing.",https://www.kickstarter.com/projects/1603039503/arpgamer-e-magazine?ref=discovery_category_newest,1603039503/arpgamer-e-magazine,"The time for the action RPG is on the rise as games like Torchlight, Diablo, and Path of Exile gain clout in the industry of gaming!

And if that's not enough for you, we've also got NeocoreGames who will be answering a number of questions about their upcoming ARPG title, The Incredible Adventures of Van Helsing.The ARPG market is booming thanks to popular game series like Diablo and Torchlight.

Back us, and we’ll be able to make something truly amazing for the genre as a whole and help drive up the success of other indie game studios.Because converting PDF to MOBI is so hard, we need the extra funding. Okay, it's not hard enough to warrant for the stretch goal. But it's beyond the scope of what we're offering presently and if people want it bad enough to reach this goal, we'll make it available to the public.It's one thing to offer a single digital download, but it's quite another to offer a subscription method of distribution. Keeping track of everything on top of ensuring folks can download the magazine easily and efficiently requires a fairly comprehensive system. It's one thing to allow for online payments and then track subscriptions on a spreadsheet and manually send an email link when a new issue becomes available, but we'd like the system to be a little more comprehensive and hands-free for everyone.And I imagine you would like to have everything work as smoothly as possible for your lifetime (hint hint) of subscriptions.Plus we'd like to spare no expense with subscription so if we reach the app stretch goal (or when we eventually develop the app on our own dime) we can buy something compatible.We'll make the first and subsequent issues even more of a bang with additional content that'll make your toes curl with glee. By hitting this stretch goal, we'll add even more content to the already-lengthy e-magazine and get closer to the 100-page mark for each issue rather than the 60 we're at presently. What does this mean for you? More ARPG goodness!We've already said as much that we plan on offering an app version of ARPGamer through which you can read daily news as well as download subscriptions of ARPGamer e-magazine. But saving up the funding needed to facilitate app development is rather hard in addition to the expenses we're already dealing with. By reaching this goal, we'll be able to offer the app sooner rather than later.The iOS version of ARPGamer's app is being offered separately from the Android version due simply to the fact developing for iOS is more expensive. We'll have to recruit the talents and resources of a programmer who has a license to develop for iOS which is a rather costly yearly fee. It feels backward to offer an EPUB version of the e-magazine first and an iOS app last, but this speaks after the versatility of the file extensions and the expense of supporting the operating system.The most simple and basic pledge will get you our undying gratitude for supporting this project.This pledge will net you a mentioning on our backer credits page as well as a digital download of the first magazine issue in your choice of EPUB, PDF, and MOBI formats.These are the same rewards as for the $2 pledge for those who weren't quick enough to snag the cheaper price.This is where things start to get good. You'll receive the following rewards:Double your pleasure with this reward:This reward is where we enter the yearly subscription rate. While the typical price for a year's subscription will be $10, it doesn't include the other perks listed below.Have a friend you think would love to receive our e-magazine? All pledges above $15 will receive an additional subscription to send to a friend.One of the rewards for this tier is only available for $20 pledges, namely picking an article topic in a future ARPGamer e-magazine issue. We'll contact you when we begin production of a future issue and you get to pick a topic (which we'll work with you to make suitable to a magazine).This is the point where we start including actual physical rewards as a thank you for your pledge. The laptop sticker is4.5"" x 2.7"" in size and will display our logo and tagline.Like the $20 reward tier, the $30 likewise has a reward only available for this pledge amount. We'll contact you (via email, so make sure you provide it in our post-Kickstarter survey) and ask for your opinion on a topic. We'll then include your opinion in a future first-year issue of ARPGamer e-magazine.If you're a poster person, then you'll want to make sure you get this. We'll unveil the official poster at a later point in the Kickstarter, but you'll get a signed physical copy of the illustration in addition to the other rewards listed.Want to wear your ARPGamer pride? Starting at $45, you can get a Mantle of ARPGamer T-shirt complete with logo and tagline.If you're a game developer and want to showcase your work, this is the only reward tier where you'll be able to purchase advertising space at a discounted rate and still reap the benefits of the previous tiers. Your full-page ad will also be displayed in four issues of the magazine.We want to recognize your significant donation to this project by giving you a limited edition print copy of the first issue. These copies will contain signatures from the staff of ARPGamer in addition to the previous tier rewards listed below.We're all about supporting the ARPGs we love, no matter who designs them. Since media tends to have an easier time of getting beta keys, we'll use that to your advantage and secure you beta keys for three upcoming ARPGs. Which games will depend highly on those available in the future.Ever wondered what you'd look like in full a dungeon crawler getup? For those individuals who pledge $250, one of our illustrators will create a fantasy illustration featuring you. This illustration will be included in a future issue of the magazine and provided to you as a digital image.The main appeal of this reward tier is that we'll write a short story based around a character of your choosing. Make up a character with all sorts of quirks and we'll put them in an ARPG-style story featured in a future issue. If you're lucky, the story may be popular enough that we'll continue it in subsequent issues!If you've got the money to pledge this much to our project, then you're well worth the effort we'll put into this reward. If you're developing an ARPG, we'll theme an entire future issue of our magazine around that game. We'll mention it in every article and every feature will be about the game.","Even once we’re funded, the main challenge we will be faced with is maintaining funding to keep this at a break-even cost. The daily news website is being funded on our own dime, which when coupled with a magazine with illustrators and contributors gets rather pricey. But we're doing this out of a love for the genre and gaming in general, which is why we've gone on for as long as we have without funding.We may not get the subscription numbers to maintain this magazine over the long-term. As with all things on ARPGamer, we're doing this because we love the genre, gaming, and writing. Without adequate subscription levels, the diversity of our content may faulter and the magazine could potentially just become an ARPG guide book. Which, as fun as that still sounds, we'd prefer to keep with our current diversity of content.Gamers may simply prefer the daily news website over the magazine. Simply put, it's cheaper and makes more sense to just visit our website to get your daily fix of ARPG news. To address this, we're trying to generate more unique and exclusive content to warrant the expenditure of a magazine. People obviously won't buy the magazine if it has no standalone value that the website doesn't already address. But we're pretty confident that the magazine will create value that complements the website without duplicating the same kind of content.One final risk is that too many ARPGs are set to be released in 2013 and we'll get caught up playing them all. Let’s face it, a lot of good game titles are coming out soon and there are only so many hours in the day for us to choose between playing and writing.Okay, fine, if you insist, we’ll keep writing when we could be playing."
https://www.kickstarter.com/projects/voiceofautism/the-voice-of-autism?ref=discovery_category_newest,voiceofautism/the-voice-of-autism,"As anyone who has non-verbal children on the spectrum will tell you, one of the hardest things in the world to do is to see the frustration on your child's face as they try to communicate with you. The fits can be down-right frightening because they are unable to request their basic needs. I have been personally witnessing this every day for the past few years, as I am the father of a non-verbal child. That's where my communication app suite will come into play.I'm not going to pretend communication apps don't exist. They most certainly do. They are, however, quite costly. Most of them run on the concept that insurance companies and school districts will pay for them for the students, but, the problem with that is, not everyone is lucky enough to be in those school districts or have insurance plans that will supply their kids with the software and hardware. Most of these applications cost hundreds once you actually unlock all the functionality.My goal is to change all that. There is absolutely no reason why these applications cost that much other than pure greed. Trying to get rich off other peoples misfortune. My goal is to put an app suite on the market for all major mobile platforms as low priced as possible, so that any family who needs it can afford it. No worrying about if their deductible has been hit yet. No worry about if the school can supply them with it. The primary code is already in place, the only problem is, I lack the extra funds to buy the test platforms in order to begin work on the user interface. That's what this kick-starter is for, to buy as many tablets of various resolutions and sizes as I can, so that I can get this application up and running and get the first beta out.The application itself is a digital replacement of the widely successful PEC program, that has been used for ASD children for quite awhile. The PEC program is a series of cards with pictures on them placed in a binder. When the person needs something, they take the card out, and they give it to their care giver/parent/teacher. We're removing the cards and instead using buttons on a tablet with the phrases handled by text to speech, and images you save to the device can be mapped to each of the buttons.If we hit our goal, I will begin ordering the test platforms. If we exceed the goal, then I will put that money towards any further development costs beyond that. The test platforms themselves will be tablets of varying sizes and resolutions, so that we can have non-verbal children attempt to use the application and verify the user interface will be workable for them. This isn't something that can be done using emulators like most developers would do, this has to be done on physical hardware platforms.https://www.facebook.com/The-Voice-of-Autism-1947572548869463/ is the Facebook page for the project.Please note: The video here is to prove the underlying code works. The user interface is on hold until test platforms are in hand so I can make sure a child with ASD will not have issues using it. The program can say any phrase you need it to, and you can use any image you place on your device. I personally advise taking pictures, so the user sees things they personally recognize.

My test user is my son, who is 5 years old and non-verbal ASD, so I will be able to test every single change with the expected user-base for this application on the same day the changes are made.

So why not have something that gives all the designers out there something to be proud of.We believe that dedication and hard work should be represented in the greatest of lights; yet there is just something about the current process that doesn't work for us; here at EnVisage we're dedicated to changing that persona.

The MAKERSTo our astonishment, each of the templates were accounted for within 1 week from the initial outreach and those were able to get in on the project began blowing up social media. With the hard part done webegan packaging the envelopes with the templates, business cards, company stickers and even T-Shirts to show our appreciation for each of the heart filledmakers out there. Shipping them out over the next several days it didn't take long for my IG account (@da.woodworking) began humming again with post after post from the makers and images of their packages (shown below)!To date 28 of the 50 makers have received their templates, T-shirts, Stickers and guidelines. Now the pressure is on to create a one of a kind piece.The END GOAL:Upon receiving the pieces piece back, we will be assembling the map back together; revealing a one of a kind piece to put on display.The bigger picture however isn't just about bringing the makers together, it's about bringingeveryone together. In an effort to show individuals that hard work, dedication and a little creativity will allow you to achieve anything I hope to display this piece at several locations around Pennsylvania, such as Colleges, Art Museums and Convention Centers.The PROGRESS:California:Kentucky:Washington:","Every project has a set of cross-roads and challenges we much overcome and this is no different. With the hope to display this piece in may locations over the course of a year one of the biggest challenges is designing and building a sturdy, but light-weight display case that will allow onlookers to admire the piece without damaging it in any sense. Yet, still allows us to move from one location to another with minimal effort. A secondary challenge will be obtaining the support from local schools and businesses to allow us to display this piece on their property for periods of time. We plan to over come this by networking through face to face meetings to explain the scope of the project and eliminate any concerns they may have on ""sponsoring"" this."

Jake grew up in Splendora, Texas and his fondest memories involve family gatherings—the kids running and playing in the bright sunshine, family members relaxing together and catching up, lots of cold drinks, and food. Oh … the food!	The centerpiece of every occasion in Jake’s family was the food. Preparations started days before the actual event—trips to the market to choose ingredients and pick up supplies and calls to family members to confirm who was bringing what “specialty” side dish.Amidst this whirlwind of activity, however, young Jake remained focused on what he knew to be the true highlight of the event—the grill. The night before every family gathering, after an early supper, Jake’s father’s attention would shift to focus on the main event—the meat. Once he got the smoker going, Jake’s dad and the other men in the family would settle in for a long night. Even as a young boy Jake knew that the time spent around the smoker was something special.At age 11, Jake’s dad invited him to come sit with them. Jake’s dad along with uncles, cousins, and family friends would share stories and experiences and tell jokes - lots of jokes. This went on all night as the entire process unfolded—coals were heated, then wood added. Next, they would play the meat and other items on the grill, and then add more wood, creating the perfect environment for the perfect smoke. Jake loved every step of this process and knew from the very start that being part of it was a privilege. 	No matter the occasion, just burgers and chicken on a Sunday night or a huge pork roast with all the fixins, the party always centered around a picnic table & that hot flame.The ChefTex Brand strives to create and maintain that Summer BBQ feeling all year round at each and every event in which we are involved. Corporate events, music festivals, graduation parties, weddings, and more … we consider it an honor to bring you delicious food along with the same sense of warmth, belonging, and happiness of Jake’s Texas summers.

We've made such a wave already, yet we've only scratched the surface of what we could do for this cause.Thank you for supporting us. :) <3www.groundherofilm.org"
https://www.kickstarter.com/projects/jasonmccoy/home-bound?ref=discovery_category_newest,jasonmccoy/home-bound,"Here is a very very early demo video of the game:Inspired from one of my favorite games and from the frustration of not being able to play it on my iPhone, I decided to do something about it.Home Bound is a fast paced real time strategic movement and pattern game.It will consist of over 100 unique levels where the player has to maneuver his/her character in and out of deadly explosions. Currently I have only implemented only 40 levels, but I am positive I will be able to come up with 60 more level ideas.These levels have been refined, played, and battle-tested over and over many times to give the perfect balance of difficulty.At this time there is only one main character tomaneuver, but with your help, I can help scale this game into something even better. Here is what I have so far:Main Character:Explosion image asset:Win and Lose screen:","This game is 90% finished, but every programmer knows that the last 10% of the work takes 90% of the time.I have everything finished basically, I just need your help to make the execution go flawless.Honestly, without your support, I can still manage to release this game.",https://www.kickstarter.com/projects/jasonmccoy/boom-bound?ref=discovery_category_newest,jasonmccoy/boom-bound,"Elevator Pitch/Objective: The goal of the game is to have the player maneuver his/her character in and out of deadly explosions and patrolling units to get to the beacon on the other side of the map as quickly as possible. Alive preferably.With 100 unique-levels, 8 unique themes, and 8 unique explosion animations, the game have been refined, played and battle-tested giving the perfect balance of difficulty and enjoyment.",Risks identified are the following below in which I have properly planned for:- Scope/Feature Creep- Being Overly Ambitious- Underestimating the Need & Value of Planning- Being a Perfectionist and Overplanning- Code mismanagement- Not seeking feedback- Researching Competition- Market/Audience Research- Sales Forecasting Analysis

We are also looking at ways to offer Continuing Education or College credits but this costs money. Right now we just have a few free courses, short tutorials and videos as well as 3 live webinars. We would like to add so much more but this takes time and money. Online education is a $280 billion dollar a year industry. I just need a small piece of that pie to make this project successful. We have already built a small following and have regular daily traffic. I just need money to hire people, build more content, and advertise.I have taken many on line courses over the years. I love online courses except for the fact that their are no live instructors on most of these platforms. My project which is already in the process of being built will offer both self paced fully web based on line courses as well as instructor led courses. The instructors will be qualified instructors with college degrees in their field, prior teaching experience and certifications such as MCP, MCSA, MCSE, CISSP, CCNA, CompTIA A+, N+, S+ CASP etc...I have experience working with a startup web based company. I worked for MyWebGrocer.com in it's infancy helping them to get the business off the ground. I was the original data center architect and I worked closely with the development team to build the data center the web site would run on.I have already built a good portion of the web site and taught a few courses. I am developing new courses as fast as I can but I need to hire some help. I have people who want to teach but I have to pay them to help build the courses and pay for my web site hosting.To see what we have so far please visit https://NetInstruct.com.","The challenge is putting together all of the courses and getting them published in a web format on line, getting instructors and materials together, and getting the live web courses on line. I am paying subscription fees to services to help get this going rather than building everything from scratch. This speeds up the process but adds to the cost. The money I am requesting will go toward paying the fees to get the products and services needed to get this off the ground. I also have to pay instructors and content providers for course materials unless I want to create it all by myself from scratch. So far I have covered many fees out of my own pocket and have already completed quite a bit. I just need to get the courses finished up and published on line, start offering classes and making money. I could probably make this fly even without the money, but additional funds will speed up the process and help me start making money faster.There is very little risk for those who donate because the site is already up. I am able to accept credit cards for payment, I have already paid for a subscription for the service that will provide the live classes. I have paid for the domain name for 2 years and web hosting for 1 year in advance. I am in the testing phase for the live on line courses. The first course has been scheduled and I have students eager to start. At a minimum I will be able to offer the classes to my contributors even if the site does not bring in another dime for the next year or two.I still need to work on the certificates and allowing people to log in, create a profile and share their accomplishments on LinkedIn or other social media. This is all part of the plan.",https://www.kickstarter.com/projects/netinstruct/help-netinstructcom-grow?ref=discovery_category_newest,netinstruct/help-netinstructcom-grow,"Last year we attempted a Kickstarter campaign that was not successful. Well guess what! We built our site anyway. We have our hosting and domain name registration paid up for the entire year so we are not going anywhere.

Facebook contacted me to ask if we are interested in being a featured up and coming small business. Other organizations have asked us about collaborating on some projects. As you can see below, we have a world wide following especially in the US, the UK, other parts of Europe and India.Below you can see the courses offered and how many visitors each page has received over the last month. We have also created an online newsletter called Netinstruct News the updates our subscribers to our progress, new course offerings and also offers tips and tricks and more educational content.Here you can see that over the last 6 months our traffic has grown. It has more than doubled. As we add new content and gain more attention from the cybersecurity community our traffic keeps growing.Below we can see that most of our traffic is new visitors which is expected at this time since we are a very new and growing organization, but we have retained many past visitors who keep coming back.To see what we have done so far please visit https://NetInstruct.com.","The challenge is putting together all of the courses and getting them published in a web format on line, getting instructors and materials together, and getting the live web courses on line.

When it came to music I felt that was my time to be selfish and create something that was solely for me.Having released albums every year since 2013, I have decided to end the story that those albums have been telling. I have created 2 trilogies and this album will be the final album to wrap up the third and final trilogy. With that said, i'd like to put forth my best effort into bringing this album to the world. I am unable to create physical copies of the projects due to how expensive it is. But with help, I am hoping to finally be able to bring a project to the table that is deserving to be the last step in what I feel has been an amazing journey. I want to thank everyone that has and will continue to support me in my craft.","There are many obstacles that I may run into while trying to complete this project. I've started writing and recording the demo versions of songs and have also began working on things such as mixing, mastering, and cover art.

I'm raising funds to be able to hire an artist to paint the cover art that I have envisioned as well I get physical CDs made so friends, fans, and family will have a tangible piece of history. So thank you to those that help in anyway possible. Whether thats backing, sharing, listening to previous album, etc. any and everything that you all do is greatly appreciated. Thank you.https://soundcloud.com/cameronlondon/mizell-single","A large majority of the risks and challenges associated with finishing the album are just lack of networking. I don't know any artists personally, that are capable of painting the cover art that I would like for the album. As far as the able it is predominantly finished. I am currently just seeking help with creating physical copies and artwork for it. However, there is no way that the album would not be released even if my desired artwork doesn't happen."

https://www.kickstarter.com/projects/beerdarts/pub-knights-beer-darts?ref=discovery_category_newest,beerdarts/pub-knights-beer-darts,"Hello KICKSTARTER members, Sorry no video yet, but it is my proud honor to appeal to you for your support for our original fun and challenging live action game. It's original, because there is nothing like it on the market. It's simple to play, but it has a lot of replayability. It will appeal to all dart players who like to enjoy the taste of beer while they throw some arrows and all beer drinkers who like to play a game of darts while they throw back some beers. This is the game where your cup is your scorecard and your ability forces your opponent/s to drink according to your talents. However, you don't need beer to play the game. This game was invented by a dart player with dart players in mind, however, the inventor does enjoy beer, so there you go. The game in itself is an excellent game to improve your talent as a dart player.We currently are in production of our first 550 games. We have a network of thousands of dart players across the country. We will be offering a unique packaging that will give flare to any shopper as our games will be shipped in packages that will be in the style and artwork of a small resealable cartoon keg.We also are in negotiations with many dart supplier/manufacturers and re-sellers to buy whole sale lots for resale. We have at least four local establishments ready to host pre-launch and grand launch Pub Knights Beer Darts tournaments to promote the game. We will film them live with a go pro camera, edit, and supply the You Tube commercials to my marketing and advertising campaign. I am planning an advertising campaign listing the game on soft tip and steel tip dart organization's web sites, plus hundreds of online social media outlets providing a link to my website to buy online. Other promotions include marketing the game at live tournament events where thousand of competitors meet.Naturally, a common path for a successful game is to be licensed by a game publisher to produce. Naturally, I am open to the possibilty.One of our stretch goals are to set up local, regional, national and international events including televised matches on cable TV, YouTube, and a network reality TV show. Facebook Live and other video media outlets. We plan on organizing these events on our 2nd web page, coming soon, www.pubknights.net.Another stretch goal is to launch our smart phone app which is currently in production and for our game to be licensed by dart machine manufacturers.Another stretch goal is the development of our expansion pack as each players will gain unique abilities and special opportunities with additional rules.One of the challenges we've overcome is the patent pending, trademark and copyright registrations.I expect to be able to deliver product in December of this year.Side one of our ""Crack On"" Guide Coaster allows players to follow the game with ease. It's also used as a cover for the dice cup. These are the original coaster designs. The ones included in the game are much cleaner looking and easier to the eye.Side 2 is an easy to follow chart for players to know how much beer to drink or add based on the rules.The custom dice allow for opportunities for the novice and advanced players to equally enjoy the game. It's optimal fun for a multiplayer game. After all, the more the merrier.I do want to stress that in our publication of our rules book and on our websites, we will strongly urge our players to drink responsibly and to not drink and drive and that if they play the game that they enlist the services of a taxi or designated driver. This game is for adults of a legal drinking age. We also stress that they play the game with good sportsmanship and courtesy to their opponents. This is not a toy and is not intended for the under age players. However, the game can be played without the use of alcohol.Thank you for reading The Story section of my project. We have much to do. We sincerely would appreciate your support in our efforts to making Pub Knights Beer Darts a household name.","Risks: As of any new game, it runs the risk of being knocked off. My game has been patent pended, My name is trademarked and the game rules are under copyright. It is unique. My lawyers are ready to file cease and desist orders to protect my investment. Another risk is for my health to decrease, however, it is highly unlikely. I take good care of myself.  I have experience in maintaining proper standards for product quality and shipping products nationally and internationally, so the risks of shipping errors are extremely minimal. Risks as a company failing due to lack of credit are minimal. Personally, my credit rate when last check was 880. I have back up capital to increase my investment in this company to allow for growth and have multiple opportunity for business loans for additional capital if needed. Another Risk is for a frivolous lawsuits for irresponsible drinking. Our rules, and websites will strongly encourage all players to drink responsibly, to never drink and drive. Also to get a designated driver or paid transportation and for minors under the age of the law to not drink alcohol. We have taken steps to use warning labels and rulebook for adults only. Also labeled, a choking hazard for children under three due to small enclosed pieces and a caution contains sharp objects.",https://www.kickstarter.com/projects/beerdarts/pub-knights-beer-darts-a-game-of-skill-and-swill?ref=discovery_category_newest,beerdarts/pub-knights-beer-darts-a-game-of-skill-and-swill,"Hello KICKSTARTER members, It is my proud honor to appeal to you for your support for our original fun and challenging live action drinking game.

The desire of this entrepreneur is to have all units home - made, so the manufacturers can make money, at home while being with their families. The result of that is that the product will be made here at home... not at some forced labor factory in another country.The need for funding stems from the desire to have an embroidered logo on each unit, and need to buy a machine to do that, $700 plus tax, and enough to buy some materials in bulk. If this campaign gets maxxed out, will buy the next step up in machine as well.

Due to to hardships and poverty following WWII and the Greek Civil War, my parents and their families immigrated to the United States in the late 1940's.They settled in Kansas City, Missouri area with its sizable population of Greek immigrants. Eventually, they opened Georgia's Greek Cuisine in the early 1980's, a wonderful restaurant known for its home style cooking and their wonderful hospitality.

Our initial focus is on the delicious and aromatic Olive Oil that is produced in this area. Many of the producers we are working with are small batch growers that are harvesting and pressing their precious oil by hand. They're estate grown and produced in limited batches, meaning that it's highly unlikely that people in the United States would ever have the opportunity to taste these delicious olive oils.I'm also looking for other organic products produced in the region, including honey, marmalade, sea salts, oregano, vinegar and grapeseed oil.Our plans are to import the products directly, where possible, to the United States from Greece. We want to provide the maximum profit for the growers by eliminating any costs and fees between us and them. We also are planning to utilize Blockchain technology to certify the authenticity and purity of the products.

Given the hardships faced by the people of Greece in recent years, we are trying to do our part to help these fine people profit from their hard work!We also intend to only import organic products produced using sustainable farming methods. Many of the growers are working to reclaim olive groves that have been allowed to go fallow over the years due to the economic crisis. For many of them, the focus is to use farming techniques of their ancestors to produce the highest quality products possible. Our mission is to bring these products to the kitchens and tables of our customers here in the United States and Canada.","As we launch this new venture, we have identified three challenges that we have endeavored to address:1.) Identifying reliable sources for products - Our business is an exercise in logistics. It takes a considerable amount of planning to ensure that we will offer our customers the finest products with a maximum amount of shelf life; olive oil has a shelf-life of approximately 2 years when stored properly. We intend to apply Lean inventory management techniques and data analysis algorithms to make sure that we have a constant flow of products from the growers. We also are engaging in a rigorous vetting process to identify growers with the highest standards and reliability for producing and delivering products.2.)

This traditional drink is made from purple carrots, bulgur (a type of wheat that is considered superfood), hot pepper, and salt. The mixture is then brewed in a non-alcoholic fermentation and bottled in a wine bottle.‘Şalgam’ juice is traditionally served ice cold The Benefits of ‘Şalgam’It’s believed that ‘şalgam’ juice has many health benefits. It’s rich in vitamins A,B and C. It has a lot of vitamin C. In fact, şalgam has more vitamin C when compared to orange juice. The even bigger winner found in şalgam is citrus substances, beta-carotene and phytochemicals. These come from the Purple carrots in the recipe.These powerful antioxidants aid the body in clearing lung and bronchus congestion and improving blood circulation. It is said to be good for the heart, circulation and vision. Turkish people drink ‘şalgam’ often as it’s believed to ease digestion, increase appetite and reducing swelling. The Spread of ‘Şalgam’ and our GoalOur goal is to bring the tangy healthy taste of şalgam to America where it is currently unavailable. It really does taste like nothing else you have tried (in an amazing way) Its salty, spicy and sweet all at the same time. We will use the funds from this kickstarter to produce a small batch of organic şalgam using only purified water, organic purple carrots, organic bulgar, salt, and organic red pepper. It will be vegan friendly and bottled in a high class 1 liter wine bottle.","The goal of this kickstarter is to gauge the possibility of şalgam in a limited US market. If the kickstarter meets its goal, there will be no risks associated with the backers receiving their product (based on the production math). If we are able to reach our goal, we will have the infrastructure and mechanisms funded to produce further batches and expand demand. The goal would be to sell our product in organic health food stores across the Northeast as well as through mail order.",https://www.kickstarter.com/projects/816552276/postcards-to-president-trump?ref=discovery_category_newest,816552276/postcards-to-president-trump,"President Donald Trump has been a public figure in the United States for over 40 years. During those 40 years, he has been involved in decisions, committed actions, and expressed opinions that have led the majority of US voters (according to the popular vote) to believe that he is either unfit for office or will run the presidency in a manner that is contrary to the interests of the average American.Traditionally, if an American Citizen writes the White house in a civilized manner with a concern, they will receive a personalized response from the Executive Branch. The Trump administration has continued this tradition (Here is a link on how to do it from the White House!) . Our proposal is an airing of grievances from the American people concerned about the person our president is. We will send 1 postcard to the Whitehouse for each individual who contributes to this kickstarter. Each postcard will have a photo from some point in Trump's history on the front. The back will have a concern from the American people on an issue that is related to the photo. Once a photo and issue has been used, it will not be used again. Below are 3 example postcards from this campaign.Since every single postcard will have a different image on the front and a unique question and concern on the back, after the completion of this project, we hope to build an anthology containing all the postcards from this project. The goal is to get enough backers that it will be a complete record of every issue the American people have with the current President as posed by an equal number of Americans.",A difficulty will be the amount of work required in the creation of enough valuable material to effectively produce an anthology at the end of this project. A further risk would be if the Trump administration chooses to start ignoring the postcards. (we feel it will take value away from the project if the individuals who contribute don't at least get the response they deserve from their government.)

Some of the tooling which are required are bushings for the lathe, 1/2"" keyless chuck with a MT#2 arbor, a dedicated pen blank drilling chuck, different sized brad point drill bits, upgraded chisels, additional display stands for craftshows and project hardware.The funds will also be used to purchase materials to create beautiful exotic woods and acrylics as well as POS hardware for craftshows to increase sales instead of only accepting cash.We are also creating a website to expand the sale of our pens and other products such as letter openers and keychains.We plan on launching our pens on instagram and creating a facebook page to share our creations in the coming months.",Our biggest changelle will be building a professional and trusthworthy website.

Second is to see if others share the same love for these rings as I do.I will be taking custom orders at craft fairs and am currently designing a website to sell my jewelry & pens. The rings will sell of an average price of $80 Canadian.The metal band is high grade stainless steel and is hypoallergenic, rust-resistant and very durable. Ring sizes are between size 5 and 12 and available in half sizes or full sizes. The wood is stabilized meaning resin is put into the wood making it extremely strong and durable without affecting the look of the wood.",The only risk I can think of this the length of time to get the tooling required and the amount of time to make a ring.

https://www.kickstarter.com/projects/owispyo/ocwalk?ref=discovery_category_newest,owispyo/ocwalk,"OCWALK will be a fully free online application that allows you to learn, practice Ocarina and discover new songs and music to learn. It will feature a project library, pre-filled with Ocarina pieces, four different practice modes and an additional ""Watch"" mode to preview the songs.You will be able to run OCWALK in any modern browser from your computer. Mobile and tablet support is planned, but not within the first release.(OCWALK discord server)When I first started to learn piano by myself, I stumbled upon application called Synthesia, which gamifies the learning and practice experience. It works by importing midi files and tracking which keys you press on your midi keyboard connected to the computer. This simple concept turned out to be so powerful and very easy to pick up for self-taught piano players, which made Synthesia very popular till the present time.Since I got my first Ocarina, I was always contemplating if there is a way to create Synthesia experience but for Ocarina. Of course, I cannot just connect my Ocarina to midi port, so eventually I came up with an idea of using microphone and pitch detection algorithms to read which note you are playing on the instrument. This is when the first proof-of-concept for OCWALK - sound spectrum was born.After the successful proof-of-concept, I came up with four practice modes that I can build on top of the sound spectrum. These four modes will be the core of what OCWALK does.This mode allows you to learn the music piece step by step at your own pace. Every time melody reaches the next note, OCWALK will pause until you play it on your Ocarina. If you make a mistake and play a different note, the song is not advanced, giving you time to correct the mistake.In this mode OCWALK will not pause on notes, and your goal will be to play the whole piece at a certain tempo. You can slow the song down to 20% of original speed, practice it, then gradually increase the speed until you are happy with the results at 100% tempo.This mode is all about accuracy: OCWALK will pause on any new note until you play it with a precise pitch for the full duration. I often find myself deviating from perfect pitches when I play Ocarina due to the natural curve that the instrument has. Learning to play precisely is a difficult but very rewarding process, and this mode is designed to help you out.This is the grand finale for your practice. OCWALK does not stop on notes, playback speed is locked at 100%. This is your time to perform the song all the way through without any pauses.In addition to four practice modes, this mode simply displays how the song is played. It is useful to preview the upcoming work, so it can help you to find the piece that is not overwhelming to learn at your current level.Ultimately, I want OCWALK to be a powerful tool for creating and sharing Ocarina music.I find it tedious to create Ocarina covers for the music that I love. Music sheets are often outside of ocarina ranges or use scales that are awkward to play on the instrument. Piano sheets contain chords and features that have to be converted into single notes for Ocarina. OCWALK will provide a toolset created specifically to address these issues.I would also love to see OCWALK being a place where you can share your music with friends and community. A global project library with many search options will let you easily discover Ocarina covers for the music you want to learn.Additionally, I want OCWALK to display music sheets during practice. It will allow you to print or export tabs and sheets and a mix of both for any song. It will record your practice so you can download and use the audio.There is also a potential to create courses within OCWALK. They will teach Ocarina basics, how to read music sheets, or even how to play by ear.At last, OCWALK is not strictly limited to Ocarina instruments. It can support any instrument that plays one note at a time and can be picked up by pitch detection. For example, you could totally record Kalimba sounds, create tabs and use OCWALK to practice Kalimba music in four already existing modes.I am Leo, I live in US, I am currently a Scala developer and I professionally create web applications. I learned to play piano and Ocarina, and since then music has become one of my biggest hobbies.During my time off I've been working on a few art-related projects. I've created app that pixelizes images using your palette of colors, app that produces scanimation grid and body from imported frames, and app that converts midi files into printable Ocarina tabs. I have participated in a couple of Ocarina collabs by David Erick Ramos, and it's been a blast!With the OCWALK project I hope to create a valuable tool for the Ocarina community. My goal is to make searching for new songs, practicing the instrument and creating Ocarina covers simple to everybody.Twitter: https://twitter.com/ocwalkprojectDiscord: https://discord.gg/FJ7r34WE-mail: ocwalk.project@gmail.comMusic from https://filmmusic.io - ""Midnight Tale"" by Kevin MacLeod (https://incompetech.com) - License: CC BY (https://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/)","There are a few challenges and risks for this project.One of the challenges is that I cannot develop OCWALK full-time, because I need to have a full-time job to sustain my life in US, which leads to a broad project timeline. I would be so happy to only work on OCWALK, but I don't think it's possible in my current position.It's very hard to come up with rewards list for a free application, so there is a risk coming from project rewards: if I get a ton of backers requesting songs for OCWALK, there might be a lack of time to complete all of the requests by the first release. If that happens, I will look to hire another person to help me out with the song requests.

Art pieces of similar type have been around for a long time, but only recently the term ""scanimation"" was introduced by an amazing artist, Rufus Butler Seder.Currently if you want to create a scanimation of your own, you would need to learn how the effect works (probably from some youtube tutorials), put all of your animation frames in some image editor, and spend quite a lot of time building the grid and figuring out how to mask the frames.You do get a template which you can reuse for other animations by just replacing the frames, but there is a big downside: you can't easily experiment.My goal for this project is to build a free online web app that lets anyone create scanimations in a few steps:The downloaded images can then be printed. The grid goes onto transparent paper, and the scanimation can be printed on your regular paper.In addition to the scanimation builder, the website will have a gallery of scanimations, that you can download and print.It will be a single page app, with the next design:It's always hard to come up with the rewards list for a free application, but I hope you will have a plenty of choice with the next options.Please, pay attention to $15 reward an above: they include the printed grid that follows the recommended settings in the app. It's quite valuable, because to print the grid you have to:Each person who backs up this project makes a huge difference. I thank you from the bottom of my heart. As a sign of appreciation, your name will be mentioned on a home page on the website.You will receive printed compilation of all of my past scanimations, both 2D and 3D. It will include 11 different scanimations, and the printed grid on transparent paper. You can reuse the grid for your own projects.Same as $15 - Scanimation pack, but every scanimation sheet is signed by me.Even though the creation of scanimation is so much easier with the app, you still need to create the underlying short animation. I will animate and create a scanimation for the topic of your choice. In addition, you will get the scanimation pack.Join the Scanimation community on Discord now! https://discord.gg/KzdzqzXYou can interact with the people that share your art hobby, find scanimation resources or discuss the scanimation app that I will be creating.Thanks to PokuriMio for helping out with the video!","I don't see any high risks with this project or rewards: this is a fairly straightforward app from the development perspective, and I will do international shipping of US letter size envelopes for pack rewards, which is quite reliable."

When it comes to funding our biggest challenge is being able to properly pay cast, crew and location based off of their rates. One thousand dollars is very low is these categories so we do wish to pass that greatly but we do understand and support the fact that much of us struggle with money.

Wish someone would get them for you while you are sitting in your pyjamas? How about a burger from the famous local nearby place?Or are you the kind of person who loves to help people out? Maybe get some groceries for them while you are buying yours at Tesco? Or get a burger for them while you eat yours?Introducing HosComm.A platform wherein students can request and complete services. Services? What kind of services, you may ask? Pretty much anything a lazy student can think of.So how does this work? Well its quite simple. The student goes on the platform (Website/App), log themselves in, request a service by clicking on a button which pops open a form and filling details selecting the category of the request while setting up a timer for the request.As simple as that.But then, who completes these services you may ask? Well students themselves. But not the ones who request them, of course.Suppose, a student goes out to Tesco or LIDL to purchase groceries and they might think, 'Hey, What if someone is in need of something from here? Let me go check on HosComm if anyone has requested any grocery or not.' and the student opens up the portal and gets a list of all the services requested by other students in this category. If any service seems viable, they may choose to complete the service by choosing it and exchanging contact details. The requester may throw in some extra amount as an incentive for the other students so they get to complete the service.As simple as that.HosComm just acts as a communication portal between those who need to request something and between those who feel like fulfilling them.Fundraising for this project is crucially important as I am just small web developer.","The biggest challenge that is going to come with this project will be attracting and maintaining a proper balance between both ends of the service. This is a class demand and supply model. The students who request service and the students who fulfil them should be balanced. Initially finding people who want to request services wont be that difficult but however finding people who want to fulfil them maybe harder to find.Another thing I will have to think of will be on expanding the service to other hostels across different countries. Initially I will be targeting hostels one by one and as we expand, some kind of an autonomous system would be put in place which allows the hostels to register themselves and manage as well.",https://www.kickstarter.com/projects/anulagarwal/cue-task-reminder-app?ref=discovery_category_newest,anulagarwal/cue-task-reminder-app,"Introducing Cue - a task reminder app designed to help you remember daily tasks and reminders easily and quickly!You can check out the application on Google Play Store (application still under development):https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=theswiftbaker.com.testnotesCue allows you to put any form of text reminder or task embedded in your wallpaper in the form of a post-it so that whenever you look at the home-screen or the lock-screen of your phone, you tend to look at the task to be reminded as well.

I intend to hire people from Fiverr as there are really good freelancer at Fiverr who do professional work for a decent price. As currently I am working on just 1 application, there exists no need to hire a full-time developer or application promoter!60% of the funds raised will be used to hire an app promoter and the rest 25% of the funds will be used to hire an app developer who will polish the app and make it even more smoother and implement ads and develop a paid version of the app with additional features (Ability to choose your own font and design, Time based reminder settings etc) which will be available to you upon pledging!Approximately 15% of the funds will be used to open a website for the application wherein all of you pledgers can stay updated about the progress of the application and see what I am planning to do in the future!Future Plans-As far as future plans for this app are concerned, there is a lot that needs to be done for this.

Humans have sought after their magical powers. Their poop holding the power of luck is typically the only bit of magic left for humans to find. Wenivere has been searching the earth for years to find the best specimens of magical delight to share with her fellow believers, bringing good fortune to all whom possess.Recently a couple of unicorns have taken up residence with Wenivere. They have graciously donated their poop, and agreed to help make wishes come true. In exchange, their story will remain in our hearts.The possible uses are endless. Garden decoration, desk decoration or to hold your papers to the fridge, to name a few. My favorite place is on my window sill, where the glitter and rainbows can catch the light.I am super excited to spread my families love of unicorns (not to leave out other fabulous beasts). I have done numerous prototypes to make sure I have it just right. I tried 3 different mediums before I finally settled one that was just right to share with the world. It was important that Wenivere's Unicorn Poop could be used outside and inside the home and office. Currently, we use a special polymer clay as a base to creating a magically durable product. The DIY kits utilize a nontoxic self hardening air dry clay.Our goals are simple: spread joy and luck through the mystical mediums of rainbow and glitter.Step One:Launch online with new improved packaging.Step Two:Work towards our goal of distributing at least 10,000 of Wenivere's Unicorn Poops to the world..How we plan to accomplish this:To Start, I have suppliers set up for all of our clay type needs. This will be our start, and the beginning, of something sparkly and beautiful.I have also found reliable sources for all of my paint and glitter needs.  Finally, hard work and dedication will be the most important ingredient. I know this sounds cheesy, but this is the truth. As with all things in life worth doing, there is hard work.Ultimately, I want the world to take a moment to smile and believe in something magical.","The biggest challenge we face is the amount of time it takes to fully cure the sealant used to make Wenivere's Unicorn Poop water resistant. This process takes 7 days, but lends to additional uses such as in the yard and garden. I have set up shelving to accommodate the cure time.

Hello my name is Wendy Wolff. I am the artist behind the hippo.I started Happy when I went back to college for developmental psychology. I was fortunate totake some really great art classes that pushed me to expand beyond the art Ihad been doing for fun. Even though Happy was not finished that year,I was already hooked on his smile. I want the ability to bring my love of art to start a studio and after school arts program in a small ND rural community. I will be bringing art to children's lives, but I need some help. If we all share a bit of Happy I am hoping that we can do great things for the kids in a community of 1500.Any pledges that are received will go to helping defray theclosing costs on the property I ultimately locate to. I know a thousand may notseem like much, but it would defray the inspection and appraisal fees. I would love to bring this unique program to other communities in the surrounding area someday. The more we raise the more children's lives we can fill with art. ","Will it take a ton of work for me to fulfill my commitments? It will absolutely take a lot of work and a lot of long days. I am committed to making this work, because if Happy Hippo can find a new home, so can  art. Currently, there is no such project in North Dakota. This is a challenge, that I hope to remedy.  I will use my education in developmental psychology to work with a diverse group of children. I will be working in a very small community, that tends to fall below the median household income for the state and country. The biggest obstacle would come from having to turn away children that were unable to afford the program, even with a sliding fee in place. I will be working with the community to ensure that this obstacle does not become a reality. I will write cards daily, and have timed my ability to meet the deadline on this reward. The painting itself presents a challenge. While all the hard work is done, oil paintings take a while to cure. They cannot be transported until this process is completed, which is why even though Happy is completed he is not just yet ready to leave the nest.Happy started the curing process a couple of months ago, so I am confident that he should be dry, but oil paint sometimes has its own ideas. I have fans that I can implement in the last month of cure time if needed. I also left a two month additional cushion in the cure time to prevent any disappointment that could come with a delay.I purchased a button and magnet pressing machine a couple of years ago that will make the buttons and magnets a snap. The cards are a bit more time consuming, but thanks to a very large donation of card stock to the cause, I have the materials, cutters and printer ready to go.My family is all in, and failure is not an option. I have my husband to help with shipping and assembly, which is awesome."

After the murder of one of the band members in the middle of the show, the remaining members and a group of teens are slaughtered in creative ways based of the names of the groups new album ""Strait from Hell."" Who is this killer, is it part of a satanic curse on the land? Is it a crazed devoted death metal fan who takes the lyrics literally? Is it a disgruntled ex member of the band? Only one way to find out and survive the night in HEAVY METAL MASSACRE! (meant for fans of 80's horror films such as Friday the 13th, A nightmare of Elm Street, Sleepaway Camp, Night of The Demons, Return of the Living dead, and for music lovers of 80's metal and Death Metal.)Looking to make a SALES TRAILER (5-7 minutes) for my script ""Heavy Metal Massacre"", while i have a sweet ass camera and set up already, what I need is practical effects. I want to create a film that could have been made in 1987, The greatest horror movies were made in that time because of real effects. Just look at the difference between John Carpenters ""The Thing"" and the 2011 quasi prequel/remake. The original is one of the greatest films ever made in sense of pure effects and directing. The remake lacked both and simply slapped together some CGI effects of some robots and thought it would have the same effect...it doesn't. For example, I have a scene where a teen is killed with a power washer up the sphincter and shoots out guts, and poo, and blood forward out of his collapsing body. I want to put all the effort forward that the legends of the 80's would of had to do. I want a fun and campy picture that is loaded with gore and with heavy metal fun. This would be a huge boon to all fans of horror and metal (who are usually one in the same). Please take your time to look through this and donate just a bit so I can get the effects. ( effects needed are lots and lots of blood, squib effects, guts, a fog machine, animatronic rats, a porta potty, power washer, blank ammo, collapsing body, some camera accessories, among many other things,)I also would like to hire a band to write a few original songs for this. The main band in the film called ""Hellbound"" have a new album out they are promoting and at their concert in which they are performing, a killer is murdering teens and the band itself in ways based off the names of the songs. For example, The first song is called ""Stabbed in the Spine"" resulting in a band member stage diving into the crowd only to land on an outstrected arm brandishing a huge hunting knife, the victim lands on his back and is pushed and pulled by the unaware crowd until the blood simply pours out of him onto the crowd. I would need a band to write 9 original songs all together, names are chosen but can write whatever they want the song to sound like, though I would like it to be somewhat 80's death metal style, in the vein of Death, or Morbid Angel, with a bit of Slayer.","There is a lot to do in this and could take a while, getting practical effects right is hard work and takes time and effort, also writing nine whole songs as well would take some time as well.",https://www.kickstarter.com/projects/1984145251/heavy-metal-massacre-aka-monster-ballad?ref=discovery_category_newest,1984145251/heavy-metal-massacre-aka-monster-ballad,"Heavy Metal Massacre is passion project I have been writing for the past few years and need to make a great sales trailer to try to sell it, I have sent the script to a few places and have gotten some feedback that if I have a sales trailer it could very well be picked up.

Straight From HellFor example, one of the songs is entitled ""Force Fed with Rodents"", this results in one of the teens being locked in a porta-potty with 100 rats dumped inside going up every orifice and biting him raw until a pool of blood gushes out the sides of the john. open his body being found, he spills out bloody and covered in deep bites, all while two rats fight over his severed penis (wang). Another is ""Public Exectuion"" The Killer breaks into where a group is hiding and grabs his victim, holding him for all to see by the hair. The Killer slits the neck of the teen all the way around and deep until his entire skull falls out of his skin and plops on the ground, then throwing the boy's face at the crowd which covers them in blood.The film will be intensely gory, The gore level in my view would be on par with Dead Alive or Evil Dead, or a Takashi Miike film, with very exaggerated blood spraying and over the top gore. I will need at least 20 gallons of blood for the trailer for what I have in mind (for reference, Dead Alive used 100 gallons of blood in 90 minutes and is the record, this will be 5 minutes long and use at least 20 gallons).I've tried this one time before on kickstarter and it failed miserably but this with the right market could be huge. please help me get this out there ! anything will help!",practical effects are expensive and sometime can only be done in one shot.

The Jedi Knight lands in the Lerpo system, a planet in the Outer Rim and home to a small band of Jedi in the regional Jedi Temple. Lerpo warns the other Jedi of the threat of invasion, while Darth Vader goes in pursuit of the Jedi with the 501st Legion of Troopers.Location was a big thing, we knew we had to show something new, something we haven't seen before. A Jedi Temple on the edge of a cliff with a large body of water next to a very dense forest. The Jedi Temple or Martello Tower, as it's known in real life, was shot in a small town called Rush in Dublin, Ireland.We all loved the idea of bringing a planet that we have already from the Star Wars films but have our own addition to it. These rock make a great backdrop for Wobani as mountains. These mountains were shot in a town called Skerries in Dublin, Ireland. These rocks, and many other similar pictures, will be rotoscoped into the background of all the shots on Wobani.This will be the background for the forest in the film. This was shot in Mirkwood in Sandwich, New Hampshire, America. We found that the Irish forests didn't give the same feel that this forest did. The actual seen will be filmed in The Phoenix Park, Dublin, Ireland.We wanted to have some mountainous background for Lerpo to have to behind the forest. We shot this in America and it will soon be rotoscoped in behind to give the illusion that 3 different locations are 1 in the film.Here we are 3D Printing the Jedi Interceptor that will appear in the film who is piloted by the main character. This will be shot in front of green screen and will be used for shot of the spaceship being stationary on the ground.

The main reason I am looking to invest in this now is that I will be entering the market at the best possible time for the industry. By starting with greens, I will have the opportunity to grow my plants indoors just when the weather starts to turn here in the northeast. The restaurants that I will be marketing to will be looking for fresh, local greens that I will be able to provide to them weekly during a time when fresh produce will not be available locally.

My project is called pr0m0_ki11. I have an undergraduate degree in Computer Science from University of Florida, and am currently about to sit for the board exam in Industrial and Systems Engineering in the state of Florida. I am also currently in the process of obtaining a Master of Engineering degree in Industrial and Systems Engineering. This project idea started during my undergraduate studies, when I was illegally surveilled for being an Engineer, and obtaining knowledge about the illegal and abusive tactics that influencers, promoters, technology conglomerates, and law enforcement personnel routinely use to violate the law with intent to deprive internet users of their civil rights for advertising revenue.The problem to be solved is that there is a need to block and stop unethical and illegal methods used to obtain advertising revenue on Instagram. The form is a mobile software application via the Android platform. The function is to provide an Android native mobile software application plug-in to remove and block unwanted Instagram influencers and promoters from user-profiles on a large-scale manner. The benefit is that our project identifies and blocks unwanted Instagram promoters, stops unethical advertising revenue tactics from being used, promotes user control by removing Instagram’s Moderation hub to give moderation control back to the user, and promotes safe internet habits on Instagram because it de-incentivizes users, promoters, influencers, data mining hubs, technology conglomerates, and law enforcement from breaking the law to illegally obtain user data for advertising revenue.The purpose of this project is to remove obnoxious and unwanted advertisers, promoters, and influencers from Instagram. As of 2017, Instagram’s advertising revenue is estimated at about 2.81 billion United States dollars. Since the dollar number is so high, there is huge incentive for unethical and illegal business practices; as well as public corruption with advertising dollars. I would like to get rid of it by crowdfunding for my project, pr0m0_ki11, which will serve as a native Android mobile software plugin to block unwanted advertisers, promotes, influencers, hashtags, handles, captions, and comments, from appearing in the user’s Instagram feed. By removing this on a large-scale in a quick easy steps, the user can regain control of their Instagram experience by de-incentivizing Instagram advertising revenue, cyberstalking by promoters and influencers, and remove unwanted and obnoxious content.As of 2017, Instagram was valued at 2.81 billion dollars per year worth of advertising. Due to the high value of this advertising, promoters, influencers, data mining hubs, and law enforcement was violating laws to obtain promoter content through illegal surveillance warrants, illegal wiretapping violations such as eavesdropping and interception of wires, interception of electronic communications, the stripping of encryption, etc; illegal surveillance of social networks and its users; and illegal human experimentation for data science purposes via biometrics theft, COINTELPRO, and watch-listing. This project serves to remove the advertising dollars by crawling through the Instagram platform, identifying users who abuse advertising services based on directional graphs and activity, and block and report those users so that their profiles are never to be seen again. By using this plug-in to remove the abusive users, we are able to remove the illegal interception of communications and remove the advertising dollars which are illegally obtained through abusive practices.This project has two revenue streams: 1) Crowdfunding and 2) Donations. The plug-in will not cost the user anything, as it will be available for free download to the Instagram platform. To crowdfund, I am looking to raise an initial amount of $20,000.00 USD to begin working on this project. Ideally, I would like to raise more than $130,000.00 USD of funding than the initial $20,000.00 USD to expand this project and continue with the research and development. For donations, I ideally hope that I exceed not only the $20,000.00 minimum initial amount for start-up capital; but that I also raise in-excess of $130,000.00 to continue working on this project due to its usefulness and benefit to humanity.The project stages include: 1) Research and Development, 2) Coding, Testing, and Debugging, and 3) Project Deployment. Software updates and maintenance will need to continuously happen to make sure the security and functionality is consistent. The required resources include: 1) Physical, 2) Human, 3) Intellectual, 4) Financial. For physical resources, this will include laptops, monitors, an internet connection, and test devices. For human, this will include the need for a development team. For intellectual, this will include software and algorithms, data science methodologies, and patenting. For financial, this will include accessibility to venture capital and crowdfunding. Our key-partnerships are ourselves, Z3r0-Industrial; an industrial and software consulting services firm. Staff include myself, as a Lead Software Engineer and I would like to bring-on three additional Software Engineers.Key activities include: A) Production, which includes mobile application software development of source-code, testing, and debugging; B) Research and Development, which includes algorithms and data structures, and data science methodologies; C) Project Deployment, which includes release of the final beta version. The cost structure of this project during the initial stages of development (MVP) is approximately $20,000.00 USD, which includes: 1) Engineering, which is approximately $15,000.00 USD to start the project; 2) Device Costs of approximately $4,000.00 for equipment; and 3) Miscellaneous Expenses of approximately $1,000.00 USD for miscellaneous expenses such as utilities and operating costs.In conclusion, we have solved the problem of not being able to identify abusive Instagram influencers, promoters, and advertisers on a large-scale, who use illegal and unethical tactics to obtain advertising revenue. We are able to make Instagram a safer, more friendlier environment, and de-incentivize promoters, influencers, advertisers, marketers, data mining services, technology conglomerates, and law enforcement personnel from breaking the law to illegal surveil and obtain user data through Instagram in such an unfashionable manner. Please assist me in my goal of securing $20,000.00 USD of initial capital funding to complete this project.","One risk and challenge includes the initial amount of funding. Initially I am asking for $20,000.00 USD of initial funding. Ideally, I will need more than this due to research and development costs, production costs, and long-term updating required. Therefore, I would like to start out with $20,000.00 USD as an initial goal, and reach in excess of $130,000.00 for the long-term project. I plan on budgeting wisely to keep production costs low using a six-sigma, AGILE, and WATERFALL software engineering methodologies approach. A second long-term challenge is the longevity of the project. Ideally, this will need extensive research and development; especially considering Instagram updates itself frequently as a platform. I would like to keep this project going long-term, which will require more access to capital in order to complete.",https://www.kickstarter.com/projects/pr0m0-ki11/the-z3r0-pc-zero-backdoors-zero-viruses-zero-headaches?ref=discovery_category_newest,pr0m0-ki11/the-z3r0-pc-zero-backdoors-zero-viruses-zero-headaches,"I am raising funds for a technology start-up which puts affordable computers into people's hands. I am attempting to prototype an affordable micro-PC, which needs to be built. The name of this PC is a ""z3r0"", which is named after the company ""z3r0-Technologies"". This PC offers zero back-doors to law enforcement (full disk encryption with no back-doors), is open-source peer reviewed, uses the Linux platform, and is very small and compact all for the fraction of the cost of an Apple or Windows device.What makes this device special is that it currently uses an open-source distribution of Linux as its operating system; the first of it's kind. This means zero back-doors, with full-disk encryption, and all for a very low cost. The maker of this PC noticed Apple computers are far overpriced for what they offer and have a major back-door that is exploited by law enforcement on a daily basis. Windows machines are outdated and can no longer compete with Apple. Apple computers already use UNIX operating system, a Linux-hybrid. Windows uses the Windows operating system, which comes with all sorts of headaches. Our ""z3r0"" uses the Linux operating system which is peer-reviewed open-source software, and has very few viruses and malware currently available. The ""z3r0"" is very simple and fun to use in comparison to its competitors.This means that all the money you spend on your Apple device for privacy, is not as private as you may think. Why not spend less for the same device, but with full privacy? That's why we are offering the ""z3r0""... zero back-doors, zero privacy issues, zero headaches, and all for the fraction of the cost.","Common risks and challenges include building the PC on-budget which includes selecting components which are under-budget. The components have been pre-selected to fit the project budget. Lastly, the final challenge is mass-production and scale-up costs in the future once the prototype is built."

There are a lot of campaigns to choose from so I am honored mine grabbed your attention.Artistically, I go by Nick Noir. I'm a serial artist (graphic designer, filmmaker, writer, painter) and horrorpreneur (see Nick Noir). I've written books (Halloween Horror Stories series) and produced films and an original series (see Vimeo). Time and again, I've come to Kickstarter to sell my t-shirts and even horror-themed playing cards 'Morbid Games.'I've been set back by failure as many times as I've been rewarded by success. I've never had success on Kickstarter but in that I feel blessed because it pushed me to do better, try harder and take no shit.I do plan on opening an online store in the near future but I'm in no hurry. As you may have guessed, it will be called Nick Noir. As I like to think of it, Nick Noir is a love of all things horror, gothic and bizarre.The pictures (below) on the left and right were my first time at Spooky Empire 2015 as a vendor. The middle picture was on set filming 'Interview with the Exorcist' that same year.I've watched Bob Ross for years and every single time I watch the man he amazes me. When you think he messes up, a few seconds later he masterfully turns the mundane into the beautiful with absolutely no effort. The trick to painting like Bob Ross is learning his technique. Once you've accomplished that you really can paint amazing things that make you feel good inside.Watching Bob Ross is as entertaining as it is educational. I never once thought about painting along with Bob until YEARS later. I was kidding at first but once I started buying his supplies and held them in my hands it was almost like he was offering me a challenge. How could I deny painting happy little trees or beating the devil out of my brush?This campaign was set up to sell my work inspired by Bob Ross. This is NOT commissioned work. This campaign is merely for you to select a seasonal oil painting for the coming holidays. You are not limited to one painting. Feel free to purchase multiple paintings.There are two options: a winterscape or any other. If you choose 'any other' you will get any season and any location (ocean, mountain, lake, river, etc.). If you choose 'winter' you will still get any location but it will be a snow-covered painting.The examples of my work look a bit weird because they were taken with my phone directly after finishing each painting while they hung in the easel. I cropped them the best I could to minimize distractions. And yes, that is a Bob Ross easel.Each painting will be on a 16x20 canvas. They are easier to ship than larger canvases and a perfect size for decoration. I am starting this campaign MONTHS in advance because it takes a considerable amount of time for oil paintings to dry - especially depending on how many layers of paint are on the canvas. Since it is Summer the warm weather will help the paintings dry so this is the best time to start this campaign.Speaking of each painting, I take my time. Bob flies (majestically) through his in under 30 minutes. I take about an hour to get the finer details right so what you get in return is a work of passion.I'm charging $150 per painting which I believe is more than fair. The extra $50 goes to proper packaging to ensure your painting arrives in one piece. I don't ship outside of the US at this time unfortunately but soon that will change!Depending on the success of this campaign I would love to take this to Spooky Empire 2018 this October and not only sell what paintings I've made but paint on the spot for a reasonable price. What you do with your wet painting at a horror convention is up to you XD",Each pledge is limited to keep from overloading.

I'm wanting to purchase a second license for Adobe Creative Suite for my daughter and upgrade the family computer, so I can teach her the art of laser engraving and design. She's 14, and this summer, she will launch her own Etsy shop, stocked with items she makes herself on our laser. ""Wood you be mine"" was a brilliant idea for a shop specializing in personalized wood items, but the name has been retired. So sad :(This kickstarter will fund the computer and the software, helping her secure a summer job working alongside me but toward her own goals and launching her venture into entrepreneurship. If we exceed our goal, we have another: I want a flatbed UV printer to do these types of ornaments, but in color. Oh yeah... I feel another kickstarter coming on in the next few months! ","Risks - I am working to purchase a second, more powerful laser at the moment, so if my one machine does go down before I've found a second, your ornament delivery could be delayed. Also, if this campaign significantly exceeds our goal, delivery may be delayed on some of the later orders due to the sheer impossibility of cranking production on a small machine (but the good news is you'll still get it in plenty of time for the holidays!)",https://www.kickstarter.com/projects/lazerworx/custom-laser-engraved-wine-stoppers-great-wedding?ref=discovery_category_newest,lazerworx/custom-laser-engraved-wine-stoppers-great-wedding,"Wine not take some time to celebrate life's special occasions?

https://www.kickstarter.com/projects/1983216247/universal-maths-buddy-umb?ref=discovery_category_newest,1983216247/universal-maths-buddy-umb,"Hi! My name is Rhys Kessey.I have been tutoring maths for a few years now. What I love about private tutoring is the feeling that I am really making a difference in someone's life. When a student looks at me and says ""I wish my teacher explained it like that"", I understand just how important my work is.I understand that school teachers have an enormous amount of responsibility and it is impossible to cater to every child individually when a class of 30 or more students is being run. I honestly believe my ventures are for the good of the students AND the teachers.This is where my Universal Maths Buddy (UMB) comes in.Kids are going to bring their mobile phone to school. Instead of trying to win an impossible fight, we can use the phone as a new path for self study!Designed for easy use from any device, UMBis a website containing a series of mathematics modules (aimed mostly at years 6 through 9) designed for home study and/or in class presentations. Need to brush up on some algebra? What about some practice on fractions and percentages? The perfect tool is now in your back pocket.To gain access to UMB you must purchase a key. You can bind this key to varying number of licenses.For example. a 5 License key might be 12341234. This can be used to access the UMB on up to 5 devices at any time.The pledges all offer an Early Access License. This will give the subscriber a key which can be used up until the official release date. After that, a regular key must be obtained.The final pledge also gives subscribers the chance to be listed as an initial supporter forever.The list of initial supporters will be seen in the background on the 'portal' module, which is viewed by everyone using the UMB.It's my way of saying ""Thank you for putting your faith in me!""","The completion of my UMB is something I am passionate about. The biggest challenge will be informing the world of it's arrival.If users share and spread the word, this should be a fairly simple task. I will be able to put my full efforts into updates and maintenance.Otherwise, I'll need to focus on some marketing and growth of the UMB will slow down.The actual content that goes into the UMB is a field that I have been comfortable with for a long time now. Even so, I have close contacts in a few schools and can easily get immediate feedback should there be any errors.",https://www.kickstarter.com/projects/1983216247/arcane-mathematics?ref=discovery_category_newest,1983216247/arcane-mathematics,"Click for Project VideoHey guys, my name is Rhys Kessey and I'm a superhero *cough* I mean I'm a maths tutorWell, I'm also working in electronics engineering, so I guess maths tutoring would be my part-time job.Over the years I've been developing a mathematics app to help my students with the tricky bits. If they hit a brick wall with a subject, I made a new module in the app for them and then they could work through it at their own pace.The core component is the 'portal' section where the app generates random questions in a selected subject for the user to attempt. The mad-minute mode is a competitive test of a student's knowledge of a subject while the marathon mode is an untimed, more relaxing way to practise for the mad minutes.Word spread about what I was making and fairly soon one of the local tutoring centres began to use my app in their standard lesson plan.They love using it in there, I've had video messages from the students telling me about all of the high scores they are setting, it's just fantastic to see the excitement stemming from something I made :)I watched one student sit down after his lesson and play through the easy addition questions for over 45 minutes because he wanted to set a score nobody would try to beat!I've hidden the names because I'm not a lawyer and don't know what I'm allowed to show on here.My dream is to be able to support this app as a full-time occupation and really give everything I've got into upgrading the learning environment for students all over the world.The app is operational and will always be free to use. You do not require an account to practise your maths, simply jump on the app and you're away.That said, I offer an upgraded experience for those who hold active accounts. Holding an active account is currently priced at 2 AUD/month.This upgraded experience includes:I believe (along with the teachers and students that currently use the app) that Arcane Maths will be a fantastic new addition to global education, so right now all I want is more exposure.Feel free to give it a go:http:/rkn.rknmaths.com/home","The biggest challenge is with marketing. The app is fantastic and those who use it absolutely love it, I just need find more people to show it to.I am working full-time while supporting this in my own time. Sometimes I am too tired after work and can go a few weeks without updating the app. That's something I'm aware of and working hard to avoid."
https://www.kickstarter.com/projects/2039061418/alien-asteroid-attack?ref=discovery_category_newest,2039061418/alien-asteroid-attack,"Fact:Since 2001, the Earth has experienced 26 atom bomb-sized explosions from asteroids. They were detected by a network designed to discover if countries are testing nuclear weapons. It turns out no one has tested an atom bomb in 13 years. Those explosions were from asteroids crashing into Earth.Fiction - Maybe: So, what if this is an actual attack on our solar system. That is the premise of this game - Playing the free version of ""Alien Asteroid Attack"" you are an Aliens gunner - attacking the solar system with asteroids. In the paid multiplayer mode of the game, you are defending the universe with missiles either from earth, other planets or from orbiting space platforms.In order to create once, and publish to many platforms including - IOS and Android - we will use Unity Pro which cancreate bigger, more complex and visually stunning games and 3D content without compromising on productivity.As the game starts you are inside an Alien Spaceship.You find yourself at an Interior AlienLaunch Interface. You can select an Asteroid. For the initial trajectory of theasteroid you can aim it using a targeting control. Further controls allow youto set the speed at which the asteroid will be traveling (this could also bedone by a finger gesture). When you swipe the launch button, you follow the asteroid,which is now on the center of your screen through the targeting tube, as ittravels outside the spaceship. The speed at which the asteroid travels isconstant.After the user’sasteroid passes Voyager, tactical information presents itself on the screen including:At this time theplanetary alignment will be set by the time at which the asteroid passesVoyager.Direction of theasteroid can be changed by a finger gesture. Pushing the asteroid in thedirection the user wishes to go. The amount of the directional change isdetermined by the finger gesture of the user. With every finger gesture thathas been applied to the asteroid, after it passes Voyager, the asteroid loses10% of its current mass. Also, with each finger gesture the planets lose 10%of its max value. After 10 finger swipes the asteroid is inert.If the asteroid crashesinto a planet, points are awarded. Points are determined by the size of theasteroid when it crashes and the planet it crashes into.In order to attack Earth and other planets closer to the sun, the asteroid will have to navigate its way through the Asteroid Belt. Striking another asteroid will end the session with negative points.If the Asteroid safely traverses the Asteroid Field and is in a direct trajectory for Earth, one or several missile launches from Earthwill occur on a direct collision course to the asteroid. The user must attempt to avoid the missile before the asteroid is destroyed. If the missile misses the players asteroid and it reaches the Asteroid Belt it will automatically self-destruct.Points are awarded to theuser for successfully crashing into a planet. These points are added onto thepoints from previous successful crashes.The missile will stayon the same trajectory from which it was launched so the user can have theopportunity to avoid it. In avoiding the asteroid the user would have to divertthe asteroid 2 times with at least 2 directionally different finger gesturesthus losing mass. Please note: The asteroid that wiped out thedinosaur was roughly 15 kilometers (9 miles) wide. We can use this measurementfor similar calculations.Points can be used forsingle attempts to activate with these additional features:The base game given awayfor free, monetization based on In-App Purchases.In-App Purchases allowusers to buy points in order to use additional features.These pointsare considered: 1) Type: ConsumableExample: Extraexperience pointsDescription: Youneed to purchase these items every time you want them, and you can't downloadthem again for free.2) Type:Multi-playerExample:Other users play defenderDescription:Other users can have stations on planets and or Space Platforms which fire rockets at asteroids.Various cut scenes help move the storyline.To support multiple platforms, we plan to release the product as a free download using Unity Pro technology. Given the limited funding we are asking for, you can of course easily surmise that we are using 100% of the after-tax funds for production and licensing costs. Any stretch goals received will go toward marketing and or production quality goals.Management would only be paid off of in-game sales and or ad revenue - not by venture capital funding.","We have successfully produced many projects, so that is not the challenge. The real challenge is market share…and that is also where we will need your support. We want you to be so proud of this project that you ""pick up the banner from the field of battle"" and will tell everyone one you know of this great game.",https://www.kickstarter.com/projects/2039061418/frosty-the-assassin?ref=discovery_category_newest,2039061418/frosty-the-assassin,"KickStarter Campaign ReasonIn this KickStarter campaign, I am looking to gather marketing funds for the video gameFrosty The Assassin. To get the product ready to launch, we are either personally coding or privately funding ourselves. This game will be presented as a free app with ads and in-game buys.100 percent of the KickStarter goal funds received will be used for online marketing services such as PRWEB, Facebook, GoogleAds, etc…Stretch goals will be used for game expansion.The video above quickly explains the game concepts.Frosty The Assassin Mobile Game Elevator PitchA pail from outside a jail has evil magical powers and it gives life to a snowman. Now a call goes out to all the mythical snow creatures to come and destroy him. The user takes on the fugitive role of ""Frosty The Assassin"" and tries to stay alive. 3 lives are given to the user and they can earn more in mini-games or in-app purchases.The user's game weapons include icicle swords, snowballs and of course the acid yellow snowballs. Weapons are gathered on each level at random points. Each game level indicates the number of snow monsters the user needs to defeat to clear that level. If the user is still alive after 5 levels, they will be presented with a mini-game. If they succeed at the mini-game, they can earn 1 additional life.Environment DemoBelow is a link to a concept test of the game environment (with a little character play). You cannotbeat, hurt or shoot the creatures…you can only avoid them. There are no weapons available, because this is an environmental test. The creatures chase you, and if they hit you 10 times - you die. The creature spawn another one (in an archway) every 20 seconds until you die. You can run away by using your arrow keys (or W,A,S,D) and you can spin the character directionally with your mouse. Enjoy the environment and the music! (Don't you wish you had a snowball!) I suggest using Firefox as you will be asked to load the ""Unity"" plugin. Although the game will be a mobile app, the development evironment is not, so play the demo below on a desktop.Mini-gamesEnvironmental MusicOne of ""the"" most important aspects of gameplay is environmental music. A lot of time has gone into the look, feel and playability of the game, but soundtracks take users ""there"", into this new eerie fantasy world. The holidays have such a plethora of music to choose from, it is fun to twist it to our character and the game. Listen to the track below and hear an example of the evil and minor tonality twist given to the holiday season…With thoughts of next steps, the layout of the game lends itself easily to a multi-player edition and tournament play.","I have successfully produced many projects, so that is not the challenge including: Quest For Stardom: BackStagehttp://goo.gl/WnC348BackStage Starring Carol Channinghttp://goo.gl/ERqRU8The real challenge is market share…and that is where I will need your support.

In Colorado, where I'm from, there's all kinds of different resources on how to get outside. The same resources aren't available down here.This is when I created The Hiking Initiative. Ultimately, it will be designed as a blog, but will provide an in depth look at the Texas State Parks, and Hiking with Dogs. This will be done by breaking down a look at the trail, pictures, and GoPro videos. Eventually, as we move to different states, I want the website to grow with us, and become a collection of hiking trails and tips to make hiking with dogs easier as well as more fun!I've never worked with web designs much, but know that part of the success, aside from content, is good visuals.This is why I'm here. Networking is a beautiful tool in 2016, and networking has allowed me to know a web designer who will help this website to its full potential. People will want to stay and read after the visuals are aesthetically appealing.Plus, part of the funds raised will go towards a good cause- The National Park Foundation. So not only are you helping create one of the next best outdoor websites, but you're also helping to keep our public lands in good shape!Thank you!","As with any project, there could be potential risks that inhibit the initial launch of a project. The biggest hurdle, will be the growth of the site. The web designer will design what exists now, but I will have to learn how to ensure the analytics will stay the same as content is added. Keeping up with coding will also pose a challenge, but a fun one that will lead to learning opportunities!",https://www.kickstarter.com/projects/1689360777/the-hiking-initiative-hits-the-road?ref=discovery_category_newest,1689360777/the-hiking-initiative-hits-the-road,"The Hiking Initiative began as idea while hiking Pedernales Falls State Park, which is located roughly 40 miles west of Austin. We had recently relocated from Denver to San Antonio due to a job opportunity. This was an incredible opportunity to branch out of our comfort zones and explore new land, and seek new trails. However, we felt as if something was missing. We spend all this time working, and don't have enough time to thoroughly enjoy the things we love. This is when the idea for the Hiking Initiative was created. The Hiking Initiative's Mission is to enable active stewardship of Public Lands by serving as a modern day guide for hikers of any skill set, while providing tips to enhance the hiking experience for both you and your hiking dog.We enjoy providing stories of the trail for both you and your dog, and want to be so much more than just a website. We would like to purchase a travel trailer, and downsize our life. One couple and three dogs, traveling the roads of America, while capturing stories of the trail and way of life for those who seek to preserve our natural resources. Along the way, we want to serve as campground hosts, work for state parks, and provide our own stewardship with non-profits that have a similar mission to us. We want to prove that life can be lived quite comfortably while living a minimalistic lifestyle, all while demonstrating sustainability, and empowering others to do the same. We seek your assistance in getting started. We don't ask for a handout, but simply an extra push. The hardest part in getting this idea to come to fruition is to purchase our travel trailer. Our goal is a simplistic 1,000. Please feel free to reach out with any questions or comments. Best wishes,BrittanyBrittany@thehikinginitiative.com","Our biggest challenge is going to pushing through and ensuring we can minimize our budget accurately. After leaving the mainstream life, we will be our own bosses, and will be forced to ensure we manage our time and set time aside to create valuable content. We want to get the word out of how we plan to help preserve public land, and make a difference. I want people to as passionate about it, as we are. Passion drives action, and action creates change. We want to prove to live life as minimalists, decrease our carbon foot print, and get people amped to get on the trails and help preserve the trails for generations to come."

I particularly enjoy creating art and working with tools. This project is a coalescence of both of those strongest passions. First, the abstract design is created. Then, the tools come in to manifest a finished piece that can be hung. It is my creative outlet. I believe creativeness is important to human health and evolution.My goal is to buy all the tools and equipment necessary to complete these pieces without depending on outside sources. I have the required skills to use all tools needed, I only need the tools themselves.I already have many designs created. These are the ones that backers can choose from!","Having created many of these already, I have overcome most obstacles that arose. I am already familiar with the use of all tools and computer software associated with production. Other obstacles include reserving art show and fair booths, and packaging for shipping. The internet is a goldmine of data for shows and their schedules. Packaging solutions will be provided by Victory Packaging as they offer a service to optimize a products package.",https://www.kickstarter.com/projects/1984579888/reclaimed-wood-iphone-docks?ref=discovery_category_newest,1984579888/reclaimed-wood-iphone-docks,"Every time you buy a piece of wood, it has to be replaced by cutting down more trees. We often overlook the importance of nature's benefits to us. These docks/trays are all made from woods that were headed to a landfill or burn pile. Every piece reused is a piece that doesn't have to be replaced by a living tree.It can be quite a challenge to locate wood in the right condition with the right thickness to create these. But it's well worth the effort. I enjoy the hunt just as much as the creation of the piece itself. Here's the breakdown:First, the hunt. I look everywhere. A lot of my reclaimed wood comes from demolition and ""free"" ads. Wood can be found anywhere. The right wood is a bit tougher to find.Next, all woods are cut to a manageable size and planed down to a smooth surface to remove as many imperfections as possible. I often wonder about the history of the imperfections. Maybe a child, 20 years ago, hits the table with a toy, leaving a dent that a planer now shaves away. I can leave imperfections behind if you like that sort of thing.Then, the tray and upright docking insert are milled by a CNC router. This is where it gets high tech.Finally, the tray is hand finished using a (secret) technique I accidentally discovered while experimenting with stains. It involves rubbing and spraying two different stains to achieve a nice finish on pine. Not an easy task!","The biggest challenge is finding the right wood. It has to be at least one inch thick without holes or cracks. It takes a lot of searching.

There are 4 modes of operation.•	DSP Filter mode -  You program the filters and use stand alone as a filter Block•	USB Data mode –  Stream the Raw data to the PC and display with the software, has a scope view And Frequency view ( Check DFT Box ). In this mode the gain is selected in the lefthand side as the hardware does not apply any gain in this mode and Also if DSP on checked, the PC will use the same filter types to do the filtering as the Filter Block.•	USB Raw to File -> data streamed to the PC and also save to a user file.•	Digital waveform generator -> Check the “Test wave on box” and the output will be a selected waveform Sine, Square, Triangle, Saw tooth , Custom loaded from a file.

Also you can adjust the amplitude 5V pk-pk , 2.5v , 1v , 100mv, 10mv.You can create a custom waveform with a .txt file each line has a number from -8191(-2.5V) to 8191(2.5V) So you have 1000 lines each with a number, each number is one sample point off the 1000 Total.

Garments that she would be proud to wear and hate the day she will grow out of, clothes are just there to be worn, not to be proud of. I have tried to find original Power Ranger clothing for her as well as other that she would adore to no avail.My wish is to make clothing that she (and other children like her) would be proud to wear and feel creative and imaginative and yet fun in.The clothing range is called Kidhood, however you can find it as our kidhood on facebook as well as instagram, the range will be inspired by the imagination of children and will be fun and vibrant and influenced by old videogames, movies, books, Japanese animation and being a child. The idea of creating a nostalgic feel for children in a new way is a new concept as well, and to let us remember the ‘good old days’ when we were young and reconnect. It’s to provide a genderless collection for children to dress how they like in whatever they like without judgement.Bringing back in a new way and style images from Captain Planet for world peace day, and in general reconnecting with ourselves.Within my research we have not had anything like this and nor is anyone looking through the eyes of a child to see what they would love to wear.When studying at the University of Sunderland I came up with this range and I wanted to further it along and see what would happen with this concept.I hope to have customers that have children with a point of view, children of celebrities that love to dress different and to inspire. I want to make the voice of children ring clear with their fashion,and enable them to live in the imaginative.My biggest influence is the love of my life, and she is a constant source of inspiration and how she dresses, as she doesn’t like girl attire and she has been raised in a genderless home, knows she can make her own mind of what she wants to wear, and she likes to adjust her clothing to be more play friendly. She is still growing and learning and how she sees herself in the world is what I care about and how she grows to be a young strong woman with a world vision of her own and she may even take over KidhooD one day.My target market will be parents. I aim to fill the gap in clothing that are gender coordinated, and make children wear, for children again, and with that utterly genderless.With influences from old films such as The Goonies, Studio Ghibli, The Addams Family, Little Rascals, and The Neverending Story.The clothing available to buy will be imaginative, and fun. With leggings that have details of colourful plasters on their knees, as well as ponte roma waistcoats with hoods, interchangeable coats, gloves and hats as well as purposely mismatch socks.I have found that we let our children look too grown up too soon, strip them of their identity of who they are and what they want to become. In a short, our vision of who we are, changes the way we see our children and lacks imagination.Currently we can find everything that has sequins on, and basic wear that has a single colour, a quote “sassy” or basic stripes yet no influences of fun. I feel like we need to let our children take the lead and be children again. And with that show us who they are with wearing these clothing and making a change in the world.The people who would buy my products are looking for a change, something fun, easy to wear, and creative without restricting in children’s play.They want to find outfits that look the same for siblings yet with a twist.Individuals, with children that are making a statement. Celebrities and people in high class positions. They want their children to have a voice and be who they are without looking like a child, but still a child, with a sense of class and sophistication as us adults want, but with the unique eye of an eccentric kid.Imagine young kids in France walking around in a ‘bite me’ teeshirt, hooded waistcoat and a beanie, wearing their favourite shoes that glow with every step, heading towards The Louvre.Or a small baby that has a baby grow that says, ‘my mommy is stronger than your dad’, on it.Even a spring advertisement, with all different race and colour wearing a print of Captain planet on their jackets, with the slogan above WWCPD (What would Captain Planet do?)?I feel we underestimate how much our choices are important but even more so how important it is for us to teach children what is right, and how to treat each other and the earth, and if fashion can help then so be it. Our children have a voice let’s, hear them use it.","KidhooD will start from home in a spare room and within a few years I expect it to grow into a bigger workspace in a new home with more space for the business and home life.In future, there is a possibility to have a separate office that has employees and technical sewing staff as well, where we can work on an international basis and send items to our stores worldwide. With this child range of clothing it is a very unique market and would be very successful with the right balance of things. The target customer is the ones seeking trendiness for their children but with ease to dress them in as well as still a child-like yet not naïve quality.First the products will be designed and will be made into samples to see if they meet all the requirements, then then produced a few sizes to send online, where customers can find it, and then they will be available to purchase. To start with networking online and making it a social media would be clever as its global and can spread the word over the seas. Finding the success in doing this, then the target would be to open a flagship store, where all purchases can be made as well as online. By 5 years I aim to have 3 stores and continuously growing.With opening a flagship store it is important to have the footfall of people and spreading the word and making networking happen. Bringing in new customers and new influences. Looking at the area there are no competitors and no one that would look into doing any business involved with children’s wear."

We would implement QR codes, utilizing window clings, at various downtown businesses. When the user scans the QR code using their cell phone they would be directed to a webpage specifically for that building. The webpage would house the history of the building like when it was built, who originally owned the building, a few of the past tenants, and who currently occupies the space. The information presented on that page may take the form of a video, or print. The user could then take a walking tour of our historic downtown while learning the history of those buildings and the downtown area. In addition to buildings having QR codes in the windows downtown several spots around Fountain Lake and Albert Lea Lake would also have QR codes taking them to a webpage for information on bike trails, canoe/kayak rental stations, or native plants and animals that inhibit the area or lake.To go along with the QR codes the group would also like to create ""selfie"" stations. These stations would be a great way to capture a moment at the Marion Ross Performing Arts Center, or as you take in a sunset walking along of the lakes.The money raised would be used for a web developer, advertising, a historian to go through and fact check the information that was given to us from the city of Albert Lea, and the creation of ""selfie"" stations. ","Some unique challenges we will face upon the completion of this project would be to update and refresh the information on those webpages. Another possible challenge will be to create awareness that the ""tour"" is there and ready to be used. Sustainability is a big question we get asked, this sounds like a one time ""tour"" once you've done it why do it again. By keeping up with the information on the webpages, making them possibly seasonal it could be an on-going tour.",https://www.kickstarter.com/projects/1833675755/cellfie-tours-albert-lea?ref=discovery_category_newest,1833675755/cellfie-tours-albert-lea,"We were recently granted a $10,000 grant from the Southern Minnesota Initiative Foundation to begin our project of connecting millennials to the rich history that surrounds them in downtown Albert Lea. By utilizing window clings, and QR codes we hope to educate the community on the history behind the buildings and lakes in our robust town of 18,000 people.We need to raise 25% of the $10,000 in order to release the grant money and get the project started. ",Some risks we may face would be making people aware the tour is there. We would also face the challenge of those individuals without smart phones who couldn't access the tour.

We have 16 top improv troupes from New York, New Jersey, Pennsylvania and Maryland coming to battle over a three day weekend for the chance to win bragging rights and a nice cash prize!This is where we need YOUR help! If you're interested in giving creativity the opportunity to shine, from dedicated actors and cast members from a four State region, you would be doing this festival a huge service by supporting it!Our goal is to raise $1,000.00 to be used as a cash prize for the winning improv troupe at the end of the festival. The last improv troupe standing will walk away with $1,000.00 in prize money to be used to further their show and the advancement of their art provided we reach our goal!In an effort to be responsible and realistic with our requested amount, we are only requesting the $1,000.00 prize money. Any funds donated above that will be used toward advertising and promoting expenses to promote this event. 100% of the backing funds will be used for this improv festival! Should the amount raised reach $15,000.00 a $5,000.00 donation will also be made to the charity of choice in the name of the winning improv troupe.We're asking you for YOUR help. We think it's only fair to tell you what we're doing from our side too! From our first show in the Harrisburg Comedy Zone in November 2009, the cast of DBtS has waived their $10 ticket price in exchange for a ""Pay what you think it's worth AFTER the show"" policy. Our focus is having a full happy audience regardless if they can afford it or not. We don't want our ticket price to be the reason people don't come to the show. We encourage people to come every week even if they can't pay at all because we believe everyone deserves to laugh! With the poor economy and people being out of work, we try to take them out of the real world for 90 minutes so they can leave with a smile quoting lines from the show!The cast professionally tapes each show and creates a web series on Funny or Die called Improv Comedy Funny or Die Web Series!

Not only to me and the bees, but to everybody!Bees are threatened daily by farmers growing solely by monoculture and using a lot of pesticides. It is up to us to take a stand and let us hear our voice. With the goal achieved, I plan on buying e nice lap of land so I can start a honey bee resort. I need the money for the land, to buy once flower seeds( and than I can harvest the seeds every year again). But also for good material to work on the land, to build nice bug resorts and butterfly homes. Also to buy long-lasting hives, for queens, for a little house to store my equipment.I know how to make compost because I do it at home aswel. I have read a lot of books how to keep bees and nourish them.I work daily in my garden but it is to small to have hives considering the dog, my neighbors and little children who come and visit us.I'm now looking to try and work as an volunteer in city gardens so I can get more experience and help with this.","There are just a few risk with this project and I've thought about them well.I know how to sow seeds or plant new plants. There will be enough flowers to keep the bees alive, and I can also feed the sugar water and so.I want to talk openly with my neighbors so they can embrace this project. I will always have an epic-pen with me, for if there will ever be someone who is allergic to bee stings.",https://www.kickstarter.com/projects/1905300019/step-1-start-micro-distilling-microbatches?ref=discovery_category_newest,1905300019/step-1-start-micro-distilling-microbatches,"Hello thereI come from Belgium, the land known for it's chocolate, waffels and beers. But did you know we have lots of different fruits here? For example, at Haspengouw you can find different delicious fruits. We have cherries, sour cherries, apples, pears, prunes, walnuts, red and white berries, strawberries. We even have kiwi-berries.That's the good news! The bad news that our farmers ""lost Russia""... We exported a lot of pears to that country but since a while Poetin doesn't like us anymore.. So we have to much, more than we can eat. We don't know what to do with all that fruit, so the government made a crazy decision..Because it costs more to harvest the fruit than let them hang they came up with the next idea:All the farmers that let there fruit hang on the trees...get money. This solutioncannot hold forever, that's why I know what to do! If Germany can do it, so can we! Let's make delicious alcohol from our fruit. I recently ended a course ""How to distill"" and know about the food regulations and the law in this country. Since we have some big players in this country who control the local market, I cannot live from this. And that's fine for me. I would like to deliver quality by working with the right and honest products. We also have wine farmers, you know? Wouldn't it be great of they could make their own brandy?Since this project is strictly regulated I have to take it step by step. That brings me to Step #1: Start a micro-distillery.

We are currently a web platform that grants community members the ability to request odd jobs from youth in their neighborhood.Started just 2 months ago by high schooljunior, Avante Price, ChoreBug has already gained massive traction throughout the Chicagoland area through the press, social media, and word of mouth. Avante has high ambitions and knows that ChoreBug is much more than just a nice way to make money in his area. He wants to further develop his already profitable model to a national app platform, somewhat similar to Uber's model. Avante envisions, and has already laid the groundwork for, an app which community members can request jobs with and local high schoolers can accept within minutes!Our GoalsThrough this Kickstarter Campaign, Avante wants to be able to fund 3 main goals for the near and distant future, respectively. Being a newborn startup, ChoreBug's current projects consist of:Obtaining Full Legal StatusBeing a fairly new type of model, the sharing economy has many laws which must be abided by.Lawyer and Accountant consulting fees can be outrageous. To be able to continue this operation and expand further, Avante needs to have everything in place so that he doesn’t run into any legal trouble along the way.Mobile App DevelopmentWith the fast-paced world of today, not everyone has time to type in a URL every time they need a task or odd job done. However, everyone can tap a few buttons on their phone! One of our main goals is to evolve our current online platform into a streamlined app that simplifies many of our current problems and “bugs” (no pun intended). With this app, we will be able to better match community members with youth and make the process easier than ever!Marketing & ExpansionYes, we know that marketing is a priority for every business, and especially startups. Our case, however, is a bit different. We want to know exactly what neighborhoods and cities want access to ChoreBug to prove for national viability. The only way to do this is to advertise to very specific demographics prior to even releasing our platform in a certain area. Marketing is the most cost-heavy business expense of them all and that’s why we don’t plan to just throw money at FaceBook ads and such, waiting for the customers to come. We want quality press and acknowledgment which is why even at our biggest level we want to maintain our community atmosphere.This is our only goal that you can actually help us achieve without even contributing a penny! If you just share this campaign, our Facebook or Instagram page, or even our website, you have helped us much more than you know! The value of something coming from someone who loves our company as much as we do is priceless!If you want to learn more about ChoreBug and follow our journey to Unicorn-status, go to www.chorebug.com and read our blog.

Ik heb dit idee bedacht omdat er nog steeds kinderen en pubers zijn die niet echt weten hoe ze hier mee om kunnen gaan. Elke aflevering heeft zijn eigen onderwerp en laat aan de hand ook zien wat je kan verwachten. In een van je moeilijkste levens fases. Maar we laten niet alleen maar dingen zien die mis gaan ook de leuke dingen zie je terug in de serie zoals je eerste vriendinnetje nieuwe vrienden maken en nog meer van deze leuke dingen komen allemaal terug in de serie. ","Risico's en uitdagingenRisico's. Ja die zijn er bij elk project wel of je nou een serie maakt of een nieuw bedrijf begint, ik kan u nu wel een mooi verhaal gaan vertellen dat er geen risico's zijn maar dan lieg ik tegen u. De risico's die er zijn, ja dat er te weinig geld binnen komt waardoor de serie niet gemaakt kan worden, mocht dicht gebeuren dan krijgt u als donateur uw bedrag weer terug. U zult dus nooit uw geld verliezen als de serie om welke reden dan ook niet tot stand kan komen.Andere manieren waarop u kunt helpenNatuurlijk begrijpen we dat u misschien geen financiële bijdragen kan leveren. Maar u kunt ons ook op anderen manieren helpen. Zo kunt u met uw bedrijf ook bijdragen door goederen beschikbaar te stellen. Denk hier bij aan kleding, eten en drinken of iets anders. Alle hulp is altijd welkom",https://www.kickstarter.com/projects/675621351/het-experiment-20-0?ref=discovery_category_newest,675621351/het-experiment-20-0,"Geachte Kickstarter, filmliefhebbers, familie, vrienden en mensen met geld,Ik heb uw hulp nodig om€ 1100 bij elkaar te halen voor mijn tv serie Het Experiment 2.0. Dit is mijn eerste Kickstarter project en ik hoop dat mijn serie met uw hulp te realiseren is.Hoe het begonIn mei van 2016 kreeg ik het idee om een programma te gaan maken die iets bijdraagt aan de samenleving. Een programma dat feiten duidelijk maakt en een duidelijk beeld geeft. Ik starten met het uit te werken van een tv format genaamd Het Experiment 2.0, de serie gaat verschillendeexperimenten tonen waarin kinderen betrokken zijn, het idee van het programma is dat verschillende kinderen een opdracht krijgen en deze gaan uitvoeren ze zullen niet vermoedende voorbijgangers van alles gaan vragen. waar is mijn moeder. Heeft u sigaretten voor mijn. En nog veel meer. Helaas heb ik niet de middelen om deze serie te maken. Dat brengt me teug bij mijn vraag. Wil jij dat de serie Het Experiment 2.0 daadwerkelijk wordt gemaakt en ben ook jij benieuwd wat mensen zullen doen. Dan vraag ik aan jouw om een kleine donatie over te maken. Je zult mijn enorm helpen deze serie werkelijkheid te laten worden. ",Er zijn geen risico's en uitdagingen die gepaard gaan met de serie Het Experiment 2.0 alles is al geregeld de cast en crew staan al. Helaas is er nog geen geld voor de apparatuur en de locatie waar we kunnen verblijven tijdens de opnames

Want to help an artist? This project may interest you.OverviewThe series appropriates pop culture, industrial, commercial, and natural imagery to create new narratives themed around technology, ethics, societal norms, and psychology using digital composites. I would really like to see one piece of the series finished before I have the operation—with the goal of selling the piece to cover medical expenses.Pop Art SeriesThe Dystopian Delights project is almost complete with the creation phase and is heading into the production phase. I have been able to produce a limited edition 16"" x 24"" paper giclée with funding by a handful of supporters, but am unable to produce the original large-format canvas gicléedue to expenses. Canvas giclées are masterpiece prints created using high-quality archival materials, including pigment-based, light-fast inks and archival fine art canvas.GoalI am seeking $600 dollars in donations to cover expenses, which include artwork production, reward production, and shipping costs. I need your assistance as I am nearing the completion of the project, but unfortunately do not have the funds available to produce the final artwork. This will be the first piece of the series produced as originally conceived, which is why I would like to see it before my operation.The large canvasgiclée will then be sold to cover my surgery, hospital stay, and medical expenses in September. I hope to be back producing art about 8 weeks after surgery.RewardI am offering campaign supporters a limited edition, signed and numbered, 5” x 7” fine art paper giclée of In Bloom, 2016—featuring Kurt Cobain; limited to 25 prints. The artwork is print ready and only needs to be uploaded to the vendor for proofing and production.The reward is available for donations of $25 and over—if the project does not reach the goal the pledges will be refunded. I plan to have the reward ship as soon as I can after my surgery—approximately November; possibly sooner.","The Dystopian Delights series is almost complete, with 36 total pieces currently created, but I am unable to fund the project further without assistance. I suffer from a variety of disabilities, one of which necessitates major surgery. If the procedure is successful, I will have limited mobility for 6–8 weeks, which may impact when reward items are shipped. My project does not require approval or premarket third-party review and the file is currently ready to send to the print vendor.",https://www.kickstarter.com/projects/nigelclouse/abstract-glitch-art-series-with-augmented-reality?ref=discovery_category_newest,nigelclouse/abstract-glitch-art-series-with-augmented-reality,"I have been working the last several months on a new contemporary art series—""Recompiled""—and I am ready to begin production of the pieces. This series examines contemporary abstract art by drawing upon the essence of the classical masters and filtering this information through the lens of a 21st century technocrat examining the glitch aesthetic.The series contains over 20 experimental pieces which incorporate augmented reality—an immersive digital experience viewers access through their smartphones. This exclusive limited edition print will be the first print of the series and will be limited to 15 signed and numbered copies.The creative phase of the project is complete, but I need to allocate funding for software licensing, hardware upgrades, and production costs. My goal is to release a new exclusive print each month to generate revenue to produce the final show.If this project is fully funded I plan to renew my pending yearly software licensing, which enables me to create art—my primary goal. I will require several hardware upgrades to take advantage of the updated software. I will also begin producing artwork, which involves many steps as I begin extracting my digital art into the physical world.My goal is to have the show fully funded and ready for exhibition in approximately 4 months. You can help me reach this goal and collect exclusive contemporary artwork at the same time. It is a win-win for everyone!!I am offering an exclusive limited edition signed and numbered print of the first piece in the series; photograph has been included above. These prints will never be produced again at this size and are highly collectible at such a low production count. The 8"" x 8"" prints will be produced on archival quality metallic photography paper and will arrive matted (12"" x 12"") and ready for framing. The artwork will take me approximately one month to produce and I expect to start shipping them the second week of December.The prints will also feature augmented reality, which will be accessible using the Artivive app designed for smartphones. Augmented reality uses technology to provide an immersive art experience for the viewer by unlocking a portal to a digitized alternate reality developed by the artist. Did I mention there is free shipping inside the United States?","The production of artwork comes with certain risks as it is inherently difficult to determine how many steps a digital piece may take to bring into the physical realm. Although this is an experimental series, I am using the knowledge and experience from my last solo and group shows to output the work. I am confident I can overcome any obstacles with over 30 years of experience creating art."

This will allow you to have something beautiful to look at while you play.A little about me: My name is Jason McCoy, I am an indie developer and this is my first game for iOS!I've been programming iOS Apps for 2-3 years and I have great experience with Cocos2D-X and in-depth knowledge regarding Objective-C, Cocoa, iPhone SDK, iOS 5/6/7/8.I am also familiar with open source tools like RestKit + SSToolkit and experience working with Facebook SDK, Google Analytics SDK, Flurry SDK, Crashlytics SDK, TestFlight, etc.With the money and time, I can confidently say that I can make the game confidently!I have so much planned for this game and I really need everyones help to make this dream a reality. Hopefully everyone will come to love this game as much as I do and will see the benefit of spending a little time out of life playing this game.Onwards to the Game Details!Story!:Here tells the story of a brave hero or heroine who has come to help rescue the beautiful damsel in distress as the evil villain placed her in a dire predicament!The objective of this game is for the hero to catch the falling Coins so that he/she is able to save up his coins in order to pay off the villain in return for her safety. In doing so, he must go through several grueling and humiliating trials just for the sake of her safe return. Throughout the entirety of the game, you must collect enough coins (or other falling objects corresponding to the level theme) to first unlock certain costumes in the shop and then keep playing the game collecting coins in order to unlock the levels. Finally, when all the levels have been completed, the final stage will be unlocked allowing you to finally save her/him (please don’t be another side-scrolling ending!). Although, you may also choose to pay real money in exchange for virtual coins in order to save her faster (but where’s the fun in that!?). Throughout the gameplay, the player has 3 lives (hearts) where the second heart can be unlocked via coins/bananas and the third heart must be unlocked via currency. If you miss the falling object 3 times, you will lose 1 heart, the game will end and the total amount of coins earned will be displayed. Randomly throughout the game, the player will encounter a wildcard falling item, a lottery ticket earning him/her 2 times points. When collected, every falling object must be collected without being missed or else the game ends and the 2x points collected will not count. The player may choose to intentionally not catch the wildcard lottery ticket. If the player does not choose to catch the wildcard lottery ticket, no point reduction or loss of lives will occur.Demo Menu Music for Catch Crisis:Demo In-Game Music for Catch Crisis:","Question 1: What are the risks and challenges that come with completing your project, and how are you qualified to overcome them?The top 5 risks and challenges that concern me right now in no particular order are:1.

In a twist of fate, they both decide to take a break from the liveliness and seek solace in the peacefulness of the nearby beach.As the waves gently lap at the shore, they bring with them an instant and inexplicable attraction between two beautiful strangers, led to one another by the moonlight and lingering lust. The connection is made at a time in both of their lives when they least expect it but have desperately longed for it.

For many years she has written web content, marketing material, performed editing/rewriting duties, autobiographies, novels, articles, scripts (various platforms), screenplays and media releases as a ghostwriter. As of 2017, she no longer writes for others unless her name is attached.Agata’s screenwriting passion ignited six years ago, when she experimented using her talent for writing, her studies in counselling and criminal psychology, her love for the ‘Hitchcock’ angle mixed with Stephen King’s unbelievable storytelling. That was it, she was hooked.Now, she writes screenplays and scripts. Her style has evolved, and finally has her ‘method’ under control, making it easier to focus on the finer details of the storytelling and character development, rather than the technical/formatting dos and don’ts. Agata currently has a 26 episode deal with a European streaming network and a crime short (25 minutes) being produced in 2018. She is honoured to collaborate with Shahmir Naqvi’s Red Dot Production team for her LGBT-themed, drama/romance short script. Agata is also in the process of being hired by an Australian media company to join their team of screenwriters for ongoing film projects.Although Agata works independently as a screenwriter, she is also represented by Satellite Agency Inc. Beverly Hills USA.Rebecca McGrave - Hair and MakeupAshley Taylor - Assistant DirectorShahmir Naqvi - DirectorShahmir from Red Dot Productions is an independent filmmaker with a passion and drive for creating unforgettable films.His infatuation for film sparked in 2014 when he decided to make the short film “Conrad”, a high-concept thriller/suspense that left its audience with goosebumps. Shahmir then moved on to do “ÏRMA”, a short film about the emotional turmoil experienced from the practice of arranged marriages; not just for the young female involved, but for all family members. In 2017, Shahmir released his first directorial debut feature film “Khalish” in the Urdu/Hindi language. It’s a love story based on a rare disease called Cotard Delusion, in which the affected person believes they are dead, deny self-existence and/or believe they will ‘live forever’. The private screening was well-received and is currently touring the international film festival circuit. Although Shahmir has vast experience in marketing and advertising, and works full time in the finance mortgage industry; his undying passion revolves around filmmaking. His main focus is to dramatically capture what makes us human and how we ‘deal’ with it, touching on the emotional, dark, psychological, less familiar, taboo and/or poignant facets of life. Shahmir is diligent to impart uplifting tones in all his work - past, present and future.Some Behind the Scenes from the promo","I am an active indie filmmaker with a boundless passion for making films.

This has been a big year for Group of Deviants. We held a remix contest for our single 'In the Groves' and received remixes from literally around the world and along with that came worldwide exposure of the band's catalog which resulted in requests to make the tracks from our latest single, 'When the Butterflies Have Flown' available for remixing. What band could ask for more than to have DJ's, EDM Artists and Remixers actually requesting our songs be made available for dance remixes? Us, that's who. We have gotten such an amazing and eclectic blend of remixes from the Ukraine, Canada, South Africa, NYC and L.A. and have the same team of remixers plus many others working on 'When the Butterflies Have Flown'. Digital and CD pressings will be dedicated to each song, however we thought the best thing to do with a vinyl pressing is to have a limited edition run of both songs remixed as a double 'A' sided 12"". One side being 'In the Groves: The Collective Mixes' and the other being 'When the Butterflies Have Flown: The Remix Album' assuring that all DJ have access to both sets of remixes and increasing the likelihood of both tracks getting club and airplay. But, we need your help to make that happen. We have just signed on to be managed by the long-time management team at Exit 39 Productions in NYC and working on a deal to merge our self-owned indie label, SINaMANIAC Music Releases with their in-house label and real video productions are to start shortly. They have also arranged for Urban Outfitters to carry our CD's and Vinyl pressings along with a tour of their chain of stores to do record signings. All we need to do is to get the CD's and Vinyl pressings created. The 'In the Groves (Exit 39 NYC Mix)' has already received radio airplay in Spain so we feel very self-assured that this will be a successful release and one of the hotter EDM tracks of the summer.Here is a link to the remix contest hosted on Soundcloud featuring the winning remixes slated to appear on the 'In the Groves: The Collective Mixes'.This is a link the 'When the Butterflies Have Flown' remix contest page which went live 4/24/2015. We already have two remixes and the song has gotten over 1160 plays in 3 days.Group of Deviants is heading into big things, why not be there at the start so you can say 'I helped that band launch their first album'. Any help is always appreciated. We are not a band of egos. We are very talented songwriters and musicians who have worked so hard for so long to entertain so many. We will always remember everyone who helped us along the way.","There are no risks or challenges. All of the tracks for 'In the Groves: The Collective Mixes' are completed and awaiting pressing and with 'When the Butterflies Have Flown' actually being made available for remixing by popular demand as well as having the same people who won the 'In the Groves' remix contest already on board, we have no fears of running short of tracks when the contest ends on June 17th.",https://www.kickstarter.com/projects/ajevans/gods-in-the-groves-the-collective-mixes-cd-pressin?ref=discovery_category_newest,ajevans/gods-in-the-groves-the-collective-mixes-cd-pressin,"""In the Groves"" was first released on AJ Evans' cult classic CD, ""I May be a Stoner (But, I Ain't Fucking Stupid!) [Maxi-Disc]"", in 2007 in a demo version titled ""In the Groves (The Naked Demo Recording)"". The song actually sold as many copies individually as the title track and was streamed over 7 times more than the title track.In 2013, Group of Deviants had gained in popularity and was becoming more well known globally. In April of 2013, as AJ was in the studio putting the final touches on ""Take Me as I Am"" to be released as birthday gift to the person the song was written for, he decided that ""In the Groves"", having had the success it enjoyed, should finally be completed and released. Despite being a rock act and having such well-loved rock songs like 'ahh', ' Heavy Hearted' and 'Running at Full Speed' and a few unfinished songs that were being hosted on their accounts to build their audience, 'In the Groves' quickly became many of their fans favorite track and was the most played track on any of G.o.D.'s music profiles on various sites.In February 2015, AJ announced a remix competition to give 'in the Groves' it's just due for being such a well loved and enduring piece of work. This CD contains the best from the contest as well as a rare writing session recording of the song from 2006 and features re-mixes from around the world giving Group of Deviants an ever expanding audience through the re-mix artists and their following.There are remixes from L.A., NYC, Philadelphia, Canada, South Africa & The Ukraine giving quite an eclectic blend of the song that make this CD unique and untiring to the listener.Group of Deviants and AJ Evans are now being managed by Peter Tanico/Exit 39 Productions who had submitted a remix to the contest and upon hearing G.o.D.'s body of work asked if he could take AJ and the G.o.D. project under his management team.Manger: Peter Tanico/Exit 39 ProductionsNYC 973.66​8.2068","The CD is ready to go. We have a management team, major clothing retailer has agreed to carry our releases and AJ is on the rise currently with a brand new hit single and video, so the demand is there."

My photos remain lonely and depressing.I've been given the opportunity to exhibit everything I've been working on, which is amazing. Of course, I've been working on everything with no end game, meaning I wasn't ever sure if anyone would ever see this exploration of alone as not always a bad thing. That's why I love the literal dictionary definition: ""unfrequented and remoe,"" not sad and lonely and loser-like. We're all lone sometimes, it doesn't make us sad, at least it shouldn't.So, that's what this show will explore. The photos show the darker side and the paintings show the bright.In the perfect setting of an autumnal October evening, I have the opportunity to unveil about 50 of my previously referred to ""depressing"" photographs and heretofore mentioned ""multi-hued"" paintings together under one roof of the Harborfields Public Library. Having not had a solo exhibition in a while, there's a lot of new work (some of it not yet produced) that all needs framing. So, while I am thrilled with the opportunity for my LONE: (of a place) unfrequented and remoteexhibit, the financial burden of putting it all together in a way that doesn't involve duct tape and twine for public exhibition is daunting.Well Jane, for starters, I need to get canvases, and several. Like yesterday. I have 6 more 4-foot paintings in the planning stages, so that's the next step. That, and paint. I am running low, so lots of acrylics, gel mediums, and the like. The brushes I have, don't worry about it.Next will come the frames. With about ten 24"" x 36"" photographs needing to be matted and framed, even with my 60% off + 30% off Michael's coupon, this is gonna be pricey. Yeah, so framing materials, too.","What are the biggest Risks & Challenges here?The biggest risk once this project is completed is ego, mainly thinking far too highly of myself for erecting such a fantastic display of art that came from my head. Other than that, I hate screwing in those little eye hooks to get the canvases ready for hanging, but don't worry, I'll do them slowly over time, not too many all in one day.",https://www.kickstarter.com/projects/362597482/art-exhibit-lone-of-a-place-unfrequented-and-remot?ref=discovery_category_newest,362597482/art-exhibit-lone-of-a-place-unfrequented-and-remot,"Well, that was the origin story of the Lone exhibit.Lone is explored not only as a feeling of self, but also as the consequence of urban renewal and unfulfilled dreams.I made my ""paranoia"" video in 2011 for a visual literacy class (unbelievable graphics for a student film, I know) and since then I've been obsessed with old houses, depressing landscapes and crazy-colored Dr. Seuss-inspired paintings. The house in the film was the first recycled paper house I made, which evolved into the miniature 2D paper houses I use in my paintings.

So now I have to pull this all together and get it ready by October 1. Of this year. Yep!So, that's pretty much what this show will explore. The photos show the darker side and the paintings show the  bright. And it's definitely happening so if I can somehow stay out of the poor house to bring it to fruition, it would be much appreciated.In the perfect setting of an autumnal October evening, I have the opportunity to unveil about 40 of my previously referred to ""depressing"" photographs and heretofore mentioned ""multi-hued"" paintings together under one roof of the Harborfields Public Library.

So, while I am thrilled with the opportunity for my LONE: (of a place) unfrequented and remote exhibit, the financial burden of putting it all together in a way that doesn't involve duct tape and twine for public exhibition is daunting.Well Jane,after one failed attempt at this, I reworked the numbers, cut out a few larger painting ideas, and just about cut my budget in half, taking on a bit more framing myself than I had originally planned (apologies to the professional framers out there, if I get extra funding, maybe I can write that back into my operational budget).Essentially I will have close to 40 photos to frame (ranging in size from 11x14 to 24x36) and about 10 paintings to hang. The photos are all done, so if this kickstarter doesn't work and I have to cut the budget again, you realize you're making me bust out the masking tape and thumbtacks here, Jane. Don't be like that.Originally I was going to send out some nice postcards as well, but on this new austerity budget I will probably be printing those myself, too and skip the mailing altogether. Unless....Please fund this. Fund it like you mean it. Fund it like you've never funded anything else before in your life! It'll be fun!Thank you in advance :)ps...yes, I have done stuff like this before, in case you were worried or something. I can absolutely pull this off, with your monetary help. Check out my CV on my website www.pixelstickphoto.com.I need to update the site, so since it is a bit out of date, just picture everything that's on there plus maybe 5 more shows.Don't worry, I got this.","What are the biggest Risks & Challenges here?The biggest risk once this project is completed is ego, mainly thinking far too highly of myself for erecting such a fantastic display of art that came from my head. Other than that, I hate screwing in those little eye hooks to get the canvases ready for hanging, but don't worry, I'll do them slowly over time, not too many all in one day."

It will also include information about other aspects of my ongoingresearch into memory of the Korean War, such as film and television portrayalsor the largely forgotten Korean anti-war movement, as well as posts about theteam behind the tour including Casper and Candy, ‘The Korean War Memory Cats.’But I’m getting ahead of myself…my name isLevi Fox and I’ll be your ‘Korean War Memory Tour Guide.’ Some of you may know me from mymonthly blog on ‘Mid-Atlantic Monuments, Memorials, and Museums’ (http://march.rutgers.edu/author/lfox)which I write for the Mid-Atlantic Regional Center for the Humanities.Others of you may know me as an instructor asan adjunct professor of writing at Stockton University, political science at Rutgers-Camden,or Mosaic courses at Temple University. I’m currently a PhD candidate in PublicHistory at Temple and I’m hoping to use what I learn on the memory tour for achapter in my dissertation, which is tentatively entitled ‘Not Forgotten: The KoreanWar in American Public History and Memory.’I’ll also be creating a log book, editing a behind-the-scenes DVD, and assemblinga photo album all of which are available as rewards for major supporters of theproject.So I hope that this MemorialDay week you will choose to kickstart collective memory of the Korean War inAmerica by supporting me and my ‘Korean War Memory Car,’ a 1995 Chrysler LeBaron Convertible. I’m asking for support because myinitial budget of $500 seems likely to fall far short of what is needed, whichcalculations using IRS mileage reimbursements along with tolls and miscellaneouscosts (such as entry fees at the presidential libraries) place at more than $2,000.Moreover, while I’ve already secured placesto stay for the majority of the trip I still anticipate needing to rent rooms(or camp if the weather is nice) in eastern Indiana, central Illinois, northernMissouri, and western Wisconsin. Finally, in addition to fueling the Korean WarMemory Car, please don’t forget about feeding the Tour Guide (who is happy to eatbagels for brunch and sandwiches for dinner).Room and board should not exceed $500. I’m asking for the final $500 tocover crowdsourcing fees and costs associated with sending out rewards. As away of further explaining my budget, as well as what I hope to accomplish, letme tell you a little bit about my tour route as well as some of the sites I’llbe visiting which include state and local monuments, memorial infrastructuresuch as highways and bridges, military museums, and two presidential libraries.The first segment of the road tripbegins at the Delaware Memorial Bridge, traveling westward on the second spanwhich was dedicated to Korean War Veterans in 1968 by Hubert Humphrey, who added Vietnam Vets to the dedication despiteno prior plan to do so.This opening offersa chance to explore the idea of memorial infrastructure and compare this siteof memory to other similar bridges in Vermont, Massachusetts, andTennessee.I will next head downDelaware Route 1, the Korean War Veterans Memorial Highway (the first of threesimilarly named highways I’ll be driving along on my route), to the AirMobility Command Museum in Dover. After an in depth examination of the MarylandState Korean War Veterans Memorial in Baltimore, which reflects an unfinishedquality similar to the New York State Memorial found in Battery Park, the firstsegment of the road trip concludes with a drive down another Korean War MemorialHighway in Frederick County. Subsequent segments look similar.Day Twoof the tour goes through central and southwestern Ohio stopping in Dayton atthe National Air Force Museum followed by a short trip to the official OhioState Korean War Veterans Memorial before heading to nearby Reading to visit alocal monument.Day Three of the tourtravels through central Indiana, stopping in Indianapolis at the official stateKorean War Memorial as well as the nearby state military museum and in TerreHaute at a local monument.Day Four ofthe tour will head through central Illinois, stopping in Springfield (home ofthe National Korean War Museum and the state memorial before) heading west tothe small town of Quincy on the Mississippi.Day Five of the tour will head through northern Missouri stopping off atthe local Moberly Korean War Memorial, at the Truman Library and Museum inIndependence, and at the Missouri State Korean War Memorial in Kansas City. Day Six of the tour will head through easternKansas stopping at the state memorial in Overland Park, at the University ofKansas Memorial in Lawrence, and at the Eisenhower Library and Museum inAbilene. Followinga short hiatus (which will hopefully afford me some research time at the Centerfor the Study of the Korean War) the tour will resume on Tuesday June 9th, withDay Seven of the tour consisting of visits to the Iowa State Korean War VeteransMemorial in Des Moines and the official Minnesota state memorial in St.Paul.Day Eight of the tour will go through Wisconsinstopping at the state memorial in Plover before heading down another Korean WarVeterans Memorial Highway to Madison to see the Wisconsin Veterans Museum.After staying over in Chicago with my BFF Dan(and rising early to visit a local city memorial), Day Nine of the tour willconsist of a trip through southern Michigan between two Great Lakes from St.Joseph (home of the Berrien County Korean War Memorial) to Monroe, home ofanother monument, as well as potential stops in northern Ohio.After staying over in Pittsburg with family(my aunt, uncle, and Grandma live locally) the final segment of the trip throughPennsylvania consists of stops at a memorial in Pittsburg, at the Army War CollegeMuseum in Carlisle, at a local monument in Lebanon, and at the Philadelphia KoreanWar Memorial at Penn’s Landing.After allthat I’ll surely be eager to get home! And shortly thereafter, I’ll startworking on sending out rewards.Lastly,I should mention my methodology and how I came to decide upon these locationsas tour stops. At each site I will be asking the same set of questions concerningthe representation of the Korean War: 1) Where is the site situated, what doesit look like, when was it built, who built it, and why was it built, 2) Who arethe intended audiences for the site and are these the same groups who actuallyvisit the site, 3) How does this site commemorate US soldiers, oppositionforces, and those missing or killed in-action, 4) How does this site describethe course of the war using narratives, images, maps, or other elements, 5) Howdoes this site use architectural or other elements to reflect particular aspectsof the Korean War, 6) How does this site seem to relate structurally to other‘sites of memory’ focused on the Korean War, 7) How does this site promotelocal heritage tourism or otherwise encourage economic redevelopment, and 8)How does this site reflect particular local or regional forms of public memoryof the Korean War.Though not all questionswill be relevant at all the sites they should provide a solid basis forcomparison. I choose these sites because National Archives records show that Mid-Atlanticand Mid-Western states suffered considerable casualties with Pennsylvania,Ohio, Michigan, and Illinois each with over 1400 KIA. ","The biggest challenge is funding itself, though this also provides an opportunity.  For example, if the project goes unfunded I still plan to carry it out using student loan money, but I would have to cut at least two days from my tour route and leave out states such as Kansas, Minnesota, and Wisconsin. On the other hand, if we are lucky enough to receive more pledges than are necessary to conduct the tour as planned it may actually be possible to add additional days to the itinerary and to include states such as West Virginia and Nebraska.  Yet even with full funding, there are a few other challenges to consider.	I have little doubt I’m capable of carrying out the project given my long term focus on the study of monuments, memorials, and museums as well as my experience with web design and video editing in college and graduate school.  Moreover, after returning from the tour I have the rest of the summer to devote to completing the project and sending out rewards, though I hope to have everything done by the Fourth of July.  For example, I can foresee image and video issues potentially causing delays with the issuing of rewards.  However, with a strong project team supporting me (not even including the kitties) and my ability to draw on the resources of multiple universities I should be able to fix most technological issues and call on additional aid in assembling photo albums, editing the DVD, and sending out rewards.  There are also some potential issues that might impact my ability complete the tour itself as scheduled. 	There are a few relatively minor issues that might impact my ability to put up posts on a daily basis and to visit all the sites I hope to, including the need to drive late to make up for lost time due to traffic, the inability to recharge my laptop as a result of the choice to save money by camping, or being prevented from visiting certain sites such as museums on military bases because of a heightened threat alert.  However, the single biggest challenge that I may face would be a major breakdown of the Korean War Memory Car that would result in me being temporarily stranded in a location far from home.  This is especially a risk given that I will be driving a twenty-year old Chrysler Le Baron convertible, which I’m able to do because the car currently has less than 80,000 miles on it and the trip itself is less than 5,000 miles.  In order to moderate this risk I’m investing significantly in repairs and preventative maintenance before the trip as well as assembling a repair kit, which along with AAA should take care of minor issues. I also want to stress that I HAVE NOT built the costs of these repairs into the budget that I’m requesting.",https://www.kickstarter.com/projects/foxylevi/the-traveling-atlantic-city-trump-museum?ref=discovery_category_newest,foxylevi/the-traveling-atlantic-city-trump-museum,"The Atlantic City Trump Museum Project was launched in the fall of 2016 following the closing of the Taj Mahal in October and subsequent election of Donald Trump in November. This larger effort, launched as a collaboration amongst several Stockton University faculty “To Help Share The History Of Atlantic City In The Age Of Trump,” and it seeks to provide “A Bi-Partisan Look At The Legacy Of The Trump Plaza, Trump Taj Mahal, Trump Castle, Trump Marina, and Trump World's Fair,” as stated on the ‘About’ page of the project website, www.TrumpMuseum.org. While there was initially considerable media interest in the project, including an article by the Associated Press and multiple local TV news segments that are noted on the ‘Media’ page of the website, momentum waned from the summer of 2017 to the spring of 2018, in part due to other responsibilities on the parts of those involved (in my case the need to complete my dissertation at Temple University, which I successfully defend in April 2018). After fully taking over the management of the project, in August 2018 I launched a series of ‘Pop-Up’ displays that I staged on Sunday afternoons.For two hours every Sunday afternoon in August, after a one-week trial in July, I staged “The (Pop-Up) Atlantic City Trump Museum” exhibit, as I termed it, on the Boardwalk on front of the former site of the Trump Plaza, which closed in 2014. This version of the project, as stated on the ‘(Pop-Up)’ page of the website, “engages public perceptions of the term museum, as well as exploring relationships between local history and national politics by highlighting countries of origin of Trump-branded casino products from the 1980s through the 2000s within the context of the recent history of immigration into Atlantic City.” The Pop-Up immediately garnered media attention from websites and newspapers including Phillymag.com, the Palm Beach Daily News, and even Artnet News, while the exhibit attracted dozens of visitors each week, many that had read about it in advance. While this set up involved a table, bags full of artifacts, and a two-sided sign that “focused on the meaning of the term museum in this context” by “experimental framing of this exhibition as ‘Anti-Trump’ to gauge public response,” I learned the most effective manner in which I was able to convey information involved me giving presentations to groups of visitors.My Pop-Up month has convinced me that, rather than immediately moving on to pursue a temporary exhibit in one fixed location, the best next-step for the project would be to reformulate it as a ‘Suitcase-style’ display that can travel to different locations, which will enable me to make public presentations on the topic, both raising awareness and offering a source of future funding for a temporary exhibition in 2019 and, hopefully, a Boardwalk storefront by the 2020 election. Funding will allow me convert the existing (Pop-Up) into a Suitcase-Style display, to acquire additional artifacts--such as rolling luggage branded with the name of a Trump casino--that will facilitate the creation of the traveling museum, and to create informative signs relating to the history of immigration into Atlantic City in the 1990s. ","The main challenge I have encountered is that many people seem to perceive that my endeavor is political, based on the name, rather than historical. This has led to me to experiment with different approaches to properly framing my exhibition, which I now see as a public humanities project that is as much performance art as museum display and can benefit from support by various artistic communities."

https://www.kickstarter.com/projects/215756405/low-cost-open-source-lidar-for-robotic-systems?ref=discovery_category_newest,215756405/low-cost-open-source-lidar-for-robotic-systems,"Starting in 2009, I noticed the need for LiDAR. Ground and aerial bots need good data from their physical surroundings to ""prime the pump"" of navigation methodologies like SLAM. Seeing others and myself having to cope with this ""sensory-bottle-neck"" was frustrating. We'd have this great microprocessor system, advanced program code, and really capable bot, but without LiDAR and SLAM, we couldn't trust the machine to fly around autonomously.So, wanting to participate in the 2011 International Aerial Robotics Competition (IARC), I started looking at sensory solutions. Some of the teams could afford the Hokuyo LiDARs. These were 1200 to 6500 US$, and the modern ones are USB only. Other teams used home made solutions like scanned ultrasound, crossed laser beams and so on. But until I saw the Neato XV-11 hack challenge, I wasn't sure where to go next. Fortunately, seeing autonomous flight attempts from 2011 to 2013 in Grand Forks North Dakota, I became more and more convinced that sensory and telemetry systems are the key to getting our UAV's to be more than just expensive toys.At CSU Chico, my Electronic Engineering and Computer Science peers and I followed the XV-11 LiDAR and Microsoft Kinect reverse engineering bounty. Including some reverse engineering and operating of the structured light optical train ourselves (really cool by the way!). But seeing the CMU cam 4 and the XV-11 LiDAR really brought my mind to focus. A spinning LiDAR is unavoidable for the hobbyist, high school through college students, and experts alike.The lack of - and need for - an affordable open source LiDAR has become an intolerable obstacle, and this must change. I want this device to follow the spirit of the CMU cams and Pixy 5 optical flow cameras. This LiDAR should be easy to attach to Arduino's, PICs, STM32s and Basic Stamps. The interface and coding should be simple, and will be thoroughly documented in a PDF. Example code and sample setups will be included. This LiDAR is meant for High School teachers and students all the way up to college professors and students. My goal is for more LiDARs in the market place, at lower cost.Pixy (CMUcam 5) : https://www.kickstarter.com/projects/254449872/pixy-cmucam5-a-fast-easy-to-use-vision-sensorLike the XV-11, it will have a mechanically scanned sensor. This method has been used in industry for decades for radar and other sensors. The sensor is from the PulsedLight3D LLC group and this device, the ""LidarLite"" version, is already proven and certified for human eye safety. The turret housing the LED and detector will spin 3 times per second, and the data will be returned serially through a slip ring commutator. The motor will be held at a constant RPM with a closed loop speed regulator. each of the 100 pulses per second distance measurements, will be indexed to the degrees of a compass, as in other common devices. Ive put in more than 2,000 hours and 4,000 dollars of my own time and money researching, building and learning. I wouldn't be asking others to do the same if I didn't believe in the critical importance of this technology. So, I currently have the rotating test device, which has verified the geometry and signal timings. next up, there will be code written for a STM32L1 discovery board to interface with an actual lidar lite.Seen in this clip, the rotating turret and oscilloscope. Ill have the STM32L1 attached soon, to read the IR break beam encoder.For this project, its important for potential backers to know that I have all the necessary instruments, and knowledge to use them. Oscilloscopes, Logic analyzers, Volt meters, Logic programming, soldering, CNC milling, Circuit board etching tank and so on. So this isn't my first rodeo :) And feel free to look at my previous work in UAV's and High Voltage projects. Further, Im using our purchasing power in quantity to press the price down. So we the end users will get greater capability then just the straight line LiDAR-Lite itself.Academic Bicopter Using Castle ESC's [ It Flies! ]http://www.rcgroups.com/forums/showthread.php?t=1818948Ducted Academic Tricopter (Asymmetric, 3rd Generation).http://www.rcgroups.com/forums/showthread.php?t=20696722 Channel High Voltage Oscilloscope Probe.http://4hv.org/e107_plugins/forum/forum_viewtopic.php?118895.post High voltage probe for O-scope, 2 of 2, ( FABRICATION ).http://4hv.org/e107_plugins/forum/forum_viewtopic.php?124946.0High voltage probe for O-scope, 1 of 2, ( DEVELOPMENT ).http://4hv.org/e107_plugins/forum/forum_viewtopic.php?107837.0","The risks are mostly related to economy of scale and purchasing power.

After that I can run the devices out quickly, with more backers this becomes more favorable.I have costs figured out, with formal quotes for quantities of the components, including alternates if need be.There are others offering solutions, first RoboPeak, which sells for 399 US$.

I offer the rewards to make it compelling, but I'll make accommodations to backers if possible for unconventional rewards so long as they comply with kickstarter rules.This machine is specifically designed for the purpose of conducting humanitarian, environmental and academic work. This is to be done through long duration flights carrying a useful payload. That means starting with a proof-of-concept Kickstarter (first of three), to prove these ideas worthy of your continued backing.That's all easy to say, but how are we to actually do it ? Tilt-rotors !* Lion = Lithium Ion battery, LiPo = Lithium Polymer battery.As for the common multirotors (even expensive large ones), all have limitations of payload and duration of flight. As these are the measures of any flying machines usefulness, improvements in these capabilities must be demonstrated for these aerial robots to be considered more than just an expensive, novel toy.Second, sensory systems must catch up, and be made small and yet still effective. The sensory system of this proposed machine would be modular, capable of being tailored for each flight and users needs. ( More on that below. )(In the title pic you'll see a 3rd generation Tri-Copter, very successful.) Like myself, you want to be a rebel with a cause! Instead of passively reading and watching terrible events in the world, lets go! Seize the initiative and use technology that humanity has never possessed before, and use it for good. Developing drones for other than military purposes wont be easy, but it will be worth it ! .This will take place at Shasta College via independent study courses, my own time and money, and involve local businesses that have assisted my past multirotor efforts..Ohlone, Shasta and CSU Chico.Already flown sensors include temperature, humidity and NVDI pictures. These sensors have returned valid data on many flights. End users, like universities, private individuals and government agencies may like to develop there own unique sensors. This machine is envisioned from the beginning to be open source friendly, so integration of new sensors will be easy.Modular Sensory Systems (as many as possible will be flown) :* The Lidar and GPS features are most difficult to implement, these may have to wait for the second Kickstarter. ^ this is expensive and may have to wait for the second Kickstarter.^ Medical supplies are often small yet valuable and needed quickly by nurses and doctors where there are no or few roads. In future versions sensor data captured would be assigned at least one method of retrieval from the bot itself. This means solid-state memory or real time transmission to ground. For agricultural use, Ive been using NVDI (Normalized Vegetation Difference Index) to evaluate plant health from a distance. Using NVDI, large sections of crop or forested areas could be measured for disease prevention instead of disease suppression after the fact.At Shasta College in particular, we are investigating whether random flights of UAVs could be used to prevent crop loss. ( Chasing animals off, without hurting them. ) Furthermore, a great deal of water is lost In California's central valley and drought is a particular problem. Aerial detection of leaks would be advantageous, and it adds up.For future versions of this machine, we want to take part in research geographic information system (GIS) efforts shown below. Launching from a large ocean-going research ship, making measurements, and returning. (At least experimentally for now) However, this would necessitate flights of several miles which isn't possible yet. ( We'd need the third starter !)Capturing many far off data points allows for greater science at lower cost, compared to a slow moving ship with single measurements from its path of travel. Surface vessels and or low altitude drones can evaluate pollution that otherwise cant be seen from satellites. In the above picture, the temperature colorized map is obtained via satellite, however the only means of measuring harmful radionuclides, PCBs or DDT would be through direct sampling of water of surfaces. Remote sensing from orbit down to Earth's surface would allow for comprehensive models of various kinds.Measuring the bio-accumulation of poisonous chemicals is becoming increasingly important in third world countries, largely do to poor practices in power generation and electronic waste. Rivers and small water ways are known to transport poisonous chemicals quickly.Ultimate success will be measured by the ability to travel fast and far, stay on station, and bring back information. For example, A squadron of 10 UAVs could range out far and wide from a ship, take subsurface samples measure and return tracking radioactive or poisonous materials. Medicine could be delivered fast to an outbreak that is far from other transport. War crimes could be observed by accredited journalists at a safer distance and faster than a cover-up could take place. (For example, Syria's use of chlorine and ammonia, or the use child soldiers in Africa)For the rewards of $120 and above, Ill print and fabricate composite parts for two sizes of machines, either the 450 or the 600 size. This means the servo tray, the landing gear and other parts needed, servos not included. list of materials and where to buy included. (basic machine and does not include my advance systems.) These rewards are for those who have built similar multi-rotors in the past, not those new to the hobby.(Jan 28 2015 to July 15 2015) like the Neato XV-11 LiDAR, and Kinect bounties, I feel modularity is wise and open ""hackability"" essential. University researchers and humanitarian users shouldn't have to fight a closed unsupported system. http://letsmakerobots.com/blog/gallamine/open-lidar-project-hack-neato-xv-11-lidar-400-bounty Land mine detonator: https://www.kickstarter.com/projects/massoudhassani/mine-kafonPublic Lab: https://www.kickstarter.com/projects/publiclab/infragram-the-infrared-photography-projectPixy cam: https://www.kickstarter.com/projects/254449872/pixy-cmucam5-a-fast-easy-to-use-vision-sensorRainforest Connection: https://www.kickstarter.com/projects/topherwhite/rainforest-connection-phones-turned-to-forest-guarThis first Kickstarter ($1,200) demonstrates the tilt-rotor ability, greater efficiency and the beginnings of a modular sensor system. (This first kickstarter does not need any FAA certification) This will be a tiny tilt-rotor, about the size of whats seen in the above pictures.This is a proof-of-concept device.The second Kickstarter (approximately $8,000) will improve the power supply for longer range flight without the use of LiPo batteries for main power. This power units details will be released for backer review, but for now its secret for technical and legal reasons. (This version will not need waivers from the FAA) This is a technology demonstrator using collective pitch propellers.The third Kickstarter (approximately $70,000) will make long range flights at sea of several miles and back. ( sea flights for safety and verification of GPS waypoint navigation.) This machine will be capable of scientific and humanitarian flights into disaster areas and is a large tilt-rotor Ive chosen three separate Kickstarters to prove my self capable of the skills and ideas I claim. Furthermore, the backers benefit from transparency, which allows the backer to re-evaluate whether this project is right for them at each stage. Test Point One: Can tilting be done with practical dimensions, and mass ?Test Point Two: Does tilting increase flight distance per unit of power consumed ?Test Point Three: Is there a measurable difference between LiPo or Lion batteries in forward flight ?Test Point Four: Can a tilt-rotor carry and use modular instruments across water and fields ?Test Point Five: Can this machine carry a dead-weight equivalent to the second Kickstarters advanced range power unit ?* Lion = Lithium Ion battery, LiPo = Lithium Polymer battery.","The greatest risk is large national defense contractors trying to take over this industry, while we are newborn still in the crib.And a close second, the FAA dragging its feet in allowing the safe use of drones for profit. It looks very much like Australia is leading the way for the use of multirotors by small and midsize companies. Perhaps we Americans, for the first time, are giving up the initiative on an all new frontier, which we are not known for.Next, with every flight, the agricultural use seems more and more practical. Ive been getting good NDVI pics from on-board.A significant challenge I frequently see is scattered information. Many projects claim to inform you on the ability to build your own multi-rotor, but skip key material and setup guides. There is also problem in the other direction, the dumping of a lot of random information on the you the end user, and your left to randomly sift through it."

Think about the saying, ""You can lead a horse to water but you can't make him drink.""  For their health and safety we needed to make them drink.  (Enjoyment too...what dog doesn't like bacon?) Our initial challenges will be to produce the product in bulk by securing large quantities of the ingredients and packaging, creating product labels, preparing the recipe, packaging and distributing the liquid enhancer.The second challenge is advertising and promotion. Fortunately we have a strong network of users and promoters (local vet clinics, pet groomers, animal shelters and dog parks). We will also develop an impressive web presence and promote via the usual social outlets.Growth plans include the reinvestment of early profits into a campaign to find a wholesaler who will mass distribute K9-H2O to retail outlets.Our Kickstarter campaign anticipates these costs as well as incidentals.Please join in today and bring K9-H2O to families and their pets across America."

https://www.kickstarter.com/projects/richborowy/preservation-of-photogrphic-images?ref=discovery_category_newest,richborowy/preservation-of-photogrphic-images,"Since the enhancement of digital photography at the turn of the 21st century, uses of traditional 35mm film cameras and related film formats taking casual pictures for personal non commercial usage has dropped in convention to favor for digital photography, either through dedicated digital camera devices, or through cell phones that can capture images affixed to JPEG and related computer based files. Because of the spontaneity of taking said images through dedicated cameras and phone appliances, many images captured by these electronic elements are saved by the user that would be stored within a hard drive or a “cloud” based application for future retrieval. Images that are not desired by the user are permanently deleted.      In the traditional method of taking pictures through a camera device that uses light sensitive film properties, any photo taken is permanently exposed and affixed onto the film strip. Once developed, a negative is created of all images captured that can be printed on to photo paper. (Photos taken as 35mm and other size formatted transparent slides are not printed onto paper stock, although this process is possible to execute.) Such images taken are usually kept by the user and/or owner(s) of the photos that are stored through many methods, from placing said photos into an album, placed within a photo frame for display, or perhaps stored inside of a container. (Cardboard box, etc.) Over time and tide, these photos, with the assumption that they were stored in ideal physical environments and conditions (cool dry location, away from excessive heat, dampness, and humidity) are kept by the user and/or the user’s estate or domain for multiple generations. This project is to take existing photographic elements (print photos, negatives, 35mm slides, etc.) and to preserve them by either reprinting paper based photos from existing prints and negatives, or to take said print pictures and negatives and digitize those in order to be part of the digital image domain. This method’s purpose and functions is to preserve its unique history of the domestic lifestyle set place within the 20th century as these type of photos normally depict. Non commercial photos taken in the late 19th century (1880-1900) will go within the same preservation process. Once digitized and/or reprinted, all photographic components will be made available and fully accessible by any individual or institution for both academic research study and/or for personal amusement. If a party and/or company desires to use said images for a commercial for-profit operation, (republished in a book, periodical, or through electronic media), any monitory fees and tariffs paid by the interested party or parties for said use would go to either the surviving estate(s) owning the photos, or retrieved back to this author where such funds would be used for further and existing preservation purposes and related applications.","The ricks involved are the lack of cooperation of preserving images due to legal disputes established by the estate holder(s) of the said still picture and/or motion picture/videotape collection; The physical condition of film and tape elements due to chemical shrinkage and/or material damage, and the act of gaining access to a selected photo/film/videotape collection.There will be no risks involving any physical injuries or related dangers to any person or persons, as this project does not require the usage or any toxic or harmful substances to preserve such imagery.",https://www.kickstarter.com/projects/richborowy/preservation-of-non-commerical-moving-and-still-im?ref=discovery_category_newest,richborowy/preservation-of-non-commerical-moving-and-still-im,"     Throughout the twentieth century, many domestic households owned or had access to photographic equipment in the form of a still camera, or a motion picture (movie) camera. The most common and most popular device, the still camera captured images on various form of film sized at 110, 127, and 35mm. These photos, taken by a family or similar household, would capture these persons for the sake of remembrances. Motion pictures, captured in the forms of 8mm, super 8mm, 16mm, as well as videotape in the forms of 1/2” VHS, Beta, 8mm, Hi8, and digital video (DV) would capture these same forms of imagery. Much of what was captured both in motion and still, would be of domestic life milestones (births, birthday celebrations, bar/bat mitzvahs, graduations, etc.) family events (vacations, holiday celebrations, etc.) or some other form of life that deemed important for the household to photograph. about 99% of what was photographed by a household was presented for the household only, not indented to be exhibited or displayed to the general public or to anyone outside of the family domain.     This project’s focus is to preserve such photographic and/or motion pictures, taking its original elements (transparent negatives, motion picture film stock, etc.) to convert to an electronic digital element for the sake of academic research and study, showcasing domestic lifestyles profound within the 20th century and early 21st century.

So we had a great idea to start a project. A compact gaming console that can run all of the old games you love!This is what we came up with. A concept design to house all the hardware you would need to make a small form factor retro gaming machine.Currently the machine is only running a free Operating System called Retro Pie. However we would like to make our own unique software.(You can check out Retro Pie here:http://blog.petrockblock.com/retropie/)Please note: The housing design is only a concept and we welcome new ideas to make the machine the best it can be!We will be posting updates on a regular basis for the project. We have access to a 3D Printer to test all of the different models we have come up with. But we feel as though we are on the right path to making something awesome!The RetroBerry is a small form factor gaming machine which uses the Raspberry Pi B+ combined with emulation software to run all of your favorite old-school games without having lots of wires, cartridges and consoles laying about.By the time design is finished and we are working with a fully functional product, it will come pre-loaded with the Retro Pie software, we do not implement any charges for this as the Operation System is free and open source.When you receive your product you will get the RetroBerry console, a Power Adapter, 8GB Micro SD Card, a internal WiFi Module, a Retro style Game Pad. And the pre-installed software.We managed to 3D Print a base housing for the Raspberry Pi. Once we receive peripherals to port out to the back of the case and a fan mount to keep the Pi temperatures low. We will post updates. We are also planning to add plenty of grills and other cool features. Please bear in mind that this was the second physical product and the design is being worked on day by day and rapidly changing. If there are any features that you would like to see implemented, feel free to tell us!The controller we would like to use gives you that nostalgic feel while playing your favorite old-school games!Hi I am David. I work on the Retro Pie Operating System and make sure everything is running silky smooth. Things I like: QuadCopters, Engineering, Zelda, Gaming and Peanut Butter Sandwiches.This is a bit of a touchy subject. We don't want gaming companies knocking at our doors telling us off, so unfortunately we can't Give them out. And of course I hope this goes without saying: Please only use ROM's you are entitled to use.Thanks for reading! Make sure to come back for future updates from us!-The RetroBerry Team.",We don't want to sound over confident about the campaign. But a challenge is going to be popularity.

Both Josef and Zach are incredibly talented, experienced and ambitious individuals in their respective fields.Cult Called Man hope to make a piece of visual art, that fuses a retro video game feel with the bands odd and timeless style. Using filming techniques and set design, creating a video that is a 2D video-game with the twist, it's shot in live action. It's a bold and ambitious idea. We want to create something which the gaming community and the artistic/music community can marvel at alike.Foster The people Pumped Up Kicks Music Video, Rubber (Movie)","The project is ambitious and the idea of shooting something in live action so as to make it look like a retro video game is tricky. Any funds raised will go towards, building sets and practical effects that are high quality. We hope to give Zach, our set designer the tools he needs to design the set of his dreams. As independent band Cult Called Man have received incredible support over the years so as to engage in the most ambitious projects we can, both musically and artistically. This will be the most ambitious project the band will have ever undertaken, and as ever it will be a unique production.

The video will follow the band as they interact with the artistic underground in Germany in a light hearted way, using some retro concepts to draw the viewer into the band's world.","One of the biggest risks the band have in making the video is not having access to the lighting and equipment need to shoot certain scenes.

Jigsaw puzzles have always been a great way to pass the time; nowadays my three kids like to help whenever I go to the store and buy a new one. I initially had the idea to create some puzzles from some of the fantastic images that I came across on the internet. In January 2016, I finally took the first step into making this a reality.Scouring the internet, I was able to find an interesting photo of an Airbus cockpit as the pilots are in the landing flare. Working with a company with puzzle-making equipment, I obtained the rights to the photo and had a prototype made.The puzzle came out great, and I am ready to begin creating my first production puzzles. I am looking for $6000 to get this project moving. It costs about $4500 to get the best price on a run of 500 puzzles. The remaining $900 or so (after Kickstarter's fees) will go into website hosting and design and marketing.There is a great niche out there, with 680,000 people on Facebook alone in the USA who are fans of both jigsaw puzzles and aviation. There simply aren't any jigsaw puzzles available that are created with exciting, modern photography. I intend to change that.","The biggest challenge to launching a new product is distribution.  Anybody can have the best idea or product in the world, but getting the benefits of that product our idea to market is expensive and challenging.  In 2015, I created a brand of high-end men's grooming products from scratch.  At the end of the year, that company had made more than $125,000 in retail sales.

As you would have figured out by the title of my kickstarter, I am here to share my creative artwork inspired by the Indian tradition of making a Rangoli every single day at the entrance of a house. This auspicious tradition is followed to absorb good luck and positive vibes into a household.Coming from a country like India, which is so rich in its culture, rituals, traditions and yet falls low in respecting Art as an potential field to pursue. My intention through this project is spread positivity through my artwork, celebrate Indian culture around the world and most importantly inspire people to pursue Arts and make their dreams of becoming an Artist come true.I started my journey about 5 years back in India, that was right after quitting my job as a software engineer. My hobby of designing clothes became my obsession and I started accepting orders as a freelancer fashion designer for my near and dear ones.

Only on the last day of the campaign, and only if the campaign has met its minimal funding goal, is when your pledge will be charged. At that point, you officially secure your 'backer' status, and will be soon receive 'the reward'.Up until the last day of the campaign, you are free to cancel or revise the amount of your pledge at any time.

When she’s chosen to go on a mission to find out what the Rashan are up to and why trade has stopped between the Rashan and the rest of Kaloris, she’s less than enthusiastic. She’s happy where she is, and there’s no reason for her to be the one to go. But the bard who chose her has information she wants, so she reluctantly agrees and finds herself on the long road into the harsh region of Kor-Baen alongside a naïve fisherman and a ranger who won’t protect himself. When they arrive in Kor-Baen, they find the issue runs far deeper than trade, and soon they’re trying to stop a mysterious war between the Rashan and the docile country of Adrelia. If they fail, Kor-Baen and every Rashan in it will be in danger. Who’s really behind this disaster?More about the projectThe Heart of the Baenor is a book I've been working on since March 2017. I'm currently in the process of revising it (the chopping up and shuffling around and rewriting stage), and I'm looking to raise money to hire a couple of professional editors and buy cover art.The Heart of the Baenor is not the final title, but the title has been really difficult with this story so I have yet to figure out a permanent option. I'm hoping that beta-readers will be able to assist with that.After this revision I'll do another read-through and revision on my own before sending the book to the first editor, and then once I get it back from her and apply the edits and all that I'll send it to the second editor and apply those edits. Then I have to format it, print it, make sure it worked, and finalize it for publication.The timeline will basically look like this:My revisions: January-July 2018Beta-readers: August 2018Cover art: August 2018First editor/shipment of smaller rewards: September 2018Applying the first editor's edits: October 2018Second editor: November 2018Applying the second editor's edits: December 2018Shipment of larger rewards: Mid-/late-January 2019Publication: February 2019My plans for the fundsApproximately $550 of this is going toward my two editors, and $350 is going toward the cover artist. The rest is going toward paying for the physical backer rewards, Advanced Reader Copies, and the Kickstarter fee.Stretch goal - $2,500 (additional cover art)It would be awesome if I could make about a thousand dollars more so I can get cover art for the trilogy that follows this book ($350 for each cover). I'm going to the same artist for all four covers, so I'd love to be able to get them as much at the same time as possible so as to keep her waiting as little as possible. :)More about meI've been writing for nine years, writing primarily fantasy and also experimenting in sci-fi, dystopian, and post-apocalyptic (as well as contemporary in short stories). This will be my first published novel, but I published a short story collection and a stand-alone short story earlier this year so this isn't my first time publishing.","What if you don't get your revisions done by the end of July?I really hope this doesn't happen, because I've already pushed the publication date back once (I didn't fully understand all that's involved to begin with and ended up not scheduling myself enough time) and I'd rather not do it again because I really want to have this book published this year, but if it does happen I'll push everything back by a month and publish in March 2019.I've completed my entire second draft, and even if the date gets pushed back you WILL be getting a book by the end.",https://www.kickstarter.com/projects/rysaarcher/slander-and-steel-ya-fantasy-adventure?ref=discovery_category_newest,rysaarcher/slander-and-steel-ya-fantasy-adventure,"Catessa is an assassin living in the capital of Kaloris. When trade between Kaloris and the mines of the distant Rashan comes to a halt, she is chosen to find out why—but she sees no reason the mission should be assigned to her.Still, the bard who chose her has information she wants. So she finds herself on an arduous journey to the harsh region of Kor-Baen, accompanied by a naïve fisherman and a ranger who won’t protect himself.In Kor-Baen, the unlikely trio finds issues that run deeper than trade. It falls to them to prevent a mysterious war between the Rashan and their docile neighbor, Adrelia. Failure could mean the destruction of Kor-Baen and every Rashan in it.Who is really fueling this conflict?The TavernCatessa hesitated on the roof of one of the tallest buildings in the city and shot a quick glance over her shoulder. She was still alone. Muffled laughter erupted from the building she crouched on as she crept to the gutter. The metal pole was cool beneath her fingers as she slid down and landed on a pile of trash in the alleyway, mud splashing onto her boots.She strolled to the front of the tavern and stepped inside, savoring the raucous atmosphere and the sickly sweet smell of alcohol. This place was almost like home.She made her way to the counter and saw that someone was occupying her usual seat. His face was turned away from her, but the light from the nearby fireplace gave his hair a familiar reddish tint.“You’re in my seat,” Catessa said.“I know.” Roth spun to face her with a smirk, resting his elbows on the counter behind him.“I knew it was you.”“Well of course. I’d be disappointed otherwise.”“Scoot over.”Roth moved to the next stool over and Catessa took her seat, now warm. “How long did you wait?” Catessa waved down the barmaid.“A while.”The barmaid shuffled over.“I’ll have my usual,” Catessa said. The barmaid left again.Catessa slid Roth’s mug down the bar to him and he caught it, lifted it to his lips, and took a swig.“What’d you get?” he asked.“I got what I went for. It was my job, not yours.”He shrugged. “Just curious.”The barmaid set a mug in front of Catessa and left. Catessa sipped her ale before setting down the mug and turning toward Roth. “You know I’m not going to tell you anything I don’t want to, so why are you still here?”“Maybe I want to see if I can make you want to.” He leaned closer to her and she smirked, turning to face the main room.She watched him out the corner of her eye. “Nice try.”Roth leaned back and shrugged. “It was worth that much.”“Go home.”“Why? Do you have some secret business to deal with? A dead body you need help hiding?”Catessa chuckled. “No.”Roth drained his mug and set it on the counter with a handful of copper coins. “I’ll see you back at the temple.”***Welcome to my Kickstarter campaign. If you're here, that means you're considering backing my campaign and helping me to publish my YA fantasy novella. But before you commit, I'm sure you'll want to know what you're supporting and what's in it for you.Slander & Steel is a novella I've been working on since March 2017. It's been through three full drafts and I've begun a fourth, but I haven't been able to finish it yet. Due to National Novel Writing Month (NaNoWriMo) this month, I won't be aiming to finish it until December, but the plan is to get it done in the first half of December and have it ready to send to professionals in January.This book is also the prequel to a trilogy I've been working on since July 2017, which I'm super excited to share with all of you. I'm not sure how much longer they're going to take to write and edit, but I'll hopefully be able to publish them in 2020. In a way, Slander & Steel is a doorway for the trilogy to go through when it's ready.I am a 16-year-old homeschooled author. I've been writing for nine years and earlier this year I published a set of short stories, one of which I also released as a standalone. I primarily write fantasy and dystopian sci-fi, but I've also experimented in post-apocalyptic and contemporary.As a young adult myself, I've seen a marked lack of YA fiction that handles serious issues tactfully. While my books may include romance and violence, I try to always handle it in a tactful manner and avoid unnecessarily graphic descriptions.What sort of content is in Slander & Steel?Recommended reader age: 12+Romance: A few scenes contain kissing.Violence: There's a fair amount of violence, but it's not described in gory detail.Swearing: There's one instance of a fictional swear.When I'm finished with my fourth draft, I'll send Slander & Steel to two professional editors (one at a time) and order cover art. After the professional editors are done and I've applied their suggestions, I'll send the book to a team of beta-readers for review and make sure it's appealing to the average reader. After editing once more with their suggestions in mind, I'll format the book for print and order a proof copy to make sure everything is as it should be. (This is the place where I freak out because my book is an actual printed book that I can hold in my hands.)Assuming everything is okay with the formatting, the next step is to print out copies for my advance reviewers and my $20+ backers, and I'll send out all of your awesome rewards. Another month after that, I'll officially launch the book and release it to the public.Self-publishing is expensive. While traditionally-published authors have publishers to take care of editors and cover designers, self-publishers pay everything out-of-pocket. This is why I'm coming to you; I get to publish my book, and you get early access and cool bonuses.Here's the overall plan for the funds:As you can see above, I have a stretch goal. If I could raise an additional $1,050 (a total of $2,350) I could order the cover art for my trilogy along with Slander & Steel's cover. I'm getting all four covers from the same artist and I expect it would be easier for her if I could order them all at the same time instead of piecemeal. Each additional cover is $350.Once the main goal is reached, I'll reopen the Willing Guide discount for those who want to contribute to the stretch goal.You can get a reward for a pledge of anything from $1 to $50+. Computer wallpaper, bookmarks, acknowledgements, and physical copies of the book. For the first week of November ONLY, you can get an autographed copy of the book for a $5 discount of $20 instead of $25.

I am the producer All Star Motivator and I am also the director of Pink Dolphin Music Ltd (also trading as Melting Clock Records).I'm making 300 copies of a 12"" coloured heavyweight vinyl 6 track EP containing music by myself, and by European producer Depussy.It's long been a dream of mine to expand the record label from purely digital downloads, to making physical products too - especially a proper vinyl record. I just love the feel of a record and the look of it when it spins on my turntable. Maybe that's just me (I hope I'm not alone!).One of our exclusive rewards is the chance to have your name or nickname printed on every copy of this record in a 'Thanks to...' section on the back cover. Everyone will be able to see your name or nickname, imagine that!All 6 tracks for the EP are recorded, it's just manufacturing costs that need to be funded, and I'm hoping that you'll come along with us on this ride! No money will be taken from you until our goal is reached. If we don't meet our target, you will not be charged anything.The musical styles of this EP will be synth pop tracks and club-friendly dance tracks too (Trance/Minimal Techno/Tech House). The EP will feature the Foreign Technology remix of my song Don't Panic, Just Dance! (feat. Kamey Jade on vocals) as can be heard backing my truly appalling video. (Don't judge me on the video please!) It will also contain another 3 of my tracks, Thank You (feat. Kamey Jade), You Take My Breath (feat. Kamey Jade) and Impossible (Instrumental). The 2 tracks from Depussy are the Original Mix of T.T.I.P. along with a special exclusive Depussy remix of You Take My Breath by All Star Motivator (feat. Kamey Jade), one long 10½ minute musical masterpiece! Just a long sonic journey from darkness to light in 1 track. Brilliant!You can hear the tracks available below:Don't Panic, Just Dance!

If you will indulge me, I want to give you the short version backstory to #PlanLikeABoss.I started out as a scenic artist who landed a dream job almost right out of college. I worked with an amazing team lead by an amazing and inspiring man. He was my friend and mentor. The group of about 6 of us were incredibly passionate about theatre and we went through the trenches together to make some of the best theatrical scenery I have ever seen. My mentor always pushed me to be better, to be inventive and think outside the box, to make solutions out of the worst situations. Almost a year ago that man died of stage 4 lung cancer. The team fell apart, and long story short there is no longer a sense of drive and passion among the people who still work at this ""dream job."" I am not and never have been the kind of person who can just show up to work with a clock in clock out mentality. I put my soul into everything I do and I cant do that, then its time to move on to something else. I can do two things really well in this world; painting, and making lists. I am a type A list maker from hell. So it made sense to me to branch away from this company and work for myself, selling my artwork. For anyone who has done this/is doing this, you know its hard as hell.There's so much to remember and keep track of. For months I struggled through trying to find the best planner/notebook to keep all of my stuff in order, but nothing worked. So I created my own, out of sheer necessity. I want to share my planner with all the creative inspiring artistic CEO's of the world. It helped me get my crap together. I was overwhelmed with how much stuff I had to do every single day, and even more overwhelmed when I couldn't find the notes I had taken yesterday because they were in a different notebook. Honestly, if nobody else but me finds this planner helpful then that's ok, but on the off chance that there are more people like me out there looking for structure and direction then I have something to offer. As they say, fortune favors the bold who get shit done! Actually, Sophia Amoruso said that, and I trust her judgement. So if you're still with me, read on and see what there is to see.This planner will help artists track things like-Weekly goals-Yearly goals-To Do Lists-Project Development-Social Media Planning- Monthly Expense/Profit Tracking-Yearly Expense/Profit Tracking-Organize your art-Client Contact Information-Password Trackerand plenty of space for notes, lists, reminders and anything a future CEO might need to keep on hand daily. I am a very hands on person when it comes to creating, so it makes perfect sense to me to be completely involved in the production of these planners. Based on personal preference I have decided that offering WIRE-O bound notebooks with front and back hard covers is the best option, instead of the hardback book that is pictured. I was unhappy with the paper quality that was used and decided that I would much rather produce these myself! That way I am in charge of assuring TOP QUALITY.I have done extensive research on the creation of WIRE-O bound notebooks and have compiled a list of items needed to get this project up and running. Below is a breakdown of what I plan to spend the Kickstarter funding on, with the intention of buying in bulk and producing 250 planners to begin with.28lb bright white paper for interior pages- package of 250 pages is $14.95 x 250 books = $3,737.50Chipboard front and back covers- 1 package of 32 boards is 27.45. 8 packages of covers @ 27.45 each = $219.60Printable covers- 2 per book = 500 covers. Bulk priced at 100 for 17.90. 500 covers = $89.50Printable interior stickers- 2 per book = 500 covers. Bulk price 200 for 8.10, rounded up to 600 covers = $24.30White 50 mm white metal coils- Bulk package of 50 for 116.50. 5 packages of 50 = $581.15Weight scale for shipping- $16.99Protective shipping envelopes- 100 for 8.75 rounded up to 300 envelopes = $26.25Approx. .05 printer ink per page @ 50,000 pages = $2.500 inkIndustrial paper/chipboard cutter- $129.62Industrial coil binding machine- $199.95Grand total comes to = $7305.26 + approx $760 in fees =8065.26. I rounded up to 8100.00 to make it a nicer number. PERKS:I already own a good printer so no need to purchase there, and I already own the newest version of Adobe Illustrator to do all my designing in house.Because I am doing the printing myself, I will be able to offer the option to customize your cover art, or if an artist wants more space for notes or sketching and less space for blog post updating I can customize planners specifically to the needs of the individual. I've always had a fondness for small US based businesses, so I intend to purchase all of the supplies needed from small companies. In the same regard, I have every intention of building this into a fully realized and developed company, meaning that I will be creating jobs for artists.WHAT COMES NEXT: Right now I am in the middle of converting the context of this original dated planner into an undated version, so that this planner can be used at any point in the year to kickstart your business. I will also be offering this undated version in the mini and full size version, and will still be able to be customized. At this time, because this company is still in the very early beginning stages, I am only going to be able to offer domestic shipping options. The goal is that by this time next year I will be offering multi language planner options that can ship internationally to artists all over the world.I am very excited about this project and am open to suggestions from artists on how to make this planner/workbook even better!","I have spent the last 9 months researching and developing the content to make #PlanLikeABoss the best it can possibly be, and I have been using it with much success recently. The only challenge that I can see is in marketing. I have been successful in marketing my art career, but it took some time. My plan is to market through all of the same avenues that I currently market my paintings, website/blog and all social media sites. This should save time and money in start-up because I already have an audience. Also, the better half of my current audience is made up of artists who could benefit from a planner built specifically for their industry. I plan to put these planners on the market around the middle of October, so that anyone who is doing early Christmas shopping for themselves or others can give this 2018 planner as a gift at the end of 2017. Perfect timing.Since I will be manufacturing these products myself, I am not worried about any delays from a publishing or book printing company. I am purchasing the majority of my materials from local stores, so there could potentially be some lag if they run short on materials. However there are always other options for purchasing materials online from other retailers if this becomes an issue. Of course I would prefer to purchase locally, but if I have a deadline to meet a supply shortage will not stop me. Domestic shipping around Christmas time is always somewhat of a toss up. The majority of the planners will be produced and packaged ahead of time, but I hope you understand that if a planner is ordered the day before Christmas, there is a chance it will not make it on time. I will do absolutely everything within my power to make sure these planners ship to everyone in a quick efficient manner.",https://www.kickstarter.com/projects/2044226831/planlikeaboss-planner-and-workbook-system-for-arti?ref=discovery_category_newest,2044226831/planlikeaboss-planner-and-workbook-system-for-arti,"Are you an artist who wants to take your career to the next level?

The only hurdle is raising the funds to get this idea of the ground!!,https://www.kickstarter.com/projects/1376373307/doggie-daydreams?ref=discovery_category_newest,1376373307/doggie-daydreams,"While furniture shopping for our new house, my fiance and I had come across two different custom pet beds, one made from old wooden pallets and the second from pine logs. The pet beds looked phenomenal but so did the price tags that came along with them. While talking with the owner of the one furniture store, they had mentioned that they had lost their vendor and were in search of another vendor and this is the moment when Doggie Daydreams was born.I have worked in construction building homes for quite a few years now. My fiance had asked that I build two beds like the ones we have seen for our two German Short Haired Pointers. Those two beds are currently being produced but at a much slower rate. Due to the opportunity to be a vendor of custom pet beds for a local furniture store and needing to build our pups their dog beds, I have taken to this website to secure funding to bring custom pet beds to people who can not afford the price tags of the ones we have seen. If you're wondering, the custom wooden pallet pet bed had a price tag of $189 and the pine log bed had a price tag of $469. Well worth the money for the amazing looks of the bed but not affordable to the regular blue collared worker. With funding, I plan to produce these pet beds for a fraction of the costs of the ones you see in furniture stores or online. I pledge to slice the price tags in half, at least!! Every pup out there deserves the best of the best even if their owner cant afford the hefty price tag attached. With funding I plan to produce these pet beds full time to sell to our local furniture store and to be able to offer them on our future website with a short term goal of making these beds available all over the United States and ultimately, the globe!Funding is going to go directly to pre-priced items from Harbor Freight Tools to quicken the production process. All items needed have been laid out on an Excel spreadsheet to itemize every penny needed to make this dream a reality!!","With all funding, benefits must outweigh the risks. The risks with this endeavor have been minimized due to the fact of having a verbal agreement with our local furniture store to be their main vendor of custom pet beds. Risks will be further reduced by selling our products online to reach a much wider customer base."

My name is Chad Welker and I have a great concept for a magic act/routine/gimmick and would need help to achieve this as I do not have budget for two man controlled dinosaur puppets. I think with my graphic arts background in design and my passion for slight of hand street magic I could pull off an impressive feat for small to large audiences as well as an outside on the street performance. Any questions feel free to contact me.Stay magic.-Chad Welkerhttps://www.youtube.com/user/CNNChadsNewsNetwork?feature=mheeIt's not just a project. Its my story...Imagine this.... A world of intense futurism where adventurers perform feats of magic and two live dinosaurs roams the audiences. The year is 2045 and genetic engineering and cloning are common place and the world is no longer the one we just left outside. In this New World Order nothing is as it seems as future technology meets Pre-Historic time travelers steam punk, cloak and dagger mysticism. Watch magic tricks skillfully performed and elaborate steam punk costumes and intense special effects take place. A kids version. and an after dark version will be conceived. The show would last about 45 minutes to an hour starting off as I have to design the illusions and tricks. I feel this will be positive experience and has a message of technology escaping man's grasp and trying to avoid a future of A.I. damnation. Much of the idea behind this magic act comes from Ray Kurtzweil's vision of the future with an ""Indian Jones"" meets ""Hunter S. Thomson meets Turok meets Back to the Future. Steam Punk fashion clothing and storyline brings the audience to a scary future guided by the Nameless Adventurer. Dinosaurs are loose and its up to the Nameless Adventurer to send these two dangerous blood thirsty creatures back to the stone age.    Steampunk—a grafting of Victorianaesthetic and punk rock attitude onto various forms of science-fiction culture—is a phenomenon that has come to influence film, literature, art, music, fashion, and more.","The first thing I need to do is to buy the Tarbell course.I have ordered it today. This is the world's largest collection of magic tricks and acts. I have been studying magic for several years, mostly with slight of hand. Afterwards I will spend time thinking out the act and when to use the dinosaurs. This is no doubt one of the biggest expenses is the dinosaurs as each costume can cost $6,000 more with options. But to my own defense I've never seen another magician do anything of the sort I am going to try to accomplish. To mix stage puppetry with magic.    I will accept advice from high roller donators and will include the highest bidders advice to add to the act or a trick to his or her liking to the best of my ability. Only the most life like dinosaur costume will be needed and I have contacted a company in China which has a distributor in Illinois which sells these dinosaur costumes to my specification. Other lights, background,props and costumes will be bought from home made vendors and the magic tricks and props will be purchased online. This will no doubt be the second biggest expense. I want all original costumes and storyline to go along with this act. Please help me make this show a possibility within the year. Thank you very much for any support even if its just a dollar. I will record a 45 min DVD of the act and send copies to the highest contributor and make the act available online free to all. This could be my big break into becoming a magician  but I just need a kick-start. Soon I will start a blog about my adventure into this project. I have already started developing the act and I am making a short ""demo"" to give an idea of how the show will look. I have been in contact with sellers of costumes, props and illusions already to get a good idea on how much to request from Kickstarter.Here is a link to my Amazon Wish List for purchase of the illusions I intend to incorporate into my act. As you can see I could make a 3 hour show but I want this to be non stop roller coaster.12/28/2012--The Tar bell arrived today in the mail. I had to go to work so I brought the book with me for my down time which wasn't much. I didn't finish the introduction. When I arrived home I read the first two tricks and decided not to move on until i mater them. Oh and I bought another illusion from Amazon from MagicGeek. I've very impressed with the size of this book. Its 9,000 pages ha.12/30/2012-- The Tarbell course was more than I could have hoped for. I am up to lesson 4. I ordered another prop and am now awaiting delivery. I will give a hint: its a bottle and two handkerchiefs. I have done my practice for today and am working on my opening movie for the kickstarter page. I have dropped a few links throughout social media to spread awareness. Made two videos last night and may try another tonight in addition to my address to fundraisers. Wish me luck. Still need to go to Wal-Mart and get a better camera. Found one for only $37 bucks. That is unfortunately my budget for now.1/03/2013-- Celebrated the New Year and my birthday over the holiday break. I got to show off a few tricks at the pub to wonderful reactions. I have ordered a few more props (I love amazon) and they have been shipped today. I am going to try to finish my promo video this evening if my webcam agrees as it has been very fickle as of late. Happy New Year and lets make 2013 the most magical year yet for all of us. YAHOOO!!1/10/2013~ Spent the week preparing for college algebra and haven't had a lot of spare time to make videos so I added a new one to this page and a new different routine to my YouTube page. Got a few responses but no donations so if you are PA, VA, WV MD or DC please support if only a dollar. Thanks and enjoy the upcoming weekend. Peace in the Middle East, Yours always...

However to the highest Kickstarter reward tier of $100 I will send you, via e-mail, a copy of my levitation plans for personal use. This is not my original idea as this has been around for ages. Plans only! Not the gimmick as this is a Kickstarter to help me get to the next level of my idea.Putting together a magic show for children in the area as well as the adults. I have done a few open air performance always to rave responses. I have performed worldwide while serving. I have performed in Japan, Hong Kong, Singapore, Australia, South Korea, Indonesia, Brunei and Thailand. I am trying kick-starter again after last year's failure to reach my goal which I believe was too ambitious. I do shows for disable members in my community and travel to homes and meet people as part of my day job. Thank you for your support,Chad Welker","Magic, especially the kind I perform can be dangerous. Do not attempted without the proper attention, training and skills.After funding is successful I will post videos linked to YouTube to show off this wonderful illusion.

Funding this center is not solely about my desire(s) - it is about helping as many people as I can heal in a world that continues to take damage. http://aliadanielle11.wixsite.com/restorationIt is my dream to open my wellness center, but also incorporate other areas of services that I provide. Not only am I a successful freelance artist with my own registered online/local business (www.itsmyforte.net), but I am also a Life Coach, a certified pre-martial/martial assessment facilitator, certified in Art Therapy, amongst other things. Therefore, I have a big heart with a lot of love, suggestions, and open ears to give to those needing that type of outlet.I have located a perfect spot for my healing arts wellness center; however, it is covering the initial rent and ordering other supplies that I am requesting financial assistance with.The wellness center will include:*A color-coded yoga room where anyone is given an allotted time to meditate and practice yoga*A craft room where adults/children can participate in pre-planned crafts related to healing and art therapy*A color-coded music room where adults/children are given an allotted time to meditate and listen to soothing music for healing purposes*A color-coded room for personal coaching sessionsYour contributions would help fund:*'silent party' headphone/equipment for the music room*initial craft supplies for the craft room*yoga mats/pillows*rent of facilityPersonal wellness and healing is so important, and finding that through the means of art is such an expressive feeling. I am eager to share my love for humanity, passion for art, and longing for healing with others. I would greatly appreciate anyone who helps me in the endeavor so that I may in turn help others.Thank you!","The risk and challenges to completing my project are minimal, because I already have the support to ensure the business starts off at a steady pace once opened. I have ample followers on Facebook business page, followers from my blog site, and am a known local artist.

https://www.kickstarter.com/projects/dv-exodus/larte-del-suicidio?ref=discovery_category_newest,dv-exodus/larte-del-suicidio,Il progetto consiste nella realizzazione di un libro fotografico con all'interno foto in analogico create con una macchina fotografica istantanea. Tutte le foto all'interno raffigurano le varie forme di suicidio in 2 modi: in prima persona e in terza persona.La macchina fotografica utilizzata sarà una POLAROID IMAGE PRO con carta fotografica IMPOSSIBLE SPECTRA COLOR o POLArOID IMAGETutte i libri saranno simili ma non uguali in quanto le foto saranno incollate tutte a mano. Per ora l'idea è di posizionarle in ordine diverso per ogni libro.Il libro è stato creato con l'intento di far riflettere le persone su cosa si prova nel vedere quello che stanno per fare e per cercare di fargli cambiare idea. l'idea iniziale è quella di vendere il prodotto a singole persone che lo chiedono e poi di pubblicarlo in scala più ampia.Ogni libro avrà più o meno 40 pagine.,la sfida più grande è quella di riuscire a fare tutte le foto in quanto in ogni ricarica ci sono solo 10 fotografie. La sfida quindi sta nel riuscire a fare più libri possibili.,https://www.kickstarter.com/projects/dv-exodus/exodus-1?ref=discovery_category_newest,dv-exodus/exodus-1,"Exodus è un libro fotografico, un reportage, un viaggio attraverso le vite di sei uomini che raccontano, per mezzo di parole, fotografie e colori, il viaggio della speranza per fuggire dal loro paese e arrivare in Italia con la speranza di avere una vita migliore. Un libro con interviste singole realizzate in momenti diversi, dove ogni voce racconta a proprio modo i fatti vissuti senza alcuna censura. Le parole, una dopo l’altra, creano quello che viene completato dal mezzo fotografico: la nuda testimonianza di una vita mandata avanti dalla speranza.Le foto sono scattate durante tutto il corso della giornata, ponendo l’attenzione sui ritmi seguiti dai ragazzi. Questi vengono seguiti durante la preparazione dei pasti, in particolare, per loro un momento di relax. La prospettiva percepita è quella di un osservatore che si immerge nella vita di un’altra persona.Oltre alle foto che presentano i migranti in prima persona, le loro vite vengono raccontate anche tramite l’ambiente in cui vivono. A tal proposito ho realizzato una serie di fotografie dall’alto che dipingono lo spazio che i ragazzi riempiono ogni giorno. La loro presenza è stata volutamente resa assenza in tali scatti per lasciar vedere chiaramente al pubblico le condizioni di vita di coloro che fuggono dal proprio paese senza altre vie d’uscita. Il mio intervento negli scatti è nullo, volendo rappresentare la realtà oggettiva di tale argomento.-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------Il viaggio viene dai migranti comunemente considerato non come il puro raggiungimento di una specifica destinazione ma come l’inevitabile fuga dal punto di partenza. Seppur ogni migrante abbia una storia simile a quella di un altro compagno, avendo in comune uno spiacevole inizio e la speranza di una nuova vita, il percorso per raggiungere la propria meta cambia.Ognuno di loro è un essere umano con una propria storia, unica e piena di avvenimenti più o meno spiacevoli. Da qui nasce per me la necessità di entrare appieno nel loro mondo individuale utilizzando come mezzo principale la macchina fotografica, con lo scopo di catturare la pura realtà che altrimenti rimarrebbe nascosta all'indifferenza del resto del mondo, ma servendomi anche della parola.-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------Siamo tutti persone, viaggiatori provenienti dai luoghi più disparati in cerca di un posto sicuro.L’uomo è nato nomade; sin dalla notte dei tempi, per seguire le migrazioni degli animali che cacciava, che gli fornivano il sostentamento necessario, l’uomo si è dovuto spostare attraverso innumerevoli paesaggi. Per secoli ha attraversato vallate, pianure sconfinate, deserti e cime innevate senza dover chiedere il permesso. Ha goduto della libertà di potersi spostare da una parte all'altra del mondo senza sentirsi “estraneo” in una terra che non gli apparteneva.Tutti, almeno una volta, siamo stati estranei in questa strana terra.Immigrati che lottano per sentirsi a casa, per sentirsi al sicuro e confortati dalla conoscenza del proprio essere e della propria provenienza.Ogni essere umano è impegnato nella ricerca e nella realizzazione dei propri desideri, tra questi la speranza che la meta raggiunta alla fine del tortuoso viaggio sia migliore della partenza. La diversità del genere umano è essa stessa il suo pregio maggiore.Le sfumature di colore che differenziano un uomo dall'altro non sono altro che lo spettro visibile della realtà umana, satura di debolezze e punti di forza. Ciò però non cambia nulla perché, in fin dei conti, restiamo ancora tutti immigrati, senza alcuna distinzione.Siamo tutti immigrati col terreno sotto ai piedi e la stanchezza sulle spalle, esseri appartenenti alla stessa terra, madre di ogni uomo. Se siamo qui con i nostri occhi, cuore, orecchie, gambe e braccia, siamo proprio come te.Qui, siamo tutti immigrati.","Quando inizi a camminare verso una meta, non puoi tornare indietro e stravolgere tutto. Ti abitui ad essere così come sei, soprattutto se anche gli altri si abituano a contare sulla tua forza e sul tuo sorriso sempre presente, lo stesso che ho cercato di regalare ai sei ragazzi al centro di accoglienza. Non è stato semplice gestire tutte quelle emozioni ed esprimermi nel migliore dei modi senza cedere al bisogno impellente di piangere."

They sag sadly on their hangers, feeling unloved and unwanted. That's where I come in! I swoop in and rescue these sweaters so that they can have makeovers and become something useful and pretty and desired.How, you might ask?By recycling them back into yarn!Sometimes, like the yarn above, they are unraveled and the yarn is dyed and then re-plied or spun together. Sometimes, like the yarn below, it's simply dyed and left as is... but it's always made into something exquisite!Fibers range from cotton to cashmere, and everything in between! Wool, alpaca, viscose... I love to experiment with all sorts of fiber.So, what exactly is this Kickstarter funding?First and foremost, it's funding a new camera, so I can take quality, color accurate photos of my merchandise. Second, it's funding more supplies and equipment for dyeing- a tarp, gloves, containers, soda ash, etc. Anything left over after that will fund more sweaters and dye.This is my third attempt at a Kickstarter- my first two attempts included hand mixed nail polish also, but I feel now that it's better to focus on one thing at a time for now. Perhaps in the future, I will branch out, but for now I feel the yarn is most important. You know the saying, third time's a charm... Let's make it a reality! :-D","This is a very low risk project. Any setbacks will be clearly communicated to backers, as well as a proposed solution, though I really don't foresee any happening.",https://www.kickstarter.com/projects/819514122/magick-cat-yarns-needs-a-spinning-wheel?ref=discovery_category_newest,819514122/magick-cat-yarns-needs-a-spinning-wheel,"Eventually, I moved on to learning more about knitting, since my mother had left me many sets of needles to play with.  Something inside of me exploded, and I discovered a glorious obsession that hasn't left me since. I have gone through many phases in my life, creation wise, and some have come back repeatedly- whether making jewelry, photography, drawing, painting, etc. But nothing has been so constant or deeply satisfying for me as the fiber arts. It was only a matter of time before I delved deeper into the rabbit hole, and discovered the wonders of working from recycled yarn (unraveled from thrift store sweaters), dyeing yarn, plying yarn, and ultimately, spinning yarn. I was gifted a drop spindle, and learned how to spin rather well on it. I combined some of these activities to create really lovely yarn, learning several new skills along the way. And so it was that after feeling lost and discouraged for years, with no real job or career ideas for a long time, I had found a path and a purpose, and slowly discovered what I wanted to to for a living: I want to make yarn, whether I turn unwanted thrift store sweaters into beautifully made over yarn, dyed and plied and ready to be knit or crocheted something wanted and loved, or whether I create beautiful hand spun yarn from raw fiber!Are you laughing? If you are, I don't blame you. Because it does sound pretty silly, and random, and ridiculous. But it's the truth, and I want desperately with every fiber (no pun intended) of my being to make it a reality. It's something I feel a need to do. And I know there is a market for it, as the fiber arts are rising rapidly in popularity again. Bonus: it's eco friendly! My best friend believes in me, to the point where she actually bought me an antique spinning wheel for my birthday last summer. The wheel is glorious and does work, despite the little quirks and wobbles that come with age. However, the wheel is unsuited to spin or ply the quantities of yarn that I need it to, in order to create a suitable product to sell. So, while it is perfect for spinning smaller quantities of beautiful, rustic wool (though it was originally intended for flax), I need something more consistent, something made to produce larger quanities than what I currently have now.This campaign is going to fund not only a new wheel (I have my eye on a Schacht Ladybug), but also enough sweaters, wool, and dye to get started, miscellaneous items such as rubber gloves, listing fees on Etsy, and advertising fees on Ravelry. Success for this campaign means not just the physical materials, it means starting me off on a career that I've created and envisioned all on my own- a new life, and a new purpose, and a way out of the poverty I've been struggling with for so long now.","There are no risks or challenges I can think of, it's a pretty safe endeavor. If you can see any though, I'd love to hear about them so I can be better prepared to handle them, if/when they show up."

Some of you might ask, ""Why are you asking for funding of your company and not a specific product?"" The answer is quite simple. We feel that our current project is going to bring about a change in the mobile game market. This being the case, we're afraid of getting such intellectual property stolen from us. So here we are! We still need everyone's help to get things moving more quickly. Our number one problem isn't that we need new software, new hardware, or a location to create our masterpiece. Our problem is that we simply don't have time to devote our full attention. Namely our graphic designer is so slammed with work that we either need to hire someone to lighten the load or funds enough to employ him at least part time for Exalted Guy Studio.Although we can't share specifics on our current project, we can share company plans and bios.Goal 1: Complete our current project!We've given this one a lot of thought and devoted as much time and energy as we could up to this point. The only thing we can share about this project is that it's a skill/puzzle game that utilizes properties exclusive to the mobile platform. Our current progress has shown that we are more than capable of finishing this game on our own. That being said, we would like to move to the next level more quickly.Goal 2: Officially form Exalted Guy Studio.As of this moment Exalted Guy studio is not a business entity. We would like to change that as quickly as possible. Right now we're just four guys with a lot of great ideas and not enough time to make them all happen.Goal 3: Employ our current work force!Right now all the individuals working on our current project are doing it for fun or the promise of a cut of the future profits. We would like to change that and at least pay our graphic artist so he doesn't have to struggle so much.Goal 4: Get a legitimate office!We have done some looking around and have found a few modest office spaces that would suit our needs. Of course we need more than 15K to open an office so this is more of a stretch goal after we pull in some profit from our games.Bios:Eric Langkamp:Eric has been a software developer in the industry for over 5 years and has helped develop an educational video game to teach K-12 plant biology for 3 years of his career. Eric focuses primarily on back end code but will poke his head out of the shadows to aid in the overall game design by giving his approve/disapproval of different aspects. Eric is also the head of Exalted Guy Studio and the founder.Jason Kelley:Jason is our designer and has honed his skills over many years of game/puzzle design and story writing. Jason is by far the most hungry out of all the Exalted Guy Studio staff and is dying to make every project a success.Evan Rowley:Evan is Exalted Guy Studio's dedicated tester. Not much more to say there. He sometimes aids in the overall design process and throws in his two cents when it's relevant. Evan would take more of an active role but he is currently in the Army and deployed.Josh Kelley:OUR GRAPHIC ARTIST! Josh is the man who makes the game look good and has had many years of graphic design experience. Most notably he worked as a landscape designer using virtual tools for several local companies. He has also had several small side projects using his cartooning skills. This will be Josh's first video game project but with Eric's extensive experience, Josh has made a great addition to the team.",Our current challenge is ensuring the continued graphic design on our projects.

We're not not content creating a ripoff of existing games we want to give you something truly unique and inspired. Using tilt control to directly control the environment instead of the character allows you to control the character very intuitively. Guy, our mouse friend, tumbles his way through obstacles and deadly traps to reach his ultimate goal or rather your ultimate goal of collecting all the cheese in the maze. But wait!It's not that simple. As guy eats the cheese he gets fatter and isn't able to fit down certain passages. If he eats two cheeses in a row he won't survive that much food. In order to win you must collect two different types of cheeses regular and pungent cheese. Pungent cheese will make guy lose the weight. In essence pungent cheese doesn't agree with guy and it makes him thinner. If guy eats two pungent cheese in a row he will lose too much weight and die. You must choose your path and what to have guy eat very wisely in order to complete the maze successfully. There are also cookies in the level and they, along with a time bonus, are how you receive points for the level completion and earn stars. Simply completing the level will advance you to the next maze but to get all three stars for the level you must complete the level as quickly as possible while also collecting as many cookies as you can. We currently have plans for 50 levels, two skin packs and 10 unlockable mouse skins for completing the mazes. In the future we plan to release an additional level pack if the game is successful enough to warrant it.With a pledge of $7 for iOS and $10 for Android you not only get the game but you also get this gift of Moneybags Guy. Goal: Fall Guy! - $1500Stretch goals:Goal 2: Additional 20 maze level pack DLC -$3000Goal 3: Additional Skin pack - $5000Goal 4: Additional 50 maze level pack instead of 20 mazes - $8000",At this time the only risk we run is not meeting our planned deadline of December 24th 2014. We want this game to be a Christmas gift to you who pledged and also for the entire mobile games market!

I’ve also traveled to various destinations to document many unknown and forgotten ships.I've documented stores, events that not even the mainstream press has covered;My photographs have been featured in trade magazines, international newspapers and in commercial print ads for the New York Economic development corporation.I was just recently featured in the Power ships Magazine summer of 2015 issue and a book called New York's Liners (Images of America) by John A. Fostik.For me it's its a labor of love, dedication and my heart and soul I put into my work.To assemble together a large exhibition of my vast collection photographs, films and artwork to showcase to the world and the local community & to complete the 50 page coffee table book titled""Through the Lens of Byron Huart: Cruise liners in New York.""It can only become a reality if crucial funding is raised to get the project off the ground from the planning board to reality. Funding is needed for the following: Operating costs, advertising, printing of the photographs & books,  framing and the costs to secure a space, host the opening reception and make a show catalog.The rewards as listed depending on what backing one chooses..As you can see by watching my video, this exhibition is about much more than just showing my photography, it’s about this amazing showcase of history and the continuing mission of preserving these moments for future generations to come and giving back to the community. Projected launch date:Late Spring- early Summer of 2016Once the show is launched we will display the work as well as host programs, functions, community events, workshops as well as discussions on the port of New York and the local community.Your contribution to this amazing project would be greatly appreciated.

KEEWATIN and the list goes on, it's only because of the herculean philanthropic efforts and support that liners such as the SS Rotterdam, MV Dulos and the famous RMS Queen Mary were spared from a similar fate, which is why it's important we fight to preserve these maritime icons for future generations to cherish.Aspiring maritime historian, Professional photographer, speaker and travel journalist of over 8 years. Byron Huart's love for the QE2 came when he went down to the piers in to see the great QE2 and her new sister ship MV Queen Victoria in Jan of 2008. As he looked upon the great old liner, it was a childhood love of ships rekindled.From that day forward, he began to document various passenger ships in New York harbor including the final 4 visits of the QE2 in New York City.Since 2010 he has worked as the US correspondent and New York city branch founder of Liveboat Italy, an Italian based cruise and travel publication that covers various events and topics the cruise industry.Byron's work has been featured in various publications such as Cruise Travel Magazine, Powerships Magazine, The Philadelphia Tribune, NY1 News, The Staten Island Advance, Maritime Matters and Cruise BusinessReview including a book byJohn Fostik by Arcadia publishing titled ""New York's Liners.""In 2016 Byron Huart founded his traveling exhibition ""City of Ships."" a traveling photo & artifact exhibition focusing on his documentation of various port cities and numerous vessels he has documented in the past 10 years.Since 2016, Byron has hosted exhibitions of his work in Staten Island, NY and in New London, CT and now in Hoboken, NJ.The collection from Byron's documentation of the QE2 in 2008 consist of over 500+ photographs and videos, this exhibit will display the best of that colleciton.Lisa’s enjoyment of photography began at age 13 when her dad gave her his 1950s Voitländer VITO B 35mm rangefinder camera and an external light meter. By experimenting with various apertures and shutter speeds, she learned to optimize her photographs in many situations. After purchasing her first single-lens reflex camera in the early 1980s, Lisa honed her photography skills through night courses at The New School in New York City. She entered the digital age in 2005, although she still prefers overriding automatic settings with manual ones.As an avid traveler, Lisa’s camera would accompany her during her trips to 35 states, 8 Canadian provinces and territories, 26 countries, and 4 continents.Lisa’s favorite mode of transportation is passenger ship, and photographing the interiors and exteriors of ocean liners and cruise ships became a passion. One highlight was a transatlantic crossing on Queen Elizabeth 2 in 2003. In 2010, she launched a noncommercial Web magazine, NauticalNotebook, which features some of her travel photography among her comprehensive reviews of cruise ships, ports of call, and advice for domestic and international travel. When not behind the camera, Lisa is a writer, editor, and user experience consultant in the financial services industry. She lives in Massachusetts, USA, with her husband, son, and an overly dependent house cat. She may be reached at lisa@nauticalnotebook.com. Patricia lives close to Southampton docks so saw the ships come and go as she grew up, QE2 being the one she'd show visitors. While she has since cruised on many ships, her first cruise was the QE2, the ship her great-grandparents sailed on when new. She fell in love with a crew member during one of her voyages and subsequently visited the ship several times before retiring in Dubai. Standing on the bow was a dream come true. The relationship didn't last but continued adoration for QE2 did.She gets her passion for ships from her father, whose own family worked on the docks in Liverpool during the ocean liner heyday. QE2 will always hold a special place in her heart. Barry has been involved with the cruise industry for more than 30 years.  It started out as a passion for the history of the trans-Atlantic liners and has evolved into a passion for the cruise industry.  A dream come true for Barry in 1992 was when he was hired to work as Stage Manager aboard the QE2.  Barry worked on cruise ships as entertainer / Cruise Director from 1989 to 1992.Now Author of Cruising Authority - a book with cruise stories, adventures and cruise reviews, Barry let's his reader live vicariously through his over 300 cruises around the word.The exhibit will be hosted in June of 2018 at the Hoboken, NJ at the Hoboken Public Library in the library's newly constructed exhibition space.For the price of a cup of coffee, you can support this great exhibit, if you choose to contribute more, we will reward you with one or all of these great keepsakes made by the founder himself.The calendar will be produced by a local print shop in New York, the project is self-funding from calendar and photograph sales only, and receives no government or other grant money.All the money raised goes back into the project, either to pay for the printing of all prints and promotional materials.and the professional framing of all photographs and art pieces.Your support will be greatly appreciated, this amazing project and the culmination of over 10 years work will for the first time be shared with the general pubic world.Thank you all!","I'm really seeking funding to be able to provide a proper platform for this show as well as future exhibitions. With the increased prestige of showing at the Hoboken Public Library, also comes a desire to have the work presented in the best possible way.I have been looking at alternative ways to showcase the exhibit, but I'm trying to stay as close to a method of exhibition that I feel most aligns with the reverence I have for photography and these images in particular.The timeline of this project is pretty short, but this would allow me to change courses if the project isn't fully funded.With every project and every dream, comes obstacles and barriers. This is my very first kickstarter, and as we prepare to launch this new exhibition, there are many steps we must take. All prints and calendars that are offered for a reward in this kickstarter campaign are already in my possession and this would not be held up at all.Being able to create a spectacular, real, genuine, beautiful showcase will allow the love of  history and the work to be emphasized and seen everyday.

After 20 years of scribbling I have to conclude:Drawing and writing on a whiteboard is far more effective and leads to more engagement than endless talking without context and structure. So, if you are an eager professional whodares to walk up to a whiteboard/glass wall to help others envision their project by drawing and scribbling, the EAMarkersare made for you.Using more colours can have a positive influence on the memory performance of your audience. Please read this article for more info. I selected 10 quality whiteboard markers with distinctive colors to separate business & IT domains, processes, persona, lateral thinking perspectives etcetera.Adding more colors (than the standard black, blue, red and green) adds more creativity and more fun.The whiteboardboard markers:The whiteboard markers are delivered in a cardboard box with magnetic closure and a foam inset to keep the markers in place.An extra feature is the invisible placement of 4 extra magnets in the back of the box. In this way, the box can be attached to the whiteboard.Inside the box, some common models are presented as a kind of holistic checklist:The keywords of the models will be UV printed* on the markers to help you when you are presenting. *In the sample I printed the keywords on a label, because I need a MOQ of 3000 markers for custom UV printing, which looks really neat and professional.Personal WhiteboardAs shown below you can even use the box as a personal whiteboard.For innovative organizations and creative agency's that would like to deliver an exclusive set of whiteboard markers as a premium giveaway, you have the option to pledge for 250 sets with a custom designed EAMarker box.The picture below shows an example of the IT sourcing company I'm working for. The front panel will be UV printed to deliver a neat and professional look. At the inside you can display your own corporate message, models etc.","CHALLENGETo deliver the custom printed whiteboard markers for a reasonable price I have to order 3000 sets, which is really a huge amount of sets. This is a private project. As you can see I designed and ordered samples and made an estimate of the cost based on the minimum order quantity  (MOQ) of 3000 sets. I'm convinced that the quality of the markers and the cardboard box is 'good enough' for delivery.IMPROVEMENTSI will replace the yellow marker with a brown one, because brown is better visible on white and transparent backgrounds. The supplier confirmed they will supply the brown color marker with the same quality ink.There are some small failures in the sample design (Eg. 'colorfull'='colorful', 'oppertunities'='oppurtunities'). I will correct that in the production batch of  course.The measures of the EAMarker box are: 215mm x 170mm x 26mm. The max measures for international MAIL are: 380 x 265 x 32 mm. My plan is to select a package that fit this size to reduce transport cost.  FEEDBACKFurther feedback on this project is highly appreciated.",https://www.kickstarter.com/projects/kheek/origemu-worlds-lightest-brain-game?ref=discovery_category_newest,kheek/origemu-worlds-lightest-brain-game,"During a rainy holiday my daughter lost one of the pieces of her brain game. She got really grumpy because of it. I said: ""create your own mind game."" Present on the table were only some sheets of paper and a pricking needle, but it was enough to set off our creative journey. We folded the paper in 16 small squares, and made 3 or 4 holes in each of those. The goal of the game is to fold the sheet of paper into one little square with the given color and hole combination for both the front and backside.After ourholidays we were still thrilled about our game. However, the level of difficulty was not suitable for all of the family members. On top of that, the paper began to tear.Synthetic PaperI stumbled across an amazing material called Tyvek®. Tyvek® is polytene non-woven fabric with high density made through a special process known as flash distillation using 100% recoverable material. Since its invention in 1950s, due to its unique waterproofness and vapor permeability, extremely high strength, excellent durability and chemical resistance, Tyvek® has been widely applied to the fields including medical protection (such as operation clothing, packages for medical purpose, protective clothing, etc.), military (such as military maps) and civil service (such as construction, car covers, clothing, envelope, etc.).The following hurdle was to cut Tyvek in the right format. It lead to my introduction to a Fab Lab. Using a laser cutter in the lab, the first synthetic folding paper with perforated holes and folding lines was created.The result was amazing: a very strong folding 'paper' with sharply-cut folding lines and holes in in the squares. Small holes were added at the folding line crossings for improved ease of folding.The gameplay is straightforward and shown in the video below.The most challenging part was the development of an algorithm to determine all possible foldable combinations. I had to look into folding theory and recursive programming. After that, we made a website to present a 'folding challenge' (one of the many possible combinations) at random.The video below shows how to set the timer, turn the sound effects on and off, and showcases a feature for even more fun: 'guess the color'. In this mode, one of the colors is hidden at first (displayed as white) and appearing when all time is up.See the video below for an example game where I played in 'guess the color' (Russian roulette) mode with two of my sons.'Ori' means 'folding' and 'gēmu' means 'game' in Japanese. Limited Premium Tyvek® EditionWe will send you a unique brain game that consists of a durable Tyvek® folding sheet and free access to the Origemu web-based app (no download required).Familiy Fun EditionSet of four (4) folding sheets based on ultrathin plastic (see picture) and free access to the Origemu web-based app.","Are there any risks?No, the Tyvek sheets and app are ready. Do you have further plans with Origemu?Depends on the success of this kickstarter initiative. I think the game can be a premium give-away for company's, because the folding paper and the app can be branded. I had the oppurtunity to give away and play Origemu during an event of the company I work for. It was very cool to play the game with an audience of 50 people after telling the story of my creative journey."

It is very well begun, but in need of serious fundraisers. This initial round will get the financial ball rolling and get our operatic production crew operating full-time.Listen to Recordings Already MadeRead the SynopsisWatch WIP Videos and AnimaticsView Concept Art and Still ImagesConcept/3D ImagesINTRODUCTIONThe momentum of this production stems from my passion as a composer of music but specifically and most importantly my passion of opera. Unfortunately, opera is a struggling art form, slowly losing interest in the wake of modern day entertainment mediums. K’ai is positioned to change this decline, by combining this exuberant style of storytelling with a rich, subtly complex and musically diverse orchestral score and exceptional wonders of the human voice, with the overwhelming popularity of computer animation, which has entertained us all in these fast moving times.Those familiar with opera understand that the story told does not necessarily need to be in the listeners native speaking language. When done right, the musicals and visuals express the experiences of the characters via an almost surreal medium, which can trigger inner emotions, most often untouchable by other forms of entertainment.In the story of K’ai, there is an unspeakable and unthinkable reality of life that is discovered in the dreamworld, a spirit world in a sense, that has been kept from the a slave race for centuries. This unique revelation is soon understood by the protagonist, K'ai, and propels the opera through numerous experiences and crescendos toward the true meaning of the word and of freedom.PROJECT NEEDThe story and music are nearly complete, and in all encompass approximately 6 hours of music, voice and 3D Animation. Once complete it will be released on DVD as a series of chapters, each one telling a portion of the story.Up until this point, the entire project has been completely staffed by volunteers and myself working as time allows to continue with this vision of reviving the art of opera to the modern audience.In order to bring this vision to life, we need additional team members, computer and motion-capture equipment, a marketing team and many other critical and important ingredients to establish a full time production team to complete it.The primary focus and campaign of this Kickstarter project is to establish a first round of fund raising for the following needs.CONTRACT A PROFESSIONAL FUNDRAISER (whom we have already found) whose goal will be to bring in the two million dollars we will need to complete the entire project.CONTRACT ARTISTS to continue the conceptual design and 3D construction processes required to create more than 30 characters, 45 scenes and other artwork required for the visual presentation.PROVIDING INITIAL INCOME to composer and project coordinator Richard deCosta in order that he may devote and focus the entirety of his time and energy on the project from this point to completion.Our initial KickStarter goal amount is a mere fraction of our total needs, but it will allow us to pursue larger funding sources, and will enable us to gauge the level of support we're likely to see in the future. We would love to see this round go way beyond our initial goal!STUDIO SUPPORT""The Maine Studios is honored to be involved with the K'ai project. This is a new and groundbreaking endeavor that has the potential to breathe a much deserved new life into the world of opera. I hope that others will see the tremendous potential of Mr. DeCosta's vision.""John E SeymoreStudio Executive The Maine Studios(All design and production will take place at The Maine Studios.)TECHNICAL NOTESWe are using real-time computer graphics engines to create the animations in K'ai (a process known as Machinima). This not only adds a degree of interactivity on our part but also reduces the cost of rendering to less than less than 1% of standard animation. This, combined with facial and full body motion capture is what what will allow us to create 6-hours of animation at such a low cost, yet produce such a high quality output.TECHNICAL SPECSThe project and vision has been underway part time for several years with the help of volunteers as previously mentioned. To realize the completion of this monumental undertaking, we need people like you to help, donate what you can and to be part of this unique and ground breaking project.Thank you for your contribution and helping to revive the dying art form of opera and for helping us make this unique new work a reality.",,https://www.kickstarter.com/projects/richarddecosta/lazr-lures-laser-cut-fishing-lure-and-fly-kits?ref=discovery_category_newest,richarddecosta/lazr-lures-laser-cut-fishing-lure-and-fly-kits,"LAZ'R LURES (patent pending) are a fast, easy, and highly rewarding way to get into the world of making fishing lures.

Our manufacturing process is so efficient that our lures can be a fraction of the cost of traditional lures! Imagine, six beautiful lures for less than $10!Assembling the prototype:Here is our first, streamer-inspired lure product line, with our lure's name, followed by the fly that inspired it:The Worry Wort (Warden's Worry)Your Sharona (Miss Sharon)The Mick Pocket (Mickey Finn)Casper's Beard (Grey Ghost)Ken's Winnebago (Kennebago Smelt)The Boss Man (Supervisor)Spectre Noir (Black Ghost)Mini Mud (Muddler Minnow)The Hobbit's Foot (Matuka)Here is the packaging for our very first official design, called the Worry Wort. The Worry Wort is a lure based on the Warden's Worry streamer fly, one of the most effective fish-catching flies I've ever used. Similarly, the rest of the flies in the first set of Laz'R Lures are inspired by time-proven streamer flies.We will initially offer 7 different lure designs, in 2 sizes each. Once funded, however, we will be continually adding to our line with new designs and ideas.Once the kit side of our company is established, we will also define a manufacturing process to mass produce fully assembled lures using the same templates as the kits.OUR DESIGNER:Our line of new lures will be designed by Edward Luterio, whose paintings have been on the covers of Fish Facts Magazine, Striped Bass magazine, many tackle and supply catalogs, and his how-to illustrations are published monthly in SaltWater Sportsman Magazine. His lure designs are second to none, and we are privileged to have him on our team.USE OF FUNDS:This is the first round of fundraising and will cover designing the lures, buying packaging and shipping supplies, lure kit raw materials (basswood, plywood, laserboard, hooks, etc.), and production costs for the first offering of 7 unique lure kits.Any funds raised over our goal will go toward producing even more designs and kits.At present most of Maine is in a transition period from open to frozen water. Once the lakes are more solid we will have footage of fish being caught with these lures. We look forward to sharing our passion for fishing with these unique lure kits!","The challenge for us is to produce kits using quality materials, that are not only fun to build, look great and last, and **actually catch fish**! As a  registered Maine Guide, I happen to know a great deal about what fish like and don't like, having spent decades fishing for them using every imaginable lure, fly and bait!We have an arrangement with a laser cutting manufacturing facility. Within their shop is everything needed to produce, package and ship hundreds of kits per month."

BASH was an idea developed years ago in our kitchen when we tossed together some burgers with random ingredients we thought of as we walked through our super market aisle. Well here we are years later and nothing has changed. Now we are ready to break free from our white collar jobs and go back to what we have loved for all of these years,  GOOD FOOD.  From our ole smokey burger topped with a house smoked pork shoulder, bacon and slaw, to our house cut garlic herb fries and wings, we pride ourselves of using the freshest ingredients, whether it is our fresh ground chuck steaks we ground in house to ensure the highest quality burger, or our fresh from the bakery buttery brioche buns.  Our goal to provide you the best burger you have ever eaten without having to break the bank to enjoy it.  We are just a few things shy of opening BASH early June and are excited to be bringing our love for food to our community. That is where you all come in Kickstarter.

Current ideas include aprons, T-Shirts, Sauces, Hats.Stage 3 - Cafe - The idea is to start a cafe, possibly in the center of Manchester to help feed homeless people. Customers would purchase cakes/coffee and eat/drink. they would then put a postit note on a wall. If someone couldn't afford food, they would then take a note from the wall as the previous person had already covered it. I would also like to use this idea to offer employment to people who would otherwise be overlooked by society.

Welcome to my Kickstarter page. I'm Ron, a multi-medium artist who needs your kind and generous support to help me in the creation of my design and concept for an imaginary new home of super hero's Batman & Superman. If you love the concept and want to see what it looks like completed, just give what you can towards the design & construction process of this new magnificent work of art. Let’s bring these two characters “together” as never before, living, working, protecting & socializing among the citizens of Gotham & Metropolis in this one of a kind urban megalopolis. Lets build this incredible city together where it naturallybelongs, within the boundaries of the New York/Jersey Quadstate Metropolitan Area.When fully funded lets over the next 18 to 24 months begin to experience & witness a historic design and building process that will take place in the creation of this city of over 50 million people including every nationality imaginable. Out of your love and curiosity for GothamMetropolis, come view and explore the slow creation processin the building of this magnificent online city. Come watch and learn from all of the hundreds of free videos that will be available to you of myself building thousands of individual building structures to populate this city . Watch as I try to figure out many things including the street grid, overall landscape, design and construction of the many different types of bridges that will connect various parts of the city together and so much more. Come learn & experience first hand what it takes to create one of the most complex pieces of digital engineering ever tempted. Feel free to come download & privately collect any part of GothamMetropolis you desire. For those of you art collectors who love Gotham City, the image below might be something you would like to add to your collection of art.It comes in 3 approximate sizes that are 24 by 72 inches, 36 by 108 inches &60 by 180 inchesImagine this 60 by 180 inch canvas on your wall. So far about half of the central business district of the borough of Gotham City is complete and available to view online in incredible 8K detailed resolution here at http://infinitypl.com/gothammetropolis . You can already explore, zoom in, download and collect any part of the city that is now completed. When project is fully funded and ready to go, only supporters will have access to the creation process. Use the side tool bar to expand to full screen and explore this massive work of art in maximum detail. For best viewing experience, look at GothamMetropolis on a 8K resolution computer monitoror TV. If you don’t have a 8K viewing screen just decrease your browser page size to 50 percent on a 4K viewing screen or to 25 percent on a 1920 HD viewing screen to see the full complete image all at once. When complete, GothamMetropolis will become one of, if not, the most complex digital art / canvas painting ever created to date. With an enormous single Photoshop image file of over 50 gigabytes, this massive work of art will be in a class by itself. Thousands of new building structures will have to be designed & built to fill in this thousand plus square mile east coast urban oasis. This work will require thousands upon thousands oflayered images resulting in an extraordinary amount of rendering time. This is where yourfinancial support comes in.GothamMetropolis was started with a standard computer which did the easiest work laying out the overall structure of the city. To continue and finish the work in a18 to 24 month time frame, a supercomputer is now needed to take over & handle the difficultdetailed work ahead. The video below shows a few minute sample of how slow the work process is with a standard computer. It takes nearly 2 hours just to upload GothamMetropolis to begin work. At these speeds you wouldn't want to watch any of the video's of me working on GothamMetropolis. The computer also crashes a lot because of the huge file sizes it has to work on, often over 100 gigabytes in size when layers are added.A super computer with several hundred times the power and speed of a standard computer is necessary. The images below are current prices & samples of the computerhardware & software needed to do the job. Your financial support will purchase these tools to complete GothamMetropolis in the time frame describedThe image of GothamMetropolis will include the combination of two 2 boroughs. These are the boroughs of Gotham City and Metropolis. The image below shows the dividing line between the two boroughs.The following image shows a map of GothamMetropolis at http://infinitypl.com/gothammetropolismap within the NewYork/Jersey Quadstate Metropolitan AreaMany of the famous landmarks associated with the comics will be included in the painting such as the statue of justiceGotham Tower West Gotham Tower EastWhen Gothamcityans are in the mood for entertainment, Advertising Square is the number one spot in the city to partyand check out shows as shown in videos below at infinitypl.com/8kGothamMetropolis will be constructed in a style I call consistent scale aerial view. Like your eyes and the visual perspective most landscape artist used to create a painting, you’ll find that the farther away an object is, the smaller and more blurry it becomes. In GothamMetropolis, everything is at a consistent scale and remains sharp & clear no matter the distance. This gives the viewing audience an opportunity to see the entire landscape clear, sharp and in the highest detail possible.If anyone wishes to ""freely donate"" a building structure to GothamMetropolis, you are welcome to do so, ""but"" (there is no financial compensation ""what so ever"" for doing so, ever) ""period""..... You must agree to give me absolute power to use and place your structure in GothamMetropolis as I chose and see fit. You will however become an important member of GothamMetropolis society and real estate developer in the city.Say for an example, If your name is John Doe or Trump and you want to design and create a building with your name on it to add to the GothamMetropolis skyline, you are welcome to do so. Once I receive your building, and ""if"" it is ""excepted"", it will be kept on file until I’m ready to add it to the city landscape. I will contact you by e-mail to let you know went and where your building will be located. Not everyone who submits structures to the project will be excepted. Likely it will be 1 out of 4 because too many were sent or it doesn't follow the guide lines perfectly. I will have to limit this invite to about 1000 building donations that I feel are OK for the project.

It “must be in 3 dimensional form” showing the front, sides and top of your building with the sides of your building at a 45 degree angle as shown in sample image below.Each floor height or building width must represent 10 feet per 30 pixels at 300 dpi. Your building “must be sent (only) as a PNG file on a transparency layer” so it can be removed later from the transparency and add to the city landscape. Your building has to be less than 20 megs in size and can be no larger than 120 stories in height by 200 feet in width or 1000 feet in width by 5 stories in height. Limit is one building per person. I hope everyone doesn't send a 120 story skyscraper to try and stand out. Design something that is you, a place that you would really like to work & live in as a building owner and citizen of the city. I will do my best to help your building stand out over structures next to it. Remember, the most important thing is that you know where your building is in GothamMetropolis Even though your building would be only a tiny fraction of the city’s landscape, it would still be an important contribution to the overall project and highly appreciated. Then when ever you look at Gothammetropolis,you can feel good about the fact that you have an actual place you can look at and call home in this magnificent city of virtual reality. It interested, send your building donations to contactmeatxyz@gmail.com.When complete, GothamMetropolis will also be available on canvas as an original one of a kind painting in each of theapproximate following sizes. 60 by 140 inches, 72 by 170 inches, 84 by 190 inches, 120 by 280 inches, 144 by 320 inches, 192 by 440 inches500 by 1000 inchesat current real estate price values of $40 dollars per square inch.In the end, I hope all who visit this page will have the same desire to see Gothammetropolis get built as much as I do.

Your invited to come privately collect a rare special treat of photos & videos to add to your collection of magnificent art. There are perhaps only a few things in life you've seen more beautiful than a woman in the right outfit wearing a pair of stiletto high heel pumps. The power of the pump makes a woman stand taller, shows toe cleavage, elongate the legs, show a more prominent buttocks & thrush the breast forward helping her stand, pose & walk amazing beautiful.The image below shows the V-18 shoe ""perhaps the sexiest pumps ever made"". They were produced in China for onlya short period in time at http://www.orientvisual.com. Due to its pure mighty 7 inch arch, the V-18 was discontinued because its almost impossible to walk in, impractical to wear unless perhaps your a ballerina or worn by shoe models as a sexyposing prop in videos and photographs. This makes the shoe an extremely rare treat to find in public, videos or print. So any time you see a pair, you are looking at something extremely rare and truly special!!!The total support of all 1300+ subscribers at https://www.youtube.com/user/highheelchallenge are welcomed to help continue this journey to product the world's greatest collection of V-18 superpumps images. Without your support, this journey will soon come to an end. If your interesting in helping the collection continue with better, longer and higher quality content, the follow support numbers will produce the following collection results.Up to $1,499 in support is not enough and the collection ends,$1,500 in support will produce about 2 dozen new videos in standard HD quality & a few dozen photos .$5,000 in support will produce about 100 new videos in standard HD quality & 100 or more photos.$10,000 in support will allow an upgrade in camera/stabilization/video equipment, computer power and video edit software to produce about 150 videos in both HD & 4K quality plus 200 or more photos.$26,000 in support from most subscribers would produce at lease 365 HD & 4K videos during a year period with over 1000 photos.In the end just $20 dollars per subscriber takes us all on a year long photo/video collection adventure. Which type of collection is up to you. Which do you want............. End it,or go for the max.Sincerely,Artist/photographer/video producerR L",The only challenge I see is total equipment failure.

Douglas Jacobs, entitled Gethsemane: An Epic Poem About Us. The audio book was released on Amazon last November.The score was revisited earlier this year due to the favorable response it received from audio book listeners. The author, Mr. Jacobs, then had the good fortune of coming into contact with Bob Attiyeh, the founder and of Yarlung Records, and a widely respected producer of classical music. Mr. Attiyeh expressed a strong interest in the project based on the musical potential of score and, consequently, the idea of producing a new recording of Gethsemane as an album was born.Mr. Jacobs then discovered and recruited the talented Edward Hong to conduct the orchestra for this project. Mr. Hong isa graduate of the Colburn Conservatory of Music and is a masters candidate at the San Francisco Conservatory of Music in conducting.Together, he worked with Mr. Moya in revising the score for this project, and with Mr. Jacobs, he's working on assembling a new orchestra, Kontrapunktus XV, which iscomprised of 20 exceptionally talented musicians led by concertmaster, and violin virtuoso, Etienne Gara.At the present time, we are in need of financial assistance to see this dream realized given the costs of producing a quality album that truly has the potential in being cultural significant in the world of classical music with respect to new, Baroque music for the younger musical generations.","There are no risk to speak of in producing the album, especially if we hire the recording engineer that Mr. Attiyeh has recommended to us. Really, the financing is the only major concern we have to ensure that musicians are paid, and that the production costs (studio, mixing, etc.) are covered.Once the album is produced, the risk will then come by way of getting a record label to distribute the album.  Mr. Attiyeh does have an interest in distributing the album, but won't make any guarantees until he listens to the final cut of the album.If he does choose to pick it up, Gethsemane will be distributed through a sister label to Yarlung, which he intends to launch later this year.  Like Yarlung, this label will be a domestic subsidiary for Naxos-a classical record label recognized as the largest in the world.  Therefore, the album will be distributed internationally.Otherwise, Gethsemane will need to be shopped to other distributors.  If it isn't taken by a major record label, the option would then be to distribute the album independently through Amazon.com and other Internet music sites.",https://www.kickstarter.com/projects/1224569591/kontrapunktus-music-video?ref=discovery_category_newest,1224569591/kontrapunktus-music-video,"Kontrapunktus (which means “Counterpoint” in Latin) is a new, young, and ethnically-diverse neo-baroque chamber orchestra that went into the studio this past summer to record original baroque music for their debut album, which will be coming out this January.

Becoming too large for a hobby and being required to license as a business before I am ready.Solution: Get all proper licenses and continue to drive forward and rely on my product and customer base to continue to drive my business forward.2.	Be required to get permits for my establishment when doing onsite jobs.Solution: Continue to research required permits and make an effort to ensure locations are picked that will benefit the business in a way that profits gains are hire that operating cost.3.	Not being able to produce items fast enough to meet customers’ needs.Solution: Enlist the help of my lovely wife and a few friends during peak times as I have in the past to ensure that deadlines are met and products are to quality standards. Large orders have been completed in the past, rough at times but always completed. Also if the situation presents itself I would consider hiring help.I am sure there are many more obstacles that I will encounter but they will all be met with a positive attitude and dealt with accordingly."
https://www.kickstarter.com/projects/1291517799/the-elbow-drop?ref=discovery_category_newest,1291517799/the-elbow-drop,"Here's the section where we get to tell you all about our project, and we hope you like what you will read. The origins of The Elbow Drop could be traced back to 2010 when Co-Owners Vito and Larry were spending a weekend at the Jersey shore with Larry's brother Mikey and Vito's cousin Bob. They were sitting in Vito's car heading back to New York when they started discussing everything and anything that interested all four of them. This eventually led to heated discussions about ""who would defeat whom"" in various fights, from Qui-Gon Jin vs. Wolverine to George Washington vs. President Snow. Larry pulled out a notebook and decided to write down every fight that was mentioned. By the end of the ride, they had well over 250 ""epic fights"" that they were discussing compiling into a book.Once back in New York, Vito and Larry met up with mutual friend Richie and discussed the epic fights of the car ride with him. The three men brainstormed and decided it would be a great idea to take those fights and make them a part of something even greater. This is where the short lived ""Man Cave"" was born. The idea was to create a website that would encompass all things of interest to the average guy. Everything was going well until they discovered the ""man cave"" domain name was up for sale for upwards of $600,000. Being that none of these guys were Mr. McMahon himself, the website seemed unattainable, and all work for the website was indefinitely put on hold. However, the conversations never stopped and the ""epic fights"" list continued to grow. Circa April 2014, the idea was brought back to life when Vito and Larry decided to look into creating a podcast centered around previewing and reviewing professional wrestling shows from the views of well-educated fans. As time passed, the idea for the ""man cave"" came back into their minds and hearts. They realized that the name doesn't make the website — the content does. So they moved forward looking for the perfect name to represent their interests. This spark brought Richie, Mikey, Bobby, Keith, Fernando, and Nick into the fold, and ""The Elbow Drop"" was born.That is the true and honest back story that chronicles how we came to where we are now. Our purpose is for each of us to contribute something special to this website — something our readers and listeners can follow, watch grow, and be a part of. While each of us have similar interests, we all have differing opinions. We have officially purchased the domain name and have begun working on the website as of August 11, 2014. Our team has been working on articles that will interest, entice, excite, and, most of all, entertain you. So why did we come to Kickstarter? We need your support! Plain and simple, this project can't take off without your help. As you can hear in the podcast, the sound is low-quality, and we had no means of creating a video for you guys to enjoy. With that being said, we are looking to raise enough money to purchase the items we need to bring this thing to the next level in every way. We are looking to purchase a decent computer that we can record our podcasts on. In addition to that, we need:We also want to make sure we have some pretty kick-ass gifts for our supporters. We all agree that any monetary donations not directly used to fund this project will go toward other Kickstarter projects. We hope that we will be able to give other dreamers an opportunity to turn their dreams into a reality. We are firm believers of giving back to those who help us. Our website will cover just about anything and everything that would interest the average guy. We want to be your headquarters for:We are a bunch of extremely passionate, well-educated and articulate gents that feel like we have a lot to share with you guys, and we want you to be a part of this as well. As promised in our podcast, we will post the emails for co-owners Larry and Vito. These emails will change once the site is live but these are the ones we will be using until then:Feel free to shoot us a message if you have any questions, comments, or concerns about anything at all. Even if you don't plan on pledging any money, we want to hear from you. Sincerely, thank all of you for taking the time to listen to our Kickstarter podcast right on this page and for taking the time to read how we came to be and what we're all about. We look forward to bringing you some more entertainment in the near future.Thanks Guys,Vito, Larry, Richie, Mikey, Bobby, Keith, Fernando, and Nick!","We will probably encounter numerous challenges along the way. We are confident that our material will keep listeners and readers entertained, but the hardest part will be obtaining an audience in the first place. We plan to use word-of-mouth advertising for this project, and with your support, I am sure this will merely be a bump in the road for The Elbow Drop!",https://www.kickstarter.com/projects/1291517799/theelbowdropcom?ref=discovery_category_newest,1291517799/theelbowdropcom,"Thanks for checking out The Elbow Drop here at Kickstarter.com. First and foremost, we appreciate you taking out the time to check out our video and we hope you learned a little bit about us. Our motto is, ""We are here to drop the elbow on all things sports and entertainment."" That pretty much sums up what we do. We are a bunch of passionate, well-researched fans of all forms of entertainment, including;You watched our video, so we won't make the reading part too long for you guys. We love what we do, and we hope that all of you passionate fans out there enjoy it as well. We came to Kickstarter for two reasons: exposure and funding. We want to bring you the best quality entertainment that we possibly can, so we we need a better camera. The video quality, as you saw, was not optimal, but it was the only way we could post a decent video on the site. We were able to save enough to buy something slightly more decent, but decent won't cut it when it comes to our audience. We would like to purchase a high quality camera, so when you take the time to watch one of our podcasts or skits, you get the best quality possible. You, as fans, deserve that. We recently purchased high quality sound recording equipment along with two very good microphones. This is why the audio sounds so crisp in the video. We would like to purchase a few additional microphones so we are not limited to 2-person podcasts. Stuff really gets good and funny when there are three or more of us going on at a time. We would also like to purchase better video editing software and possibly a second laptop if funds allow, but it is not at the top of our list.It's pretty simple. We want to entertain, if you'll allow us. We want to create articles, podcasts, and videos that will excite, entice, and entertain you. And we want you to be a part of it as much as we are. For you passionate fans out there, you know there is nothing better than discussing your passion with someone who shares the same feeling. We want to interact with you guys on every level to create a truly remarkable experience for all those involved. We aren't asking for much, just your support and some spare change if you are willing to part with it. Give us a chance and we will continue to drop the elbow for a long time to come.*Note: When we shot this video, we we're not sure of how much our goal was going to be, so the line about a 500 dollar pledge is now defunct. Check out our rewards to see what pledge can lead to you being a guest on The Elbow Drop Podcast!If you would like to find us or contact us, here is the info we promised in the video.TheElbowDrop.comFacebook - https://www.facebook.com/pages/The-Elbow-Drop/746657665397500Youtube - https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCr9owcu1KDZEKozpNMPWefwInstagram - The_Elbow_DropEmail - theelbowdrop7@gmail.comDon Vito's Email - elbowdropvito@gmail.comThe Birdman's Email - elbowdroplarry@gmail.com","Right now, the website is under construction. A few of our members tried their hand at creating the perfect look and feel for the website, but ultimately, we were never satisfied with our work. We hired a professional web developer out of pocket to create an extraordinary web browsing experience for every visitor that makes their way to our site. Once he is finished, it will be a challenge for us to learn how to successfully post our content, but it is nothing that we cant handle. One of our own is also learning Photoshop to help enhance the experience for our audience. Once he masters it, he will pass down the knowledge to the rest of us. We are ready and excited to grow in new and challenging ways."

There are now a multitude of means to record and remember, to the extent of technological advancements, in the form of online journalling.We are now more at a stage of remembering the mode of recording used in the past.Well...One of the major forms of enhancement is artistic, and the elements that could be played around in a Coptic Stitch Journal include: the thread, papers, the front cover design (importantly), book closure and the binding pattern.I am Madhu Mohan, an entrepreneur who likes to learn any and every form of artisan skill, develop and produce products that utilise hand tools to the fullest and essentially enhance the word 'Handmade'!!Randomly browsing through a stationery shop, I landed in front of the wrapping paper section. A flow of thoughts.I remembered how during school days, books had to be covered (for some weird reason) and how my books were always covered with spare Christmas Wrapping Sheets. It was even pointed out, the fact that I used wrapping paper to wrap my books.Thinking about it, I thought that it's not a bad idea after all!! Wrapping papers aren't just Christmas themed. There are many themes. Various designs and varieties of wrapping paper, that the possibilities are endless.I was simultaneously learning about book binding, and blending it all together, I decided to make Coptic Stitch Journals, with the front covers utilising wrapping paper of various themes.I have a dedicated Etsy shop where I publish all my handmade works, including journals, jewellery and candles, where I embrace the process from ideation to development for every product. http://www.etsy.com/au/shop/hues000For this project, I am going to be making Coptic Stitch Journals, Vintage Collection and following this campaign, I would like to have a dedicated vintage collection within my Etsy shop.Vintage is many things and many colours. It refers to a time or period, when some item of quality was produced, and reflects the value it has adorned over time.A selection of wrapping papers that cherish that quality of vintage in them, will be used to produce the front covers of these coptic stitch journals, along with the thread and back covers matching the palette!!The below mood board gives a feel of what Vintage is and some of the colours and themes that the covers of the Vintage Collection Journals would have.The first reward is a miniature coptic stitch journal attached to a keyring and is $15 AUD.The miniature journal measures 4cm x 5cm and has 144 80gsm white pages. These serve a cute gift and also as a quick little note taker!!The A5 Coptic Stitch Journal plus the Calico Journal Sleeve is $35 AUD.The A5 Journal has 192 110gsm white pages. This serves as a fantastic art sketchbook or as a medium for you to jot down your thoughts and stories, carrying a story itself!!There is a pack of 2 option, with 2 x A5 Journals plus Journal Sleeves for $60 AUD, with 192 110gsm white pages each!!The learner package comes with a Coptic Stitch Binding Step-by-Step Instruction booklet, along with a A5 Binding Material Pack and an A4 Binding Material Pack. With this you can learn and produce your very own Coptic Stitch Journals (the front cover material will be randomly chosen for you from the vintage collection wrapping paper lot), with 192 110gsm white pages each!!The Lot: Limited Edition, packs all the rewards together, and is kickstarter exclusive, with a miniature journal keyring, 1 x A5 coptic journal, 1 x A4 Coptic Stitch Journal, 2 x Journal Sleeves (a name or any text of your choice will be printed on the sleeves), 1 x Coptic Stitch Binding Instruction Booklet and 1 x A5 Binding Material Pack. All papers will be 110gsm white.With all thoughts, ideas and moments worthy of collection and remembering, collecting them in one of these handmade perfections, would count carrying both history and memory in one!!All these prices and packages are exclusive to kickstarter and rewards would be made and delivered within May 2020 if all goes well :)","With my interest and experience in making handmade products and making them to perfection, I seek satisfaction from people who receive my products beyond anything else. Regarding shipping, the price ranges from $8-$15 for within Australia and all domestic shipping (within Australia) will be made via Australia Post, without tracking and signature on delivery. International shipping (everywhere else) ranges from $13-$30 and will be posted via Australia post Standard economic air, with tracking and no signature on delivery.

Its an accidental font, that came about via some bored sketching, while brainstorming for a brand designing project. But once I started expanding on the design, creating all the alphabets in line with the design, I wanted to bring it to digital life.And so, it was put together after lots of sketching on paper, defining boundaries and designing...I am not a type designer by profession and this is my first font project, but I like learning and designing...If this font is successfully funded, the plan is to:- Launch the Official Tea Decoction Website (Dec 2020)- Publish the font on the Tea Decoction Website (Dec 2020)- Send out all the rewards to my wonderful contributors (Dec 2020)- Publish this font on Monotype, with Tea Decoction already being an approved Foundry- Start the work for the next font :)Tea Decoction is a platform, founded by me, where the focus is on designs of various sorts. UI Design Templates, Typography, Branding, Game Designing and many more, all being published for purchase, written about and documented about in one space.While the development of the official website is happening on one side, this project aims to bring about this particular font for creative use by fellow creators and designers.The font files will be provided for download as both otf and ttf filesThe glyphs of the font set include both Regular and Bold:abcdefghijklmnopqrstuvwxyzABCDEFGHIJKLMNOPQRSTUVWXYZ1234567890!@#$%^&*[].,The difference in the license is as follows:- The personal license is for anything that you develop independently and without direct commercial intent- The commercial license allows usage of the font for all types of communication materials that you would use for a business, including logos, business cards, websites, banner ads, etc. (Gaming, App and Web Usage all fall under commercial license)*There are no restrictions on the number of users that can use this font. Since you love it, you can have it all :DWhile there are going to be digital versions of the rewards available as well, the pleasure of holding a product, made using the font is definitely next level, and so we are going to be printing and sending physical copies of the rewards as well.Although, to keep it more eco-friendly, the physical rewards will be printed in recycled paper!The font Specimen Booklet:As, this is the first font of Tea Decoction, following this Kickstarter Campaign, the contributors names' will be listed in the booklet and published on the Official Tea Decoction Website and you will be getting a copy too (digital or physical copy).Limited Edition Typography Poster:You will receive a poster printed in A2, only available on (Kickstarter) that speaks the character of the font and the glyphs represented in various sizes. Have Fun!Postcards:Sketched by hands and digitized, you will be receiving the postcard designs inspired from the MatchSticks font.A design project may have many components that bring it to life, including art work, photos, information, arrangement and fonts.It takes some browsing through and mixing and matching to find the right assets that suits a particular design project.I would like to bring about this font, created by me, under the font foundry Tea Decoction, to designers and creative thinkers out there, who's design might be complimented by this font.Thank you!Madhu MohanTea Decoction","Currently I am working on expanding the glyph set to have more characters. If this project is backed successfully, there may be stretch goals for production of the extra glyphs. And of course, the rewards would then include those extras as well. In any case:- Campaign Ends November- Extra Glyphs (Nov - Dec)- Rewards Shipped (Dec 2020)"

It's a good start! I will also be using some of my savings to cover the restoration, but this Kickstarter is designed to supplement the cost!My name is Anders Muskens, and I am a young, emerging professional fortepiano and harpsichord player from Canada living in the Netherlands. I specialize on bringing music from the 1700's and 1800's to life on instruments used in the period - which are extremely different from modern ones!I graduated from the Royal Conservatory of The Hague, and I am now just beginning my international music career across Europe and North America!You can learn more about me at andersmuskens.com! Among my qualifications, I was chosen as an Artist in Residence on solo fortepiano and harpsichord at the National Music Centre in Calgary, Canada, and I played solo programmes and with ensemble in the Utrecht Early Music Festival Fabulous Fringe, the London International Exhibition of Early Music, the MAfestival Brugge (BE), the Laus Polyphoniae Festival Antwerp, the Geelvinck Fortepiano Museum in Zutphen (NL), and the Wahrenbrücker Graun-Festtage (DE).I recently acquired a very special piano - a John Broadwood & Sons grand pianoforte built in London in the year 1806! It's in fantastic condition, but requires some restoration to get it to 100% This is exactly a type of piano famous Classical composers Joseph Haydn, Ludwig van Beethoven, and Muzio Clementi were familiar with and wrote for.I am asking for support to help cover the cost of restoration, which will be done by Paul Kobald in Amsterdam. Once the instrument is ready, I'll be able to use it in many concerts and recordings, and I'm super grateful for the assistance!In order to reward the backers of the campaign, I will record a professional album based around Therese Jansen - a pianist famous in London in the 1790's for which Haydn and Clementi dedicated many fantastic works! She would've known exactly this type of instrument, and it will be extremely nice to bring this special sound back to life as a fascinating window to the past!I would like to record the following tracks (all works dedicated to Therese):You can hear me playing part of the Clementi sonata on a smaller, more domestic square piano from Longman & Broderip c. 1787, also restored by Paul Kobald in Amsterdam!","We expect there to be no unforeseen problems in the restoration process, but there is a possibility that complications could occur, due to the fragile nature and age of the instrument in question. But the chances of this are fairly low, as Paul Kobald is a seasoned restorer who has been involved in numerous restorations.",https://www.kickstarter.com/projects/andersmuskens/world-premiere-of-jc-bachs-1767-opera-seria-carattaco?ref=discovery_category_newest,andersmuskens/world-premiere-of-jc-bachs-1767-opera-seria-carattaco,"My name is Anders Muskens, and I am writing on behalf of my ensemble Das Neue Mannheimer Orchester. We're a young, emerging early music ensemble based in The Hague, Netherlands, and this is our first giant project!We propose to record Johann Christian Bach’s 1767 opera seria Carattaco on 14 February 2020 in The Hague, Netherlands in an historically-informed performance with period instruments. This early Classical opera has never been revived or recorded, but is richly orchestrated and full of quality music. We will release this opera for the first time on CD and digital platforms.So far, we have received support from SENA to get the recording started. We started this KickSatarter to raise some additional funds from pre-orders to help improve the quality of the recording.Das Neue Mannheimer Orchester is a young professional ensemble with a mission to bring galant, Classical, and early Romantic repertoire; especially that of the Mannheim School of composers, which is often neglected, back to life with historical performance. There is still so much un-revived music which deserves to be heard and we would love to make that happen. The ensemble is made up of students and recent graduates from Den Haag and Amsterdam who all specifically specialized in early music study. The group was founded by Anders Muskens in late 2016, and he is the artistic director and leader of the ensemble. We have performed numerous concerts in the Netherlands and Germany and have played in the Utrecht Early Music Festival Fringe. A contingent of the ensemble won the „Hofkapelle Elbe-Elster“ für das Jahr 2019 prize at the „Gebrüder Graun Prize“ 2018 in Bad Liebenwerda, DE. For more information about the ensemble, please visit dnmo.nlThe CD will have the following cast: Teomanzio: Yuh-ichi Sakai (bass) Carattaco: Noëlle Drost (soprano) Cassibilane: Jole de Baerdemaeker (soprano) Trinobantia: Josefin Bölz (soprano) Cartismanuda: Natalia Pérez (soprano) Pratusago: Felipe Carlos (tenor) Guideria: Tinka Pypker (soprano) Publio Ostorio: Heleen Bongenaar (soprano) Marco Ostorio: Chris Postuma (tenor) Claudio Cesare: Natalia Pérez (soprano)Carattaco is a 1767 opera seria by Johann Christian Bach about the Roman conquest of Britain in the 1st century A.D. The work is in three acts, and is about 3 hours long, and it has never been fully revived in modern times, unlike most of the other operas by J.C. Bach. Among one of the main themes of the opera is the virtue and rhetoric of Caratacus, a Silurian King who is betrayed and defeated by the Romans yet is pardoned by Claudius Caesar for his eminent virtue and loyalty to his people.The opera was premiered on 14 February 1767 at the King’s Theatre in the Hay-Market. It was received extremely warmly by the public, and a contemporary newspaper reviewer wrote: ""the masterly Stile of the Music, and particularly the Grandeur of the Chorusses, makes it to be wished that Signor Bach may meet with further Encouragement, as his Genius and Judgment corrupted Taste of our modern Music, and, like a second Handel, again seem admirably calculated to reform the present restore that Elegance and Perfection we have for some time been Strangers to.”The opera is scored for 2 flutes, 2 oboes, 2 clarinets, 2 bassoons, 2 horns, strings, and basso continuo.In the Netherlands, there is no question that we love Johann Sebastian Bach. There is no doubt that he definitely passed down his gift to his youngest son Johann Christian Bach. Unlike any other member of the Bach family, he would move to Italy, become Catholic, and would distinguish himself as a composer of opera. He would be hired as Master of Musick to Queen Charlotte of Great Britain, and he would establish himself in London. From here, he developed the most fame of any member of the Bach family at the time, gaining international acclaim across Europe and even the American colonies. He was commissioned to write opera in Mannheim and Paris, and also wrote symphonies, concerti, and chamber works; many of which were published and widely distributed. Mozart was one of his greatest admirers, writing “I love him from my heart, and esteem him.”1. To bring a fresh approach to the approach of Classical opera through historically-informed performance research and application.2. To revive a forgotten work of great quality for a modern audience.3. To make a powerful moving performance based on our understanding of 18th century rhetorical and aesthetic principles.4. To develop the skills, prowess, and profile of the ensemble, and to pave the way for future professional engagements.","Because we have already gotten some resources from other sources to do this recording, there is fairly low risk in supporting this campaign."

Plenty in time for the holidays!Thanks for looking!","The challenge of sculpting hot glass is that I must keep the liquid glass evenly hot and spinning inside the flame for the entire time I am working on it.  Spinning inside the flame helps with even heating and creates centrifugal force that steadies the liquid marble against gravity, keeping it from flopping under its own weight and trying to get to the floor.     Marbles with this much detail must be intricately crafted, and yet completed- start to finish- in one continuous sitting.  The larger the marble, the more challenging the process becomes as I try to keep an increasingly larger (and heavier) mass of liquid glass spinning hot, working to finish the inside details quickly before the overall centrifugal force starts mixing them together.        Since I will be making all the rewards by hand, I have limited the total numbers available to what I can accomplish with a reasonable production schedule over the next couple of months; this will minimize the risk of delays in production and delivery."

We are a group of free developers and want to create this kind of an APP! But we need your help! We needmoney to buy licenses and servers to make this happen. The usage and the Client Software will be freeon all supported systems. All Supporters will be given a big thanks and even get some awesome presents! What is “Voice Net”? “Voice Net” is a software, which will allow you to communicate (call) a device which is also using “VoiceNet”. It will be possible to call more than one system at once (group call) and also you can call a mobiledevice from a desktop system and otherwise.What Systems will support “Voice Net”? We have the goal to make “Voice Net” possible on the following systems:- Microsoft Windows XP Sp3 up to Windows 10 (Desktop)- Linux with KDE and Mono (Desktop)- Mac OSX (Desktop)- Android 4.0++ (Mobile Phone)- IOS 6 up to IOS 8 (Mobile Phone)How does “Voice Net” work? “Voice Net” will work this way: At the first start of the client, the client will connect to the targeted server. There the client will be checked if he has already a number, if not he will get his own number from the server. Over this number the client/device will be reachable now (as long it’s connected to the internet/network). Now he can call others or can get called. When he calls now a number, the connected server will look in the database if the number is given and the System is online, if this is the case, the target device will be informed and the call will be prepared. In an active call it is possible to let other systems join to the call (group call). The App will only need a network so there is no need for a Sim-card.How can “Voice Net” be used for a company? There are many ways to use Voice Net in a company. The biggest reason to use Voice Net in your company could be summarized as the following: - Self-hosted network on own controlled Servers (required owning of the server software) - Call-numbers can be created by yourself with the length of 1 up to 1000 and that for every user - Multiplatform support where you can call every user at a desktop-system or mobile phone who is in your network - all Calls are crypt, secured and cannot be spy out - a single Voice Net Server can handle up to 3000 users at once - easy usage and very low costsWhat do I get if I help you making this possible? Well this depends on how much you want to support us. Here is a little overview, what we will give you as sign of our thanks:","Well, everything has his own risks and we have it here too.The risk is, that we don't reach the goal and can't buy the server, wich we would need to host the public server. If this would happen, this would be the worse for us.You would of course get for what you have donated for. We will try to bring the software to a level where you should be happy with.

This IDE includes a Database who contains all Batch-Commands from XP up to Win 10 and can present them all with their syntax and description.The „CMD-Geek“ is currently in private development and is in need of support to cover the costs of Licenses, Development and Software-Support.Batch-Script is a way to do things on Windows-Systems fast und very easy. But always to search for the right commands or getting some syntax-error can be frustrated. So we want to build an IDE wich has a Command-Database to search for the needed command and a wizzard-function where you can build your needed command without any typo's or the wrong syntax.We also offer you a DVD with some Video Tutorials where you can see how script with batch and become a master batch scripter. And this is also a very easy way to start developing.At Release (end of Development) the CMD-Geek will include the following features:- Batch-Command-Database with over 1016 - Commands    Script-Pather for a better overview of the script-code - Command-Wizard, for the a easy way to create commands without any typo’s or syntax error‘s - Command-Search-Engine – No need to search for the needed command anymore. Just say what function you need and the CSE will deliver you the right command or sub-command. - Execution-Protocol – all executed commands will be recorded in the background to see a execution history, what commands had been executed in the active session - Result- Protocol – all shown outputs of the CMD will be redirected into the CMD-Geek and can easily be copied, overworked or in other was processed. - Direct CMD execution – Batch-Scripts don’t have to be saved at some place and the started. You can execute them directly in the CMD-Geek and see the results in it. - 4 Execution-Mods – the CMD-Geek includes 4 Execution-Mods who will make it possible to execute a Script internal (CMD-Geek), external (CMD), Silent (No Window) and remote on another system in the network - Search-Mask for script and Log - Script-Check Function – Batch-Scripts can be scanned for what system they are compatible and what commands has to be replaced for the target system - Dynamic Design – all Colors of the CMD-Geek can be replaced like you wish it - Update & Upgrade Interface - Script-Database - Support & Know-How ForumWe need money to cover the costs of needed Licenses for different Windows and Server Software wich we need to develop and test alle the Batch commands for a high quality batch-scripting on all systems.Sure, we have created a little preview version for you. The Version is only a sneak peak what the CMD-Geek can do when it will be finished. So some features has been disabled.You can get the Demo-Version over here:http://www.cmd-geek.net/Over the next Weeks we will eventually update the Demo-Version from time to time.","The Risk is that, when we don't reach our goal, we will not be capable of creating oll this features we want to put in and this would be very sad for everyone who uses batch."

You can get an idea of the direction I want to go with this project.,"For now, my biggest challenge will be simply getting the word out. But with your help, we can definitely make it happen!The market is saturated with beverage choices and with big players like Coca-Cola, Pepsi, and Red Bull, I will need to work harder to persuade customers to try out a new, less common beverage. My strongest selling point will be the health benefits. In a world where there is too many sugary drinks and unhealthy choices, customers will see my product as a refreshing alternative that they will feel good drinking and most importantly, giving to their kids. I will also market my product to small business owners so that they can sell. My target audience will be independent gas station & convenience store owners and small independent restaurant owners.Distribution: A product's success lies in it's availability to customers. Distributing the product will be another challenge for me. I must find a quality, reliable way to deliver the product while keeping the cost low. At first, I will be doing local deliveries in my city and will hire extra help as the business grows. There will also be the option of online sales in which I will facilitate the shipping and handling process on my own. Once the business truly takes off and branches out, I will definitely explore better delivery options!Price-setting: With all the choices out there for beverages I will need to set a price that is most affordable to customers while still being profitable for me. This involves getting the raw materials at the right price, packaging and bottling and distribution at the right prices. To get the right price for my product, I will conduct research, seeing the price of competitive products and closely meeting that price based on production and material costs.",https://www.kickstarter.com/projects/aunaturel/grayorchidcom-redefining-penny-auctions?ref=discovery_category_newest,aunaturel/grayorchidcom-redefining-penny-auctions,"Hello, and thanks for visiting my page!I have came up for a brilliant idea for a new kind of penny auction startup site: grayorchid.com!Gray Orchid is an auction site where people will place bids on deeply discounted items and win them for a fraction of their retail price. Now, there are other sites out there that are similar (Quibids, Dealdash, etc) but this will NOT be your ordinary penny auction site.  My site will address all the complaints and concerns that plague those other sites. The biggest complaints I hear about those is that you will pay for your bids and waste your money not winning the auctions from the bids you bought. Some of those site will even charge a signup fee! Here's how my site will be different (and better):My goal is to revolutionize the penny auction industry to make it fun and FAIR! Get peace of mind knowing that your money will go towards winning an auction. Less risk and more reward!I will be truly grateful to get funding for my new startup idea. My goal is to get my project fully funded by February and have a site built and ready for beta testing by spring 2018.Also, those who donate will get exclusive access to GrayOrchid! Check out the different rewards for your donation!What will the funds be used for?","Risk and challenges will be minor but able to overcome. Some challenges that I may encounter creating this project are:Low profit margins - Initial profit margins will be low for the first year due to lack of users. This is typical of any new startup. Once the word gets out and users start joining and participating, profits will increase.Competition - There are already site that are established and well known. GrayOrchid will seek to find a niche i the market that will set it apart from the other sites making it more unique and favorable.Advertising - Although many people are intrigued and curious about new things, there are still those who are weary and cautious. A good advertising and marketing strategy will win over these new cautious customers giving them the comfort and confidence to try something new. I will use various social media platforms and web advertising to achieve these goals.Industry reputation - A few bad apples ruined the reputation of penny auction sites. Many people complaint about huge fees, hidden costs, and bots to inflate bidding prices to make users bid higher. GrayOrchid will  be completely transparent with its practices, offering lower fees, upfront pricing, and real-user bidding with no bots whatsoever."

Eat, Sleep and Work isn't working out for him anymore, but it takes more than a dream to make a change, it takes courage.In addition to creating all of the sets, characters and special effects I will also be working, in collaboration with Essence Identity, a local Indie band to create the soundtrack for the film.","Although I am only asking for $1500 that is only part of what I need to complete this film.

Now, I think there is a profound difference between Work and Employment. Employment can only be a tool to survive, but the pricethat one pays, often, is a far greater price than one can pay materially: it is a price paid with time given to someone else's wealth.The Work is an expression of oneself, of what one is and of what one is able to do, it is a realization of oneself.

Cooking is a daily experience and you don't need to be a star chef.I am separated with two children, I had to learn to cook for my children in the days they spent with me.What did I learn to cook? That I have always seen prepared by my mother, by my grandmother .. with the ingredients and methods of the land tradition in which I live and where I grew up.And I started with the simplest things: a plate of pasta, a dressing, a side dish.Italian cuisine is perhaps not the best cuisine in the world. There are equally valid and widespread and good traditions that you can remember .. Chinese cuisine, Indian cuisine, Arabic cuisine, French cuisine ..But there are at least two things that make Italian cuisine special: the first is the extraordinary variety of raw materials and ingredients, the second is the simplicity of making recipes.Italy is a geographically fortunate country.It is a Mediterranean country ... like Greece, Albania, Croatia ... like France, Spain, Algeria, Tunisia ... Turkey ... But Italy is literally immersed in the Mediterranean and this has allowed that an extraordinary biodiversity can be found on the territory. Different lands, many animal species, plant species of incredible diversity ... all gathered along a narrow strip of land.This richness can be found directly in the kitchen: extreme diversity in the quality of cereals, incredible variety of vegetables and vegetables .. the pastures provide different nutrients even moving a few kilometers, so the milk and the cheeses produced will be different as well as the meat of the bred cattle.Combined with this, Italian cuisine provides a library full of recipes: many ingredients and millions of ways to put them together. This is a historical richness, mainly due to the customs and needs of the many populations lived on the Italian territory since the end of the Roman Empire.There are seven notes in music. But the way to combine these seven notes led to extraordinary melodies. Italian cuisine is a piano with thousands of keys and we can decide ... whether to put together four chords and spend an evening in company around the fire, or watch the symphony played by an extraordinary orchestra.I often found myself eating in non-Italian restaurants. There is the fashion of eating ""ethnic"" or ""exotic"" and everyone sooner or later try to enter an Indian or Japanese restaurant.Entering a Japanese restaurant, I realized that the cooks and staff were Chinese. I read ""traditional Chinese / Japanese cuisine"".How can Chinese and Japanese traditions be put on the same plate?If I go to a Japanese restaurant in Italy, am I sure I will eat Japanese cuisine?In Germany some of my friends, for hospitality, took me to an Italian restaurant in Berlin. It was Horrible!Are you sure you eat Italian when you are in an Italian restaurant in your neighborhood or in your city? This restaurant, perhaps, opened 70 years ago ... and the recipes certainly had a very strong bond with the aromas and flavors of a distant land. But now 70 years have passed! Does the restaurant owner still have a strong connection with the land of his father or grandfather? And what about the ingredients? Is the cheese really Parmesan? Is extra virgin olive oil used?And then, the last question: would you be able to go home and prepare a plate of pasta? ... for you, for your wife or husband, for your children?It is the same question I asked myself: despite the fact that I lived in Italy and grew up seeing my mother, my grandmother and my wife cooking ... would I be able to cook a plate of pasta for my children?Yes! Because it's simple .. and I want to share this experience with you!I raise funds to rent a camper and move around Italy. I want to collect special recipes typical of the tradition of the places visited. The project is to travel for a month and communicate the collected experiences by publishing a series of five e-books. A collection of simple but important recipes that can allow everyone to bring a bit of Italy to the table.","There are no special risks!In order to collect some data to complete e-books, I need to visit some places in Italy and collect the best recipes.

In fact, most off-set printers will require at least a minimum order of 50 posters and will charge up to $1,000 or more.So this is where you come in, Kickstarters. With a bulk order, each poster will cost significant less. If you find this roundtable design visually appealing and would like one of your own poster, please pledge to help fund this project.Each poster will be 27"" by 27"", offset-printed on 80-lb.

However, the rewards are set up so that I would ship certain number of posters each month in early 2014.  Whenever possible, it is my intention to fulfill each pledge as soon as possible.I created the Roundtable of Elements design using Adobe Illustrator.  The colors you see roughly mimics what I see on my monitor display.  However, despite setting the design as an CMYK print setting, there is a risk that the printed posters may not look as vibrant as view on the web (RGB setting).  I will work with the printer to minimize this risk as much as possible."
https://www.kickstarter.com/projects/740325275/baby?ref=discovery_category_newest,740325275/baby,"We're a group of aspiring filmmakers and actors looking to break into the industry with a short video.The short video will be extracted from a pilot script by Osian Andrew, rewritten by Osian and comedian Amy Webber.It will follow teenagers Amy & Xander, who meet each other again after 9 months on a blind date set up by their mutual friend. It becomes increasingly awkward when Amy reveals to Xander she's in fact pregnant with his child, a secret she wanted to keep from him.The pilot, which we intend on creating after showing this video to producers, will follow the two characters as they embark on an unexpected journey together, looking after their newborn whilst dealing with family, money & each other.","Risks are minimal in this production as we're meerly creating a two minute, one location video with only two actors and an already comitted crew.",https://www.kickstarter.com/projects/740325275/the-other-lady-short-film?ref=discovery_category_newest,740325275/the-other-lady-short-film,"'The Other Lady' follows a single character during the worst night of her life. A one woman show, Lady attempts to convince us the dead body in her bedsit isn't down to her. As she attempts to convince us, we begin to understand the past that led her to this moment in time and how an event years ago triggered an illness that has impacted her to this day. Playing with the themes of loneliness and distrust, 'The Other Lady' aims to grip the audiences on a mind-bending journey through a reality that isn't discussed.We intend on exposing the effect Borderline Personality Disorder has on a single human as well as impact they have on others. Around 4 million people suffer from BPD in America alone, despite this, BPD is rarely talked about, especially among people that don't suffer from nor understand it. Our way of explaining an issue that bothers or that has affected us is through story.We want to represent people with Borderline Personality Disorder in an accurate and fair way. We don't want to alienate anyone, we want to inform people of what BPD is and the impact it has on anyone with the illness. To do this, aside from specific online research, we interviewed Gemma, a woman with BPD. Watch a part of it below.Osian Andrew (Director, Writer)This will be Osian's second short film project. An actor with roles on upcoming film 'Ravers' & TV show 'Tourist Trap', he previously wrote and directed 'Poverty' which was his debut as a writer & director. He also co-starred in the film, proving he can multitask in all fields. This has given him an understanding of what it takes to be on both sides of the camera. Before acting, writing & directing, he shadowed award-winning director Sally Martin on 2018 film 'Jeeves' & worked as a Script Supervisor for the BBC & S4C. A right fit for this film, he has also written an original pilot script of a similar tone that Tribeca nominee Evan Ari Kelman praised.Joe Morley (Producer)An upcoming writer & director, Joe will be honing his outstanding producing skills on 'The Other Lady'. Good friends with Osian, he successfully exceeded his Kickstarter fundraiser on his upcoming short film '1940' in which he wrote & directed. He has a grand social media following of over 23,000 on a film-based Instagram account, meaning he'll use social media to successfully promote 'The Other Lady' to a wide range of film enthusiasts.Chris Crawford (Director of Photography, Editor)Chris & Osian met on a trainee scheme for budding filmmakers. They kept in touch for a while until Osian asked Chris to join him as a DOP on 'Poverty'. A great creative team, they continue to collaborate great ideas for film. Chris aspires to be a DOP, though Osian insists he becomes a Director someday. As well as serving as a DOP, Chris will also edit and colour the film during post-production.Dan Norris ('A Camera' Operator)Dan & Osian met while working on 'Jeeves'. Osian was taken away by Dan's ability to adapt under pressure while heading a B unit as well as his general understanding of camera technology. Dan is the perfect fit for the job as Osian has worked with him on 2 short film shoots and has a great reputation as a photographer & cameraman across different platforms around South Wales.Eve Marie-Parry will serve as Make Up Designer. After being nominated for the Manchester Make Up Award 2018 she'll be the perfect fit for 'The Other Lady'.Osian's mentor Sally Martin has volunteered time away from directing and starring in her upcoming charity-based musical to be the 1st Assistant Director. Osian believes Sally will be able to adhere to the crew's needs while Osian, Chris & Dan are focusing solely on the overall look of the film on the day(s) of production.We need £1,500 as we believe this is enough for us to tell the story we so desperately want to tell. Although some short films ask for as much as £10,000, we're only shooting in one location with a crew of not many.Costume HireIt will cost around £100 to hire or purchase 2 dresses for 'Lady' to wear. These dresses will have to be bold statement pieces as they will define inner character of our protagonist. The dresses will have to be made to fit our lead artist when casting is complete, having to be comfortable enough for the artist to remain in the clothes for a long period of time as well as move into several positions as per the script.TalentThe crew are so dedicated to the story that they're happy to work for a bare minimum wage. As their profiles prove, they are experienced and dedicated individuals with a range of abilities that will suit 'The Other Lady'. They are also different and new, giving our film the opportunity to stand out from the rest.Equipment HireOur crew already have adequate filming equipment, however, a radio microphone will help the sound team out in wide shots, as well as 2 large monitors so that Osian our Director and Chris our DOP can study each shot carefully, ensuring they meet the standard of the script and the goal of the film.Production DesignA lot of work will go into the production design. We will look at how the set and props will impact the look of the film, while comparing costume pieces with the look of the film. We will seek professional help from Georgia Griffiths who works with magazines and their visual looks when it comes to photography. We want our Director and DOP to be as relaxed as possible on the day, without having to worry too much about how the set could impact the film poorly.Set ConstructionBecause production design is essential and specific on this film, we will likely build a set with the help of a local carpenter, Ioan Lewis, who has experience in multiple fields of construction. Ioan has the capability to tile, decorate and build using various and professionally sourced materials. However, we will first look at filming in a genuine location if possible, meaning our money will go to location hire as opposed to construction. If we have money left over from a hire, we will add those funds to the festival submission pool, meaning we can submit to a wider range of film festivals internationally.Festival SubmissionsWe will look to submit to multiple film festivals around the UK, entering at least 10 festivals. Festival submissions for our category averages around £25, meaning we will have a fair chance of being nominated in certain categories, and hopefully, winning an award or two. We will use Withoutabox by Amazon to submit to recognised and verified festivals.CateringBecause our days will likely be at least 12 hours long and our crew working for a bare minimum, we will want to provide hot meals as breakfast and lunch as well as snacks and drinks throughout the day. We will source these from local businesses that are willing to help out with our catering needs during filming.4K'The Other Lady' will be shot entirely in 4K with Andy Wain's ultra modern Sony Alpha. We also have access to Dan Norris's Panasonic camera & lenses that are all 4K compatible. 4K means we will be eligible for more independent film submission contests as well as having an overall improved look on screen.Our CrewWe have a crew that have a range of different abilities with the same intended goal, creating outstanding and compelling content. It is a preference of ours to have a small crew as opposed to a 100+ head crew, meaning we can work in a more relaxed environment, having only to worry about the look of the film.Our StoryThe story sets us aside more than anything. BPD is well-known but is rarely talked about, especially on film. With stars like Pete Davidson expressing their struggle with BPD, it seems the perfect time to create a story about BPD and it's impact on people. This will be our opportunity to create a film that has a story in which is truly compelling.","Our biggest issue is a location. If we do manage to find a real life location, there may be tenants living in the property and filming times may be thwarted. Alternatively, building a set will be expensive & time consuming, but with knowledgable carpenter Ioan Lewis available to help, it is easily done.Our second challenge will be working a filming schedule. Although we have a dedicated crew, they are very in-demand and therefore more difficult to work a schedule around. However, they're happy to make time & in their experiences August is a quieter time for work in the industry and will likely be free."
https://www.kickstarter.com/projects/elenichols/cohorts-a-radio-theatre-20-podcast?ref=discovery_category_newest,elenichols/cohorts-a-radio-theatre-20-podcast,"My name is Ele Nichols and I am an artist and a writer. A year ago, I created a character named Bailey Barker who is also known by his more popular alias, The Bowler. He's a British gentleman, with a hint of a Mr. Rogers type attitude towards life. He was born into wealth, but he isn't smug or arrogant. He is very much down to Earth, except for one very important feature; He always wears a mask across his face. No one knows what he looks like underneath that dark shroud. At first appearance, you can't help but feel dread over what threat he might pose. Shortly after though, you realize this man doesn't have the ability to hurt a fly. Even sooner, you begin to forget this well dressed man is even wearing a mask at all. It becomes crystal clear; the mask is his face and you see whatever you want to see.If you think that's all that is interesting about him, then you thought wrong. Bowler is a genius in many respects, but his ability to solve complex crimes are unmatched by any living or dead. While his methods are unknown, Bowler can unravel a crime before it happens. Many have labelled him a psychic, a fraud or even guilty of committing the crimes himself. The truth is though, he is none of these. He is a forecaster looking at the world and he sees the storms are coming.Bailey has made a lot of enemies in his short time of putting away the worlds most evil and vile creatures to ever crawl out of a hole. To protect him is a young woman named Eliza ""Dimes"" Dixon. Hired by The Agency, to whom they both work for, her job is to protect Barker and to take care of any dirty work that may arise. Eliza has a complicated history and emerged from the criminal fraternity. She had a very successful criminal career until her world came shattering down and she lost everything. For a short time, she's been trying to make terms with the past and find a way to move on with her life. She reluctantly accepted the position as Bowler's bodyguard. She thought it would possibly help make up for the mistakes of her youth. While she has no idea where the future is going, she knows for the mean time that she is staying exactly where she is. She's new to this world though and has no idea what she's in for. Her fighting skills and her deadly precession with sharp objects will be useful.Their first assignment together is one for the record books. They have to save a woman from a serial killer at a certain address on an exact date. The problem is they don't know which woman their looking for, there is no proof that this serial killer is even real, the address they have doesn't exist and they don't know what time of day the crime is supposed to be committed. To make matters worse, they only have 3 days to get to the bottom of this or the blood of this victim could be on their hands.To overcome these challenges, they will have to work together and push themselves beyond their limitations. It's a fight against time, doubt and disbelief. Not to mention that death and danger are always on the menu. This epic story will presented as a Radio Theatre 2.0 Podcast. Why Radio Theatre? I believe radio theatre is the perfect medium for this story. I want to take an old idea and revolutionize it for a modern audience. Sound engineering has come a long way since the golden age or radio theatre. We have the ability to create a rich and fully textured world through an audio environment. This will allow the listener to imagine a world that they are apart of, putting them in the middle of the action.While I will continue creating my artwork that will accompany every show, those images will help the audience picture these characters in greater depth than I could ever possibly present in a movie form. Also, there is a great love that still exists for radio theatre, but there are no serious productions being produced today. I want to change that. It's an ambitious effort, but one I and my team are full committed to seeing through.Why a podcast? Many listeners are not tuning into radios anymore. Podcasting is modern broadcasting. Currently in the U.S., there are over 21 million active podcast listeners and that number is continually growing in massive quantities. The goal is to introduce a produced, high quality theatrical production for free to the podcast community. In time when the audience grows, we will be able to offset any additional costs through sponsorship and donations. This will allow us to freely distribute this show to anyone who wants to listen. The immediate need though for this project is to gather funding so we can create the best production possible. That's where we need your help.The story and the preparation is finished, what we need now is to build proper studio space to record our voice actors and to hire a professional music composer to score the show. We have already found the appropriate equipment and individuals for the job, now we need to pay for them. We're looking for a minimum of $5000 which will let us begin to get the production in motion. We've already been selling t-shirts and artwork to help us with the cost of the show, but now we are asking you if you will help us with our vision. If were are able to raise this money, we can begin production by late November for an early 2012 release. If we receive more, we will expand the project and continue to produce more stories.So far my friends and myself have invested everything we can to this project. We really want to make this happen and we will produce this show no matter what. To make it what we want it to be though, we just need your support to help us reach our budget.Thank you for taking the time to read about this project. If you make any donation, you have our eternal gratitude for helping us make our dream into a reality.

Long story short, I came up empty.I wondered why it was so hard to make a cool Wonder Woman tee, and not just for teen girls and young adult women, I mean everyone. I guess the consumer and marketing teams figured this was the only demographic worth producing products for.After talking to other fans consisting of men, women, gender-fluid, and non-binary individuals, they were having the same problem. Even when you managed to find one, it was usually not what you really wanted and felt uncomfortable to wear.So not to be deterred, I made my own, well two actually. I'm an artist with 10 years in my current artistic path. who runs an online store called Eluded.ltd. I make things I like, such as pins, t-shirts, art prints, and other items.Like many small businesses though, 2020 has hit me hard and made it very difficult to continue doing what I love. This has also been a long year waiting for this film, though fortunately we get to see it streaming on Christmas Day.Back to Wonder Woman. It's not okay that we can get plenty of the male super heroes in a variety of artwork, styles, cuts and products, but we can even get a decent t-shirt for Wonder Woman. I'm here to give one, well two actually.The artwork is my own original work, designed as a black and white sketch, with an impact of color. I tried to bring out the best features of her, demonstrating her strength, bravery, and determination, while also keeping that sense of compassion she always emanates.All tees are printed to Canvas brand garments, using high quality plastisol inks.Art prints will be screen printed on 18x12 inches on art stock heavy duty paper.","I've worked with the Screen Print company before on dozens of occasions. They're reliable and clear about any delays or problems, but all my past projects have gone smoothly. I actually aim to ship all the orders earlier, probably late December to early January, but the extra time is to ensure we can beat those deadlines."

In much  of the developing world, goat milk is the primary milk source for humans. Goat milk is often sought for its perceived health benefits and unique taste, a number of health effects have been attributed to consuming goat milk. Goat milk is similar in composition to cow milk, but some important differences exist in the protein structure. Because of these differences, people who have allergies to cow milk can often drink goat milk, and the fat globules in goat's milk stay in suspension longer, which leads to the perception of ""natural homogenization."" Goats are good browsers and allowing them to consume plants containing aromatic or flavor compounds can impart the smell or flavor to the milk or cheese, thus providing an opportunity to generate unique specialty products.It’s also naturally homogenized, which makes it easier to digest.In 2014, the nation’s dairy herd grew 2 percent from the previous year, and producers reported a 15 percent increase in sales, The Associated Press reports.Daily operations/management and sales will be run by Judd and Michelle Cummings.

It is not strictly for entertainment, it is to build understanding. Our goal is to raise awareness and shine light on difficult life situations that are hard to talk about and often leave people thinking they are all alone. Every season will deal with a different topic such as domestic violence, losing a loved one, school shootings, what it is really like to be transgender (what struggles trans men and women go through while they are trying to find their true selves) and much more. Everyone who will be involved with this project will be thoroughly researching each topic to insure we bring the most realistic results to this project because that is what we want. We are also hoping that even though it is hard to talk about, people who have gone through these challenging situations will step out and talk to us about their experiences. We are hoping to eventually be able to use this series as a fundraiser to help train emotional support animals, but any of the money you donate here on Kickstarter will go to filming expenses such as cameras or sound equipment to hopefully make your experience better. All actors, actresses and crew work for free. Although work is probably not the right word for it because it makes us happy to be able to spread awareness in this unique way!

I also want to mention that this will be our first big project, but we will give it our all!",I think the biggest challenge that comes with completing this film project would be portraying each of these situations correctly. While writing and filming each episode we are going to have to walk a mile in someone else's shoes. I think we will be able to overcome this challenge by talking to people who have actually gone through this event in their life and letting them help us understand how it impacted them.

On top of that they will have a greater chance to be adopted as they can wander freely and capture the hearts of the coffee drinkers around them! Profit from the coffee and treats we will be selling will go towards taking care of the cats. I set it at $1500, but if we can raise more than that thatd be great! Looking forward to going forward with the project with you guys!",I think the biggest challenge for us will be rescuing cats. It will definitely be a mission to rescue cats because a lot of the time they will be scared and not want to be handled. we will have to come up with a plan each and every time. I do plan on getting the community involved and having at least one day out of the week where we search for cats in need.
https://www.kickstarter.com/projects/qibots/opensource-educational-swarm-robots?ref=discovery_category_newest,qibots/opensource-educational-swarm-robots,"What Is E-Bot ?E-bot is short for educational robots. It is a simple programmable robot that wirelessly connects and controls from any android device, E-Bot is Arduino based that uses an app for control and learning. The goal of E-Bot is to achieve a level of stimulation for our users who are interested in science, technology, engineering and mathematics. E-Bots stand for communication, learning and fun!What's Included In E-Bot ?Hi! Kickstarter, We Need Your Help And Here's Why:)Ever wanted a robot but couldn't afford it because they seemed too expensive.The OpenSource educational swarm robot is a project that will make well researched and highly developed robots cheaper and more affordable at the lowest possible prices. The programmable robots can be built from surrounding objects found in an average home using arduino, mod kit micro and babuino wireless micro-controllers with ported user interface design onto an android smartphone device for wireless control and programming. Mostly the behavior of the programmable robot will be determined off the android device with Scratch and StarLogo programming languages.Our vision of the project is to have educational robots available to users in every home, workplace, educational institution, worship centres worldwide by 2020. To address the silent epidemic but ever soaring drop-out rates in science, technology, engineering and mathematics programs because colleges and universities have become too boring for students and young teens because the world around them is accelerating technologically at a faster rate than the four-walls of the institution, there should be a balance and this should retain students in school when faced with challenges that may seem appealing but instead are detrimental to the future of education. The robot will help in areas that the targeted user is lacking such as aiding in mathematical proficiency for aspiring engineering users, but who go into college and find out they should have had a stronger mathematical background before enrolling for engineering school. The robot will teach and educate the user long before they become engineers to prepare them through fun and interactive means of learning in core mathematics curriculum.Help Students like KevinOne reason for this is, there was once a student; Kevin who aspired to study engineering at the university level, but had foregone core advanced mathematics during high school when he enrolled into college, Kevin struggled all through the term trying to reach the cut-off score to be admitted into the university to study engineering, Kevin never made it into the university to study engineering but later switched to a different degree program. However, the major problem was that he lacked the mathematical proficiency to survive in college, this is what the robot will face, it'll will ground the user from basic to complex mathematical skills to suit the users preference to build the user from ground up, it'll monitor and enhance the user's progress in these technical areas by using fun and interactive ways that will appeal to the user more than ever before and increase the user's learning experience. HOW IT WORKSThe Open-Source educational Robot tends to the the problems of mathematical proficiency, coding basics and engineering principlesThe programmable robot or etoy as a means to explore mathematics. Research has proven that programmable robots can instill mathematical interest in young kids from ages four to eight years old.The idea is to entice users from a tender age to cultivate the love for a subject such as mathematics. To achieve this goal mathematical packages will be programmed into the robot to demonstrate in real-time. These subjects will be chosen to create value in the user's learning experience in areas such as shapes, geometry and trigonometry. As a result, the robot will be able to demonstrate simple geometric shapes that the user can program into the robot.The use of educational programming languages which have a simple and visual programming effect on the user such as Scratch and StarLogo visual programming languages will be used to develop basic programming principles in the user which will be ported onto the android device so that users can program the behaviour of the robot with these simple tools.Simple machines and basic mechanics will be the subject of choice, the subject will be taught in physical and visual forms using the combination of the robot and the software program so that the user gets a realistic application of the concept being described.The programmable robot will also serve as a companion that connects with peers who have the same robot so a robot social network online community easily accessible from any computer communication device allows the users to have fun and extend communication between other to exchange information and increase each others learning progress through peer-to-peer collaboration as the robots evolves with the user.We have a clear cut vision with a concise mission and for the first time programmable robots are being used to imbibe education and none of these can be achieved without your help to reach our goal. PLEASE KICKSTARTER!! help us fund our campaign successfully. And together we can shape the future of robotics and education as we grow the number of interest in educational development using programmable robots and etoys.How The Money Will Be SpentThank You.","The OpenSource Educational Swarm Robot has no risk involved in developing the project.The only risk might be delays from licensing, intellectual property infringement and policy laws. Before embarking on this project these criterias may put up challenges but will in no way harm the production of the robots. With the help of our backers community all necessary funds to cover these challenges will be expected to be met to bring about speedy fruition of the project and fulfill our vision. The ultimate challenge is to make mathematical, coding and engineering principles fun, interactive and more engaging to the users by improving the learning process with educational robots",https://www.kickstarter.com/projects/qibots/qibots-fun-and-educational-arduino-robots-for-45?ref=discovery_category_newest,qibots/qibots-fun-and-educational-arduino-robots-for-45,"Very grateful to Kickstarter to launch this project to develop and create QiBots arduino open-source robot prototype and hope that backers can contribute to this project because they want to support a project about robotics, educational toys, coding, mathematics, art and inspire everyone to have access to low-cost robots which can be built upon with functionalities beyond their imagination. I have always seen robots as amazing programmable tools but too expensive to own which was what motivated me to build one to suit my 'pleasure' and to do far exceeding more things as an educational aid than what I would have spent 400-1000 USD on. Hence, QiBots was the to fill that creative void and now everyone will be able to have access to it for $45 and build upon it too. Because if we're to see further it'll be by standing on the shoulders of giants and backers too.What Are QiBOTS ?Qibots pronounces as Chi robots or chi bots. The word 'chi' symbolizes 'life force' or 'energy', in some beliefs 'Chi' means Supreme being or supreme life force in every existing creature. Hence, QiBots are robots that will bring liveliness to an environment be it in education or entertainment once a prototype is built. Backers should understand that they are contributing to a project that is still at the development stage but that contribution backers make to bring the prototype to life will be one that will make good quality, researched and highly developed robots low-cost, cheaper and more affordable at the lowest possible prices. The Qi-Bots programmable robots will be built with customized PCB circuitry and wooden objects found in an average home combined with open-source Arduino programmable micro-controllers. Sixteen years ago robots for entertainment and educational purposes cost from $400 - $2500 now with the power to create and innovate robots with better functions can be affordable at prices lower than $50. In today's world a robot the quality of QiBots would cost close to $450 that's not all, because robots are such remarkable tools, I believe they should be ubiquitous and should be found in every home to educate, entertain and whatever work they are made to do but how is that vision to be accomplished if robots like QiBots are not low-cost and easily accessible. How is such a feat feasible, is it possible? Can a robot with the same power and functionality as an AiBo or Lego Mindstorms really be low-cost ? Yes, it's feasible because we have the technology and it is possible because again we have the technology as predicated by Moore's law. As a result, the reason Qibots was invented and once the prototype is complete by reaching the funding goal, the QiBots will be made affordable from 10% of it's current market value of $450 to $45. QiBots Are:LOW COSTLow cost open-source robots that will have wide range of functions including line following, obstacle avoidance, drawing and a host of fun learning Artificial Intelligence software packages to thrill and edutain with Qibots etoys. Because, we believe robots that aid education should be for everyone and not just the ELITE CLASS. Hence, QiBots educational robots have the same capabilities if not more than with other expensive robots in the mainstream market which are only available in Elite schools and homes but QiBots cost a lot less and will be available to everyone to be affordable to students even in remote educational institutions and homes if funded successfully.EDUCATIONAL, SIMPLE TO CODE AND FUN FOR EVERYONE Learn. Code. Play. Repeat w/ QiBotsWith the open-source Arduino IDE, ArduBlock graphical programming language can be embedded onto the IDE or created as an app controller. Kids or people who have never coded before and professionals can create simple codes that are executed immediately allow the user to imagine 'sketches' and see them come to life. The application embedded in the QiBot will allow the user to learn by doing what they imagine. And because the QiBot is very engaging you get to learn how to code, play with your code and do it all over again with a new code.QiBots will also be an Open-Source educational Robot fully loaded with functions and interactive software that emphasizes on the problems of mathematical proficiency, coding basics and engineering principles which makes it a great low-cost tool for young students, robotics projects for schools. Mathematical ProficiencyQiBots can be a programmable robot or etoy as a means to explore basic mathematics using basic geometry, art and coding; one example is by coding and drawing basic shapes. Research has proven that programmable robots can instill mathematical interest in young kids from ages four to eight years old.The idea is to entice users from a tender age to cultivate the love for a subject such as mathematics. To achieve this goal mathematical packages will be programmed into the robot to demonstrate in real-time. These subjects will be chosen to create value in the user's learning experience in areas such as shapes, geometry and trigonometry. As a result, the robot will be able to demonstrate simple geometric shapes that the user can program into the robot. Coding PracticesThe use of educational interactive programming languages with fully enhaNced IDE which have a simple and visual programming effect on the user such as ArduBlock and Logo visual programming languages will be used to develop basic programming principles for the user    Basic EngineeringQiBots will be able to demonstrate the principle of simple machines and basic mechanics, the subject will be taught in physical and visual forms using the combination of the robot and the software program so that the user gets a realistic application of the concept being demonstrated.Great For Classroom And Competition Robotics Activities    Great for young inventors to engage into robotics activities to have fun and learn by doing coding and engineering activities. A good educational tool to immerse anyone into competitions and summer campsConnectivityA Sneak peek feature of QiBots after the prototypes are made to our backers who contribute to the programmable robot is that QiBots will also serve as a companion that connects with peers who have the same robot, so a robot social network online community, via bluetooth or Wi-Fi which is easily accessible from any computer communication device.MANUFACTURED TO MECHANICALLY ELECTRIFY THE FUNFrom solderless breadboard testing to schematics to PCB design and manufacture. The QiBot motor/servo controller will be customized to make assembly easy for you so you don't have to face all the rigorous wiring that can ruin the board or fry the circuits.This is why the internal hardware like a proposed H-Bridge motor shield will be fabricated w/ a desktop CNC machine tool to reduce cost and for good quality for easy connection and control of the QiBot which is based on an open-source Arduino microcontroller.Note: Arduino powered L293D w/ SN754410 motor drive shield design and manufacture features may vary from the picture below. The Arduino Uno controller functions as the control unit for QiBots. All Arduino Uno microcontrollers are based on the Atmel AtMega168 microchip that stores codes to control QiBot, it is QiBots brain.EASY TO PUT TOGETHERWith no soldering required, the upgraded QiBot prototype will require screwings and clips while the control board can be plugged and programmed to play. Each hardware part will be tested and developed with 3D CADD design software, Fritzing, MATLAB and SimuLink simulation while Desktop CNC machine tools can fabricate final designs.3 Stages QiBots project will run -Time-lineCost Of Building The QiBots Prototype:- Desktop CNC machine tool for Robot Hardware - $1,000- Hardware Materials for QiBot Prototype - $200- Software development - $300- Kickstarter fee includedTotal = $1,500","As a prototype the risk are moderate, due to various testing and development of the prototype. At the moment we are currently in need to fabricate shields using suitable PCB designs tailored for QiBot's functions and remote controllers. In addition, since this is an overseas mobility project an international bank account is used as a stationary account, some locations embargo shipped products so shipping rewards from these embargoed locations could be delayed. As a result, the solution to this challenge would be to ship rewards from unembargoed regions. However, this will not affect the rewards of ours backers should this project meet completion stage."

Well the time has come to do something about it. Through this project I would like to achieve my financial goal. Before I can take this to the next level I have to make sure that I have my professional labels in place, grinding and sealing equipment in place. The packaging is just as important as to what is in the package.","Challenges that I may face would be that I may need to to hire assembly workers.

Pull a barstool up to the island and enjoy some appies while I share my story with you.     I first started training as a chef in the early 90's and a few years later I found myself married with a family on the way. Although my culinary pursuits were continuing, I made the difficult decision to adopt a more balanced career for the benefit of my growing family.     In 2001, I suffered a work related accident which left me partially disabled.  I had to make the difficult decision to choose a new career in a sedentary role.  My goal in life was always to return too the culinary industry once my kids were older. While that dream will never fully be realized, I cannot let the chef in me go. I continue to enjoy cooking for family and friends, but miss the fast pace of working in hotels and high end restaurants! I have worked with some amazing chefs from around the world, and the one lesson I'll never forget is to always season your foods with the highest quality ingredients.     I have always enjoyed creating and sharing spice blends & recipes with others and it's now time to start sharing them with the world.  In 2014 Simply Delish was born and I get to continue with my passion of creating unique spice blends using top quality ingredients.    With this campaign, my goal is to purchase my  grinding & sealing equipment so that I can  process and package larger orders to sell in retail outlets.I hope that some of my enthusiasm can encourage and inspire others. Ultimately, I want to show that Simply Delish foods can be just that!Kickstarter is not only a great platform to launch a startup, but it's also allowing us to grow our company with projects like this. Every pledge counts, so does every share. Please share our project with your friends and family...They'll thank you later.","There always risk and challenges with any business. Creating a consistent product ins't easy as it seems, but we try our hardest. For example, every spice that goes into our spice blends can vary based on the time of year, the harvest, location, drying methods etc."

I am located in Cambridge Ontario and I am the owner/artist of Rusted studioz. I have created this Kickstarter page to raise funds to get my home business up and running again as the past year I have been off dealing with personal health issues. As well as revamp the pieces I can produce by investing in new products.I have found a new paint that is going to allow me to expand into other products than shoes, it is wearable, crack resistant, waterproof and can be used on a large variety of items. I set a goal of 2000 to purchase all new paints, brushes, printer ink or possibly a whole new printer all together, and invest in the future of Rusted studioz to reach my goal of having a table at the 2020 fan expo in Toronto.For those of you who have not seen or used Kickstarter before it is a website that allows creative projects and small businesses to raise funds through donations and purchases also known as “backers”/ “rewards“. I have set up my rewards as a preorder for Christmas, ordering will be available for the next 60 days. Kickstarter is an all or nothing platform, so projects that do not reach their goal have to start their fundraising project over again and money is returned to backers. So sharing is caring ❤️The images I have included are from previous orders with a different paint, as well as some recent art work to demonstrate the sharpening of skills. The new products provided will have less imperfections as the new paint does not have to be layered as much as the previous paint I was using which sometimes caused a bumpy like surface. As well as my artistic talents have grown since last creating custom products.I want to thank each and every one of that you for your support especially those of you that have followed my progress since the beginning ❤️ And those of you just joining the journey now ❤️🤓I hope to hear from you and make your geeky 🤓 shoe, wallet, leather products and misc. dreams come true ❤️👠📱please keep in mind these preorders are intended for Christmas, as I need time to purchase new paints etc.Please order kids shoes a size or two up to ensure your youngins get the chance to enjoy their customs 🤓","A challenge in selling hand painted products based on consumers ideas is perception, artists work hard to make images appear as lifelike and as character like as possible. Sometimes characters don’t come out exactly as shown in images but is interpreted to the best of the ability of the artist portraying it.

Thank you for taking time to read my project. The reason why I started this project is because I would like to propose my collection ""Crazy Pictures of London"" in some exhibitions of design and art&craft which will take place in London in the next few months, where the entry fees are quite high. I am currently working on a handpainted set for breakfast and other home accessories, born from my love for the city. The collection is based on some small acrylic paintings I did, inspired by the city of London.I gave to the series the title of “Crazy Pictures of London” (because it’s a city I love much and I like the British humor: places, symbols, colours, signs). I thought to give a touch of Italian style to the English breakfast. In the gallery below you can see some samples from the collection. The set for breakfast ""Crazy Pictures of London"" is a work in progress! At the moment I made: teapots, coffee cups+plates, mugs for milk+plates, sugar bowls, cookie jars, wooden trays, napkin holders, hot pad hooks, breadsticks holders, cutting boards, bottle cups, coasters and so on. Plus magnets and pendant. Coming soon, other bigger ceramic pieces: trays with two handles, platters for sweets, trays for hard-boiled eggs, sauce boats for cream/chocolate/jam/sweets/fruit and so on! The amount of the crowfunding will be used to finish some more pieces, registration fees for the fairs, public insurance, costs to bring the ceramics with me to London, to print some flyers that will explain my breakfast set and things like that.Can the series be seen somewhere? Yes. First, you can see all the pictures on my website, as soon as the works are ready. Then, you can always visit my studio in Faenza, RA, Italy! You’re very welcome! So what now? Look on the right and choose your reward!Every donation will be much appreciated and reported on my website, Facebook and Twitter accounts (real name or nickname, as you prefer).

Try to plan it better. Use a google calendar for your tasks and add the add-on workplanner.This add-on combines the workload of your active google calendars with a google task calendar and calculates the total workload of the day and week (in day/week/month view)You can define your maximum workload & calendars in the settings screen:With this system you can easily drop tasks to another week and get immediately view on your workload coming weeks:The red color indicates that this week is already full...We looked to a lot of calendar & task systems (see workplanner.be), and decided that this simple and easy add-on in google calendar system can help a lot of people to avoid stress and bad planning.You are surprised that this is not existing yet? That was our surprise too !We compared a lot of systems and they are too complex (to add a task you have to click too much), can't drag and drop, or have no calendar functions or are too expensive. This is a one-time fee for this add on.","The global concept seems very simple, but we developed already a basic idea on workplanning and prototype (see workplanner.be). The idea to work on an existing platform and to create an add-on is not a big challenge for us and avoid that we have to setup a whole complex development.There is a challenge. Google Calendar API has some restrictions and perhaps we have to work with an extension or 'google gadget'. Another concept is to work with a workplanner toolbar that you install as extension that you always can make visible to see the workload per day & mark which task you are working on. The idea that you always have a clear view on the workload in several Google calendars should remain.",https://www.kickstarter.com/projects/1976027274/myworkplanner?ref=discovery_category_newest,1976027274/myworkplanner,"Not difficult.How many work do you really have next weeks.

Gaming and simulating makes learning much easier and more effective because of its practical, visualized and haptic experience for the participants. The best learning results are generated with games and simulation.As a developer and teacher of these types of educational games in schools and universities throughout Germany it was obvious that students had fun learning in this way. It was so effective that it spread to other schools and universities quickly - even outside Germany. The High School Business Simulation & Game is being developed specifically for High School students. Once this game is released to High Schools in the US it will enable and empower students to envision business, management and entrepreneurship in an exciting format.Business games have a long history as the time capsule of gaming exhibition at the 2014 ISAGA Conference shows (http://isaga2014.com/isaga2014/index.php/public-exhibition/gaming-artefact-gallery) . ISAGA is the International Simulation And Gaming Association. Today (serious) games are used in management assessment and training very effectively. Seminars with this teaching method though are very expensive and therefore are not open to a wide range of US-target groups who actually could benefit from participation very much. Our project will make this teaching method available to High Schools and their students at no extra charge.Everyone hesitates at first at the word ""game"" in an educational context and directly thinks about parlor games like ludo. Actually business games are based on the same concept: creating a replica of reality. Business games though have nothing in common with parlor games. They areParticipation is possible without any previous knowledge!Part 1 - SIMULATIONStudents learn moderated by a facilitator in an interactive setting by following given business transactions the basics onand experience practically by sliding the values of raw materials, occurring costs, etc. on the board that shows the different departments of the company until there is a finished product that can be sold to customers. Participants furthermore learn about the meaning and use of Economical terms while the whole group together with the facilitator evaluates what happened after each simulated half-year. Within an open discussion the teams search for room for improvement for their company’s processes to improve the results and profits within the next phase of the simulation. Participants will be provided with a manual that will be a guide and provides important content.Part 2 - GAMEWith a good understanding about Economical terms and the processes within the company students have to make their own business-related decisions and create a unique marketing mix. All the teams will act as competitors in this “classroom-market”. Depending on their marketing-mix teams will be granted orders in different amounts and the different strategies will be evaluated in the group. With this students experience how different strategies can affect their results. Every participant and the school will receive a Certificate of Participation!!!The development of the ""High School Business Simulation & Game"" started about three month ago. This is our to-do-list for the development of the whole game:1. Specification of the game2. Game content3. Prototype 4. ManufacturingMain goal of this project is to give High Schools the opportunity to use a business simulation as a teaching method at their school. Overall 3,000 students from up to 100 different schools will benefit from this project which would make it one of the most cost efficient education projects using a business simulation (comparable seminars would cost about $396,500 on average if you order them from a consulting firm - that is 2.4 times more than for this project).These other goals will be accomplished:The following table shows the costs that will occur for the rollout of the project for a minimum of 3,000 students (based on actual offers from external suppliers for e.g. production of manuals and the actual game parts, etc.).:IMPORTANT NOTE: I commit myself based on the calculation that the budget I am asking for will cover the costs for the mentioned minimum of 100 seminars. I will ask schools to meet the participation no. of 30 students per seminar so that we also can reach the goal of 3,000 participants. If after the 100 seminars there is still money left I will continue to facilitate seminars until the budget is completely spent. After the first 100 seminars are booked by schools I will provide a waiting list for schools which didn’t get a chance to get one of the first 100 spots on the list and let them know asap when more seminars can be conducted to setup a seminar date.Of course, right now I am just hoping that we will reach the minimum funding goal of $164,745 to make this project become reality. In the event that we as the crowdfunding community are able to collect even more money I came up with an extended funding goal:-EFG I: $280,000If we reach this EFG, I will manufacture 100 sets of the game (with a never-ending license that allows schools to facilitate seminars for their registered students at their school) for all schools who took part in the project by having a seminar facilitated at their school. Therefore a teacher's guide will be written and printed that allows teachers to use the game without any further training or need of hiring a trained facilitator. Manufacturing costs per game that comes in a box with all materials will be an estimated $1,150 per piece.-EFG II: $280,001+Just in case we reach even more than that I have some other ideas in mind for what we could rollout together as a community. Depending on the amount that will be available for further projects on this topic I will share those ideas with all backers and we will have a vote on which ideas should be put into reality. Of course, one of them will be to continue with facilitating seminars and providing the game including licenses free of charges to schools as long as funding is available.Over the years I have rolled out many similar projects in education like this in Europe, especially in Germany (read about it in the “About me” section). Those projects were very expensive due to high administration, personnel and development costs. So clearly the intention of this project is to keep all costs as low as possible while focusing on the main cause: making this efficient and energetic teaching method accessible to High Schools in the US.To me Kickstarter seems to be the perfect platform for this cause to give me the chance to focus on the things that matter which are: developing good content and manufacture an entertaining, hands-on game for students that will get them the perfect learning experience with lots of light bulb moments as well as to schedule seminars with applying schools free of charge because all of it will be funded with this crowdfunding campaign.Reward #1I will hula hoop for 1 minute for every $1,000 in $1-pledges, videotape it and make it accessible to backers on the projects' website.Reward #2Reward #3Reward #4Reward #5Reward #6Reward #7Reward #8 to #10See reward description #8, #9 & #10 for the additional rewards that are not viszualized here.","Low AwarnessEven though press releases will be published right after going online with the crowdfunding campaign and a marketing budget that will be spent for information to schools there is a chance that schools won't be aware of the project and therefore not all 100 seminars can be rolled out until June 15th, 2014 as planned. I don't see it as a problem to extend the roll out phase but I see it as a crutial aspect for success of the project that we make it happen. Teachers tell me they would love to have a project like this at their school. As a backer or a person who likes the project you are welcome to share the project and its website www.conamini.com on your social media accounts and every other way you can think of and don't forget to tell your teachers! Thank you in advance for spreading the word.Higher DemandOn the other hand there is a chance that demand from schools will be much higher (by experienced data form comparable projects in Germany I managed) than what we are able to handle with the budget and within the projects' rollout time. This could lead to unsatisfaction with schools who can't participate in the project. Therefore I will try to do my best to meet the demand in the following school year 2015/2016 and if no more funding is available offer those schools a seminar at the actual net costs (no profit margin will be added) so that even more schools can benefit from the project in the future.SchedulingIt will be a challenge to meet all the wishes of schools when to facilitate the seminar at their school. Of course, I will do my best to meet all requests but to be cost efficient I might need to bundle schools who are geographically close to each other within a specific week/month.",https://www.kickstarter.com/projects/2046074683/krauths-pastry?ref=discovery_category_newest,2046074683/krauths-pastry,"There are hunderds of thousands of Pastry Shops out there. So why have another one? That's what you're probably asking yourself, right!?The answer is pretty simple. Since I moved to Chicago (from Germany) this summer I am missing German bread, cakes, pastries and cookies. Everything tastes different here in the US. So my hobby of baking became like a weekly routine to have the same taste and smell in my house.After a little while friends and neighbors kept asking me if I could bake those goods for them, too. After only a few months living here I have so many requests that I thought I should make my hobby a business and see if more people are interested in my baking goods.The important thing for you to know is that all baked goods are made from scratch with ingredients imported all the way from Germany to make sure you get the same taste as if you are in Germany while you take a bite of one of my pastries. During my last AirBnB experience I hosted a couple of dinners. This is the review I got from the owner with who I lived for about two months after moving to the US: ""Together we hosted a couple of dinner parties where his homemade pastries were a big hit.""If you miss the German taste like me sometimes this is your place to get started and buy your German pastries. If you never tasted a German style cookie you should get started to try them here from a real German who has a baking experience of over 15 years.All rewards will be shipped via USPS Priority Mail 1-Day™ Small/Medium/Large Flat Rate Boxes to make sure that you receive your rewards all fresh and ready for a yummy experience. All baked goods are packed within bakery boxes or other suitable packaging.Well, first of all I need to invest in some more professional baking and kitchen equipment and of course I will need to purchase ingredients in Germany and have them shipped here to the US which also involves import taxes - believe me its worth it! Also there is need of a permit to run this kind of a business.If there is any money left I will bake goods for charity and provide them to people in need in the Chicago area. So you might wonder if this is suppossed to become a business. To be honest I first want to find out if a larger scale of people would be interested in my recipes and willing to buy them on a regular basis. If this project gets funded the answer would be: Of course I would make this a business. But let's take it one step at a time and let's all enjoy the yummy pastries I will make for you.So I set up a product line of baking goods that I have been baking with my own recipes. The following pictures show you the available products that will be freshly baked and delivered to you freshly. The products represent also the reward that you get as a backer depending on your pledge.You can chose from those characters: Lightning McQueen, Homer Simpson, Helly Kitty or Smurf. The Streusel Cake in Cookie format for a quick bite. Can be offered with frosting or chocolate icing.Send me a pic of your favorite cartoon character and you will receive one cookie either shapped like the character or on a square cookie. Either of course with frosting. Maximum size: 6"" x 6"".The Streusel Cake in Cookie format for a quick bite. Can be offered with frosting or chocolate icing, too.Very yummy! Fluffy sponge dough with frosting. Also available with Black & White Cookie Frosting.Small cookies (delicate prezel design) with partial chocolate icing or frosting. Approx. Size: 2-1/4"" x 1-1/2"". Medium cookies with partial chocolate icing or frosting or decorating sugar & egg yolk. Approx. Size: 2"" x 3"" depending on cookie cutter.Batch of large cookies. 12 pieces with partial chocolate icing or frosting or decorating sugar & egg yolk. Cookie Cutter Form: Gingerbread Boy.Plaited German Yeast Bun with lots of butter. Very fluffy. With decorating sugar on top or egg yolk or none at all.Sliced German Streusel Cake with a touch of cinnamon. Can be delivered with frosting or partial chocolate icing. You get half a dozen cookies with icing and an individually shaped cookie cutter (Maximum size: 6"" x 6""). Please send a picture of the shape you want.See description above for each product.Yummy different sized cookies with different kinds of frosting, icing and decorating sugar.You get 60 cookies with partial chocolate icing or frosting cutted with an individually shaped cookie cutter (Maximum size: 3.5"" x 4.5""). Branding: Maximum 2 lines with each maximum 18 letters. Please send a picture of the shape of your cookie cutter you want and where the branding should be placed on the cookie.","I make all pastries by hand in our small home kitchen. I've mastered the small scale production, and I'm excited to take on more orders. After funding this project I hope to launch the website krauths.com where hopefully I will be able to provide more fresh products for online purchase.One risk could be the import of the needed goods from Germany. Therfore I hold an associate's degree in international business management majoring in international trade. I have verified that all needed goods are allowed to import them into the United States. So basically the risk on this topic depends only on delivery time especially when the package  would get lost.I am looking forward to the challenge to produce all ordered goods in time and have them shipped by the end of February 2015."

It is incredibly versatile and can enhance a dish, as easily as it can stand on it's own as a side or garnish.Traditionally, Pesto is made with Green Basil, and pine nuts, although there are literally hundreds of variations, like Spinach Pesto, Artichoke Pesto, purple basil pesto, and even Asparagus Pesto. Pesto can be made with almost any nut, not just pine nuts. I've seen cashews, almonds, walnuts, pistachios, and even brazil nuts and macadamia nuts in pesto recipes!Another key pesto ingredient is Olive Oil. This alone can dramatically change the nature of a pesto, depending on if the oil is light, or extra virgin, and even if it's Spanish, Italian, or Israeli olive oil!I've made more than a few batches of pesto in my life, and loved every single one of them, but there are SO MANY more recipes I want to try!The purpose of this Kickstarter is to find and make as many different pesto recipes as I can, and then share all this delicious goodness with the world! Backers will have early access to recipes, and samples, with everything eventually destined for publication. I'll start with a website, and then, if interest is high enough, look into publishing everything into a book.My ingredients are of the utmost importance. I intend to only purchase the best quality oils, nuts, and other ingredients. ALL ingredients WILL be organic, and I will publish each source on the website. Fresh, organic ingredients can cost an arm and a leg. 100 percent of the proceeds from this Kickstarter will support this project.I'm going to document every recipe, every variation, provide video recipes, and downloadable recipes. Development on the site has started, and will be published when this Kickstarter gets funded. Filling the website with content will take some time, but for starters, I'll list all the Kickstarter backers, and then move on towards publishing the recipes, and posting videos.I can't edit the reward, as it has been chosen by some, but I just wanted to let everyone know that for the $50 reward, you can choose a single 6oz jar of pesto, OR your choice of FOUR 1.5oz jars. After the campaign is funded, surveys will be sent out to determine everyone's choices.T-shirts will be sourced by Printfection, and will be available in sizes from Small to 5XL. There are 30 colors available, and will be made available after the campaign ends.","Pesto is supposed to be a raw food. That will make it very difficult to ship.The plan is to pack the pesto in glass canning-grade jars. I will cover the pesto inside with a layer of olive oil, and pack the jars with a small quantity of dry ice cubes in a small padded box. Because of costs and regulatory issues, I can not ship internationally.",https://www.kickstarter.com/projects/1784858180/3d-printing-rare-auto-parts?ref=discovery_category_newest,1784858180/3d-printing-rare-auto-parts,"I'm an IT consultant, who loves staying up to date on the latest technology.3D printing has always fascinated me, and as printers are becoming more mainstream, there has been a veritable explosion of affordable 3D printer models, which means this exciting industry is now open for everyone to participate in!I have recently discovered a niche market for rare and impossible to find automobile parts. I have been collecting as many of these hard-to-find parts as I can, and 3D modelling them for future production as 3D printed goods. Most of these parts are plastic, and as they break or wear out faster than the cars they belong to, demand starts increasing.I'm going to start out with a small, hobby-class printer. the specs for most of these devices more than meet the requirements for nearly-indistinguishable-from-the-originals reproductions.The money from this Kickstarter will be used as follows:The costs above are high estimates.

We were recently married in 2017 and now I am looking for help to start giving a little back to my wife and having the chance at doing what I love, creating, crafting and art.In 1994 I was diagnosed with depression/anxiety after suffering multiple panic attacks. Most of the anxiety stemmed from bullying at school and later in life at college. As the years went by I was later diagnosed with PTSD  (1997) after being held hostage in my home which led to me needing to see a counselor. The person involved never faced the consequences for his actions as I was too afraid to take that route. After seeing multiple counselor's I decided to give up, I found my depression/anxiety only worsening after each visit as my counselor would leave the practice I was at, so I'd always have a new counselor and have to go through the traumatic experience of explaining everything again.I slowly grew to learn how to manage my panic attacks with the help of my family, but also from hiding myself away, staying home a lot of the time. I enjoyed living a sheltered life, it made a lot of things easier but also made things a lot worse, I wouldn't and still don't go out alone, I get anxious around crowds and when meeting new people. It's very difficult at times to be social, even when I want to.With the help of my beautiful wife (Vanessa) I've accomplished more in the last 2 years than I ever dreamed possible and I want to be able to give her something back.Any money raised will help towards the purchase of a metal lathe and materials needed to begin creating rings, using all types of materials, from home. I plan to create rings and various objects from turning wood, metals, resin and other exotic materials I find interesting.    Materials that will be used for this project are, but not limited to:Recently my wife purchased me a Dremel 4300 so I could show some of my work here. Below are some images of the current rings I've made with wood using the Dremel 4300.Sadly with a Dremel 4300 there is only so much I can do so I'm restricted to only wood and unable to show anything further than wood rings.The first purchase will be the metal lathe. They generally run about $1,565.00 from Grizzly found here: Grizzly G0602. After funds are spent on the lathe, I will be purchasing tools to work with the Lathe and also buying materials to complete my work.I have found that I can buy the materials for my projects from Rockler.com for around $15 - $100, depending on the type of project being completed.I'm hoping to sell my items on my Facebook page and also at craft fairs. My hope is to have a little income so I'm able to help my wife, based on the work I am able to accomplish with these supplies.   I also plan on streaming regularly, live on Twitch.tv whenever working on rings etc. I have setup a Twitch.tv channel ready. (link is below)I hope to be working from 9am to 5pm during Mon-Fri and using the weekend to sell on Facebook Live using the newly created Amore Rings page. (link is below)I am very passionate about art in general and know that I could be successful in creating rings once I have been able to acquire the tools needed. I already have a large garage as my work space with plenty of room to grow my small WFH business. (Video to come)Also being able to contribute to our household means the world to me. Any funding you can provide is greatly appreciated and will be used completely towards this project and project rewards.  You can really help by spreading the word! To help me get the word out, you can share my link to your Facebook Timeline! You can even make a pledge, that would really help and be super appreciated.(Final product may not look the same as pictured examples)May 1st: My wife purchased me a Dremel 4300 for me to show some of my capabilities.May 2nd: Added some images of my first wooden rings.May 3rd: Updated my story to go more in depth, it's a very hard subject to talk about and write about.May 6: Added a Livestream video, creating a wooden ring with a Dremel 4300.May 11: Added some new images of my current handmade rings.

As with most projects like this, the main challenge is managing fulfillment.

I've had the idea for a long time, and I just need the backup to help me fund it! The money will cover materials and rewards, and there are several different reward options to choose from, so read through them carefully, and pick which one is best for you.Included in my Etsy will be soy candles and melts, bath bombs, bath soaks, scrubs, body butters and lotions, solid perfume, lip and body balms, etc. The list could go on and on, as I'm sure I'll add things as I go.So if you all love the luxury of a relaxing bath soak or the the soft flicker of candlelight, help me make it all happen by backing me up! :)","I'm ready for this project. I've done loads of research, I believe I have enough experience with the products to deliver every one of them correctly. I've never done a Kickstarter before, so I'm sure that will have it's own challenges, but I've given myself plenty of time and budget to make it happen and have things sailing smooth. I'm confident that there will be no issues with any of the rewards, and none of my materials will go to waste.",https://www.kickstarter.com/projects/1404985629/the-stone-door-a-young-adult-fantasy-novel?ref=discovery_category_newest,1404985629/the-stone-door-a-young-adult-fantasy-novel,"'The Stone Door' is a young adult novel about a girl named Juniper Holt. Since a car accident at age eight, Juniper has been suffering from amnesia, and she doesn't remember much about her childhood. In 'The Stone Door,' she finds herself knee deep in a world that she's always been a part of, but doesn't know anything about. After being kidnapped, Juniper has to fight her way through an otherworldly forest, alongside a group of strangers who claim to know her, all while trying to figure out who she is and why all of this nonsense feels so familiar. The group struggles to get home, fighting through every obstacle that the Norse God, Loki, throws at them, and once they do, Juniper finds herself at odds with her entire life.In 'The Stone Door,' readers will start to learn about the world that Juniper has been thrust into. The world I've created for this series has deep roots in Norse Mythology, but there is also an ample amount of witchcraft and classic supernatural creatures in it. The characters themselves are a sort of demigod, but I won't give too much away about that, and instead I'll let you read it for yourselves. If you like mythology or fantastical creatures, you're sure to enjoy this world!Hi! My name is Meghan, author of 'The Stone Door' and the rest of the Juniper Holt Series. I've been working on these books for the past seven years. At one point, the first two titles (The Stone Door and The Chains of Rowan) were published under alternate titles, and they were a bit different than what they are currently. I've come a long way since then, and my writing abilities are far superior to what they were. I've been re-writing and editing the first book for months, and I'm now ready to take the first step.With this Kickstarter campaign, if it is fully funded, I will be able to submit 'The Stone Door' to a professional editor, to get it the clean sweep it deserves, as well as purchase ISBN numbers and barcodes for the various versions of the book. As soon as the editing process is completed, I will be able to format and publish the book, and that is when all of the Kickstarter rewards will be sent out.I'm really excited to share this novel and all it's sequels with the world! This has been a long journey for me, and I'd love to take you all along with me. If this campaign is successful, it will kickstart the beginning of a five-part series, as well as the rest of my writing career.Thank you!The funding for the project is broken down into four parts: Editing, ISBN/Barcodes, Fees + Cushion in case of backer cancellation and Backer Rewards/ShippingEditing: $950ISBNs & Barcodes: $250Fees + Cancellations: $100Backer Rewards & Shipping: $250Below is a chart of all the backer rewards. The higher rewards are perfect if you know of some people you'd like to gift the book to, and all of the included art will be my own.$1750 - 11 x 17 Poster for every physical backer$2000 - Sticker sheet for every physical backer$2250 -Tee shirt for every physical backer$2500 - Small art book for every physical backer and a pdf version for digital backers","I'm very confident that if this Kickstarter is fully funded, there shouldn't be any risks at all. The only thing that could potentially go differently than planned is the date of the book being released could be pushed back, in which case everybody's backer rewards would arrive a little later than planned. However, I don't believe that will be a problem, and if it is, it wouldn't be extremely late, just maybe a couple weeks or so."

https://www.kickstarter.com/projects/soulsfeng/blackout-dual-purpose-sneaker-0?ref=discovery_category_newest,soulsfeng/blackout-dual-purpose-sneaker-0,"We see sneakers and wear sneakers everyday, but theres never a perfect sneaker when the weather changes frequently throughout the week even on the same day; in the morning its cold then by noon its hot. We might also want a sneaker that can be used on cold and hot days, summer and winter. So we designed and built this two layer upper sneaker, one layer lines the inside to cover your feet when its cold and is stored beneath the insole when not being used, with the second freeknit layer on the outside. When its hot put the inside layer under the insole to keep your feet cool, when its cold put the inside layer over your feet and attach it to the tongue of the second layer so it remains in place while keeping your feet warm, the inside layer uses a special fabric which is 2-3 time denser than regular fabric to always keep your feet warm.This sneaker suits all occasions even Black Tie! only joking!! perhaps not Black Tie but practically every other instance. We try our best to build sneakers for everyday use.Thanks so much for supporting our project, we are looking for at least 209 reward pledges so we can start producing this sneaker again in numerous color options and larger quantities, we understand that there are so many sneaker options to choose and support today that all say similar things to what I have told you, all I can tell you is our BLACKOUT sneaker has been meticulously designed and engineered in small batches for quality control and then underwent an extensive barrage of tests, frequently having to return to the drawing board to assure that it is lightweight, comfortable and durable. By pledging at least 72USD you will receive a pair of BLACKOUT Dual-Purpose Sneakers.We are scheduled to begin shipping: 15th Jan 2020-5th Feb 2020","All projects are and will be met with challenges regardless of their budgets. A challenge for us is while producing hundreds and thousands of sneakers is to all the time maintain our high quality control and performance standards, we believe that qualities out rank qualifications and quality is more valuable then quantity but we do need to produce our BLACKOUT Dual-Purpose sneaker and our other sneakers to satisfy market demand and evolve our business further, so we have gone through great efforts to assure each and every sneaker is designed and engineered using the same exact materials and methods of production and undergo the same stiff quality control testing for comfort, weight, durability and looks. We don't just make sneakers, were about engineering them with walking and running, breathability, temperature testing, shock absorption testing and more ... We are confident that we can replicate these ideals every time because this is our fundamental focus to engineer for you truly amazing sneakers.",https://www.kickstarter.com/projects/soulsfeng/west-bay-sneakers?ref=discovery_category_newest,soulsfeng/west-bay-sneakers,"I love sneakers which is why I design, test and make sneakers that I'll like to wear not just to sell to others! myself and my teammates at Soulsfeng New York, are all about trying to create the ultimate sneaker, a sneaker that is lightweight, comfortable, durable, reliable and of course looks good!To me passion is bigger and goes beyond words, so I'm keeping this short! We are a new sneaker company launched in 2017, We are off to a good start however like all startups need investment and people to support the business growth.Our West Bay Sneaker is among the latest designs we have created. The print around the toe box and tongue is the West Bay City Skyline at Doha, Qatar which is the richest country in the world but Qatar will not abandon its traditions so tries to blend the present with the past and so far it has large heritage and architectural projects on the horizon, with the West Bay Skyline they are trying as much as possible to preserve their heritage and the Qatari-Arab Muslim identity. In a country where many have no financial need I felt it was admirable that they still stay connected with their humble roots.The West Bay is a very important building skyline in the state of Qatar which is a kind of their spirit, a kind of yearning and hope for preservation of heritage and history.","We are a small business with limited funding so try to step carefully to make the right longterm choices, this is always a risk and challenge especially with small businesses, however we have the fortune of having our own factory which means that all sneakers are made in-house and addition to this some of our sneakers materials are also in-house produced with the rest sourced locally. So overall all this gives us a lot of control to be creative and to explore with less risk."

Later episodes have much more action and you're gonna love em. The first season of One Thing Wrong (OTW) is voiced primarily byfour awesome people. Jessica Rainville, Derek Concannon, Keith Jensenand Mike Weiner. Characters were created by Austyn, and Mat Johnson drew/brought them to life.We’ve been hiding in the shadows for nearly a decade, andnow we’re ready to launch. Sounds warry…If you like mature and immature humor then we’re for you,especially if you also like cartoons. We’re a group of like-minded individualswho have worked tirelessly to put together some awesome shows. I’m not going tobore you with more info. Each show began as a small comic that we called a“strip bit” because they weren’t full comic strips… mainly one cell jokes. Andnow, we have luckily joined up with an amazing animation company and some ofthe awesomest voice talent to create some increasingly inappropriate animatedbits. First, we haveOne Thing Wrong, a supernaturalcrime fighting show thatScooby Doo wouldn't be proud of… Asupernatural laugh fest of wrongness. Every episode pits Hero and Warrioragainst the evil that surrounds them on their“adventures”, even when theevil is non-existent. Second, we haveDippy Saves the World, an alieninvasion hits a circus, what more do you need to know? The clowns band togetherwith the other circus folk to strategize how to best defeat what the aliensthrow at them… including giant bugs and saucers.And Lastly, we have “CollectionVol 1”, a motion comic following the first volume in series of volumes thatfollow several once ordinary people as they are thrown into their now abnormallives. Vampires, aliens, time travel, flight, super powers, if you have any ofthese then you will become property of the Collection; an undergroundcontainment facility that makes sure the world of the unknown stays unknown.But when Jerry attempts to transport himself through time, a freak storm wreakshavoc while a meteor shower fast approaches Earth. Aliens, Dragons, Vampires,super powers..., everything that shouldn't be known is on the Collection'scollection list.We need you guys, the fans who never existed till now… well,hopefully, to fork up some dough so we can pay all these awesome people as wellas bring the dvd set to fruition. If my mind is right, that means creation… Ifnot, expect some diced fruit in your dvd set… What’s going to be in this fruity pack of delightfulness?Glad you sarcastically asked. The pack will have a full season of “One Thing Wrong,” a full season of “Dippy Saves the World,” and a fullseason of “Collection Vol 1” amotion comic. That’s the shows, butwe’re also going to dazzle you with the stripbits brought to paper… that’s right;all the bits you can conveniently find on our site will now be even more convenientlyincluded in an awesome book insert for the dvd set. And that’s not all... Incaseyou want to read the Collection vol 1motion comic we’ll also include thelimited edition pre-release graphic novel inside the package! OH! And the Affliction comic will also be part ofthe insert! Affliction is a Zombie comic. We’ll also throw in some surpriseepisodes from our f’d up inappropriate line-up of stuff soon to come. You’regonna love them. Each episode will be 3 to 6 minutes, while each season will beroughly 45 to 60 minutes of crazy animated comedy, except for the Collectionmotion comic which will be crazy supernatural dramatic stuff… the other side ofShutupsystems…. We are going to jam-pack this pack; again I don’t think thatrefers to the preservative. So that’s what you get if you just pre-order the launchpack. Awesome stuff, I know. However, if you’re not broke, don’t have all yourmoney locked up in diversified stocks and bonds, or you’re not saving up for aflight to mars, that’s like nearly a million bucks L, then how about you fork up abit more so you can get these awesome perks! ","Once the package is funded, we'll be able to knock out this set in no time! We decided against offering toys and trinkets this time around because we didn't want to be held up by that, so as long everybody avoids being abducted by aliens or arrested by clowns then we'll have these shows ready for you by 2016, if not sooner.",https://www.kickstarter.com/projects/849746165/blink-psychopath-a-lovely-horrific-zombie-anime-in?ref=discovery_category_newest,849746165/blink-psychopath-a-lovely-horrific-zombie-anime-in,"Here's the awesome sticker!

The reason for this pledge drive is quite simple, and comes with a complex confusing story. But first the quick bits:There's a whole demon thing going on in the book, so that's the reason for the 6 theme... not some necro-folk here.I wrote this book and its sequels in my style and I will continue to write these books in my style. My style is scripty and unwanted by publishers, but that's fine ... the books don't want them either. Lots of immaturity and whatnot that the respectable respected corporations aren't keen on reading. And why should they? I suck at selling this... So book one has already been released and book two is ready to be thrown out of the nest. But unlike those bitch birds who throw their babies out without making sure there aren't mongooses or snakes or bears awaiting a tasty snack, I've chosen to avoid ejecting the 2nd book until I've paved the way for predators? I suck at literrary devices... ...And if you thought that bit was a ramble... enjoy this fella.The origin of BLINK PSYCHOPATHFirst, I wanted to make a project with college kids, because I, too, was a collegian at the time. So the idea was to have 'em work on a movie with me. No luck. Next, I started looking all over for people to do bits of my movie that I could piece together. Some people were interested, but they were also too busy to work for free. Which is understandable. After a few years, I shelved the jigsaw'ed movie and pieced together a new project ... zombies vs psychos. Well, it was actually going to be Vombies vs. Zampires ... but my mind changed on that and it became the Sycho Movie Project. First, I contacted indie filmmakers/college kids... some interest...no time... Second, I put the word out to a gaggle of followers of the band, ICP, and ...some interest... no time... trailer raided by fbi...So Third, more recently, I tried indie filmmers again, and this time people asked for a script... I had already written a few pieces for the juggalos to shoot, but never a full script of it. So alas I began scribing... and as I did so ... Well, in short and less dramatic, I basically got carried away. I started it as a movie then Ichanged my mind and decided a series would be better since that was my plan for a later project, and then I went crazy with actions and graphics, stuff that indie filmmakers on a momma and poppa budget couldn't possibly do, or feel good about doing. SO I continued to write my little show how Iwanted and viola... season one was complete, after a ton of editing sweeps. And season 2 is even awesomer... not to belittle the first though. In short... it took a near decade to come to the final product/project/book BLINK PSYCHOPATH which allows me to write my way in my voice and only feel a little bit bad about it. So please help me put my words in peoples' mouths and become one more book report banned from schools.IF WE REACH DOUBLE OUR GOAL Then we'll go ahead and release season 2 right away! And probably something more!",no risks. Season 1 is already out. Season 2 is ready to be released. And Season just needs some formatting and editing and it'll be ready to go.

Here's a detailed list of songs I've chosen:I'm Not The Only One: I will shoot a mock wedding ""You and me, we made a vow."" Then I will shoot the man cheating and have the woman burning her wedding dress. ""You've been so unavailable.Now sadly I know why, your heart is unobtainable.Even though Lord knows you kept mine"" I will actually be doing two couples the other will be connected to first. I want to keep the element of surprise in all the photos.Make It To Me: The setting for this shoot is going to be a coffee shop, with a model sitting there and another walking in ""I'm waiting patiently though time is moving slow. I have one vacancy and I wanted you to know that."" This song series will be very old school glam. I want to add an vintage fill to them.Stay With Me:This series will be solely from the point of view of a man. I want to capture the raw emotion of how men feel after they have caught feelings for some one but they weren't necessarily return and possibly ruined by a one night-stand ""Guess it's true, I'm not good at a one-night stand but I still need love 'cause I'm just a man.""Latch: I'm going to keep it sexy and alluring like the lyrics, but i also want to add a bit of theatricality to it. I'm going to do a lot of word play. ""You lift my heart up when the rest of me is down.You, you enchant me even when you're not around."" I'm going to put you guys in the mind of Disney love mixed with lust.Like I Can: I'm going to make this series into a story, This series portraits will have a beginning, a middle and an end. The shooting style will be very cinematic. I will use very scenic setting and roads with models and props. ""Why are you looking down all the wrong roads? When mine is the heart and the salt of the soul.""Life Support: I'm going to make this series somewhat of a tragedy. I want to create an essence of lost and gain. This series will be shot in Blake and White. ""I've been sleeping with the lights on cause the darkness is surrounding you."" Leave Your Lover: I'm going to do this shoot in the rain. I want to create an urgency, almost a need that each model will portray. When you see the portraits I want the need to jump off the pictures There will be some fun surprises in this series.""Don't have direction, I'm just rolling down this road. Waiting for you to bring me in from out the cold.Restart: This series will be the anthem of breaking up and starting over! This will be an uplifting and fun.Balloons, champagne, glitter and more. These portraits will be a blueprint of what every person should do after a break-up. ""What do you want from me when I just wanna restartYou keep coming back for me when you're the one who tore us apart And the truth is I'm better on my own and I'm the one to leave it apart.""No matter how much you back you will get to see these portraits! Every backer will get an e-book! Also one lucky backer will get a HUGE surprise! Every perks includes some form of photo book that will be created through Blurb! What's the huge surprise? Lets just say that whoever the lucky person is, they will be very excited!!More on my site: http://businesskeshia.wix.com/photographyTHANKS!-K",Biggest challenge is making sure the songs are expressed correctly through the portrait series.Shipping internationally will take longer so that is naturally going to be an issue.

There is going to be a lot of lights, special effects, audio sequencing and cues that all need to come together to help the performers tell their story.

We packed all three kids in our SUV and made our way to ""Little Valley"" in St. George. After unloading the kids and visiting with family for about 15 minutes, my wife asked, ""Where's Parker?"" I looked around my brother's home to see if I could find the car seat our then 10-month-old boy was sitting in. I couldn't see it. ""Didn't you grab him?"" She asked. ""I thought you did"", I replied. We both ran outside to find Parker inside the SUV, crying with his face beet-red. We had left our baby in the car! St. George, Utah is notorious for its 115+ degree summers. Luckily, this afternoon wasn't one of them. And luckily, Parker was fine. Not two months later we saw on the internet that a baby girl who lived in our same county had just passed away from heat stroke. She had been left in the car for several hours, forgotten by her mother.I immediately felt empathy for this young mother. I could only imagine the feelings of guilt associated with her tragedy multiplied exponentially to what I had felt. She had forgotten, just like I had. But luck wasn't on her side that day. Temperatures soared well into the 90s, and the day passed well into the afternoon. My point is people forget. Busy people, lazy people, single people, married people, young, old, fat, skinny, etc. Don't kid yourself, you forget too. And don't say, ""I would never forget that. That's impossible"". That's the funny thing about forgetfulness, it's no respecter of persons. We are all susceptible.I needed something to help remind me that my baby was in the car. Something simple, something easy to use, and something that I could and would remember to use to remind me. But what? I first thought about a device that could sense the amount of weight placed on it, to go directly beneath the car seat. It would send a text message to my phone after triggering, sensing that the baby had been left after the car was turned off. Too complicated. What about an app that alerted me when I was ""x"" amount of feet from my car and reminded me to check the back seat? Maybe. But I've had the GPS in my phone fail, a lot. I needed something simple. I asked my wife what she thought after explaining my ""hi-tech"" ideas to her. She said, ""What about a bracelet?"" ""What? A bracelet?"" I didn't understand. ""I don't know. A bracelet of some-sorts"", she said again. She then left me by myself to further develop this little idea. Wait. What if the bracelet was on the baby's car seat and you put it on after you put the baby in the car seat? Then after you got out of the car, it wouldn't take long for you (or someone else) to notice the bracelet and you going back to retrieve your baby! And maybe add some jingle bells to the bracelet, to further remind you of your baby with your sense of sound. And maybe, just maybe, if the parent forgot to take the bracelet off the car seat and place it on their own wrist, they would hear the jingle bells from the back seat while driving, which would remind them of their baby back in the seat. So, that's what we made. We tried it, and it works! And yes, it's just some yarn, a slap bracelet, and three jingle bells. Don't want to buy one? Then just make one. But do something, please.    ","I guess the real risk is that parents won't remember to put the bracelet on. All we can do is put obstacles in the way of forgetfulness and hope that if we put enough in the way, to help us remember, that something will jog our memory to help prevent an accident from happening. We will make as many bracelets as are wanted."

I know that there have been occasions when, upon meeting a person for the first time I felt that they were, or were going to be, important to me.David Gwynn is definitely one of these people.The first time I played with him it was obvious that we shared a very deep musical connection. Over the last few years I have begun to realize that he is a near perfect complement to my show, the roots and years we share are clear when we play together. It’s like a friend once said, “Talkin’ to you is just like talkin’ to me…”. That’s the feeling I have on stage with him, he plays what I would play if I could, and if I wasn’t playing rhythm and singing.We have been working in a number of formats for several years, from a six-piece band with violin and harmonica through trios and duos. This current CD is an outgrowth of that work, and a natural progression for me as a writer and performer.I have been feeling the need to return to a simpler sound and that has had an influence on my writing.Now don’t get me wrong, these tunes sound great with the band, but in some way I was writing this stuff to be recorded as a duo, with acoustic instruments and with a minimum of overdubs and punch-ins, as close to live a I can get and still feel happy about the sound.Smiling Jack Smith",
https://www.kickstarter.com/projects/1424067177/delicious-dairy-free?ref=discovery_category_newest,1424067177/delicious-dairy-free,"Delicious Dairy Free has been a work in progress for many years. The money from this kickstarter will be used to help make sure that I can actually open up my bakery and share it with the public. Delicious Dairy Free started out abouteight years ago when my brother was told that he was lactose intolerant. This really turned my family’s life around as we were not able to buy baked goods from anywhere. They all were made with dairy in one form or another, whether it was milk, cream, or butter. This meant that whenever my brother wanted a treat, we had to hand make it. Since most recipes are made with dairy, my family had to get creative with homemade dairy substitutes. My mom started the baking for my brother and when I was old enough, she let me come into the kitchen. I learned to bake with my mom as we learned to bake dairy free for my brother. While we were baking, something clicked inside of me and I knew that I wanted to make baking a major part of my life. Since I have started baking I have really mastered specialty baking and grown to know even more that I want to bake for the rest of my life. My brother is still lactose intolerant but I have found that I can use natural margarine in place of butter and things like almond and rice milk in place of milks and creams, while making sure the desserts still taste amazing. This past year I have also moved into the realm of baking without gluten and baking vegan for friends and family. This was a little bit tougher than dairy free baking but it still tastes really good and works for people. While baking I have been sharing my treats with friends and family to spread a little bit of joy around. My favorite part of baking is getting to see the smile on someone’s face when they get a delicious treat made just for them. This is really the main reason why I like baking and want to continue it because I enjoy sharing smiles and cheer with homemade baked goods and I like making people feel special by getting something made just for them. A few months ago I got the idea to turn my love for baking into a bakery so that I can help serve all of the dietary needs people in my community. While looking up starting a business in my community I learned that there are a lot of different types of permits that I need to have in order to start up and this is really expensive. I am only 14 so coming up with over $1,500 to buy permits is really hard. That is why I have set up this kickstarter so I can raise the money to become a certified bakery in my community. With the money from the kickstarter I will go and get all of the permits I need for my bakery, certify my house to bake from, and I will start my bakery out of local farmer’s markets. With this bakery I can spread cheer in my community and hopefully I can raise money on my own to be able to travel one day.  Thank you to all those who help sponsor this bakery and for taking the time to read this.",As I am looking at starting up my business it is important to note that there are several different risks and challenges that come with trying to open up my bakery. One of the main risks that comes with my bakery is the fact that my bakery might fail. There is always the chance that no one will buy from my bakery and I will not be able to make money but I am qualified to handle this because I have a community of friends and family that need special baked goods and are willing to buy from me. Opening up my bakery is the main risk with this adventure for there is no guarantee that people will buy from me but I can handle this by encouraging my friends and family to buy from me.

Overall there are several risks and challenges that come with trying to open up my bakery but I am qualified to deal with these problems because I have the support of friends and family behind me and I am unwilling to give up in the face of hardships.

These works focus on loss in a very real sense. That is to say, this book looks at the loss of a friend through suicide as well as losing family members to sickness. As was the case with my previous three books, Forever Turn the Midnight Carousel further morns the last of the old New York, both the places and the people along with the city’s ghosts. The story “The Brief History of Henry Wilson” is a look at a shut who hears the voices from the other side of his door as his neighbors make their presents known. He soon believes he’s the savior of all SRO tenants and looks to fulfill the task of that roll. To Mr. Algren is my ode to the great author Nelson Algren but spoken with a real New York voice, as opposed to Chicago. Behind The Heavy Metal Door is a fictional account of a thirty something year old woman who finds herself locked up in a psychic ward after having attempted suicide. She befriends one of the fellow patients while being pestered by another one looking for a quarter.Forever Turn the Midnight Carousel is by far and away my most realized work to date as most readers will undoubtedly find. http://joerussia3.wixsite.com/thenewsfactory","Since I'm going through a nonprofit instead of a traditional publishing house, the cost of publishing falls on me as the writer.

With really no budget to promote the itunes release I did not get the sales I needed to pay for physical copies to sell in stores in my region.I like the freedom of doing things independently for my music career. The fact that I have kids means their needs come first, so right now financially my personal life has taking precedence over pursuance of my goals in music.

After paying for the: beats, studio time, mastering and itunes fee (also a music video) I didn't have much money left for promotion. With really no budget to promote the itunes release  I did not get the sales I needed to pay for physical copies to sell in stores in my region.I like the freedom of doing things independently for my music career. The fact that I have kids means their needs come first, so right now financially my personal life has taking precedence over pursuance of my goals in music. I'm at a point momentarily where I do not have the extra income to complete the final portion of this project on my own. I think it is a quality piece of work that is worth not letting fall to the wayside, because I could not get cd's printed up in a timely manner.Any donations will be used for pressing of cd's and, printing of posters. If feasible some t-shirts for promotional purposes. I've attached to the project the full album (video) for listening too. Check it out and decide if you think it is worth supporting. The album ""Infrastructure"" has soul, rock n roll, and dance tracks. My style is lyrical and deep, but I also know how to make fun songs too. Even people who are not necessarily hip hop fans dig some of my work. As you can see I have done 85% of the work myself I just need some help crossing the finish line with this project. Enjoy the video for a song called ""OH YEAH"" which will be included on the album!",The only challenge is getting the cd's on the shelf in surrounding cities outside of my town (specifically Chicago). If I cannot ...plan B be will be to sell copies at shows there. If i can get one or two music stores Chicago mission complete. There is really no risk for backers they will receive a copy for sure if $10 or more is pledged when the campaign is successful!
https://www.kickstarter.com/projects/316584148/wegans?ref=discovery_category_newest,316584148/wegans,"                               ¿POR QUÉ? Después de haber descubierto lo que significa ser y no ser vegano, tanto para individuo como para el mundo entero, no pudimos no unirnos a muchos veganos. Es demasiado grande y completamente injustificado el precio que otros seres vivos, e incluso el mismo planeta, están pagando para que nosotros pudiéramos ‘disfrutar’ los sabores de nuestras tradiciones y comodidad. Si el mundo no hace el cambio hacia el veganismo, dentro de los próximos 40 - 50 años será imposible sostener la vida humana. Cada 10 segundos un niño muere de hambre. Si todo el mundo se hiciera vegano, podríamos alimentar a todos. WHY?After having discovered what it means to be and not to be vegan, for the individual as well as for the entire planet, we couldn’t not join many vegans. Completely unjustified and way to big is the price other living beings, and even the planet itself, are paying so that we could ‘enjoy’ the flavors of our traditions and comfort. If the world doesn’t make the change towards veganism, within the next 45, 50years, it will be impossible to sustain human life. Every 10 seconds, a child dies of hunger. If the world became vegan, we could feed everyone.       Un vegano cada año:El hecho de que en el mundo 100% vegano no habría ni hambre ni muchas 'enfermedades del mundo moderno', es suficiente para que todos nos preguntemos si nuestras tradiciones y comodidad son más importantes que la vida misma. Ni siquiera hemos hablado sobre qué clase de tortura están obligados a pasar los animales, para que nosotros podemos tener su carne y otros productos en cualquier momento, en cada esquina.   Every year, one vegan:The fact that in a 100% vegan world, there would be neither hunger nor many ‘modern day diseases’, is enough for all of us to ask ourselves if our traditions and comfort are more important than life itself. We haven’t even spoken about the kind of torture animals are forced to suffer, so that we can have their meat and other products at every moment, on every corner.                                                             ¿QUÉ?Pensando en cómo nosotros podríamos contribuir, no solo a detener la masacre diaria de los animales, sino también a salvar tanto a nuestro medioambiente, como a nosotros mismos, nos hemos dado cuenta de que un buen plan de amigos en una buena plataforma vegana online, puede contribuir muchísimo a expandir el veganismo y de este modo acercarnos todavía más a un mundo totalmente vegano.Wegans plan de amigos ofrece un modelo innovador y autosostenible basado en una formula simple, pero muy eficaz, que permite a los consumidores aumentar su poder de compra. Por otro lado, facilita a comercios la oportunidad de ofrecer sus productos veganos en nuestra plataforma a través la cual los usuarios pueden comprarlos a mitad de precio sin que los comercios necesitan hacer descuentos.Tenemos dos objetivos. Primero es dar a los consumidores la oportunidad de comprar más con el mismo dinero, o comprar lo mismo pero ahorrando mediante nuestra plataforma. El segundo trata de facilitar la actividad de comercios reduciendo sus gastos operativos.En resumen, nuestra misión es fomentar y recompensar la decisión por el veganismo, reduciendo el costo de vida solo por elegir lo vegano. Esperemos que esta pequeña contribución de nuestra parte alentará a muchos a unirse con nosotros a romper el círculo vicioso de la muerte y los malos tratos, y crear juntos el nuevo círculo de la vida y el respeto mutuo.                                WHAT?Thinking about how we could contribute to, not just stopping the daily massacre of animals, but also to saving our environment as well as ourselves, we realized that a good friendship plan on a good vegan online platform could contribute a lot to the expansion of veganism and, that way, bring us that much closer to an entirely vegan world.Wegans friendship plan offers an innovative and self-sustainable model based on a simple, but highly effective formula, that allows the users to increase their buying power. On the other hand, it gives the stores the opportunity to offer their vegan products on our platform, through which the users can buy them at half the price without stores having to make any discounts.We have two goals. The first one is to give the users the opportunity to buy more for the same amount of money or buy the same but saving half the money using our platform. The second one aims to make it easier on the stores buy reducing their running costs.To summarize, our mission is to promote and reward the decision for veganism, reducing the cost of life just for choosing vegan. We hope this small contribution of ours will encourage many people to join us in breaking the vicious circle of death and abuse, and that, together, we will create a new circle of life and mutual respect.                                                              ¿CÓMO FUNCIONA?Cada comercio que en su oferta contiene productos veganos puede suscribirse a la plataforma Wegans creando su perfil en el que puede subir tantos productos veganos que desee.Cada consumidor registrado puede comparar y comprar productos subidos a la plataforma Wegans y luego puntuar y comentar su experiencia para que todos los comercios puedan mantener calidad adecuada de su profesionalidad. En vez de introducir los datos de sus tarjetas, cada vez que haga una compra el usuario puede pagar con su Cartera online Wegans usando los fondos que antes había ingresado. Es la manera más sencilla, práctica y segura.Con 10 € de la cuota de activación que se paga solo una vez, el usuario puede activar su Hucha online Wegans que puede usar para duplicar su dinero. Hay que destacar que esto es el único coste que Wegans tiene para un usuario.Cuando activa su Hucha, el usuario puede transferir 30 € de su Cartera Wegans a su Hucha Wegans con el fin de duplicarlos, es decir, convertirlos en 60 € gracias a Wegans plan de amigos. Cada vez que uno de sus amigos hace lo mismo, porque el usuario lo ha recomendado, Wegans Plan de amigos premia al usuario con una bonificación que equivale al 20%. Con solo 5 amigos, el usuario ha duplicado sus 30 € de la Hucha y ahora tiene en su Cartera 60 € para comprar productos en la plataforma Wegans.El usuario no está limitado en duplicar solo 30 €. Cada persona duplica según sus necesidades.Aparte de facilitar la compra y hacer productos veganos más accesibles, tanto físicamente, como económicamente, tratamos de animar la gente no vegana a comprar productos veganos porque a través del nuestro Plan de amigos puede comprar todo en un lugar, pagando solo la mitad.                               HOW IT WORKS?Every store that has vegan products can subscribe to the Wegans platform creating its profile where it can upload as many vegan products as it wishes.Every registered user can buy and compare products uploaded on Wegans platform and, later, evaluate and comment on their experience so that all the stores can maintain an appropriate level of their professionalism. Instead of providing the bank card information, each time they make a purchase, the users can pay with their Wegans online wallet, using the money they had previously deposited. It is the simplest, most practical and safest way.With a 10€ activation fee, that is paid only once, the users can activate their Wegans online MoneyBox they can use to double their money. It needs to be pointed out that this is the only cost users have.After activating the MoneyBox, the user can transfer 30€ from the Wegans wallet to Wegans MoneyBox to double it, in other words, to turn 30€ into 60€, thanks to Wegans friendship plan. Each time one of his/her friends does the same, because the user recommended it, Wegans friendship plan gives the user a reward equal to 20%. With just 5 friends, the user doubled his/her 30€ from the MoneyBox and now, he/she has, 60€ in the Wallet to use when buying on Wegans platform.The user is not limited to doubling just 30€. Each person doubles according to his/her needs.Apart from making shopping easier and making vegan products more accessible, physically as much as economically, we aim to encourage non vegans to buy vegan products because, using our Friendship plan, they can buy everything at one place paying only half the price.","Teniendo en cuenta lo importante y complejo que es el proyecto Wegans, hemos dedicado mucho tiempo a buscar un equipo informático comprometedor y capaz de convertir este proyecto en realidad.

https://www.kickstarter.com/projects/albedomusic/albedo-new-age-christmas-album?ref=discovery_category_newest,albedomusic/albedo-new-age-christmas-album,"  This is ALBEDO and I'm a New Age Music Artist. I'm in the process of completing a Christmas album. I've released several other albums in various genres over the years, but this will be my very first Christmas album. I'm currently in the recording and mixing phase, and if all goes well, the album will be released by November 1st. I just need a little bit more in order to fund the distribution and promotion.  The album will be a collection of secular and sacred Christmas songs using live and synthetic elements. Ranging from synthetic mixes, to solo piano, to chamber orchestra, to full symphonic score with choir. I sing all the vocal parts myself, including the solos and the choir parts. I also play a lot of different woodwind instruments including Clarinet, Oboe, and Recorders, all of which will be used on the album. Everything else will be achieved digitally through the use of synthetics and virtual orchestra samples. I'm offering many great rewards for your pledge to this project. Including digital song downloads, CDs, PDF sheet music, and T-shirts. For your pledge of $50 I will invite you to a private concert where I will perform all the songs from the album live. For your pledge of $100 I will include you in one of my upcoming music videos for the album. For your pledge of $500 I will write you a one-of-a-kind composition in your choice of Classical, New Age, or Dance.  Thank you for reading and helping me out with this project!ALBEDO Christmas- Jingle BellsALBEDO Christmas- What Child Is ThisALBEDO Christmas- Nutcracker Grossvater & TrepakALBEDO Christmas- Up on the Housetop",,https://www.kickstarter.com/projects/albedomusic/music-from-final-fantasy-vi-by-the-new-age-artist?ref=discovery_category_newest,albedomusic/music-from-final-fantasy-vi-by-the-new-age-artist,"MUSIC FROM FINAL FANTASY VI BY THE NEW AGE ARTIST ALBEDO Hello, I'm ALBEDO and I'm a New Age Music Artist. I also write in the Classical, Soundtrack and Dance genres. ALBEDO was formed in January of 2002, and has since released 8 albums. My CD ""Forgotten Lands"" was Nominated for Best Soundtrack Album by the 12th Annual Independent Music Awards. The latest releases have been a classical tribute album called ""Cliff Millward"" released in 2013, a new age Christmas album containing both secular and sacred arrangements in 2012, a five movement symphony called ""Symphony No. 1"" also released in 2012, the soundtrack to a video game called ""Forgotten Lands"" in 2011, a collection of classical orchestral works by Utah composers called ""Digital Fingers"" in 2010, and a dance album called ""7th Heaven"" in 2008, which was described by a fan as: ""Mannheim Steamroller goes to the club!"". My music is similar in style to Mannheim Steamroller, Kurt Bestor, Jon Schmidt and Yanni.  I'm currently working on an album that will be nothing but music from Final Fantasy VI by Nubuo Uematsu. For those of you who are unfamiliar, Final Fantasy is a role playing video game series that was originally released for the Nintendo Entertainment System back in 1987.  All of the music on the album qualifies as cover songs. Which means I need to get permission from the company Square Enix, who own Final Fantasy, to officially release the album and be completely legal. I will submit the music through a company called Limelight that specializes in getting permission for cover songs. All of the music will be very similar to the originals, because if I change too much then it'll be classified as a derivative work and therefore would have to go through different channels in order to get permission.  So, I'm asking for $1800 to help me with the cost of getting all the cover songs cleared, plus the cost for CD duplication. How many CDs get produced will depend on how much funding I get and how many pledge rewards need to be fulfilled. The percentage of money that goes to the original artist after a sale is not too much, but there are a lot of fees involved in the process of getting permission. I'm planning on having 18 songs on the album and each one has its own separate fee. The album is scheduled for release this fall, which means I have to submit the songs be the end of August. That will give me enough time to have official permission before the album is released.  I've done several other albums in various genres like dance, classical and new age, but this will be my first album of video game music. It will also be the first time I do an album of nothing but cover songs.  I sing all the parts myself. Including the solos and the choir parts. I also play lots of different woodwind instruments including Clarinet, Oboe and Recorders. All of which I will try to use on the album. Everything else will be achieved digitally through the use of synthetics and virtual orchestra samples. I'm offering many great rewards to this project including digital song downloads and CDs.

You'll have to pay for yourself, your guest, me, and my guests.$200 PRIVATE HOUSE CONCERTFor your pledge of two hundred dollars: I will come to your house for a private house concert and perform songs from the album. I will probably also perform songs from my others albums, plus well known pieces. The concert should last about 60-90 minutes. This will basically be me singing or playing a woodwind instrument with a pre-recorded backup being blasted through speakers on a stereo. I'll probably bring a guest with me. You may invite as many guests as you want, but don't go overboard. I'll need enough room to perform. $500 ORIGINAL SONG For your pledge of five hundred dollars: I will write an original song and name it after you. In your choice of either new age or classical.

It can be up to 10 hours starting no earlier than noon. I promise we will do some fun stuff, but don't expect to do anything wild and crazy. That night we will eat dinner at a nice restaurant of my choosing somewhere in Salt Lake City, then attend a Mannheim Steamroller concert. You will be responsible for buying your own concert tickets. Two days are available for 2 different backers, Friday Dec. 27th & Saturday Dec. 28th. The first person to pledge gets to choose which day they want. This price does not include transportation to and from Salt Lake City, the cost of any activities we do during the day including concert tickets, or the cost of dinner. When we go to dinner you will pay for the whole ticket which would be you, your guest, me, and my guests. Maximum of 5 people. Dinner will be about $40 per person not including tax or tip. $2,000 TAKE A TRAIN TRIP WITH MEFor your pledge of five thousand dollars: I will invite you and a guest on an Amtrak train trip with me from Salt Lake City, UT to Omaha, NE and back. I don't know exactly when this trip will take place. It'll depend on everybody's schedule. It'll most likely happen on week days. I'm planning on sometime in September or October. I will probably only stay in Omaha a day or two, but you may stay longer if you wish. You will be responsible for getting your own train tickets. You can get your own private room, or just get a regular seat. There is a lot more leg room than an airplane, plus you can get up and walk around at any time. Plus there is a dining car with a sit down restaurant and a cafe car where you stand in line and buy food items. You will also be responsible for getting your own accommodations while in Omaha. Hotel, motel, etc. We will visit the Mannheim Steamroller warehouse while we are in Omaha. They may even be nice enough to give us a tour. They are their own company, so I cannot guarantee anything special when we get there. But they are very nice people, so they probably will show us around. Chip Davis and other members of the band may or may not be there. This price includes round-trip train tickets for you and one guest which also includes meals from the restaurant on the train, but does not include extra food from the cafe. They have a dinging car which contains a sit down restaurant, and a cafe car where you can stand in line and buy food items. This price also includes transportation to the Mannheim Steamroller warehouse, and to and from the train station in Omaha. Which will probably be all by taxi. This price does not include hotel, transportation to and from the Salt Lake train station, extra transportation around Omaha, or meals in Omaha. You may join me for touring around Omaha if you wish, or you may go and do your own thing. For more information you can visit the Amtrak website: www.amtrak.com. I've done this trip before and the view is spectacular! EXTRA FUNDINGIf I get more than what I'm asking for I will use the extra money for advertising, better equipment, better software, better samples, better synthetics, and more physical CDs. Basically anything that will benefit the album during production or after the release date. If I get a lot more, then I will use it for a large live concert with a full orchestra somewhere in Salt Lake City. Maybe even a national tour if the local concert works out. I would have to get permission from Square Enix (the company that owns Final Fantasy) in order to do such a thing, but it's very possible. ","Obviously the biggest threat to this project is if they don't give me permission to do it. I'm submitting 18 cover songs to Square Enix (the company that owns Final Fantasy) to get their permission to officially release the album and be completely legal. The good new is, several people have told me that Square Enix is a really nice company to work with and they always give permission for third parties to do arrangements of their music. I'm going through a cover song clearance company called Limelight that gets permission for cover songs on my behalf for a large fee, but they have many benefits for doing so. It will take about 6 weeks to process my request. The plan is to submit the songs at the end of August for a mid October release date. I have also made sure that all songs qualify as cover songs. If I make too many changes they will be classified as derivative works, and then I will have to contact the company directly for permission. If for some strange reason they don't give me permission for certain songs, I will just take them off the album. I'm submitting a lot of songs just in case that happens. If I can only use half the songs that will still qualify as a full album. In the extremely rare event that they deny all the songs, it's possible to still release they album without getting full permission. Video game music is strange that way, Many artists have released video game arrangements without getting permission to do so. Nintendo and Square Enix don't seem to mind about that kind of thing, but I would rather go the complete legal route. It's possible that the music may take longer than excepted to create. If that happens, I will just move back the release date. Worst case scenario would be six weeks later then planned. I don't see that happening since I have created 8 previous albums, and have never missed a release date. I will ship all pledge rewards as soon as I get them from the manufacturers. If I get a really large number of request for non music items (like T-Shirts and Teddy Bears), it's possible it will take longer for them to produce a large quantity. I have lots of experience with shipping, so I don't foresee any problems there. I used to be the shipping manager at Day Murray Music for many years, and have experience with packing and custom forms for shipping music around the world."

We feel that these interactions are becoming endangered through our ever increasing use of social media and electronic communication and so we have created this project as a way of inciting people to have more actual human contact. Bubble Two accomplishes this in several ways.-- it touches people's sense of curiosity. From our experience setting up our prototype inflatable we have found that people find it hard to resist the pull of a large bubble set up in a park or plaza. They want to know what it is and what it's about. The first step of interaction is drawing people in, and at this a friendly and whimsical inflatable seems to excel.-- it provides an intimate space in which people are benignly forced to interact. We have deliberately designed the bubble to be a space where those inside cannot help but to have physical contact and conversation with their fellow occupants. Inside the inflatable people's ""personal bubbles"" expand, allowing contact that they often hesitate to engage in outside of the inflatable. They do so with neither objection nor apology as a sense of camaraderie through shared experience becomes present within the bubble.-- it incites interaction through ambient media. We have designed bubble two with multimedia capabilities and are producing video and audio that will be played at low levels so as not to distract from other people in the bubble. The video is not a movie to be watched, but a revolving series of snapshots of people interacting in intimate ways. The audio will be a series of statements suggesting ways in which people can interact intimately.We intend to set up Bubble Two in both public and private settings; in parks and plazas, at festivals and parties and wherever else we feel people might want a whimsical experience of their own humanity and recognition of the world around them.We also intend to use Bubble two for purposes outside The Human Experience Project. It is large enough for small musical and theatrical productions to take place inside, it's multimedia capabilities will allow us to use it as a portable theater and it's portability make it possible to take with us just about anywhere. Other uses surely will arise and we believe it's limits stretch as far as the human imagination.With money raised from kickstarter we will be purchasing the necessary supplies and equipment to make Bubble Two a success. This includes the plastic film and rubber mats used to actually construct the bubble, micro video projectors and speakers to allow for multimedia presentations and a better fan to inflate Bubble Two and future planned inflatables. Overfunding will be used to make other inflatables and improve the design of Bubble Two. Should we find ourselves with a wealth of overfunding, we will adjust what rewards we offer for donations.",,https://www.kickstarter.com/projects/1888792796/bubble-2?ref=discovery_category_newest,1888792796/bubble-2,"Bubble Two is an inflatable environment that initially will be a component of The Human Experience Project, an ongoing concept work that explores and invigorates people's sense of humanity and their need for face to face interaction.

They do so with neither objection nor apology as a sense of camaraderie through shared experience becomes present within the bubble.-- it incites interaction through ambient media. We have designed Bubble Two with multimedia capabilities and are producing video and audio that will be played at low levels so as not to distract from the people in the bubble. The video is not a movie to be watched, but a revolving series of snapshots of people interacting in intimate ways. The audio will be a series of statements suggesting ways in which people can interact intimately.We intend to set up Bubble Two in both public and private settings; in parks and plazas, at festivals and parties and wherever else we feel people might want a whimsical experience of their own humanity and recognition of the world around them. We also intend to use Bubble two for purposes outside The Human Experience Project. It is large enough for small musical and theatrical productions to take place inside, it's multimedia capabilities will allow us to use it as a portable theater and it's portability make it possible to take with us just about anywhere. Other uses surely will arise and we believe it's limits stretch as far as our imaginations.With money raised from kickstarter we will be purchasing the necessary supplies and equipment to make Bubble Two a success. This includes the plastic film and rubber mats used to actually construct the bubble, micro video projectors and speakers to allow for multimedia presentations and a better fan to inflate Bubble Two and future planned inflatables. It's also going to pay for us to create and ship out the rewards. Should we find ourselves with a wealth of overfunding, we will adjust what rewards we offer for donations and further surplus will be used to build other inflatables and improve the design of Bubble Two.",

The robots are controlled with poles attached to the head, hands and feet of the robot.This means that anyone that can operate a drill and twist some wire can participate. Have a look at me building one of the robots out of cansWe are looking to record our first pilot episode. We have a plan laid out and it's hilarious. We have two gopros available and phones. We just need one more camera that's a good all rounder that we can stick on a tripod and zoom and move.I've settled on the Canon PowerShot G7 X Mark II (Black), this camera is the reason for this Kickstarter campaign.I've put a heap of work into the proof of concept and there are lots of videos on YouTube to prove it.I'm excited about the future of Stupid Robot Fighting League and I hope you are too.

A crazy sport and YouTube channel based in Te Puke New Zealand.Check out one of our fights between two ladies representing two local not-for-profit organizations. It's an epic battle! https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7xquahpgEN8If you don't have time to watch the video I'll try my best to explain something very strange to you.Stupid Robot Fighting League is non-robotic robots fighting in a frame. They are controlled by operators sitting behind them via poles attached to the Stupid Robot's hands and feet. If you push a pole forward attached to the Stupid Robot's hand, its hand moves forward. If you kick your foot forward, the pole attached to the Stupid Robot's foot kicks forward.There are currently three rounds of two minutes per round. We may change this to one minute per round. During each round the Stupid Robot's arms or legs may fall off. If this happens that part is removed. If the Stupid Robot's head falls off then that is that round over. The winner is worked out by most knockouts achieved or most limb detachments achieved for each round.That's it in a nutshell.The Reason for the KickstarterWe started in about October 2016 and have been slowly but surely growing our channel and quality. One huge step in making our shows that little more epic was the inclusion of John Heartley and Geoff Peterfy commenting on the fights. They run thatonesportsshow.com, a podcast to give you the lowdown on major American sports and spotlights on other sports you may not know about.I really wanted to show my appreciation for the value they add to Stupid Robot Fighting League by paying them for their efforts.By reading this you are showing that you are interested in supporting us in this crazy project. You rule so much right now!Please have a look at the pledge levels and rewards and see what suits you.Thanks so much.","As I thought this project out the main question for me is: ""Can I deliver on time?""I structured everything so that it was easy to deliver the lower pledge levels. I just need to make sure that I have enough fights to shoot with the rewards.As my equipment is already established there will be no waiting around for things to arrive. I also have backup equipment should my front line gear fail.There is always the chance of injury as SRFL is a little dangerous. This is why gloves and safety glasses are a must. I'm looking at two other safety measures for the future.Challenges I see are getting two fighters at one place at one time. Delivering on time for the people that pledged. Making sure all commitments are satisfied. Growing a slightly more epic beard."

https://www.kickstarter.com/projects/1700900584/ice-prince-student-thesis?ref=discovery_category_newest,1700900584/ice-prince-student-thesis,"Hello my name is Rashad Crews and I am a graduate student working towards a  Master of Fine Arts Degree from the City College of New York. I am an emerging filmmaker writing and directing my first feature film and thesis final called Ice Prince. I started writing this script over 12 years ago before I ever considered  film school. I began to take Ice Prince seriously while working on my undergraduate degree at Touro College here in New York City. I pulled out the script and really began to refine the story. The main character Kitare has evolved as I have evolved. Currently, City College has given me the opportunity to shoot this film. They have also provided a platform for me to showcase it. Ice Prince will be featured at The Student Oscar Awards. The Student Oscars  are closely linked to the official Oscar Awards which recognizes outstanding actors, films, and filmmakers. The Student Oscar Awards winners will have the opportunity to  hand out an Oscar Award at the annual ceremony held in Los Angeles, California.  In addition to the Student Oscar Awards I will also submit my work to four Indie Film Festivals in 2018. These festivals include: The 13th Annual New York City Short Film Festival 2018; The 3rd Annual PUSH! Film Festival 2018;  Brooklyn Film Festival June, 2-11, 2018, and the 15th Annual  DIY Film Festival March 19-31, 2018.Ice Prince is set in summer NY.  The film is  centered around a young up and coming rapper named Kitare  'K-Mack' Sands.  Kitare wants to leave his turbulent past behind to pursue a career in the music industry. While working on his dream he amassed a huge debt of S11,000 for instrumentals to produce songs for his upcoming independent album. The producer of the album who has loaned Kitare the money has given him only 72 hours to return the money. Kitare has no way of returning the money in such a short period of time and has exhausted all of his legitimate resources to earn enough money to pay the money back, so he is forced to get the money by any means necessary. He has found a way to get the money he needs, but he will have to cheat on his long term girlfriend Renee to get it. Meanwhile, his girlfriend has been sneaking behind his back working as a prostitute for money to help him pay off his debt. The twist in this story is the same friend helping Renee get money is the same friend that told Kitare he couldn't lend him anything.The story of Ice Prince was influenced by actual events that took place in my life, from stories that I heard growing in the Bronx, New York and from movies like “Hustle and Flow” and Eight Mile. I know that the viewers will be impressed and inspired by the story and the attention to detail as it relates to the characters, the scenery, and the overall effort  that it takes to produce a film like this.As a student my resources are limited so it is imperative that I ask for help from the community to get this project off of the ground.

Our film A Rage in Her Heart is a story that touches on trustand the long term effects of abuse. Even though this story is a fiction. It tells a story of a young woman as she attempts to believe in herself, after years of hiding her true self as she findscourage to confront her fears.A portion of your contributions will help cover payment for a stunt coordinator to guide the actressesinthe powerful scene where ASIA confronts her abuser Ms. DEVOE. This scene ends with the abuser getting killed, and we want the actors safety to be of the highest priority. Another portion will cover the Insurance for this scene, since it is intricate,it exceeds the insurance price we mainly acquire. The rest of the proceeds will go towards the make-up for the wound and rental of lights for this scene. As you could read this is a very important scene fromthe film and visuallywe don't want to portray it incorrectly.","We have never produced a film with so much intricacies, from the choreographed fight scene, down to the details of the seduction robbery scene, but it is a risk and a challenge we are willing to undertake.The cast and crew truly believes in this film and its power to give a voice to negatively painted women.Our cast all has a deep understanding of what it takes to make this film a great piece of storytelling and they have demonstrated that they are prepared along with our crew to use what he have learned through experience and application to get our story to film.We are not only actors and producers, but also doulas, massage therapists, spiritual healers, and musicians."

Students will be given special codes to access the lectures which will be available on Saturdays and Sundays at noon and at nine p.m. on Mondays and Tuesdays to suit the convenience of working people. Students will be grouped with tutors who will lead discussions and mark assignments at the students' convenience. Participants will have an in-school experience without being in school full time and at the end of the course will receive certificates and gold, silver or bronze medals depending on the quality of their performance.Our mission is to broaden the intellectual horizons of our students and teach them the skills of effective communication. Exposed to the ideas of the great political and economic thinkers, our graduates will be able to speak with authority in debates among friends or in their communities and be able to pronounce on the wisdom or the folly of different government policies. Our graduates will no longer be intimidated by the prospect of public speaking but will acquit themselves well if they have to address the United Nations, Congress, the local graduating class, introduce a speaker or move a vote of thanks. There is more information at my websitewww.tospec.comAs founder and president of TOSPEC I have so far spent $10,000 on office accommodation, staffing, furniture, office supplies and some of the equipment.The costs that remain are for a Mac Computer ($2,500), Pro Tools ($ 1100 ), a microphone and cables ($400), for a total of $4,000. The last of my needs is for $6,000 to underwrite the first six lectures in the first semester to begin March 22. The fee for each is $1,000. After that, the feescollected fromthe students should be sufficient to carry the lecturers. The first semester begins March 22.",The biggest risk in this enterprise  is that the fee-paying base will not develop quickly enough to underwrite payments to my lecturers who have doctorates in their disciplines.  We will work on the basis of a low starting scale to be upgraded as soon as funds permit. As president of the school I shall not be taking any salary in the first year of operation. The project is absolutely ready and  broadcasts will start as soon as  it is funded.  I do not anticipate any problems arising beyond the underwriting of lecturers' fees and if other problems arise I will have the advice and support of a board of  retired teachers and administrators that  I am now constituting.,https://www.kickstarter.com/projects/696200956/the-baptist-war?ref=discovery_category_newest,696200956/the-baptist-war,"The Baptist War is a play that tells the story of the 1831 slave rebellion in Jamaica that forced the 1834 emancipation.In December 1831, Samuel Sharpe, inspired by his Baptist faith, raised up 50,000 of his brothers in rebellion against the institution of plantation slavery. He was merciful to his enslavers but his rebellion destroyed thirty percent of Jamaica's sugar-producing capacity, and the British Government, afraid of a repitition of the Haitian Revolution, immediately took steps to bring plantation slavery to an end.The Baptist War is a story of faith, courage and superb organisation by a slave who had educated himself when given access to his master's library.I intend to do a short run of two hundred copies for circulation to schools to have it placed on their reading lists and to production houses to have them produce a film that should command as much attention as, ""Twelve Years a Slave""\","Once the play is funded there are no obstacles between funding and publication. The hard work begins in trying to persuade a production house to make it into a film. I intend to send copies to Steve McQueen, my brother from the Caribbean who directed,""Twelve Years a Slave."" My play belongs to the same genre and could give him his second blockbuster. As an alternative I shall  approach the Government of Jamaica to undertake the project as part of the celebration of the country's heroes. Samuel Sharpe is one of Jamaica's national heroes and I am Jamaican by birth.It will be a challenge also to have the schools add my play to their reading lists but that will be the lesser of the two challenges. I am a teacher and I expect the education establishment to support me both in the United States and in Jamaica."

To all of those who have did not have an easy childhood or who were bullied, to those who were and are alone I want to reach out and give them some hope.Good can come from broken �I am gay and my parents were not supportive, the same goes for my brothers. Over the years things have changed but that does not undo the time where I was alone and caught up in darkness. I got out of it but you know life is not a happy ending you have to keep fighting. I started watching this American television show called ""Once Upon a Time"" which basically deals with what if fairy tale characters were real people with real problems. My favourite character is The Evil queen by Lana Parrilla. Lana's portrayal of anger, frustration, pain but also humanity, redemption and vulnerability showed me how to deal with my own problems.Now I would like to give something back.  I have been in love with movies ever since I was ten years old and wrote my first script when I was 12.        (My YouTube channel is called CINEMA STUDIOS)Well, now I would like to contact LANA PARRILLA and name my next project after her quote: ""Good can come from broken""I want to speak up for all LGBTQ members and everybody who had or still has a hard time in life and give them HOPE.Please help to reach out for Lana as I would like her to give a speech at the end of the movie.""Good can come from broken"" was developed by Julian Weigert over the past two years and is going to be shot in Mid December 2016 in Berlin, Germany.

The actual story will have our hero traveling to different worlds using music to help dance along the story. Each issue will represent each song. Think Daft Punk 'Discovery' album, but more dialogue and detail. These Japanese influenced comics will be distributed at live shows and for digital download.

Also not being able to secure my reserved space at a few upcoming events makes it difficult to sell my items. With the right supplies I will get my inventory built up so I have enough to attend events with no worry. And with the ability to reserve my space at events I will be able to get my little business going again."

This petroleum based chemical food additive – that’s been approved by the FDA – is also found in products like brake fluid, acrylic paints, tile grout, primer, shoe polish, antifreeze, floor polish, tire sealant and sealant paste, according to Food Facts.org. It has been reported on Dr. Mercola.com that the following symptoms can arise after repeated small doses – throat irritation, headache, backache, and kidney problems. Furthermore, ingesting very large doses of this chemical can cause drowsiness, vomiting, respiratory failure, coma, convulsions, or can be fatal.Yes – you have to ingest a lot of this stuff to see some of these reactions – but is saying “death by a thousand cuts?” taking it too far? I don’t know – you decide. And why is this stuff in our birthday cakes anyway? Our mission is to provide healthier and more organic alternatives to our supermarket counterparts. Our community and most importantly our children deserves better!",With any and every bakery or restaurant food cost is a challenge. Its simple if something expires or damage its a waste. Producing fresh items is costly but worth every bit of quality. Pricing our items fair will help brigde the gap of cost control.,https://www.kickstarter.com/projects/tsnuthinbutcupcakes/ts-nuthin-but-cupcakes-bakery?ref=discovery_category_newest,tsnuthinbutcupcakes/ts-nuthin-but-cupcakes-bakery,We want to bring quality cupcakes to NWI.

I have a huge passion for not only scaring people but bringing forth a world in which people can explore with safety in mind.The difference between watching a scary movie and living one is quite obvious and a hallowe'en attraction allows people to really enjoy living the experience.Over the years I have made many sacrifices to get this project where it is today and I couldn't be happier. Patrons who visit the attraction are stunned because they usually aren't expecting it to be as theatrical and over the top as it it.I love expanding and adding to the maze each year, this is why it's gotten to be as big and popular as it is. This isn't a typical cheesy scare maze.The attraction features incredible booming sound, a ton of sets with professional movie quality props, unique lighting, somewhat of an open concept design and live scare-actor's.I am hoping that by using kickstarter I will be able to go full throttle and move the attraction to an arena or warehouse setting so that I can accommodate thousands of people throughout the sept and Oct season.My goal is to make this attraction the biggest and best scare maze in the world. It is the only one of it's kind which has made it such a popular destination for families and it has even brought patrons from hr long drives away.Plans to film a horror film within the maze are also in the plans as well.",There's really not much risk when it comes to something like this. People thrive for an experience like this and they are willing to pay for it as long as you make it awesome. I have proven that I can definitely bring in the people and I know that they will love it. This maze brings in everyone so I've noticed. Teens and adults love it.To really make the attraction for everyone We hold Daytime walkthroughs so that parent's can bring little toddlers through the maze during the day without any scares to see all the sets and it has become extremely popular. The challenges are another story. The amount of work and planning that goes into a project like this is tremendous! This is something for those with an iron soul. To really make a project like this work you must have an undying passion for it which I clearly do. I have made this maze my life's work and I'm just thankful that I have a team to help make it happen because the physical aspect of putting this monstrous project together is a unbelievable. The maze is constantly being worked on throughout the year especially when adding new things to the equation.,https://www.kickstarter.com/projects/197986806/grimm-grounds-halloween-attraction?ref=discovery_category_newest,197986806/grimm-grounds-halloween-attraction,"Grimm Grounds is a large theatrical horror maze filled with realistic props, an incredible sound system, live actor's and stage lighting.The Attraction has become a must visit destination and pulls in huge crowds every year. The maze has grown exponentially and so has it's fanbase.This year We are looking to make the much needed transition from traditional halogen stage lighting to L.E.D. stage lighting.The environmentally friendly transition is incredibly expensive but it is essential as We do care greatly about the environment.We have begun making this transition with New L.E.D. stage lighting which produces little to no heat and reduces power consumption by over 90% and for a maze this big it is definitely worth it.",There is little risk as this has become a powerhouse of an attraction. We are focusing as much as possible to make the attraction environmentally friendly as it is located in a outdoor setting amongst beautiful massive trees

https://www.kickstarter.com/projects/82349696/temple-animals-of-southeast-asia?ref=discovery_category_newest,82349696/temple-animals-of-southeast-asia,"In Southeast Asia, when someone is unable to care for their animals, they often leave them at the temples, where they know the monks will look after them. I began photographing the animals living at the temples on my first trip to Thailand in 2007, concentrating mainly on the temple cats. I plan to finish what I started by returning to Asia in January and photographing the temple dogs, monkeys, exotic birds and other animals that the monks look after.  When I return back to the states, I will shop around for a publisher who can create and distribute the kind of high-quality book I have in mind.  I've decided this project means too much to me to publish the book ""on the cheap"".  Consequently, it will be done professionally, not the type of self-published book that looks like it was printed at a department store.  But I can't do it alone.

Losing Faith is a gritty Action-Thriller-Love story about Joe Tyler, an Ex-undercover agent who turns to drink after losing his wife (Faith), his child, his job and his mind. The film has many twists and depths and will take you on an emotional roller-coaster as we experience the chaos and turmoil that is the life and mind of Joe Tyler. Joe is trying to get his life back on track but finds it hard what to do and who to trust. With corruption in the agency,the path Joe chooses could turn his life around, kill him or return him to wanting to kill himself.Soundtrack By 'Theia'http://theiauk.com/Joe, blaming himself for the loss of his family and Intent on self-destruction, puts himself into dangerous situations. For Joe, adrenaline; like the alcohol, numbs the pain. Fight Clubs, gambling, extreme sports, womanising and controlling. Joe knows how to keep people at a distanceafter allJoe knows getting too close proves painful.As his life starts spiralling out of control he receives a call from his old boss, Bill. He is offered the lifeline of a Job heading up a new specialist team for a big operation. Bill is reluctant, as taking on a loose cannon with a death wish could go either way, but he trusts Joe; they have history and Bill knows Joe is the best agent for the job.Joe's emotions are taken unawares as a new love interest enters his chaotic world. Can she be his saviour or will she just turn her back on the egotistical womanising drunk?Joe smells a rat.He suspects things aren't as the should be with the operation and goes on the run. It's Joe vs Agency now. Has he been set up again? Who has betrayed him this time? Bill? Karen? Molly?Car and motorbike chases, fight scenes with full on explosive action. If that is not enough for Joe an old enemy raises his head opening some deep and painful wounds and wants Joe's destruction.Redtrack Filmsis an independent small production company based in Swadlincote, South Derbyshire, England, created by Steve Wood.Losing Faith is an original story by Steve Wood, written by Sarah Wynne-Kordas and Rachel Tattersall. Losing Faith will be filmed local to the East Midlands and cast mainly from local talent. We have the use of a plane, jet skis, motorbikes, cars (to crash and blow up) and a boat. We have a pub to, a fight club, an aircraft hanger and many more fabulous locations. This film has loads of depths, twists and turns and a love story as well as loads of action.and has already some of the lead roles filled with some amazing established actors and some fantastic new UK talent. We will also be looking for over 200 extras and supporting actors from the local area.The film is now at the point where the locations have been confirmed and most of the main cast have been selected. We intend to start filming Summer 2017 over a ten week period in blocks of four days to get this film out to you ASAP. I am sure when this is made you will want to get this into your collection and watch it over and over again.Ok. So is the trailer perfect? No, Do we do the best with what we had and the experience we had? Maybe, We had £140 to buy a car sort locations and food so not too shabby. We also had things go wrong so some of the best shots did not work out and we had no budget to re-film.so next question does the trailer tell the story as I would have liked?No, Can we do better with a decent budget? Definitely.So it doesn't seem like a lot to make a full-length feature film, does it? Well, thanks to the generosity of many of the cast, crew and production team and the emphasis on collaboration and co-operation mean's that we have been able to keep the costs of this film to a bare minimum. Many of the production team, costume and location folk have donated their time and stock for the love of the story.So, Where is this money to be spent? Well, firstly we have the all important Insurance which is £1,400.00 we need this to cover all the kit and also the actors and crew especially when they are giving up their time for free. Also, Food which we have allowed £2 per meal per person, Travel at 40 pence per mile for all main cast and crew and equipment hire. Eg camera at £50 per day.Also, don't forget to like us on Facebook. We have a 'shop' section there where you can buy Losing Faith merchandise, All profits to go towards the funding of the film.https://www.facebook.com/LosingFaith8/Thank you for your interest and we hope to see your name on the contributor's list.Massive thanks again.Steve.","During making the trailer which was a big learning curve, we had a few problems which were down to lake of experience of what could go wrong however as we pretty much had no budget for the trailer and had over 30 people just no turn up I don't think we did too bad after all it finally cost £140 and that included food and a car we blow up. The main challenges of making a film are the weather, equipment faults and crew or actors not turning up or being late.We have a double crew on most of the days set and, apart from the main cast, we have are getting backup cast in case of illness or lateness. On days when the weather puts us off we have alternative shooting locations which are indoors. Most of the equipment we have, ie: cameras etc. have backups on batteries and as we have more than one of each on our hire budget we hope any problems will be quickly rectified.",https://www.kickstarter.com/projects/losingfaith/losing-faith-feature-film-0?ref=discovery_category_newest,losingfaith/losing-faith-feature-film-0,"We need to raise some funds to complete this project we have started filming and have the money for the camera hire and sound and lighting however as everyone whom is working on this is coming for free we must at least be able to cover some fuel costs and hotel bills.Losing Faith is an action Thriller written and directed by Steve Wood.The story revolves around Joe Tyler an ex- field agent in the agency Forseti, Joe's wife(Faith) and child have gone and he turn's to drink, subsequently he has lost his job and finds himself feeling depressed and on a road to destruction.

https://www.kickstarter.com/projects/northofboston/a-winters-day?ref=discovery_category_newest,northofboston/a-winters-day,"The winter of 2014-2015 is one that few in the New England are will soon forget. While it started on the unseasonable side -Christmas Day and the day after were quite warm and sunny-, January through March dictated otherwise. 105.7 inches of snow fell in the Boston area thanks to a succession of snowstorms and the occasional blizzard or two.While that is in no way the biggest snowfall of all time or even this past winter (Helloooo, Buffalo!), it was enough to paralyze an area used to getting about half of that during a normal winter. So relentless was the weather that all but the most ardent lover of the white stuff had to stop and take pause.Despite the headaches and inconveniences the winter of 2015 provided to New Englanders, it also presented opportunities. No, I'm not talking about plowing driveways to make money. I'm talking photography! With roads impassible during the storms and public transportation non-existent, I decided to bundle up, gear up and get out and walk around during several storms to capture my hometown of Melrose covered in snow while its citizens were nowhere to be found. While many people may think that the idea of going out during a blizzard to take pictures is a form of insanity, I find being in the middle of one form of nature's fury to be quite fun.A Winter's Day is a collection of these photos and more. A majority of the book were taken during the 2014-2015 winter season in Melrose and also on the Upper Cape during the Christmas/post-Christmas warm spell. In addition, images captured on the North Shore of Massachusetts in 2013 and early 2014 are also included in the collection. In its current form, the book will be a 75-80 page hardcover book, one that will allow people to relive the season without the added ""benefit"" of shoveling themselves out afterwards.Once completed, I plan on sellingA Winter's Day through several online venues. In addition to hopefully making the book available to local merchants, I also plan on selling A Winter's Day onblurb.com, Amazon.com,Apple's iBook store and on my own website, sfitzgeraldphoto.com . In addition to the book, I plan on making prints available on my website and am looking at the possibility of producing calendars and holiday cards to sell as well.In order to achieve all this, I do need financial backing. This is where I hope your contribution to my Kickstarter campaign will come in. I had a successful Kickstarter campaign back in 2013 with my first book North of Bostonthanks to a groundswell of support from the Kickstarter community. I couldn't have completed that project without your help, and I certainly will need it this time around as well. As with the North of Boston campaign, there will be different rewards for different contribution levels, including being listed in the actual book!","With all of the photos shot and the editing on the book well underway, there is little risk at hand here. If the project is not funded, the book will not be published beyond individual orders that come into the Blurb website. For a first publication, that's okay. But if you want to get your work -and name- out there you have to go bigger. Getting physical product into stores around the region and country is one of the best ways to do it.",https://www.kickstarter.com/projects/northofboston/help-get-my-new-photo-book-published?ref=discovery_category_newest,northofboston/help-get-my-new-photo-book-published,"My name is Shawn Fitzgerald. This fall, I completed work on my fourth collection of photography entitled Here, There and Elsewhere. It's a 104-page collection of photos I took of various locations from Boston, Massachusetts to Bar Harbor, Maine, over the past four years.The project took me a few years to complete, but the final product was well worth the time and effort. I uploaded the project to the self-publishing site Blurb a week ago. Unfortunately, self-publishing costs are through the roof, especially for a book of this size and one that needs to be printed on Premium lustre paper. The amount Blurb is charging has forced me to put a rather prohibitive $125 price tag on the book, which is far too much to ask for any book these days (I have also created an Ebook edition of the book at a far more reasonable price). So instead of charging an arm and a leg to sell the book on Blurb's bookstore -where the chances of selling the book are slim to none-, I am looking to go local. I hope to do a print run of Here, There and Elsewhere and get the book into local bookstores around New England. I have already spoken to a few establishments on the North Shore of Massachusetts as well as on Cape Cod who are interested in carrying the book. Placing an order with Blurb for 50-100 pieces lower the costs considerably and make the book far more attractive to potential buyers than a $125 price tag.This is where you can help. In backing this project, you will not only help me get my work out to the public, you'll also be supporting locally owned bookstores. Of course, there are several rewards for this project: an 8x11"" print, a set of postcards, the Ebook edition of Here, There and Elsewhere and, of course, a signed copy of the Hardcover edition.Should you choose to contribute $125, you will also become part of the book. Those who choose the $125 reward will receive all the aforementioned items. In addition, if they wish to -you are certainly more than welcome to remain anonymous-, they will also have their name added to the ""Special Thanks"" section of the hardcover edition. The special thanks section will only happen if I reach my fundraising goal.I have made a video comprised of photos found in the book. I hope you will check it out and I also hope you will help me reach my fundraising goal.Thank you for your time and consideration! ","There isn't much of a risk outside of the books not selling. The photos have been shot, edited and locked into place. The text has been written, rewritten and edited as well. And, depending on what reward you choose, you will own your very own copy of the book, one that will be a) signed and b) have your name included in the ""Special Thanks"" section at the end of the book!"

My name is Jenna and I am from a small town in Iowa. I am 28, a mother of 3 and a plus size model.(yes this is really me)As you can tell, I have piercings, tattoos and I am not your average sized model. I am 5'10 and 220lbs.Ever since I decided I wanted to be a model, I was constantly criticized because of my weight, tattoos and my piercings.Here are a couple of my modeling photos.After years of being put down for the way I look, I had a revelation... I refused to be put down anymore and I wanted to show the world that I WAS good enough to follow my dreams. That day, I vowed to take a stand against all the prejudice and bullying and I started my own magazine called Perfectly Defected.It's a magazine about being who you are and loving yourself because everyone is so different. ""We're all perfect, even if society thinks we're a little Defected.""Now, I am on a new project with the same mission. I want to keep showing the world what real beauty is and taking a silent stand against bullying.I am starting a project called ""In Curves We Trust"". What it will entail is women of all shapes and sizes baring it all in showing that they are proud of who they are and refuse to be stereotyped on who says they can be beautiful. The goal is to raise money to put together a photographic book of women of all sizes promoting self esteem no matter what size people say they should be. The book is also about combating bullying about what people look like and promotes self acceptance and acceptance of others from all walks of life. The funds will be used for printing and publishing, as well as organizing studio space to shoot the models and backdrops needed. Here are some samples as my work as a photographer:These are just a couple samples of my work not the project itself.The goal of this project is to bring national attention to this issue by getting my photo journal published and for every woman to start taking a stand no matter her size and be proud and love herself for who she is, not who she thinks society wants her to be.I truly hope that you will see this project with as much passion as I do and join my cause. Through out the process I will updating with different photo shoots so you can see the progress I am making and start to get a better knowledge of how this project will inspire so many people and see this composition come together.","There are always risks when it comes to doing a project like this. I believe my biggest obstacle would be to finding people with enough courage to take part of the photo shoots. I do have quite a bit of support from a lot of my friends and I have had a lot of people come up to me and say they would be willing to do the project. The best way I can overcome these challenges is to encourage people to stand up for what they believe in and I think once people see that bullying is a much bigger issue than just school age children, I believe more and more people will want to get involved in bringing awareness to it."

https://www.kickstarter.com/projects/1247610863/solar-distillation?ref=discovery_category_newest,1247610863/solar-distillation,"About Us:We are two Architecture students who attend the University of Arizona in Tucson, AZ. After watching many documentaries on global events and developing world countries, it occurred to us that one of the largest problems they're facing can be fixed with our aid. We set out to start researching various ways people have tried to help and expand upon them. After determining that Solar Distillation is the cheapest and easiest way to accomplish this task, the development process began. We have many models (both physical and graphical) that only become more successful with each iteration!As the project goes on, we will share photos and videos so any and all donors can see where their contributions are going and how each and every one of you are helping the lives of millions around the world!Introduction:Many of us take clean drinking water for granted, because getting a glass of pure water is usually as simple as turning on the faucet. In developing countries or in survival situations, however, fresh, clean water is a luxury.Solar distillation is a means of converting contaminated (turbid) or brackish water into potable water. According to the World Health Organization, nearly 1 billion people lack access to safe drinking water; 2 million people die every year from diarrhea, caused by the bacteria in the water.Solar Distillation is an excellent method for most of these developing world countries, because they fall along the two solar belts. These solar belts receive the highest amount of solar energy and heat on earth; perfect for removing bacteria from brackish water.Process:The solar distillation process produces potable water much the way that nature produces rain. The sun's heat causes water to evaporate, separating the water vapor from salt or impurities. This water vapor condenses on the still for collection for use.For our particular project, the models encompass a triangular shaped reservoir (for the dirty water) within a larger, triangular shaped housing. This shape allows for the dirty water to evaporate and collect on the roof of the housing, dripping down the sides into the collection area underneath. From there, the water is transported through piping into a holding tank for use. Each one of these housings are approx. 6 feet long and are interchangeable incase of damage. These units can lock together and form a larger mass area, providing shade for occupants below. Each unit can also be secured to the top of buildings and structures.The unit itself is divided in half with the use of a black, heat absorbing material. This allows for maximum sunlight through the top for potentially 12+ hours a day of sunlight. The bottom portion is encased with a dark material that absorbs the heat from the sunlight and keeps the water at a near boil to enhance the efficiency of removing 99.9% of bacteria.The above image is a concept that has undergone many trial runs and a strenuous iterative development process. Currently we are working on a large-scale unit that will be the actual size of 6ft. long by 18in. wide and 8in deep.Facts:There's nothing we've done more of then our research. The following facts have been accumulated from books, articles, and many health organizations websites.- It takes 6 hours in direct sunlight to cleanse any amount of water no deeper then 4in.- It takes 2 consecutive days to cleanse any amount of water no deeper then 4in. whenit's overcast.- When raining, collect the rainwater. The earth has naturally cleansed the water.- The optimum depth of water for Solar Distillation is 3in. and no more then 4in.- Turbid water causes more then 2 million deaths annually due to diarrhea.- PET plastics (water bottles and such) are the number one solar radiation blockers and will be used as the top of the housing.Above is one of the first iterations. Since this one, we have raised the roof in a triangular fashion like the bottom. We have also flattened the bottom portion out more to encompass a larger collection area!Your Contribution:Any and all contributions will only go towards the development process of this apparatus (ie. the purchase of materials). We are currently in the stage of finding the happy medium between materiality and productivity.","Challenges:- Finding the optimum materiality. As we move into a greener world, we are consistently trying to find better ways to accomplish our goals while using recycled and non-harmful materials.- Finding the balance between materiality and productivity. We want our materials to work well with the process and not take away from the ultimate goal of cleaning turbid water.- Using materials that cost very little. As we all know, developing world countries are not among the wealthiest so we need to find a perfect balance to accomplish our goals on a tight budget.",https://www.kickstarter.com/projects/1247610863/a-little-color-book?ref=discovery_category_newest,1247610863/a-little-color-book,"The ""A Little Color Book"" started as a group of architecture students sitting around, drawing intriguing optical illusions and graphics. After consideration, we decided to come together, acetone our drawings onto thick 4-ply(1/32"" thick) paper and bind them in groups or 5 to 10 pages for your artistic pleasure!The book is meant to open, remove each color page individually, color them with anything from color pencils/ crayons/ watercolors/ paints/ or any other medium, then hang on the wall/ desk at work/ fridge/ or anywhere! Individual matte-board frames can be purchased separately in a multitude of colors to attach to the back of every completed color page.We are working on the collection of images right now for the final production of the book. Also, we are still designing the cover to remain elegant and beautiful!","Acquiring the right material for the covers: This was an issue for a while because most craft wood is too weak or normal lumber yard wood is too thick. We solved this issue by finding a high grade craft wood that's only 1/8"" thick and is durable enough for daily use.The second issue is the binding. After doing extensive research on other bindings online, we came to the agreement that a simple yet elegant single bolt and nut design on the upper left hand corner is the cheapest, more attractive way to bind all pages to the covers and provide a way to open the book/ take pages out."

To do that, we need to set up production with enough volume that the setup costs become practical. With your help, we can make these kittens a reality! If you pledge for a reward on the right side of the page, you can help us meet our goal, and in exchange, you will get some adorable kittens of your own - just in time for the holidays. You can give these as gifts, or just hoard them for yourself.All Kitten pairs are the same dimensions, about 1.4"" tall, and 0.3"" thick. Check out all the information below to find our more! All of the images are of our prototype kittens from the last year. The final kittens will have some small differences, most notably a thicker tail base to make them more durable if mishandled.You are on kickstarter.com. This is a website that allows people to back a project so that it may come to fruition. This is not a store. When you back a project here, such as our kittens, you are doing so in the hopes that many other people will also back it, so we can both complete our project, and deliver the rewards we have promised our generous backers. In our case the project and the rewards are one in the same, which could be a source of confusion for some. So to be as blunt as possible: these kittens are not made yet. We've shown you some prototypes and samples, but the kittens in your rewards are not done. What this means to you is that while we will take every possible action to ensure that kittens are delivered on time should this project make its goal, there is still a very small but real chance they could be late. This becomes more of a worry as the project gets more backers. So in advance, we thank you for your patience, and hope for smooth sailing ahead.","This is a fairly low risk project on a technical level. The most challenging aspect is packaging and delivering to potentially thousands of backers, and dealing with replacements of any kittens that may arrive to the backer injured. We have made sure that only the items we know are hassle free are promised to be delivered for the holidays. Some of our ""level up"" kitten breeds are more complex and thus have later ship dates.",https://www.kickstarter.com/projects/1200711058/crystal-bones-anatomically-precise-human-jaws-in-g?ref=discovery_category_newest,1200711058/crystal-bones-anatomically-precise-human-jaws-in-g,"Peter Zips has been creating glass sculptures for some of the most famous glass artists in Canada for decades, but rarely does he put his own name to a piece. Today is an opportunity to support him in the creation of a new series of crystal sculptures and help shine some light on a vanishing art form.This limited edition run of lead crystal glass jaws, reproduced in exact detail from a real human specimen, are to be the kick off in a series of short run small format sculpture projects with a wide variety of subject matter. Depending on the success of this run, we hope to create many more intriguing objects of desire.We need your help to launch the first piece in a small volume run. Your backing money will go to improving our silicone mold for the wax patterns, and streamlining the casting and finishing process to helps bring the price down to levels people can afford. In return you can choose your reward from the right side of the page in the form of an art piece like no other.The Creation ProcessThe process for creating these jaws is not a simple one. We first start with a master - in the case of our prototypes, it was a plastic casting off a real human jaw. We chose to use the plastic rather the the original because there was less risk of damage, and it had all the detail of the real thing.From there, we create a silicone mold of the plastic jaw, which is reinforced with plaster so the shape is rigidly maintained. We use this mold to create a jaw in a dedicated casting wax. We then set a few of these wax jaws onto a surface and build a box around them. The box is filled with a refractory plaster and left to set. The mold is upended, and steam is used to melt out every last trace of wax. It is critical that no wax is left behind, or there will be bubbles and divots in the final casting. We now have our mold to make a glass jaw.The mold is set into the kiln, and a reservoir is attached to the top, which is filled with glass pieces or billets. Larger pieces are preferred as they trap less bubbles of air. The glass we use is from Gaffer in New Zealand, a 50% lead crystal. The high lead content makes the glass flow into every corner of the mold, and raises the index of refraction for a brilliant gem like appearance.The kiln is fired for several days on a computer controlled heating and cooling cycle. When the pieces are removed, the plaster is broken off gently by hand, and the piece washed. Excess glass from the sprue is ground off, and the resulting piece is soaked in a solution of hydrofluoric acid which gives it a satin sheen, and then washed one last time.The result is what you see below, a near perfect recreation on the original jaw with every dimple, crack and fissure.ColoursFor this project we have chosen 3 colours of glass for our main pieces.The optically clear is a true colourless glass. Most other clear glasses have a subtle or not so subtle hint of green or blue. Any of the colour you see in the image below is a refraction of something else in the room.Blood red is an unusual colour. on thinner sections it appears amber, on thicker ones a deep red. It will also change significantly based on the lighting and angle you view it. With the fine texture of this piece it can have a blood like appearance - hence the name. Cobalt blue is a deep true blue, and we think the most beautiful and striking colour for this particular piece. As you can see in the photos, the colour can be quite vivid under the right lighting conditions. Gaffer Glass has an array of colours available for the limited edition jaw rewards, and you may choose any one you like. Be aware that the photos on the website - of large thick polished billets - may not give a true representation of what they will look like in this sculpture.When you are ready to choose a colour after funding is complete, Peter will be able to guide you into making the right choice based on his experiences using the glass.StandsThe stands for these jaws are a simple plinth made from wood or metal, and complement the organic nature of the glass pieces. The stand will be laser engraved with information on the piece, with the option of custom engraving on limited edition rewards. If the project is funded, we will show some images of a few different stand designs, and let our backers choose which one they like best.FracturedFractured is a one off piece with some unique and unrepeatable properties. This Skull was Fried for 7 days in the kiln and an intense 1550 degrees Fahrenheit. During the cool down process, the skull shattered into a hundreds of pieces inside it's plaster mold, and re-fused together. The result is a skull that captures and plays with light like no other, and gives the impression of severe head trauma due to the spider-web like cracks spreading from the top.This skull is truly one of a kind and the ultimate reward for the ultimate backer at a fraction of the gallery price.This Skull will be supplied with a pedestal stand fashioned from hardwood, steel and copper, and will be packaged safely for transit in a wooden crate. ","Risks in this project mostly surround timely delivery to the customer. Glass is delivered from New Zealand to Canada in bulk by boat, and the firing process takes several days for a single batch of jaws, with a small but significant failure rate. For this reason we have restricted our reward volume, and have left a safe timeline to delivery.Being a glass item, there is also a small chance of damage in shipping, even with the best of packaging. Extra rewards must be made to accommodate the replacement of any damaged items in short order.We hope our backers are understanding in case of any minor delays."

DOCo has specific Domains for certain types of thoughts, consciousness, or notes, giving you the opportunity to create a context as soon as you open the app. This facilitates ease of storage and retrieval in the moments when you really need to get to something you notated previously, a journal entry with a video of a favorite moment or when you what to transcribe something quick but need it to be in specific place .  We have always felt that taking notes, journaling or as we say mindscaping should be done in medium that is comparative of a vision board or grease board, where you create the layout. Creating your own layout when taking notes, adding photos or transcribing ideas makes the process more personal, creates a visual adherence to how you’re feeling in that moment, and facilitates a deeper connection to what you’ve done.DOCo is the beginning of a new way to create store, interact, and retrieve notes, thoughts, vision boards, ideas and more.

Autonomia does all of this in the background while you are performing a workout. This is made possible through underlying technologies such as ML-machine learning, core motion,and some other API’s which gather from your movements, activities and workout performances. Autonomia will constantly learn from your workout behaviors and progress and update all metrics related to exercises and activities, as well as create suggestions for future workouts and focus points that will help you achieve goals & higher levels of fitness.Where did the idea for this app come from?The app is a combination of thoughts, both past and present? Being a personal trainer for some years, I often wondered how could I train, give motivation, and health information to thousands of people at once but interactively? Now as a coder and Developer with an avid and active health and fitness lifestyle, my question became how can I create a fitness program, that evolves as I do? For most people, Time is of the essence and the effort it takes to create a program with all the workouts needed, in addition to the time spent in the gym adjusting and writing down metrics, can be time consuming.So I decided to create Autonomia.What is the purpose of the Autonomia?The purpose of autonomia is the be a fitness companion in your lifestyle.  Autonomously tracking your fitness performance and activity and then providing you with corresponding assessments and performance metrics. Providing you with, Quotes that motivate and help maintain a positive and energetic outlook on life, as well motivating you during a workout when challenges arise, and offering Health & Nutrition tips and facts that increases your knowledge base.What are the core features?Primary feature : performance tracking - of learned exercises, which monitors exercise form and, performance units like: Sets, Reps, Stability, Power, Balance, Stroke, and Form among some other metrics you all ready know like distance, time, calories, heart rate and general activities.Secondary feature 1: fitness suggestions - the app can create programs and workouts based on the users goals and/ or exercise performances. Note : suggestions evolve overtimeSecondary feature 2: situational feedback - while monitoring your workout performances the app will give the user feedback based on the situation. For example: the user has a watch on and an iPhone on there side. While performing a set of squats the user at rep 5 during altitude ascension, starts leaning forward past the upright position the app will generate haptic feedbacks for the watch and iPhone respectively that indicate a direction to move the Upperbody and Lower Torso to reposition. Once repositioned the user will hear a chime from their earbuds or device. Following the set the user will receive a notification from the app assessing what was detected in the performance.How does the app recognize and measure movement data?The app comes with a CoreDataBase of learned exercises and trained data. It’s uses a combination of fitness coding logic, information about anatomy and physiology, and ML-machine learning, and algorithms to evaluate movement data. It also takes into account the exercises that you explicitly teach it to measure your own progress of that exercise over time. Which exercises does the app provide?For users with iPhone 7,8,X + Plus and watch 1-3 series?Exercises from:CrossFit, Functional Training, Weightlifting, Running, Swimming(if Watch 3 series), Spin + Cycling, Yoga.We look forward to adding more exercises in the future.note:the user can teach the app any exercise they have createdWhat is the ultimate goal for Autonomia?The ultimate goal of Autonomia is to have the trained data of exercises from every fitness discipline, allowing users to have a companion trainer that can help them create programs to advance to peak performance in any fitness discipline. Your support will help take this app for the prototype phase to its completion and app release. Above are the incentives that will help us achieve a successful campaign there by being able to create an app that we believe will pioneer how fitness apps should be; a companion in your fit lifestyle.We thank you for your support in advance.","One potential challenge that could arise is the compiling of learned exercises and trained data, but I am confident that my team will be able to execute the task and if need be deliver a viable exercise database by app delivery date and update the data to its desired threshold shortly after. We will keep all backers up to date on the progress, if this becomes a kinetic challenge."

A live action role-playing game is a form of role-playing game where the participants physically act out their characters' actions. The players pursue their characters' goals within a fictional setting represented by the real world, while interacting with one another in character. The outcome of player actions may be mediated by game rules, or determined by consensus between players.The first LARPs were run in the late 1970s, inspired by role-playing games and genre fiction. The activity gained international popularity during the 1980s, and has diversified into wide variety of styles. Play may be very game-like, or may be more concerned with dramatic or artistic expression. The fictional genres used vary greatly, from realistic modern or historical settings to fantastic or futuristic eras. Production values are sometimes minimal, but can involve elaborate venues and costumes. LARPs range in size from small private events lasting a few hours to huge public events with thousands of players lasting for several days.We are After the Sun Sets Games. Our plan is to return the fun of LARPing to its place as the thing to do after dark at conventions. In the past few years the time and space commitment made it harder to have such events at conventions. The World of Darkness and its range of monsters and magic have stood the test of time and we want to return the after dark Larp life to its grand level again. The Sunset to Sunrise event is but the first of many events in the setting of White Wolf’s World of Darkness world. With the support of players like you, storytellers like After the Sunsets Games can once again help each of you to enjoy and get involved with after dark Larping at cons. We at After the Sun Sets Games would like to bring new and entertaining aspects to playing in our Larps. For one those that would like to simplify the paper, rock, scissors aspect we will be making cards that can be drawn for it as well as cards used for several other aspects of the Larping event. For those that have a hard time putting down the phone in hand, we will be working on apps that can keep your character info at but a swipe and be updated with new items and experience points so you no longer have to fold up a character sheet in your back pocket to reference.What makes us different.Players will be able to immerse themselves in a historical setting, portraying the World of Darkness in the year 1066. They will be able to play vampires, changelings and were-creatures. An after the sun has set World of Darkness Larp was often a fixture in the past at DragonCon, but in recent years it had disappeared. The Storytellers of After the Sun Sets Games hope to rekindle that spark. Many long time aficionados even gave up going to the convention with its loss. We want to bring it back and do so in a grand way with a great story and people dressing up for the parts, having a good time.This first adventure will be run at DragonCon, and hopefully continuing on in future years if successful, with players being able to continue their character stories from year to year if they would like. DragonCon is held in Atlanta, Labor Day weekend every year. This year the game will be held in the Westin Hotel, on August 30, 31 and September 1st. You must have a DragonCon membership to participate. You can buy them on site or on the DragonCon site.Event one Sunset to Sunrise follows the aftermath of the Battle of Hastings and the difficult peace forged just after by those that are not normal humans.The Battle of Hastings was fought on 14 October 1066 between the Norman-French army of William, the Duke of Normandy, and an English army under the Anglo-Saxon King Harold Godwinson, beginning the Norman conquest of England. It took place approximately 7 miles (11 kilometres) northwest of Hastings, close to the present-day town of Battle, East Sussex, and was a decisive Norman victory.The background to the battle was the death of the childless King Edward the Confessor in January 1066, which set up a succession struggle between several claimants to his throne. Harold was crowned king shortly after Edward's death, but faced invasions by William, his own brother Tostig, and the Norwegian King Harald Hardrada (Harold III of Norway). Hardrada and Tostig defeated a hastily gathered army of Englishmen at the Battle of Fulford on 20 September 1066, and were in turn defeated by Harold at the Battle of Stamford Bridge five days later. The deaths of Tostig and Hardrada at Stamford Bridge left William as Harold's only serious opponent. While Harold and his forces were recovering, William landed his invasion forces in the south of England at Pevensey on 28 September 1066 and established a beachhead for his conquest of the kingdom. Harold was forced to march south swiftly, gathering forces as he went.The exact numbers present at the battle are unknown; modern estimates are around 10,000 for William and about 7,000 for Harold. The composition of the forces is clearer; the English army was composed almost entirely of infantry and had few archers, whereas only about half of the invading force was infantry, the rest split equally between cavalry and archers. Harold appears to have tried to surprise William, but scouts found his army and reported its arrival to William, who marched from Hastings to the battlefield to confront Harold. The battle lasted from about 9 am to dusk. Early efforts of the invaders to break the English battle lines had little effect; therefore, the Normans adopted the tactic of pretending to flee in panic and then turning on their pursuers. Harold's death, probably near the end of the battle, led to the retreat and defeat of most of his army.In our version of the World of Darkness many of the forces on all sides were the varied things of the World of Darkness Setting, such as Vampires, Changelings, and Were-creatures. In the aftermath of this battle one of the most elder Vampires of Great Britain sent messages to the varied special things demanding they send forth members to meet with him in the ruins of the City of York. The 2019 Dragoncon game will be starting with this meeting and all that follows will stem from its possible chaos.The Prime Storyteller is Sam Levine, who also organized and created the successful Lord of the Rings Larp in 2001. Other storytellers will be assisting so that there should be lots of fun for everyone. Several plot-lines have evolved that should create quite an epic story.Sunset to Sunrise is a Live Action Role Playing Game set in the World of Darkness Setting and Rules by White Wolf Games and Onix Publishing.Rules system for this game are from By Night Studios.We hope to supply all players with items to make the game play easier like laminated cards for Paper, Rock, Scissors. Which is used to randomize outcomes in many Larp settings, as well as enhanced props for use in the game. A laminated copy of character sheet for keepsake and future use for those that get characters for the full game. It is also helpful to have more of the system gaming books to ease the flow if there are any rule questions.If we get full funding, we will be able to provide drinks and refreshments in the gaming area for players for all the three nights on the game. We’re considering water, soda and energy drinks as well as easy snacks.You can explore the setting and character building at After the Sun sets Games for more details. We focus on LARPs, and our goal is for you, the player to have the best fun you can while still being human.Every Dollar helps when it comes to getting a LARP going.

Please join in with us and all fellow LARPers to get this going strong.Thank You,Sam Levine, Head Storyteller, aka Harkin the Gangrel childer of Odin, The All-High - Gangrel MethuselahTwitter is @after_sets",There are many small expenses for a LARP run over several days at a Convention.  We have run LARPS in the past and at a loss just so we could have a good time.  If we don't get what we need to make it great it will still happen but not to the level we all want it to be.,https://www.kickstarter.com/projects/sunset-sunrise/after-the-sun-sets-games-larp-events?ref=discovery_category_newest,sunset-sunrise/after-the-sun-sets-games-larp-events,"(Continued from 2019 Dragoncon)“Greetings unto the gathered Kindred, Faeries, Sons, and Daughters of Merlin and Beasts of Gaia. I, Harkin son of Odin, (Sam Levine) do hereby congratulate you on surviving the Battles for England. Three mortal men and those that followed them have battled in this Land and now one stands victor. William will change England and its people and all of us will be affected as well. I will no longer rule over the Kindred that comes to or are sired in this land. Though I will hunt down those that cross the rules we set to keep the land from darkness and fallen. You have been chosen by your kind to stand above others of the same, or are all that remains of that kind. Be you cursed of Heaven or Gaia's servants, you will start together in the face of any that challenge the Lands you now share with me.”(2021 Dragoncon Game)LarpingLarping (or LARPing) is short for ""Live Action Role-Playing"". A live-action role-playing game is a form of role-playing game where the participants physically act out their characters' actions. The players pursue their characters' goals within a fictional setting represented by the real world while interacting with one another in character. The outcome of player actions may be mediated by game rules, or determined by consensus between players.The first LARPs were run in the late 1970s, inspired by role-playing games and genre fiction. The activity gained international popularity during the 1980s and has diversified into a wide variety of styles. Play may be very game-like or may be more concerned with dramatic or artistic expression. The fictional genres used vary greatly, from realistic modern or historical settings to fantastic or futuristic eras. Production values are sometimes minimal but can involve elaborate venues and costumes. LARPs range in size from small private events lasting a few hours to huge public events with thousands of players lasting for several days.We are After the Sun Sets Games. Our plan is to return the fun of LARPing to its place as the thing to do after dark at conventions. In the past few years, the time and space commitment made it harder to have such events at conventions. The World of Darkness and its range of monsters and magic have stood the test of time and we want to return the after dark Larp life to its grand level again. The Sunset to Sunrise event is one of many events in the setting of White Wolf’s World of Darkness world. With the support of players like you, storytellers like After the Sun Sets Games can once again help each of you to enjoy and get involved with after dark Larping at cons. We at After the Sun Sets Games would like to bring new and entertaining aspects to playing in our Larps. For one of those that would like to simplify the paper, rock, scissors aspect we will be making cards that can be drawn for it as well as cards used for several other aspects of the Larping event. For those that have a hard time putting down the phone in hand, we will be working on apps that can keep your character info at but a swipe and be updated with new items and experience points so you no longer have to fold up a character sheet in your back pocket to reference.What makes us different.Players will be able to immerse themselves in a historical setting, portraying the World of Darkness in the year 1068. They will be able to play vampires, changelings, and were-creatures. An after the sun has set World of Darkness Larp was often a fixture in the past at DragonCon, but in recent years it had disappeared. The Storytellers of After the Sun Sets Games hope to rekindle that spark. Many long time aficionados even gave up going to the convention with its loss. We want to bring it back and do so in a grand way with a great story and people dressing up for the parts, having a good time.This first adventure will be run at DragonCon, and hopefully continuing on in future years if successful, with players being able to continue their character stories from year to year if they would like. DragonCon is held in Atlanta, Labor Day weekend every year. This year the game will be held in the Westin Hotel, on September 3rd, 4th and 5th. You must have a DragonCon membership to participate in. You can buy them on-site or on the DragonCon site.Event one was Sunset to Sunrise followed the aftermath of the Battle of Hastings and the difficult peace forged just after by those that are not normal humans.The Battle of Hastings was fought on 14 October 1066 between the Norman-French army of William, the Duke of Normandy, and an English army under the Anglo-Saxon King Harold Godwinson, beginning the Norman conquest of England. It took place approximately 7 miles (11 kilometres) northwest of Hastings, close to the present-day town of Battle, East Sussex, and was a decisive Norman victory.The background to the battle was the death of the childless King Edward the Confessor in January 1066, which set up a succession struggle between several claimants to his throne. Harold was crowned king shortly after Edward's death, but faced invasions by William, his own brother Tostig, and the Norwegian King Harald Hardrada (Harold III of Norway). Hardrada and Tostig defeated a hastily gathered army of Englishmen at the Battle of Fulford on 20 September 1066, and were in turn defeated by Harold at the Battle of Stamford Bridge five days later. The deaths of Tostig and Hardrada at Stamford Bridge left William as Harold's only serious opponent. While Harold and his forces were recovering, William landed his invasion forces in the south of England at Pevensey on 28 September 1066 and established a beachhead for his conquest of the kingdom. Harold was forced to march south swiftly, gathering forces as he went.The exact numbers present at the battle are unknown; modern estimates are around 10,000 for William and about 7,000 for Harold. The composition of the forces is clearer; the English army was composed almost entirely of infantry and had few archers, whereas only about half of the invading force was infantry, the rest split equally between cavalry and archers. Harold appears to have tried to surprise William, but scouts found his army and reported its arrival to William, who marched from Hastings to the battlefield to confront Harold. The battle lasted from about 9 am to dusk. Early efforts of the invaders to break the English battle lines had little effect; therefore, the Normans adopted the tactic of pretending to flee in panic and then turning on their pursuers. Harold's death, probably near the end of the battle, led to the retreat and defeat of most of his army.In 1068 the setting for the third Sunset to Sunrise, William I of England is an established and methodical King. Morcar leads a revolt in Northumbria. William orders the construction of new castles at Warwick, Nottingham, Lincoln, Huntingdon, Cambridge, and York.In our version of the World of Darkness, many of the forces on all sides were the varied things of the World of Darkness Setting, such as Vampires, Changelings, and Were-creatures. In the aftermath of this battle, one of the most elder Vampires of Great Britain sent messages to the varied special things demanding they send forth members to meet with him in the ruins of the City of York.The Prime Storyteller is Sam Levine, who also organized and created the successful Lord of the Rings Larp in 2001. Other storytellers will be assisting so that there should be lots of fun for everyone. Several plot-lines have evolved that should create quite an epic story.Sunset to Sunrise is a Live Action Role Playing Game set in the World of Darkness Setting and Rules by White Wolf Games and Onix Publishing.The rules system for this game is from By Night Studios.We hope to supply all players with items to make the gameplay easier like laminated cards for Paper, Rock, Scissors. Which is used to randomize outcomes in many Larp settings, as well as enhanced props for use in the game. A laminated copy of the character sheet for keepsake and future use for those that get characters for the full game. It is also helpful to have more of the system gaming books to ease the flow if there are any rule questions.If we get full funding, we will be able to provide drinks and refreshments in the gaming area for players for all three nights on the game. We’re considering water, soda, and energy drinks as well as easy snacks.You can explore the setting and character-building After the Sun sets Games for more details. We focus on LARPs, and our goal is for you, the player to have the best fun you can while still being human.Every dollar helps when it comes to getting a LARP going.

We at After the Sun sets Games have no control over what Dragoncon or Megacon is able to host.

I believe that art and entertainment should reflect the world that we live in, so my stories and characters will always reflect and include everyone from within our world. That being said, I hope that all people from all walks of life can identify with someone or several of my rich characters from the stories that i write, the tales that i weave and the vision that I'm creating in the purist form of art . SEAN URIEL ARIEL ZAZRIEL PEGASUS SEAN URIEL ARIEL ZAZRIEL PEGASUS This story starts out with a character named Sean who wakes up to a loud crash outside of his bedroom window one rainy early morning.   He rushes out to check to see what happened only to see a car wrapped around a tree in front of his neighbor’s house. He also notices a trail of blood leading from the car all the way up to his neighbors stair case and into the house.  Normally Sean wouldn't walk into a house like this but something supernatural or even fate, called and pulled him towards and into the house. He enters and he finds two young girls eating his neighbor’s blood, guts and all. He tries to escape so he doesn't end up like his neighbor but he fails miserably at his attempt for freedom.  He also finds out the little girls were not just there for a quick meal, but they came to collect his soul.   Suddenly a loud sound of thunder rings throughout the house and then an Angel of lightning called Barachiel appears out of no where and strikes the the two girls with several lightning bolts.BarachielBarachiel  With his mighty power and presence he sends the two demon spawns running and rescues Sean from certain death. Barachiel then takes Sean with him only to find out that he was implanted with something from the demons called a ""Soul eater"" which eats the vessel's body until it reaches the soul.  Once it reaches the soul it absorbs the soul and keeps it trapped inside of its body and then goes back to its master who ordered it do to so. Its very easy for the Soul eater to eat the body but it is not so easy for it to obtain the soul.  So it makes the host lose all ability and will to live through dreams, illusions and using their fears against them to lower their guard. Once they have fully given up the Soul eater leave the the host body and materialize in a monstrous form and the consumes their body whole. Sean almost falls victim to the Soul eater's tricky but he doesn't, and he is given a second chance at life from the angel Barachiel.  He accepts the second chance at life and is transformed into something higher then his previous human form of existence. Barachiel gives him a red shiny ruby which is absorbed into his Sean's right hand and it begins his new transformation. Barachiel does one better by giving Sean one of his two Katana to destroy the Soul eater.Sean in his new armorSean in his new armor  Now with a new black armor that encases his entire body and a Katana powered by lightning made from minerals of heavens, Sean destroys the Soul eater.  He then embarks on journey with uncertainty and wonders why he was given a second chance at life by the angel. He also meets another angel and her name is Uriel. Uriel is the light of god and she Wields a fiery straight sword and she controls a fiery phoenix that comes from the phoenix that's in engraved in the breastplate of her the armor. She also uses her phoenix to finish off her foes in the heat of battle. Uriel is also hiding a secret from Sean and she knows why he was given his second chance at life but this will kept secret from him for sometime.    As the story progresses and evolves, you meet other characters like Ronald who’s wife was killed horribly and children taken afterwards by something monstrous and not of this world. Those past events and even more past events will shape Ronald's outlook on life and make him fight for the weak and those who cannot defend themselves from  evils of the world.Ronald and KasdeyaRonald and KasdeyaRonald also has a secret because before his wife and children came into the picture, a Fallen angel by the name of Kasdeya was put inside of him.  Ronald’s soul and spirit were attached together by an Arc angel called Suryal and now both Ronald and Kasdeya are intertwined in a strange twist of fate.  This was the cause of an encounter Ronald had with Kasdeya after a near death experience years ago while in college.   There is also a character called Moon who is one of Ronald’s best and closes of friends. The two met after Ronald's wife was murdered and he went looking for his children. He was asked by Suryal to help Ronald find his children.  He is a samurai by spirit and loving person by nature  and he also happens to be blind. He lost his sight when he was as a young child when he wondered off by himself while in morocco on vacation with his family.  Moon and IfritMoon and Ifrit  An ancient demon killed his dog and tried to consume Moon as well, when suddenly an Ifrit came from a nearby flame to his rescue and saved his life.  With Moon hanging onto his last breath the Ifrit healed most of his wounds and then embedded herself within his body and attached herself to his soul.  She did this because she fell in love with him at first sight and she wanted to dedicate her entire existence to protecting him.  Later Moon lost his entire family at the hands of an Angel called wormwood and after that he was alone for most of his teens and kept away from most people accept for Ifrit.  Of course before he met Ronald and other angels who also helped him along the way. He is blind but with the Sword given to him by an angel made of minerals of heaven, he can fight the ungodly and unworldly without his human sight that he refused to have healed by the Ifrit when he lost it as child.  When his blade touches his foes blood or energy, their image and their image alone appears before him until the blood or energy is wiped from his blade and this is even playing field of sorts when fighting the supernatural. Moon and his Ifrit fight side by side and she enchants him and makes him even more powerful while at the same time risking her life for him at any given time and moment during battle.   OK, and now this brings me to the two characters who go by the names of, Spanks and Nolan.  They are probably two of the biggest idiots in the story and maybe any story ever written.  Imagine Harold and Kumar meets the walking dead. They are childhood friends who were once deputies in a small town called Chase City Virginia which they were forced to go to by their captain.  They kept messing up and doing stupid things at their job at Vice in Arlington Virginia which is their old city.   Nolan is the dominant personality of the duo and Spanks seems to follow him because that is just what his dumb ass does best. Another thing is that they are also the walking dead who walk among the living. Not in the Zombie walking dead sense but they are surely dead and cannot die.  They oddly enjoy their status as eternal beings who can get blown to bits and pieces and still manage to walk out in one piece.     Somehow a mighty angel showed mercy upon them and attached their souls to his spirit and now they cannot die unless that angel's spirit has been destroyed.   But in exchange for this little gesture of kindness, they have to help the angel and his Conrad to battle against whatever evil comes upon the world.  A lot of events happened in the past in the town of Chase City which will be explored in another story that I'm working on which gives more of a back story of spanks and Nolan and also other characters who make appearances in this story.  Also Chase city is where Ronald and Moon meet for the first time all those many years ago.  Spanks and Nolan are characters who seem to always be in the wrong place at the wrong time.  There are two other characters who are called, Ariel and Zazriel who also happened to be Brother and sister.  They were born minutes part And are fraternal twins.  They are what you call Nephilim and they were spared after the great flood when they were babies which happened when the earth was first destroyed.  So that would make them thousands of years old which they are, but there's a catch.    They were born normal in a sense but still considered abominations in the eyes of God.  They and other Nephilim who were like them and born normal were placed in metallic pods called ""Zohars.""  The Zohars were created long ago by Azazel and they were used to entrap demons and creatures of darkness inside.  They in turn they were used to entrap the left over Nephilim who were Babies at the time and spared from the destruction of the great flood.    Each Zohar that held a Nephlim baby we're hidden and they had a  time release which were set by Azazel and his fallen brothers.  Uriel found six of the Zohars and she took each of them with her as she found them,  and kept them until the Nephlim inside were released by the timers.  It was almost like waiting for an egg to hatch.  Sadly not all of the Zohars were found by Uriel and the other watchers.  So they weren't raised or trained in the ways of the angelic as Ariel and Zazriel and the other Nephilim that she found.  There were those who were released after the great flood and throughout time that were taken under their fathers who were fallen, and other fallen that were friends of their fathers.  They are trained in the ways of the fallen and they are very powerful beings who seek to help their fathers and their masters control the world and the humans who live in it.   Ariel is the wisest and also the oldest of the two. She has a heavenly Bow which harnesses her angelic energy and shoots arrows made of light according to her strength and her power.   She also rides a flying ancient horse called Pegasus.  Pegasus has armor made of minerals of heaven and large wings which Ariel rides and flies him as she fights in battle.  Her hair color is naturally black but she surpassed her Nephlim form and it turned her hair blonde.Zazriel is a little more free in spirit then his big sister and he doesn't take anything serious in the slightest. He is also good friends with Spanks and Nolan and they know him as Simon Belmont because that is the name he told them when they first met in Chase City Virginia. He wears a magical armor Like his sister and he has a long retractable sword that is embedded and blended in the back of his armor which he pulls it from. They fight under the watchful eye of Uriel who acts almost as mother figure to them seeing as she raised them and trained them in the ways of the angelic from the moment they were able to fly. Their mother was a human woman from ancient Persia who they never met just as they have never met their father. She was very beautiful during the time that she lived and she was also a princess of Persia.Their father was once a mighty Arc angel who was called Seere, and long ago he weld both weapons in battles and which were also made by Azazel. He used the sword and bow together in harmony like a musical note being played with other musical notes on piano when he was still alive. He flew through the heavens and clouds with his faithful horse Pegasus while striking down his foes. The sword and bow were given to Ariel and Zazriel along with his flying horse Pegasus by Uriel as a last request right before Seere perished.There are many other characters, story lines and paths that will be featured in this first book and also in later graphic novels to come. The main premise of this story is Angels Vs the Fallen along with other ungodly creatures that are trying to consume the world. Along with a powerful fallen angel Called Sariel and his legion of fallen bothering.   Sariel has a protege called Lilith who is Lending him her power for the moment, but she has her own ambitions in mind and she has a lot of secrets that she even hides from him. The fallen Sariel's goal is to release Azazel from his chains and his prison of darkness that he was imprisoned within many millennium ago by the angel Gabriel. He owes Azazel that at minimum and Azazel expects to be repaid in full and some. This comic book is not just a fight of good vs evil because sometimes good and evil are blurred between the lines of light and darkness. The common core of this story is about humans, Nephilims, fallen and Angels and what they have lost along the way. They all share some type of pain as one and even the most evil of them do as well. I'm Sorry if this Synopsis is not the best but this is the best summary that I can give you without giving away too much of the story. But I hoped at least this is a glimpsed into the life of my characters and their stories. I know this angel vs evil thing has been beaten into the ground, but I promise you that this is not one of those typical stories that you may have read in novels or even seen a 100 times in movies. Lastly I would like to thank all of you who took the time and effort out of your busy day to stop by, read and fly along with a simple American dreamer who aspirations reaches for the clouds up and above in the blue sky.

So that would make them thousands of years old which they are, but there's a catch.They were born normal in a sense but still considered abominations in the eyes of God. They and other Nephilim who were like them and born normal were placed in metallic pods called ""Zohars."" The Zohars were created long ago by Azazel and they were used to entrap demons and creatures of darkness inside. They in turn they were used to entrap the left over Nephilim who were Babies at the time and spared from the destruction of the great flood.Each Zohar that held a Nephlim baby we're hidden and they had a time release which were set by Azazel and his fallen brothers. Uriel found six of the Zohars and she took each of them with her as she found them, and kept them until the Nephlim inside were released by the timers. It was almost like waiting for an egg to hatch. Sadly not all of the Zohars were found by Uriel and the other watchers.So they weren't raised or trained in the ways of the angelic as Ariel and Zazriel and the other Nephilim that she found. There were those who were released after the great flood and throughout time that were taken under their fathers who were fallen, and other fallen that were friends of their fathers. They are trained in the ways of the fallen and they are very powerful beings who seek to help their fathers and their masters control the world and the humans who live in it. Ariel is the wisest and also the oldest of the two. She has a heavenly Bow which harnesses her angelic energy and shoots arrows made of light according to her strength and her power. She also rides a flying ancient horse called Pegasus. Pegasus has armor made of minerals of heaven and large wings which Ariel rides and flies him as she fights in battle. Her hair color is naturally black but she surpassed her Nephlim form and it turned her hair blonde.Zazriel is a little more free in spirit then his big sister and he doesn't take anything serious in the slightest. He is also good friends with Spanks and Nolan and they know him as Simon Belmont because that is the name he told them when they first met in Chase City Virginia. He wears a magical armor Like his sister and he has a long retractable sword that is embedded and blended in the back of his armor which he pulls it from.They fight under the watchful eye of Uriel who acts almost as mother figure to them seeing as she raised them and trained them in the ways of the angelic from the moment they were able to fly. Their mother was a human woman from ancient Persia who they never met just as they have never met their father. She was very beautiful during the time that she lived and she was also a princess of Persia.Their father was once a mighty Arc angel who was called Seere, and long ago he weld both weapons in battles and which were also made by Azazel. He used the sword and bow together in harmony like a musical note being played with other musical notes on piano when he was still alive. He flew through the heavens and clouds with his faithful horse Pegasus while striking down his foes. The sword and bow were given to Ariel and Zazriel along with his flying horse Pegasus by Uriel as a last request right before Seere perished.There are many other characters, story lines and paths that will be featured in this first book and also in later graphic novels to come. The main premise of this story is Angels Vs the Fallen along with other ungodly creatures that are trying to consume the world. Along with a powerful fallen angel Called Sariel and his legion of fallen bothering.Sariel has a protege called Lilith who is Lending him her power for the moment, but she has her own ambitions in mind and she has a lot of secrets that she even hides from him. The fallen Sariel's goal is to release Azazel from his chains and his prison of darkness that he was imprisoned within many millennium ago by the angel Gabriel. He owes Azazel that at minimum and Azazel expects to be repaid in full and some. his comic book is not just a fight of good vs evil because sometimes good and evil are blurred between the lines of light and darkness. The common core of this story is about humans, Nephilims, fallen and Angels and what they have lost along the way. They all share some type of pain as one and even the most evil of them do as well. I'm Sorry if this Synopsis is not the best but this is the best summary that I can give you without giving away too much of the story. But I hoped at least this is a glimpsed into the life of my characters and their stories. I know this angel vs evil thing has been beaten into the ground, but I promise you that this is not one of those typical stories that you may have read in novels or even seen a 100 times in movies.Lastly I would like to thank all of you who took the time and effort out of your busy day to stop by, read and fly along with a simple American dreamer who aspirations reaches for the clouds up and above in the blue sky. Please support me and story tellers like me, in any way that you can!

I wanted to do a dog walking business but my mom said that it was kind of dangerous to be around strange dogs so I made a list of all the things that I enjoyed doing. I really love to bake and to make people smile and be happy. I like rainbows and unicorns and all things sweet, too! So I asked my mom if I could make some treats and sell them. She thought it was a good idea, so here I am! I would love it if you could support me and help me build my business up.

The financial sector should be shriveled and the public sector expanded. The myths of self-healing markets, efficient financial markets, nature as a free good, external and sink, infinite growth in a finite world, quantitative growth and the exact sciences eclipsing qualitative growth and the human sciences (history, literature, play, language, sociology, political science, philosophy) and private opulence next to public squalor (cf. John Kenneth Galbraith) must call us to rethinking – individually and collectively. Alternative Austrian, Swiss, Polish and German economists can alert us to the bankruptcy of austerity policy and fiscal policy aiding capital at the expense of workers and the environment. The future economic policy must be regional and decentralized. A post-materialist economy is possible as we transition from excess to access and more to enough. Work, health, strength, security and happiness can be redefined. The rights of nature can be respected in a future of moderation, equality and freedom. More and more is produced with fewer and fewer workers. Work and income have uncoupled as people cannot survive on their earnings from work and depend on credits and loans. Reducing working hours is a response to increased productivity and is the only way to assure everyone of the right to meaningful work. Reducing working hours, as Michael Schwendinger explains, is a socio-economic investment that protects long-term health interests and gives people more time sovereignty. The appendix ""Myths of the Economy"" explains 29 state myths, labor myths, business myths and social myths. The state is not a business or a household but can become indebted to help future generations. What is rational from a micro-economic perspective (e.g. competition) can be disastrous from a macro-economic perspective (e.g. mass unemployment). The future can be open and dynamic instead of closed and static if we tackle the myths and contradictions that lead to exploding inequality and precarious work.Available formats: epub mobi pdf lrf pdb txt html","If people contribute to this education project, I will be able to make the book available free to libraries and e-book readers.

We’re a pair of struggling creatives, and we’re going to discuss that with each other and with guests who face similar struggles to capture something relatable.  We’re going to use this podcast to connect with people.  We’ll talk to a disabled person about what it’s like to be disabled and how it affects their personal life.  We’ll talk to a gay person about being gay in today’s society.  We’ll get a bisexual person in the studio with them and start talking about sexuality and coming to terms with it and see where that goes.  We’re going to do a show drunk.  Over the course of the episode, we’re just going to get drunker and drunker and we’re going to reveal things on a deeply personal level to whoever wants to tune in and we pledge to release the whole thing completely raw and unedited.  Nothing’s off limits for this podcast.  We’re going to see how far we can take the medium for listeners’ pleasure, and that’s a Ben and Luke promise.Ben and Luke are two friends and writing partners still waiting for their big break.  Ben is a standup comedian performing across the country, and Luke helps him write his material.  We used to do a radio show called Going Hollywood with Ben and Luke, but we left the station because the producers were dicking us around, and also it was too limiting.  There were content restrictions and time restrictions, which meant we couldn’t connect with anybody on a personal level or get really deep, so we quit because we wanted to free ourselves of that and instead find something where we could connect with people.  That’s why podcasting is a better fit for us – it’s a looser format.  Basically, we want the freedom to do whatever we want and answer to no one, for the sake of our listeners.  Now, we can create something truly great and ground-breaking that we never could in radio.Our Kickstarter goal is £10,000 because to get started, we’ll need four Rode Podcaster mics, the best on the market: one for me, one for Luke, and one for each of two potential guests.  We’ll need to pay the guests that we book for their time.  We also need mic stands, pop shields, and an audio interface: Adobe Audition.  These things are expensive, but we want the best quality for his podcast – we want it to be easy listening.  We’re going to create the intro and outro music and edit the thing all ourselves.  We’re going to craft this podcast to be exactly the way we want it to be, with no meddling producers like we had with the radio show.  We’re going to be with this podcast every step of the way with our listeners in mind.We just need to raise some capital from you wonderful people so we can purchase the equipment, book the guests, and get started.  Once we have everything we need, we’ll be taking full advantage of it, posting the podcast weekly via iTunes, SoundCloud, Ben’s website (www.ben-sherlock.com, get on the mailing list for details about the podcast or where to see him perform), all kinds of platforms.  So, please, we implore you, chip in what you can so we can get this thing off the ground and start turning some heads.","Some potential risks and challenges we might face in undergoing production would be time management and the consistency of getting an episode made every week, since we both work, but we promise to prioritise the podcast over everything, so this shouldn’t be a problem.",https://www.kickstarter.com/projects/1401111890/funny-talks-with-ben-and-luke?ref=discovery_category_newest,1401111890/funny-talks-with-ben-and-luke,"We are Ben Sherlock, a standup comic and writer, and Luke Jamieson, an actor and writer, who are starting up a weekly comedy podcast called Funny Talks with Ben and Luke. We have a dedicated crew working with us on the podcast: Matt Johnson, our producer/mixer/engineer at Soundback Recording Studio in Liverpool, and Spencer Cammayo, our cinematographer/editor.We used to have a film-based talk radio show on Energy Groove FM in 2017, but we're hoping to move into podcasting for the creative freedom it allows over radio broadcasting. We will still maintain the punctuality and live energy of radio by recording each episode in one take.Our goal is for this podcast to run weekly, releasing a new half-hour episode every Thursday, until one or both of us die. We will release both an audio version on podcasting platforms such as iTunes, but also HD videos of each episode shot by Spencer in the studio to our YouTube channel. On the podcast, as you can see in the pilot episode above that we've produced to give you an idea of what we're planning to do, we will discuss such things as standup, film, TV, stories from the road, and what's going on in our lives. That may sound boring, but don't worry, we've had some wild times!We have the studio, the format of the show, the release schedule, and the production team all completely sorted out. The only thing this Kickstarter campaign is here to fund is running costs: editing, mixing, studio time, marketing etc. Eventually down the line, we want to be booking high-profile guests to appear on the show, but we need this funding to be able to get our foot in the door.","This project has minimal risk. We're experienced performers and broadcasters and we have good relationships with our producer/mixer and our cameraman, who are both industry professionals. The only risk is that without funding being secured, we might not be able to maintain a consistent release schedule with the podcast or eventually have to stop altogether."

He has told me that he would want to get into professional free lance photography when he finishes, he already has a box standard camera, but I would love to get him a complete set, I know it's not cheap and I can't afford to get him it by myself but with your help, if you decide to donate, I can.Frankly, it's not because he's my brother that I want to help him, it's because he's brilliant at photography. Before he got into photography he was a musician, he still plays but not as much as he did before. Basically, he was in a band that sounded abit like Ed Sheeran, before Ed Sheeran was famous, but due to conflicting musical ideas half the band left so my brother was lost on what to do as he had been trying to get into the music industry for half his life and what looked like the best band he had been in failed it was almost like his artistic side was slipping away. Then he got into photography, influenced by 1 of his closest friends, and has been doing it for around 4-5 years.Anyways, if you want to donate, I would be so thankful, also, the Project picture is just 1 of his photographs.","I guess the highest risk is not being able to afford the complete set, to over come that I'd have to get the main parts of a set or focus only on getting him a professional camera with a tripod."

Maybe get wiped off the face of the earth forever, or perhaps you will find the secret to obtaining the cure.I've been working on this project in what spare time I have and have gotten quite far with it already. However, now I need your help in order to finish this game and acquire the finishing touches to really make this game something to talk about. The screenshot above is using what free graphics I could find and alter on the web,the new graphics look so much nicer. As I'm able to acquire the new graphics and add them in, I will add new pics so you can see the difference and the improvements you are helping to make with this game.The Money from this project will be used to purchase the additional animation software, models and props, and licenses for the models I use.I'll be doing the rendering myself but I'm just no good at creating graphics from scratch :(","Since I am only able to work on this in spare time, getting the project completed in a timely manner is going to be difficult. I'm not sure when it will be completed but I am shooting for no later than the end of this year.Expect some drastic changes to the graphics (there's already been 3 revisions now) as I'm still learning some of the software I'm using for the modeling. If this kickstarter is extremely successful, then I'll be able to branch off to iOS and/or Windows 8 for even more people to enjoy!Much of the 'behind the scenes' coding is done and working, but with worthy suggestions and new ideas, that may change.",https://www.kickstarter.com/projects/1280374786/project-20m813-0?ref=discovery_category_newest,1280374786/project-20m813-0,"In the video above, you can see some of the gameplay as it currently stands. Since the addition of some new graphics, younotice that I still need to go back and edit some things and make adjustments such as collision boxes and NPC placement. Another thing to note, while not shown in this video, doorways will stop your zombies and you will have to bust through them. I have recently replaced the door graphics which is why at this point, you simply walk over them.

What is really lacking is much of the graphics and that is where this kickstarter project comes in. I've been purchasing the models and props as needed and when funds would allow but I really need help getting the rest of what is needed to really round off this game and create something that is not only fun to play but visually appealing as well.Aside from the props to fill the levels of the game, funding will also go to porting the game to iOS and Windows mobilealong sidethe Android port.",Probably the biggest challenge will be to get this project out in a timely manner while at the same time making sure it is bug free.The worst thing that could happen would be to release the game and some bug ruins the experience for people.

If you've got a broad sense of humour they should appeal, if you haven't, they may well not! But this should give you an idea whether you want to pledge or not:https://www.amazon.co.uk/Nick-Fisher-Books/e/B017RC4XIS/ref=dp_byline_cont_book_1","To be perfectly honest there are no risks or challenges - if I raise the money I can get the book published, if I don't raise the money, I can't, It's as simple as that! Obviously the more raised the more books I can publish, and if not enough is raised I'll have to have a re-think.",https://www.kickstarter.com/projects/1443635462/husband-and-wife-joke-book-gift-box-set?ref=discovery_category_newest,1443635462/husband-and-wife-joke-book-gift-box-set,"They say marriage is made in heaven - but then again so is thunder and lightning. And no doubt if you were to ask those that came up with the jokes in this book they’d probably tell you that their marriage was made in hell! Split into two parts, Husband - Wife jokes / Wife - Husband jokes, this book contains the best jokes there are about marriage. Some are old, some are new, some are re-written and some are blue - and some are fairly rude, slightly offensive and not very P.C! And if you’re married - or divorced - you’ll resonate with them.This gift box set containing the book will make the ideal present for anyone who may be getting married – though after reading some of the jokes in it they may well cancel their wedding if they think that’s what married life has got in store for them!The book was actually bought as a wedding gift for Prince Harry last year by one of his old army pals for a bit of a laugh, although then it didn’t come in a gift box. And it was after it was bought as a gift for the royal wedding that I originally had the idea to sell it in a gift box as a ready made present. And albeit twelve months later I've finally got around to doing it!So now I’m looking to raise the money to re-publish the book and sell it complete as a gift box set. And as well as it being ideal for a humorous wedding gift for those who are about to get married, it’ll also make an ideal present (birthday present for example) for anyone who’s already married or for couples who live together. It’ll also make ideal material for forming part of a best man’s speech or for a stag or hen do present. And not only will it be ideal for those who are about to tie the knot or who are already happily married, it'll also be ideal for those who might NOT be so happily married and who at times feel like tying a tight knot around their partner's neck! Well they do say that laughter is the best medicine, and although it may not be the answer to solving ALL marital problems, after reading it it may put a wry smile on one or two faces and help take a little bit of tension out of a strained relationship. But then again........!As well as selling the book to individuals I'll also be making it available wholesale at a discount to wedding planners, wedding dress / suit hire shops etc, and stag & hen do companies and other similar businesses. And if it's good enough for a present for a royal marriage then it's good enough for any marriage!(Though I never did get an invite to Buckingham Palace!)Below are a sample of the kind of jokes the book contains. *Some of the jokes do contain strong language and adult humour.Husband - WifeA bloke runs in the house and shouts upstairs to his wife, “Pack a couple of suitcases I’ve just won the lottery!” His wife shouts down, “Shall I pack for warm weather or cold?” And her husband shouts back, “I couldn’t give a fuck what you pack just get out.”A little old lady wanted to go to the pet cemetery to bury her cat and got on the bus and whispered to the driver, “I’ve got a dead pussy.” The driver turned around and pointed to a woman sat at the back of the bus and said, “Go and sit next to my wife, she’s got one as well.”A man and his wife were out walking and they came across a wishing well so the husband leaned over it, threw a penny in and made a wish. His wife then leaned over it and threw a penny in and made a wish but she leaned over the well too far and fell in it and drowned and her husband said, “Fuck me, it works!”Mirrors can't talk - luckily for my wife they can't laugh either.A bloke walks in the bedroom with a sheep under his arm and says, “This is the pig I have sex with when you’ve got a headache.” His wife looks at him and says sarcastically, “I think you’ll find that that’s a sheep.” And her husband replies, “I think you’ll find I was talking to the sheep.”If your wife is screaming and shouting at the front door and the dog is barking at the back door which one do you let in first? The dog, obviously, because he’ll shut up once you let him in.My wife said to me, “Tell me honestly, am I the only woman you sleep with?” I said, “Yes, you are the only one I sleep with. I’m up all night with the others shagging.”My mate said to me, “My wife left me the other day. I’ve tried crying but tears just won’t come out. What can I do to make myself cry?” So I said, “Imagine she’s come back again.” My wife found out I was seeing someone else so she packed my bags and told me to get out and as I was leaving she screamed, “I hope you suffer in misery for the rest of your life and die a long, slow, painful death.” So I walked back in the house, put my bags down and said, “Make your fucking mind up. Do you want me to stay now?”Wife - HusbandA woman went to the doctors to get her husband’s blood test results and the receptionist said to her, “We’ll need a stool sample, a urine sample and a sample of your husband’s semen.” So the woman said, “I’ll drop a pair of his underpants off tomorrow.”My husband said to me, “Why do you enjoy sex so much on Monday, Tuesday and Wednesday nights?” I said, ""Because you work on Monday, Tuesday and Wednesday nights.” A woman was in court for assaulting her husband and the judge said to her, “Why did you hit your husband over the head with a chair?” And she replied, “Because the table was far too heavy for me to pick up.”What’s the best way to a man’s heart? Straight through his chest with a sharp knife. What’s the difference between a clitoris and a golf ball? Your husband will make an effort to find his golf ball.My husband said to me, ""What would you most like to do with my body?"" So I said, ""Identify It.""A wife says to her husband, “Do you fancy changing positions tonight?” Her husband says excitedly, “Ooh! I like the sound of that.” So she says, “Okay, you do the dishes and the ironing and I’ll sit on the sofa and watch tele' and fart all fucking night.”I installed a mirror on the ceiling over our bed and my husband said to me, “I didn’t know you liked to watch yourself writhe and moan in ecstasy during sex?” I said, “I don’t, I like to watch myself laugh during sex.”Men are like snow storms: You never know when they're coming, how many inches you're going to get, or how long they're going to last.",There are no risks or challenges that I can think of to be honest.

The initial start-up costs were relatively low, but maintaining equipment and marketing has become extremely difficult heading into the critical holiday season. Furthermore, our woodworking projects are a source of funding to launch a writing career for David Lee Veroux, author of the novel ""Cropsy,"" which is receiving stellar reviews as a self-published title on Amazon. Getting published has become a soul-crushing and bank account-draining endeavor, leading us to consider giving up writing altogether, despite remarkably strong reader support. Those who have read David's first novel are pleading for more work, but it's simply impossible to continue writing without a viable income. We are hoping for assistance from the creative community to allow our creative works to continue and reach those who appreciate it.","The obstacles here are quite simple: maintaining creative motivation and the ability to consistently achieve the elusive hybrid of art and function. While our initial works have been well-received and are in high demand, the financial drain of starting a project like this make continuing to grow and produce tenuous.

Three lathes, miter saw, drill press, hand tools, large amounts of sandpaper, finishing materials, and other accessories. Naturally, every piece of wood -- scraps, blanks, unfinished bowls, etc. -- served as ideal kindling for the inferno. We'll make it back somehow...Our funding gift is one of our almost-famous 2- or 3-way wine barrel candle holders, crafted entirely from locally harvested oak, poplar, cherry...whatever we can find on the local forest floor.

We'll start cranking out more barrels, volcano candles, bowls, and whatever else we can, as soon as we can.Thank you : )","The only risk is losing our focus on rebuilding the shop.
