Hello, and welcome to my Kickstarter project. My name is Jacob Bear and I draw comics! It’s one of my greatest passions in life. But, despite this great love, I've always wanted to do something that belonged solely to me.  I decided to combine my love of drawing comics with my graphic design skills and thought were better to start than with my own custom deck of playing cards.That’s when this deck, the Instruments of War, was born.  It began based on an original character I drew for the Emerald City Comic Con's ""Monsters & Dames"" Children's Hospital charity book.  Due to the overwhelming popularity of the character, I decided to expand upon the universe the character resides in.  Once I unbridled my imagination, I discovered the possibilities for this universe were endless.As I wanted to ensure you would be getting the best quality possible, I put a lot of time, blood, sweat, and time (yes, I realize I said time twice) into every aspect of these cards.  Because of this desire for quality over quantity, I have already completed all illustrations for this deck and have already received approval by the United States Playing Card Company.  Also something to consider, I will only be printing this deck as a limited run. It will only be available on here or, once all rewards are fulfilled and if there are any left over, you can get them at any comic conventions I attend.  Remember, as supplies are limited, the only way to guarantee a piece of ""Instruments of War"" history is through here.Be sure to peruse the awesome rewards available. In addition to getting your very own deck, I'm also offering an exclusive custom coin, a couple of (and maybe I'm biased) excellent prints, uncut sheets of the deck, and even original artwork.  Considering I do everything digitally, original art from me is a rarity, so be sure to take advantage of this amazing opportunity.As you can tell, I'm quite excited about this deck and am very proud to see it's unique characters come to life, knowing it'll bring smiles to millions (okay, that's a bit of an exaggeration) of peoples’ faces.  Please take a moment to spread the word on this fantastic deck of cards, knowing that any and all support provided will be greatly appreciated. I very humbly say thank you for taking the time to check out my Kickstarter Project.","With everything already done with this deck, the risks should be very low. The real risk will be with the shipping and making sure I have the right pledges going to the right people. But, just as you all have pledged and put your trust in me; I pledge to you, that I will make sure you get everything that you pledged for and to make sure you're getting the best quality possible!",https://www.kickstarter.com/projects/jacobbear/batbear-open-up-and-say-ahh?ref=discovery_category_newest,jacobbear/batbear-open-up-and-say-ahh,"Shortly after Batbear's battle with Superbear, a new menace has arrived. Poison has entered the scene and he is not happy. Wrecking havoc on the city of Portburn, it's up to Batbear to stop Poison and Batbear will need to use everything he's got to take him down. But will it be enough? Find out in Batbear: Open Up and Say Ahh!This is the third issue of Batbear that concludes the current story line. Though you don't need the others to understand what's going on, if you wanted to get the first two issues, I have those available as well. They are in the add on section.This issue of Batbear is actually two years in the making. Having to move and other life changing events has delayed the issue for longer than anticipatedbut, I think it was worth it as this is the best issue yet! It's 28 pages of awesome story and opens up the world of Batbear as well as hinting at where these characters stand in this expanding universe. If you wanted to try Batbear and see what this is about, this is the issue to get.Pretty much everything is done on the book. The funds are primarily needed to pay for printing and shipping costs. This book will be ready to ship by the end of the Kickstarter so you have nothing to lose. And I always deliver!Jacob Bear - (That's me) I have worked as a professional in this industry for a while and have seen my work published in most of the big publishers including DC, Image, Dynamite, Zenescope, and many more. Although I love doing freelance, I also love creating my own characters and developing my own universe.Anthony George - Anthony's talent is growing in leaps and bounds and has an ever impressive growing portfolio. I am lucky and honored to have him color this issue and join the Bear Claw Studios team.Dan Feldmeier - Editor and cover artist for Batbear. Dan is an impressive artist in his own right and is gaining notoriety for his cover work for a variety of clients including Marat Mychaels and Brian Pulido. Dan is also quite the writer and is working on a few future projects for Bear Claw Studios.All items can be signed by Jacob Bear at no extra charge.",There really are no risks. The book is almost complete and will be ready to ship shortly after the Kickstarter is over. And I always deliver! Please feel free to ask me any questions you may have.

I will be launching a E-comm store that only has one focus. Gifts for Gamers Geeks and Nerds.I'm sure your thinking yeah sure that's been done with sites like Gamestop.com, ThinkGeek.com and Thisiswhyimbroke.com. Sure we will be a site pretty much like those, but the small family version. (No Matter How Big We Get) using better technology for our site for a smoother shopping experience from browsing to check out with a sleek modern design that's easy on the eyes. A Great mobile version that works on all devices including iOS and Android. (with plans for an app, Reason 1 for the Kickstart) None of the pop ups that those sites hit you with from advertising from Game Ads or Console ads from big companies, No exit,Bots, No chat Bots. None of the gimmicks. Just good old fashioned American business with good old fashioned family values. Honest, warm personal customer service ( From my 15 years in hospitality management). Only one place that will ask you for your email for our great Newsletter for all the top Gaming news, Great upcoming sales, and eventsWe are building a blog and discussion section where we want our gamers to get in on the action here at Urban Gaming ABXY by leaving comments for us and suggestions live on the page. Game with members of Urban Gaming ABXY on all the platforms where we will be hosting Tournaments from the biggest games all the time. ( REASON 2 FOR THE KICKSTART) Gamer Care packs for the winners featuring the Hottest Newest Products from the site.( and some other big Prizes as we grow) From my time working for an Internet Diesel Engine Store I made some great contacts with Fedex, UPS, and the USPS and have developed Reps with up to 95% mailing discounts meaning 100% FREE Shipping and Handling from our site for our customers. We would like to grow to the point that Famous Youtube Gamers would have a safe secure place to sell their merchandise as well. The main goal of this website launch would be the place to go for all gamers to purchase anything their little (or Big) heart could ever imagine for their gaming needs. With your help on this kickstart you could ensure that we will hit our launch date of August 15th 2017. Thank you for your consideration and please check out the rewards for Backers. This are just a small sample of the products we have lined up with our manufacturing partners for our launch of the site. ","As many know their is no guarantee in business today.

The characters lives are inexplicably brought  together by fate and they must all draw on their own and each other's strengths to survive. The film highlights how strong we can all be when situations arise and brings to light the fact that everyone is fighting their own individual battles.The film was written by Serenade The Stars guitarist Damian Carruthers and the band will be teaming up with Citizens of the world choir to record the soundtrack.

In an attempt to keep the conversation educational AND fun I came up with the idea of a Cheese Miner On The Moon sending the cheese back down to earth for us all to enjoy. It was at that moment a light-bulb went off in my head and I knew that more children would want to hear this story. Four years later, after much love, research and tonnes of imagination... I had a finished book complete with some of the most beautiful art work I have ever seen on a children’s book. The book follows hero Nash, a cheese miner on the moon, who has a chance encounter with a stranger whilst going about his daily mining duties. From that day on the audience is taken on an exciting and epic adventure.. one which the fate of our very own Planet Earth depends on. The story is sure to pique any child’s imagination and, whilst be a thoroughly entertaining read, also carries a strong, and relevant, message about our species consumption of our planets natural resources and how we have to change our habits before we destroy the planet.Whilst be a thoroughly entertaining read, the book also carries a strong message that we cannot continue as a species to consume our planets natural resources at the rate we currently are.We have something for everyone here, schools, businesses, children and parents.

This has proven to be a challenge from day 1! - I have had to learn many new skills and adopt a trial and error process throughout the whole project.So far I have completely self funded this project. Sadly, I have run out of money now and we just need that finally push to launch the book and send it intergalactic!So... Why should you part with your hard earned space bucks and back this project?Well...I believe it is important to support independent projects like this, you never know where the next Roald Dahl or J K Rowling is going to come from! - Not saying that will be me...  but there is some out there I am sure!If I don't raise enough to launch the book then I will have to give up writing and seek alternative employment. Perhaps I will become a chef or taxi driver... Believe me when I tell you that the world is a much safer place without me cooking or driving taxis! It is worth a £5 alone just to prevent a catastrophe there!We are planning to support a number of great causes through the book and want to make a positive difference to the world. Once the book is released to the general public, 20% of the total book price will be donated to great causes. You can be a part of that and help us to make a difference.Last of all, I have poured my heart and soul into this for the last 4 years of my life. It would mean the absolute world to me to get this book out there and take up writing as a full time career. I have made many sacrifices just to get to this stage. It has not been an easy ride but I would not change it for the world! Or Universe for that matter."

We also have plans to start a Sunfire and a Snowstorm product line in 2015 ( we already have most of the castles started we just have to finish them out and make the molds).We are negotiating with a local casting facility here in Loveland to start the first production runs, but both the molds and the casting contract is gonna be costly.

See the Updates section for a day and night version)Why?My intention is to create a sustainable project that will represent a lot of things this year, the end of the first decade of a new millennium. 2001: A Space Odyssey the film came out in 1968 and 2010 in 1982, both bringing a new standard to science fiction. Originally created by Arthur C. Clarke, Kubrick brought the 2001 movie to the screen with a lot of symbolism and hope.It represents a message of peace, but includes the moving forward in the development of the species. 2010 united Russian and Americans in a time of cold war while the monolith itself with the voice of a gentle, but unsuspecting emissary between the monolith and humans.What?Keeping the dimensions of the monolith represented in the film we are building a 9' x 4 ' x 1' black skinned monolith that will sit on a very solid tempered glass mounting to give it a floating effect. On the face of it, will be the eye of the HAL9000* computer from the movie; the protagonist in 2001 but the martyr in 2010. It is this character that will be brought back to life and speaking to people who approach it.Also, a small section in the belly of the monolith will be the source of a projection showing the Star Baby** who will make eye contact with anyone approaching the monolith.It will be controlled by a solid state computer and projection system built into the body of the monolith. Power will be a combination of solar and batteries build into the top and the base of the sculpture.The DramaOnce every 2 hours during reduced light hours mini l.e.d. white lights on the skin of the monolith will all light up and slowly diminish. It will be proceeded with the phrase ""My God, it's full of stars""; another iconic moment from the book and movie.*HAL9000 was a massive computer with a conscience who had conflicting orders in the movie and became the protagonist when the orders he was being given conflicted with the situation. He was represented by a large red eye and a faceplate with his name on it.**Star Baby is a deity like creature that may have been the reincarnation of a major character from 2001 who had a much larger role in the Clarke books than the film. It is an iconic figure from the movie either way as it was featured on the 2010 movie posters.Where?There are many details about this unfolding project on the artist web site art23design.com including plans. Video and additional pictures will be added as the project advances.How?My partner on this project (Tom Walters) and I are working on this project together, but from two distinctively different responsibilities. Scott: the creative who designed the project and proposed it originally. Tom: who brought technology and dimension to its development. It has become a real team project.Scott is building the physical structure and sourcing materials for the sculpture itself; discussing materials options with Tom as a collaborative effort.Tom is making the sculpture smart and making it function with the long term in mind as well as any elements that could affect it.Final assembly will happen at Tom's home in his garage.Funding Even with fund raisers, the money received will be used with a very specific shopping list, then a list of logistical items as the project advances. Hoping to get more than asked for to make this project as strong as possible.1. Reimburse for some of the purchases already made and put on creditMonolith frame, computer, projector2. Purchase the most expensive element needed; the skin of the monolith3. Tempered glass base custom made4. Purchase the rest of the physical items for the base structure too.Additional use if feasible:1. Transportation to Burning man",,https://www.kickstarter.com/projects/studiosk/final-passage-a-spiritual-sculpture?ref=discovery_category_newest,studiosk/final-passage-a-spiritual-sculpture,"Connecting all forms of creation evolved and inspired with the elements that gave them food, energy and faith. It is symbolic of the beginning to life lived and renewal. Imagine the Tree of Life meets the River Styx standing brilliantly in the desert shimmering with 5 branches, each holding a small flame in a tall glass chimney, surrounded by sparkling leaves. Standing 22 feet tall, this beautiful monochromatic tree will shimmer in the glowing light from the 5 flames; one on each limb. (After burning man the flames may be removed and fitted with electrical lighting unless otherwise) The final construction will result in an art piece with a lot of texture and it will use light in a lot of ways to amplify the concept, either by the light generated by the piece itself of from any natural ambient light. The orientation and acoustics of the project is based on a lot of religious and spiritual elements but gives the visitor the ability to take away anything they need from it. Theme of the Project There are a lot of spiritual elements combined in this tree, none of which are primarily from a single religion. Since faith is a rite unto itself the perceived meaning is relevant to the individual experiencing the piece. The tree represents a human connection to nature. In mythology the Tree of Life concept has various origins in cultures all over the world; the start of life, knowledge or even a basic desire to understand where we were coming from. And then for many death represented by the boat is less seen as a finality but a transition into a new life or even a higher plain of existence. The boat in the water represents the Ferry Man who transported the dead to the underworld, but in this case the boat carries one through the arch from the old to the new. One additionally interesting factor for anyone who might make a note of it, though it is not specifically demonstrated in the overall construction, the sculpture maintains all 5 elements of nature; earth, water, air, fire and spirit.

As the project progressed, I began to think about the relationship between people and print, and where it is going in the future due to technology. I am a firm believer that both print and technology hold their own places in our lives. I then took the project as an opportunity to bring book cover/poster design into the present through a minimalistic approach and try to show people that print is not dead, just perhaps a bit out-dated. With your help, I would like to bring these redesigned book titles to a wider range of people.The wallpaper set will feature an iPhone, iPad, and desktop version of each poster in the highest resolution available for each device.The postcard pack will feature a similar graphic as the poster. They will be 4""x6"" and printed on harder cardstock.The posters will be 18"" x 24"" on thicker/higher quality paper appropriate for posters. I have not narrowed down the specifics as of yet but will release the updated information when I find the right combination.The posters below are not in the final stage.

While the project will be hard at times, I also think it's going to be fun. At the end of the project the backer will get an awesome logo representing their name, their company, or anything they can think of.If the project is funded, after it has ended I will contact each backer to find out what they are looking for in their logo so that I can get inspiration and an overall feel. The backer will receive their project in whichever file format they prefer. Once they are finished all of the logos will be displayed on a page of my website www.kateferrara.comand the backer will have the option to link to their site from my site.The project is going to be a lot of fun, but also time consuming. Depending on the number of backers, it could be a lot of time.

Even at it's best, performance art and street performance in particular is the least commercial, profitable and archival form of art. Traveling is one of the most enriching parts of being a performance artist, yet it is extremely financially and physically wearing. Most performance festivals and event opportunities require travel and money. Unfortunately, the US is one of the countries which offers little to no government support towards the arts, So Im funding this the old fashioned way right here on this high tech gizmo, the Wild West Web.

Our olive trees have been in the family for 4 generations,  located in the “Mani”region, in the Peloponnese area of Greece, in and around the village of Agios Georgios.For the origin of the word “Mani” the views are many, but the one that has seemed to be widely accepted, is one in which the place name came from the word “Manu"",  which means sparse, bald and dry. These are the conditions that help to produce the distinct ""Koroniki"" olive.Our family lived in the village and produced olive oil for 4 generations. Our grandmother Stavroula, was well known because she spent all her life alone, producing pure extra virgin olive oil just as her ancestors had done for centuries.Then our parents Ntinos & Marianthi inherited the groves and passed them to us, together with their passion and love for the place. And now the 3 sisters, Mado, Vana and Vicky, continue the tradition with our families.Our village – how we grow our olives:Mani is characterised by arid landscapes, with the presence of aromatic plants and small trees growing on rocky territory.Conditions for the development of olive cultivation is more than ideal. Our olive trees have had the same care for centuries, growing organically, letting nature do all the work.-	Excellent soil and weather conditions.- Intense sunshine. -	Low rate of rainfall and mild winters. -	Hilly and rocky limestone soil.-	We carry the tools and the harvest by hand, walking 20min in a rocky field,   without the use of transportation.-	Non use of irrigation systems. -	Strict pruning once a year for maintaining a small tree size, contribute to a   local form olive “ Koroneiki”,whose fruits produce highly viscous and      aromatic oil. -	Handpicked and Inspected by hand. -	Pressed at the local mill in Mani. Why is this project called ""Greek Lády""We had to pick a name for the project and for us there is a link between the women in the family ,who they take care the olive trees for centuries and also there is another meaning to the same word ""Lády""in greek is ""λάδι""(ládi) means oil.We keep it a family affair, controlling every stage, ensuring you receive the finest quality Olive Oil.Our ""Greek Lády"" project is our families opportunity to share with you, our passion and love for Pure Organic Extra Virgin Olive oil, together with all its health benefits, with friends around the world.Now to the good stuff...Rewards:We have something for everyone and hope these rewards will help you to make nice moments with your friends and family!!Also we have collaborated with craft maker to make a limited run of unique pieces of glazed pottery tapas bowls. A perfect compliment for the Olive Oil on the family table.How can you support ""Greek Lády"" project?You can make a pledge of your choice BUT one of the most important things you can do, is to share the ""Greek Lády"" project with friends and family!!Simple share the link by email or on social networks:You can find us online at:www.greeklady.euFacebook:https://www.facebook.com/3GreekLady/Instagram:https://www.instagram.com/3greek_lady/Twiiter:https://twitter.com/3Greek_LadyWe hope to see you soon in Greece!Thank youEfharistoVicky ,Vana...& Mado.","We have tried to minimise any risk as much as possible, and are confident that all rewards are realistic and achievable - By limiting rewards, we can concentrate on quality. - The weather is almost always perfect at that time of year. - We harvest the olives by hand, as we do every year when collecting Oil for our families. - All shipping will be tracked. We know exactly when we will start and finished our harvest. We will do absolutely everything in our power to make sure «Greek Lády» makes it to your home."

My sixteen year old daughter is both co-inventor of the original and this variant design. We launched this KickStarter campaign to initiate a limited production run that will bring 100 compact Snare Drums to life. These compact drums have the physical footprint and weight similar to that of a practice pad; yet, our drum is functional acoustic snare drum usable for live performance as it generates a good smack/pop sound with a snare buzz in the same manor as a normal snare drum (main video has examples). This compact design lets you tote around a functional acoustic snare drum in similar fashion as you would have toted around a common practice pad; however our drum may be played upon a tabletop just as a practice pad frequently is used. As it is very small it is also ideal for people with limited space access as it is easy to store requiring little space. As the inner cavity of this design is open and the drum has a single drum head the drum may be muffled with cloth when auditable levels need to be reduced; this is also demonstrated in the main video.This design is a variant of our normal unobtrusive drum design; only we have removed the low-volume playing surface from this design, for this build we restricted the size to being a 10 inch diameter drum head; thus, a snare drum with a 10 inch playing surface. This drum may also be fitted with rubber feet allowing it to be placed on a table, counter, stool, chair, bench, floor, or even a drum stand. Not requiring a drum stand for usage of this design eliminates the need to tote around a drum stand furthering it's convenient to-travel design as less is required to be transported and stored.The need for this portable acoustic design was brought to our attention as we exhibited our dual volume drum system at various events over the last 2 years. While most of people absolutely loved the dual-volume nature of our design ; a notable amount of people (around 20%) remarked that they were not in a situation that sound volume levels were an issue; as such, they only needed the compact benefits of our design and asked us to consider making a smaller diameter sized version that could replace the practice pad. This KickStarter event will aid in determining if this type of product has enough value to become a normal production item.Our public introduction of this off-shot variant only just began on January 27th of 2018 when we simultaneously launched this KickStarter campaign and began to exhibit the 10 inch snare drum variant for the first time at the Elkhorn Mini Maker Faire in Elkhorn, Wisconsin. In the above photo the 10 inch snare drum can be viewed alongside our 14 inch dual volume snare drums in the center of the photo. We where excited to see the launch of an new Maker Faire event, so when Elkhorn's invited us to participate in their first Mini Maker Faire we viewed the KickStarters second annual ""make/100"" as an ideal time to put the compact 10 inch snare drum design to the test.The funds will allow us to make a run of 100 snare drums that have an overall height of 2 inchs and 11.5 inchdiameter that can be fitted with any standard 10 inch drum head. These drums will only use high quality drum hoops that allow the drum to be tensioned much tighter than that of the drums currently found in the market. The base/shell, and snare is part of our patent pendingdesign. This same drum is offered as one of the rewards to people that back thiscampaign within identified noted tier.To offer the best versatility to backers that select a tier that rewards with a drum then once funded we will acquire each possible drum head from EVANS available in the 10 inch size and make videos available to all the backers that demo each head tuned at varioustensions recorded on a HI-FI digital quality level. Variants of snare arrangement will also be provided. Prototypes of versions that are even more shallow will also be built and demoed; we have experimented with versions as shallow as 1.25 inch total height. We have alsoexperimented with making our own wood drum hoops. Funding will bring the option of wood hoops to our product line.AE DRUMS LLC is registered in Wisconsin and exist as a separate taxed entity govern by a single owner. The business was founded to become my daughters business once she is old enough and prepared to take over operations. backing thiscampaign both brings thisvariant to market, allows the business to grow, and expand our tooling at an earlier stage allowing more options for customer customizing.Our main product line is slated out to manufactures drums in diameters as small as 6 inches through the range of 40 inches that normally have dual volume modes allowing both loud and unobtrusive sound levels. All drums may be used as a snare, tom-tom, or bass drum. Off-shotvariants are also being explored such as found in thiscampaign.AE was on TV as the last presenter in the first season of 'Project Pitch It' http://www.projectpitchit.com/.

There's a whole new universe of possible ideas on how to add convenience to our lives.

The core-mask comes with a melt-blown filter.Core-masks can also accommodate PM2.5 filters, melt blown filters, fibre filters or even any filter of your choice.The ultimate design of the core mask is to keep the Seal around the core mask. Soft edges on the sides to keep you protected, but also to keep you from scratches and marks on your face. The air vent slots are large enough to inhale and exhale air through the filter or filters. Sterilizing and sanitation are easy. We highly recommend the users to sanitize and change the filter on every single use.Tested multipe times and redesign some of the key points for everyone.","We need your help to move forward and have given a 40% off towards the pre-sales on this campaign to offer you the best price. With your funding, we can fulfill the MOQ, manufacturing and shipping costs and other necessary aspects to move forward."

With this in mind, we took extra care to design the SWS board so that it could be added to any project on the fly without having to change anything. This expansion module is being designed by and for people with big and exciting ideas who don't want to get caught up on the little things. If you are interested inusing a SWS board in one of your own projects, please consider backingour Kickstarter. We have built several functional prototypes and are currently in the process of turning the design into a printed circuit board to be distributed to backers before the end of 2017. Once the PCB is developed, we will make all documentation (schematics, eagle files, etc. public so that other hobbyists can learn from it. Thank you!​ ","Most of the serious design work for this project has already been done. The current functional prototype is the culmination of six or seven failed prototypes over the last month. Because a reliable design has finally been settled on, the only serious challenge remaining is to take the schematic we have and turn it into a manufacturable PCB.",https://www.kickstarter.com/projects/1998140538/logex-electronics-prototyping-reimagined?ref=discovery_category_newest,1998140538/logex-electronics-prototyping-reimagined,"An Improved Solderable BreadboardSolderable breadboards and traceless protoboards are both amazing tools; they allow developers and tinkerers alike to quickly build prototypes without going through the whole PCB manufacturing process. Despite their immense value in the DIY electronics community, they both continue to have significant drawbacks that make prototyping a complex circuit difficult - no matter which method is used.In my engineering career to date, I have strongly favored solderable breadboards when I need to build something quickly because they are so easy to use. When I began designing more complex circuits, though, I constantly ran into the same problem: not having enough space when trying to work with more than one integrated circuit.After struggling with wire wrapping and solder bridging on traceless protoboards, I finally stepped back and decided to find a way to combine the versatility of a traceless protoboard with the simplicity of a solderable breadboard.This board has been designed from the ground up to address the practical requirements that I have encountered as an electrical engineer.Design FeaturesThis board offers an engineer's take on what an ideal prototyping board should look like, especially when working with integrated circuits in through-hole DIP packages. This board puts the most commonly used elements, the power rails, closest to where they are needed the most - next to the integrated circuit itself. This makes it easy to add biasing resistors while still leaving significant space available around the perimeter of the board, something that traditional solderable breadboards fail to offer.Additionally, a large ground pour on both sides of the board makes this a perfect choice for high-precision analog projects and those with high current demand.Some of the board's most notable features include:I have tested this board extensively in small batches; it has eased my workload significantly while keeping my circuit boards looking neat! Projects I have built using this board include instrumentation amplifiers, MOSFET motor controllers, buck-boost converters, Arduino accessories, and many smaller projects.Open-Source 3D Printable AccessoriesTo compliment this board, I have also designed several cases to protect the things I've built. There are over 15 different case styles to choose from so far, and that number will continue to grow as the project matures. All files will be available in standard .STL format, and this library is free to access for anyone.Thank you for your interest, and happy prototyping!","I hope that this project turns into an open source platform that is affordable, easy to use, and leaves the backers with a lot of freedom. To that end, I pledge to keep all backers updated and informed throughout the project. Everything is ready to go if the funding goal is met."

It represents a real landmark for us and it's definitely going to be different. A big part ofthe inspiration for this project is that I was recently introduced to the ancient solfeggio scales. Knowledge of the healing power of these sound frequencies is really amazing! Did you know that our common use of 440hz 'A' to tune instruments is 4hz off from ancient tunings? And the original scales contain a note humming at 528hz that is being used by biochemists to repair DNA? I've retuned my guitar to 444hz 'A' and the result is a real surprise. The tone is so much more pleasing and satisfying to the ear and to the cells in my body. What does that tell you?Ever wonder why we love the Beatles so much? Apparently Paul McCartney and John Lennon recorded some of their most famous songs using 'A'=444 hz.Something cool is going on here. It is our intention for this recording to transmit whatever energy lives 'within and between the notes' of these mystical and ancient tunings.The Taodogs are eager to share what we discover with the world. We'll beexploring ethnic music from all over the globe, including Gaelic psalm-singing, didgeridoo, tribal drumming and Indian chant. It's all finding it's way onto this project. The video includesmusic that was written by Doug Fulton to Matt Kahn's beautiful poem ""I Am"". Matt is anbeautiful spiritual teacher who transmits powerful energy through his words. We've set our budget at $3960. The money raised will cover studio time, album design, duplication costs and reward distribution. In the event that someone goes for the big prizes then some resources will go toward travel expenses. Yah!Kickstarter is an all-or-nothing fundraising platform. If we meet our goal then we go straight to production. I hope you get excited with us as we birth this dream into reality. Once you choose to back us we will keep you updated with our progress. Recording has already begun and we are looking to wrap it up by late June.Please check out the rewards and help us turn this dream into a reality. Thank you! May you be richly blessed by supporting our project. InJoy! Doug and The Taodogs.""We are vibrational beings.

In season 2 we will get a bit more of a look into Sally and why she is telling the story's that we are watching. As well as a new cast of lovable character.Watch Season 1 HERE: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sWtkjGp-DSc&t=291sSALLY started as part of our student university project. The original brief was to create only a three part web drama and run this across other social media platforms.However, the Sally series garnered an overwhelming amount of love and support. The production team had little idea how the pilot would be received, but in the six weeks after its premier on Youtube, the show has gathered an encouraging amount of attention; receiving numerous comments, fan-art, and support for the show as well as inquiries over more episodes.We're raising money to continue this beloved show.We care about this show so much because it is something we have always wanted pursue, being able to create fun content online for an audience. We had no idea what would come of it but over the past 6 weeks have watched the show blossom. Receiving many comments, fan-art and support for the show, with people asking if there will be more episodes.As this was a university project it was scheduled to be completed at the end of march and for us to completely move on to a new project in April. We don't want to end this series as we have many ideas and want to continue making episodes. However, the show costs a lot to produce so we need your help so we can continue it and to evolve the show into something greater!WHO WE AREThe team started with 6 people. From the student project 3 of us have stayed on to continue the show. However we are receive help from you guys and people we know in the film world.Chantelle/Yoka - A Fursuit Maker who has been on YouTube for many years and has always wanted to create a successful show starring a diverse range of characters.

These include many officially licensed audio adventures of Doctor Who (Big Finish Productions), the new horror anthology series Hammer Chillers (Hammer Films) and comedy horror series The Scarifyers (Bafflegab Productions).Osiris is a 6 episode original cinematic science-fiction audio drama series intended to be listened to in 5.1 surround sound (also available in standard stereo) andeach episode will have a 1-hour running time. This Kickstarter project will fund the first two epsiodes:Pilot and Osirian Enemy.For those of you unfamiliar with the term ‘audio drama’, itis a term that is used to describe a radio play produced for CD release,digital download and web streaming. Unlike narrated audiobooks, audio drama is designed to sound like a filmor television drama but using only audio to engage the listener’s ownimagination and provide the images. This is where audio drama excels where filmcannot. Your imagination is far more powerful than any CGI effect and becauseit is purely sound your senses are heightened and it is much easier to be drawninto the acoustic environment. It is my strong opinion that an audio drama production does have to be well madeotherwise something like an overused library sound effect could jolt you rightout of the story and you will become instantly aware of the editing.Here is a trailer for my cinematic sound design, music and mixing work on the officially BBC licenced Doctor Who box set UNIT - Dominion. It will give you a small taster of how Osiris will sound in stereo...Deep in the heart of Sherwood Forest stands a great ancient oak tree, The Major Oak. Myths and legends surround the tree and many theories have been cast about its unusual size but none are close to the truth.In a hidden cave beneath the Major Oak lies a semi-organic spaceship buried for thousands of years until October 2014 when a freak tremor causes graphic designer Jason Fox to fall into the cave while walking in the woodland with his flatmate William Tyler. Upon rescue they are joined by their old university friend Christopher Mason and the three of them are thrown into an epic adventure within our own solar system that they will never forget.The six episodes of series one are as follows:Jason Fox discovers a spaceship hidden for thousands of years beneath Sherwood Forest. Fox and his friends are thrown into a dangerous adventure and chased by authorities around the world.Osiris is fired upon by Isis, an identical ship piloted by an alien female who wants Fox dead.The Osiris crew find a strange planet in Earth's orbit on the opposite side of the sun and become stranded.Jessica boards Osiris when it comes tumbling out of a wormhole and gets caught in the gravitational pull of a moon.Fox is in a world of dreams and nightmares where he is put through a series ofchallenges.The Osiris crew travel to Egyptto find local tribes being forced to build massive structures by an evil godlike being.I’ve been developing Osiris for a number of years. Listeningto it will be like listening to a Hollywood blockbuster film on audio withincredible atmospheric sound design and a huge orchestral soundtrack. It willalso be one of the first of its kind to be mixed and available in 5.1 surroundsound on aLimited Edition DVD as well as a standard stereo CD. It will also be available as a digital download in either format.Everyone who backs the project at £20 or more will receive both episodes as a 5.1 surround sound MP3 (backwards compatible as a stereo MP3) and playable on PC, Playstation 3, DVD and Blu-Ray players, MP3 players (stereo) and most smartphones.Limited Edition DVD -The Limited Edition DVD is available to anyone who backs the project at £40 or more. These are limited and numbered to 1000 and are only available to Kickstarter backers. It contains a feature-length version of the first two episodes in 5.1 surround sound, behind-the-scenes material, complete orchestral music score in 5.1 surround sound and a thank you video.I have an amazing production team working on the project, most of which have been working in the industry for many years on some of the best television and radio programmes in recent years.Barnaby Edwards is confirmed as director of episodes one and two. As well as being principle Dalek operator of the current TV series of Doctor Who, Barnaby has directed many official BBC licensed Doctor Who audio dramas and runs a bespoke audiobook company called Textbook Stuff. We have a brilliant working relationship and have previously worked together on Doctor Who audio dramas includingThe Doomwood Curse and The Book of Kells. Our creativity is very similar in tone and style so our ideas usually gel very well together.Due to legal technicalities the cast will be announced after the recording has taken place and backers will get exclusivity on all developments. For now all I can tell you is that the Osiris cast have appeared in popular British television drama such as Doctor Who, Gavin & Stacey, Merlin and Robin Hood.This kind of production, which is our most ambitious yet,isn't a cheap process. It costs a little over £5000 per 1-hour episode so that writers, directors, actors, artists, specialized studio rental, advertising, CD manufacturing and design printing can bepaid for.In total we are asking for £10,000 to make these first two episodes. Only backers receive the episodes at a reduced rate!So with your help and support we can get this cinematic audio dramaseries off the ground and the initial episodes sent to Kickstarter backers* on CD, Limited Edition DVD and digitaldownload in April 2014.*Episode two will not be available to the public until June 2014.For more information or to hear more samples of previous productions you can visit my website at everybodylese.co.ukIf our initial funding goal of £10,000 is surpassed then we have stretch goals for this project which will allow more episodes to be recorded, edited, mass produced and released as dated above. Here are those stretch goals...£20,000 - Allows episodes 3 & 4 to be produced and released professionally.£30,000 - Allows episodes 3, 4, 5 & 6 to be produced and released professionally.If these stretch goals are reached then everyone who gives £30 or more will receive free stereo downloads of additional episodesthat were funded via Kickstarter as they are released, saving £32!My name is Martin Johnson and for 8 years I have been providing cinematic sound design, orchestral music, audio editing, mixing and mastering for some of Britain's best loved audio dramas, most of which have been broadcast on BBC Radio.

Here are some of the special content on the USB drive:I have an amazing production team working on the project, most of which have been working in the industry for many years on some of the best television and radio programmes in recent years.Barnaby Edwardsis confirmed as director of episodes one and two. As well as being principle Dalek operator of the current TV series ofDoctor Who, Barnaby has directed many official BBC licensedDoctor Whoaudio dramas and runs a bespoke audiobook company calledTextbook Stuff. We have a brilliant working relationship and have previously worked together onDoctor Whoaudio dramas includingThe Doomwood CurseandThe Book of Kells.Our creativity is very similar in tone and style so our ideas usually gel very well together.Due to legal technicalities the cast will be announced after the recording has taken place and backers will get exclusivity on all developments. For now all I can tell you is that theOsiriscast have appeared in popular British television drama such asDoctor Who, Gavin & Stacey, MerlinandRobin Hood.In total we are asking for £1,000 to get these first two episodes released and into mainstream outlets such as Amazon, Play, iTunes, etc.So with your help and support we can get this cinematic audio drama series off the ground and the initial episodes sent to Kickstarter backers* on CD, Limited Edition DVD and digital download in April 2014.*Episode two will not be available to the public until June 2014.For more information or to hear more samples of previous productions you can visit my website ateverybodylese.co.ukMy name isMartin Johnsonand for 8 years I have been providing cinematic sound design, orchestral music, audio editing, mixing and mastering for some of Britain's best loved audio dramas, most of which have been broadcast on BBC Radio. These include many officially licensed audio adventures ofDoctor Who(Big Finish Productions), the new horror anthology seriesHammer Chillers(Hammer Films) and comedy horror seriesThe Scarifyers(Bafflegab Productions).I have worked on many short film productions and a couple of officially licensedDoctor Whostage plays. My music and sound design can be heard on the re-imagined film version ofThe Power of the Daleks. I also created the entire title sequence for this film.I have also directed and produced an audio drama version of F.Paul Wilson's horror novelThe Keep, however,this was not made for public audiences.My future goal is to continue providing good audio drama that pushes the boundaries of current technology so that audiences can experience sound like never before!Thank you for taking an interest in a project I've been developing for most of my adult life. Without your backing we cannot bring Osiris to life in an world of sound.Martin Johnson",The biggest challenge for the Osiris project is funding it! We need all the help we can get to get the word around about this exciting new audio drama series. We will be promoting the Kickstarter project from day one and to make it successful we need your help. So please do whatever you can to make others aware of our cinematic adventure!Everyone involved is a established professional in the media production business so a delay in the release of the episodes is extremely unlikely. Barnaby and I have produced these audio dramas many times so we know what we're doing and how to make it successful.

https://www.kickstarter.com/projects/busstopburger/bus-stop-burger?ref=discovery_category_newest,busstopburger/bus-stop-burger,"Hi, I'm Lamont Crockett,I'm interested in partnering with you to bring positive change every where I go. I grew up in Milwaukee, Wisconsin, sometimes, lost in the fast moving world around me. As I look back on my life, I realize that I was a scared little boy who didn't have any idea what I was doing. At the time, I acted tough. I acted like a man; the man my dad always told me I needed to be. In reality, I was lost. Look at that picture. Do I look like I knew what I was doing? I remember times when we didn’t have food to eat, but I was tough. When the gas was cut off for lack of payment, we’d heat water on an electric grill for the family, but we were tough. When the electricity was turned off, we’d light candles to see, but we were tough. We had to be. It's what my dad said.I wasn't tough. I'm still not tough. I did stupid things. I have an actual police department booking photo of me at 11 years old on my phone. I keep it to remind me of where I came from and to keep me grounded. It reminds me that I needed help to succeed. I needed help to be strong. These days I am strong. But it's not because I'm resilient or lucky, or because I'm me. It's because I had family. Not just my mom and dad, but I had people that loved and cared for me. People that wanted me to succeed. These days, I'm a Police Officer. I volunteer with multiple programs as a youth mentor, and give my time whenever I can. I've realized that I'm tough, not alone, but together, with you. I want to help others the way I was helped. I want to show people that we're a family, and we're in this together. I want them to be tough. I'm not here to give you a sob story. I want you to know why I want to build a food truck. In essence, I want to bring smiles to the faces of my family: you. Show you that we're tough together.I'm sure everyone remembers the struggle meals they had growing up. American Cheese on White bread? Sugar and cinnamon on buttered toast? The memories always put a smile on my face, and I hope you think of them fondly. They helped make you who you are today.When I was younger my dad made burgers that he called “Welfare Burgers.” He would mix toppings such as green peppers and onions, with the burger meat. Doing this made the burgers bigger while using less meat (saved money), but in turn we felt more full. They were welfare burgers…because…well, we were on welfare. It was crass, but it was humor in a crappy situation.I intend to serve these burgers on the food truck. They're delicious. Trust me, I've tried them. That doesn't count? Oh.I’ve always remembered my dad's welfare burgers. I want to spin my dad’s burger ideas and offer them to others. I have created a menu of “welfare burger” inspired cuisine and plan to open a food truck with the idea. The burgers will not only be topped in local, fresh toppings and produce, but also have the toppings inside. Take my Tex-Mex Burger. An all-beef burger with roasted green chilis, and red peppers inside, topped with pepper jack cheese, onion tanglers, cajun avocado spread, lettuce and tomato, all on a toasted bun. Sounds delicious, huh? That’s just one of my creations. I plan to use earth friendly items, locally sourced food, and offer vegetarian alternatives.As a police officer, I have a front row seat to the injustices in the world. I became a police officer because I wanted to elicit change in the world. I enjoy what I do, and I truly hope I make a difference and make the world a better place. I want to to do even more. I continue to see the need in the world, and I will do my part.EmployeesI intend to show that we are a family, and are tough together. That being said, I will employ at-risk youth, helping provide professional employee experiences, personal development, and, of course, food. Additionally, employees will focus on beneficial actions dedicated to their family and community. Employees will fulfill a required amount of service to the community and themselves, such as volunteering, trash collecting, or social and emotional development with professionals.DonationsA portion of profit from the bus will go toward community programs to further the causes they serve. This food bus, will increase positive contact with our community, and in turn, we will increase the positive in the community. Our bus will turn away no person in need. No need to have American cheese on white bread, enjoy one of our burgers on us.I also intend to partner with community entities for fundraising through food sales on the food bus. The BusThe last way I intend to create a positive community is with our bus atmosphere. Initially, the design of the bus was to incorporate a dining experience in the front with the rear containing a full service kitchen. The front was to be an eating area for those that want to ""dine on."" Local laws and ordinances have put a damper on those ideas. I'm not giving up, no. I'm tweaking the ideas a bit.We had a bus. A Flat-nose Thomas HDX. It was 40 feet long! Seeing as the dining idea is being tabled for the time being, we did not stay with the bus. It makes us sad, but we roll with the punches. We'll even have to change the logo!We will still obtain a bus, but a shorter one that fits within the legal realm for food trucks. Additionally, we have plans for future expansion such as additional busses. These ideas are also being morphed into brick and mortar restaurant ideas.What I’m asking from you is to assist me in my journey. I have an idea. I have a will. And where there’s a will, there’s a way. I need assistance in turning my idea into a tangible product. Your funds will go to the following:Retrofitting a food truck can be costly. We need help with this. We are currently in the stages of website and social media creation, along with registering the business as an entity. The wheels are moving! I am putting a fair amount of my personal funds into this endeavor, but hoping that you won't make me do it alone.The bus will have a Build Your Own Burger for those who don't like my creations, but here are a few of the Chef's favorite ""welfare burgers"" we'll be serving.Tex-Mex BurgerA Cajun seasoned burger patty with jalapenos and green peppers inside, topped with homemade guacamole, Pepperjack cheese, lettuce, tomato, and onion tanglers.The WiscoA seasoned burger with Bacon, American cheese, and Chedder cheese inside. Topped with a Wisconsin Brat, onion tanglers, and house mayo. You'll be full and satisfied.The Mushroom SwissA seasoned burger blended with sauteed crimini mushrooms inside. Topped with more sauteed mushrooms, onions, and Swiss cheese. A tangy house mayo completes the ensemble.More to ComeWe'll be offering more chef creations, french fries, sweet potatoes fries, ice cream, and vegetarian alternatives.Even if you do not donate to my cause, I hope that you go out trying to make the world better, one small act at time. Give a smile, when you have nothing else to give. It's my philosophy. Things are going to get tough and things sometimes suck. No other way too look at it. But we'll be okay.","I think the biggest problem we face is uncertainty. As said before, I dont have a bus, or quite yet the funds to outfit one. I have an idea.

",Fashionistas may make fun of us for poor accessories. But we will soldier onward.,https://www.kickstarter.com/projects/1972598316/guardians-of-fire-the-science-and-ethics-of-spacet-0?ref=discovery_category_newest,1972598316/guardians-of-fire-the-science-and-ethics-of-spacet-0,"What the Film Series Is About Guardians of Fire is an introspective, critical look at the human race. It is an ethical, practical self-diagnostic on human society and how we interact with the Universe around us. Presented over eleven 22-minute episodes released on YouTube, Guardians of Fire seeks to aid in the continued improvement of people as ethical, helpful creatures in the Universe. In 2017 the human race sits atop a pinnacle of technology and power over the natural world. The nations of the Developed World share an abundance of advanced technology and sophisticated social systems that would have been unthinkable even 100 years ago. With almost 8 billion people onboard, Earth is becoming a small place with insufficient resources to meet the intemperate demands of humanity. The next logical expansion point for humanity is outer space, but the conversion of humanity from a Type 0 (planetary) to a Type 1 (extra-planetary) civilization will be arduous because we are dealing with humans here. Guardians of Fire will take viewers through a 10,000-foot analysis of humanity from as much of a non-human perspective as possible. With the belief that people will eventually expand into outer space, the film series will examine the nine practical and ethical challenges that seem to be holding us back or threatening to destroy us. The first four episodes will deal with our propensity for ethical folly regarding our ceaseless: greed, pride, stupidity, and violence. The next five episodes will deal with practical concerns, including: energy use, social design, technological innovation / stagnation, medicine / genomics, and expansion planning. Two episodes will sum it all up in the hope that Guardians of Fire helps future generations of humans meet the strategic challenges that will continue to face people, potentially threatening our survival or ethical merit as creatures in the Universe. Why is this Different:The space of futurism is an interesting one and has recently become crowded with projects like Year Million or Cosmos. No catalogue of these projects exists, but they seem to be split into three distinct styles. In one camp are the works of science fiction, fanciful tales often insightful but lacking basis in science. In another camp are the scientific documentaries, works founded in science but often lacking insight and imagination. Finally come studies in ethics, philosophical or religious studies that too tend to be limited. Guardians of Fire seeks to combine the three styles, creating an inclusive project that is imaginative and insightful but still founded in reality and an ethical core. The argument of this film is specifically designed to be different and to present an alternative perspective on humanity.Documentarians love to shoot for the stars and talk about interesting and cool things like Dyson Spheres or Cloaked Star Destroyers. But those things are eons from being realized. This film is about the now, about getting humanity to the launching pad before we blow up. Breakdown of Funds:I will be doing all of the writing, editing, and narration by sweat equity. The 1000 will be used to buy digital rights on photos and video clips. The usual price for the media file I will be using is between $2 and 3$, and so the Kickstarter funds will be used to purchase rights to about 500 images/video clips. I will also be using some of the funds to buy a quality microphone ($150). By the standards of developed world I am asking for a small amount of money. This approach is intentional, putting together a quality video presentation is not that intricate, and in the style of this project I want to show how much you can create with as few of resources as possible.If you don't think $1000 is a lot of money then you really don't understand what's going on in the World right now. Throwing money at something does not always make for a better end product. All video and image files are royalty free and part of the public domain via Pexels.com and Wiki Commons. Music by: http://www.bensound.com/royalty-free-music ","The hard part of the project will be developing a final script that is unique, perceptive, analytical, heartfelt and not biased about Humanity. This trial is made more difficult by the fact that the final narrative must say something meaningful about Humanity and not be swallowed by moral subjectivity.Second to the theoretical challenges will be the actual process of editing video, sound and other media files. I have 2 years experience doing this but this will be my biggest project. The good news is that most definitions of Humanity say that I am adaptive and can manipulate tools."

We are raising funds for a fully illustrated collection of short stories including a secret 13th chapter only available here on Kickstarter! 25 brand new stories of horror, mystery and madness each featuring their own beautiful illustration and with additional page decorations.I'm a full time artist working with my good friend, author Sean Walter to bring this project to life. Last October, we attended the Dark Arts exhibition here in Whitby together, which is where we started plotting a major collaboration. (photo credit Simon Blackwood Gallery)We have worked together before - I produced an illustration for his short An Invited Guest, Sean wrote Forgotten Resident to accompany my drawing of Stephen Under The Bed. This book is our opportunity to combine our skills to produce something extraordinary. We have included the two above to demonstrate what we can do. All stories and illustrations in the book and other rewards are brand new, created just for this project. Copies of the two tales above and art prints are available via our own websites. We have already designed the postcard level, shown below.The chapbooks will look similar to the stack below - illustrations will depend on the stories within and covers will vary in colour.What's the plan long term? Your pledges help in the following ways: A portion goes on the basic expenses of running this project - keeping the rain out and the lights on while we work. The rest (after Kickstarter fees) is for the production and shipping of the rewards. If we exceed our initial target (and we sincerely hope we will) we have the opportunity to invest in professional representation and support to help us develop our careers. In return, we give you your choice of the following rewards: If we meet our target, Sean will share a short story reading with you. Stephen and Mr Thingy will help by acting out a key sequence of the story. They're good like that. One last thing - this project is all or nothing. Without your support, the monsters won't have our full attention and will be very sad. Or bored, which is much worse....","This project is low risk. We have allowed a realistic amount of time for the creation of the stories to allow for all creative activities including retrieving lost plots, the proper care and feeding of monsters, etc. The paperback edition and postcards are being produced by companies we have previous experience with. With the chapbooks, we have a choice of production methods which will be dictated by the number of backers we have for those levels. We can hand produce the chapbooks, or if we have enough orders, we have negotiated with a small press to have them bound professionally. This is why we have reserved sufficient time to complete half the book before sending any out.We will announce such decisions as and when we hit those points to keep you up to date.",https://www.kickstarter.com/projects/drawingindark/tales-in-sombre-tones?ref=discovery_category_newest,drawingindark/tales-in-sombre-tones,"Welcome ! I am Karen, a full time artist (working under the name Drawing In Dark) currently working on a brand new horror anthology with my friend, author Sean Walter.Unlike most author and illustrator productions, this is a real collaborative project with things crawling out of both our imaginations and has been a huge amount of fun so far. We want to share that fun by putting on a fully immersive touring show with readings, the original artwork, animation, and more to bring people right into the book. That's where you come in.Because we also want to provide 3d versions of the artwork for the blind and partially sighted, sign language versions of the readings and so on, it's a pretty epic production. We've managed to get Arts Council (more about them in FAQ) backing and other funding for most of what we need but we're still a little short. So we decided to to offer some exclusive, limited edition goodies and signed copies of the book to raise the rest, using two of the full page illustrations.RewardsThe £1 reward tier is for those who just want to support the project but don't necessarily want anything right now. By way of a thank you for putting a pound in the pot anyway, we'll email you a taster of what's next and report back after the show to tell you how it went and share some of the highlights.The £5 reward tier gets you a pair of mini prints in the form of high quality bookmarks featuring our chosen illustrations.The £10 reward tier is an E-book edition of Tales in Sombre Tones, emailed directly to you, in whatever format your E-reader will take. We have 2 x £25 reward tiers - the first is an E-book edition of the book with an a5 fine art print of one of the illustrations (two to choose from). The print measures14.8cm x 21cm, and is supplied without a mount to keep your shipping costs down.The next £25 reward tier is a physical, high quality paperback copy of Tales in Sombre Tones, sent to you anywhere in the world. The £30 reward tier is simple: one E-book and one high quality paperback copy of Tales in Sombre Tones so you can read it however you like- you get both, and at a lower price.The £50 reward tier is all of the aforementioned rewards, but the paperback book is signed by both of us; author and artist. It also includes a mounted fine art print of one of the illustrations from Tales in Sombre Tones, signed by me. You will be contacted to choose your preferred print from these eerie options. The prints are A5 in size (14.8cm x 21cm or 11.7in x 16.5 in).The prints are a Kickstarter exclusive and will only be printed at this size as rewards.The Barghest is a legendary hell hound who prowls the street of Karen's home town of Whitby and stalks through one of our stories.The great and terrible Catmonkey, a representation of a real object found on the shore, who has such personality we just had to give him his own chapter.The £100 reward tier gets you everything offered so far, plus all of the extras we'll be using for the tour itself on a convenient thumb drive. These materials include stop-motion animations of Stephen, Mr Thingy and friends, recorded readings from the events, haunting video, and whatever other bits we can fit in the box, including copies of the programme and other promotional material so you can join in at home. Our funding goal and spending is pretty straightforward - £500 of it goes to complete the tour requirements so we can go, go, go. The rest is to produce the physical rewards. If we exceed our target, and we do very much hope we will, any extra goes on any improvements to the project and producing a special edition featuring additional illustrations in the form of page borders and so on, material from which we will be offering as stretch rewards.We hope that you'll join us, and our monsters, in these Tales in Sombre Tones.Stretch reward #1 has been unleashed ! Please see update 3 for the extra goodies everyone gets. We have more up our sleeves to keep pledging and sharing.Stretch reward #2 - let's double up ! If we hit £2100 by the end of the funding period, everyone gets one of these...Meet the Borrower - a graveyard guardian I encountered when I lived in London. We couldn't do the book without including him and so I worked up this portrait of him, as glimpsed through a cobweb, going on his nightly prowl around the cemetery. This creepy composition will be made into extra thank you rewards to add to everyone's packages. Those pledging at digital levels will get a background for their devices with a quote from the story, bookmark folks get another one, those at physical book pledge get a free bookmark, the £50 and £100 levels get a bonus print of him to add to their collection. We can only cover the costs of that if we hit the double funded mark so get sharing - 14 days and counting !","This project is very low risk as we already have the images for the art based rewards and are a good way through the rest of the book. For the tour, we have managed to get ourselves most of the way there thanks to other funding partners and their backing gives us the thumbs up as we've had to pass their risk assessments to get this far. The book will be going to print in spring of 2019 in time for the tour and we will be posting rewards including the book when the tour is complete to make sure we have everything done."

https://www.kickstarter.com/projects/sweetartmarsh/craft-marshmallows-yes-inspired-and-wildly-creativ?ref=discovery_category_newest,sweetartmarsh/craft-marshmallows-yes-inspired-and-wildly-creativ,"Hello Kickstarter,I'm Michele Bezue, Fluff Artist for SWEET artisan marshmallows and owner of SWEET, a confections boutique & cafe in the Morningside neighborhood of Detroit, opening early fall this year. Earlier this year on Kickstarter, we introduced you to our a-maz-ing fluff and s'mores. We have growna lot, as well aslearned a lot from our mistakes since then. We'vealso had great opportunities to get some local media attention, a cooking segment on our local morning showand build awareness of our company here in Detroit.We are now on a mission to create the MOSTwildly creative, culinary-inspired line of marshmallows andmarshmallow-inspired treatsyou have ever seen. We believe that we can create simply the BEST. FLUFF. EVER.We are stepping up our craftsmanship and in addition to using the locally sourced, always fresh ingredients which we already do now, we will also bemaking our own bourbon-barrel aged vanilla, simple syrups and even tea blends, straight from our local distilleries, which we will use in our new, culinary-inspiredline of craft fluff. These ingredients will take on the complex flavor of the barrel, with a caramely, custardy and even smokytwist, adding another layer of delicious.And, we will really get back to basics with a line of medicinal marshmallows (which is what they were originally used for) which we will craft from actual marshmallow root!!1. SWEET artisan marshmallows are made with high-quality, premium ingredients, but the most important ingredient which I can add to my marshmallows is L.O.V.E. I am simply in love with everything about creating and sharing the marshmallows, starting with the exciting process of coming up with new flavors, to the look on EVERYONE's face when they try them for the first time and each unexpected, individual note hits their tastebuds. 2. Every flavor you taste and any color you see comes from nature. All natural flavor and color make our marshmallows taste exactly like the fruit, spice, root, herb or any other ingredient it is named for.3. Our marshmallows are made in small batches, by hand, when they are ordered for the maximum freshness. Although, with a shelf life of 4-6 weeks, they are still wonderful in hot beverages, cocktails, cereal, and to use in your crisp rice treats and, s'mores toward the end of their life cycle. Trust us, they will be gone LONG before they expire.4. Every ingredient such as cake, candied bacon, cheesecake, tea, coffee, brittle, butterand more is handmade in our kitchen before it goes into our marshmallows.5. We have a NO waste kitchen. Leftover mango pureeand fresh-squeezed lemon juice combine for an amazing mango lemonade, extra lavender or hibiscus tea make a great addition to a glass of white wine or a scrumptious mixer for a drink. Our scraps are shared with other area bakers to use in marshmallow frosting, fondant, filling and more.Some of you may have tasted our fluff here in Detroit or even around the country, but you are in for a real culinary treat when you try these complex and somewhat sophisticated flavors of our new craft line. We are starting with8 flavors for Kickstarter backers only and we'll add a new flavor and/or treat as stretch goals are hit.Violet & White Chocolate - Our house-made violet liqueur adds a tangy sweet flavor to this white chocolate marshmallow.

And I want to push the crossword format, and all its delightful varieties, with the imagination that you'd find in a good science-fiction novel.It's tough to tell you too much more without spoiling the answers for you, but the puzzles will explore most of the crossword types now being documented in my essay series, ""Callin' Them Squares,"" and hit a ""Wednesday/Thursday"" level of difficulty (somewhere comfortably between insultingly easy and mind-crushingly hard). Though there'll be a big emphasis on sci-fi trivia, it'll still be sci-fi trivia that most fans have a reasonable chance of knowing or guessing.Once funding is complete, you'll begin receiving one each weekday, in printable PDF and online-solvable JPZ formats. With the fiftieth crossword, you'll receive a more convenient collected edition.

Through the blending of mechanical and naturaltonalitiesandrhythms, Holy Motor Bluesseeks to provide a soundtrack for Michigan's past, present and potential future.PROJECT BACKGROUNDThis collection of recordings stems from a project started in 2003. The initial goal was to blend Moog synth with a folk-approach at songwriting. Through the blending of these textures and tonalites, we're trying to create applicable stories for people in the region, and applicable melodies/rhythms for people around the world. What should be most evident in these recordings is a ""grind-it-out"", Midwestern attitude without relying on ""ruin-porn"" or an overlyrevivalist sentiment.We want these songs to be what they are, nothing more, nothing less. It's not art for the artist's sake, and we've taken that to heart. The more people these songs resonate with, the happier we are.WHAT WE'LL DO WITH THE FUNDSWhat we (myself and engineer Jesse Barabe) have ended up with, is something bigger than expected and we need your help to finish it. Most of the recording is done but we need more time to produce, mix, and package the album. Funds raised will be used for production, post-production, musician travel costs. A majority of the funds raised will be used for the physicalmanufacturingof the album. Backers supporting us with more than $25 will recieve a digital copy as well as a physical copy of the full length CD. Funds raised will also be used to pay for gifts for our backers (of course).WHY WE'RE ASKING FOR SUPPORTThese songs are composed with string arrangements, Moog synths, orchestral percussion, brass and analog beats. This makes it nearly impossible to perform the music live. Our goal is to generate enough enthusiasm around the project that one day, down the road, we will have the resources to perform these pieces as they should be: five core band members, a ten-piece string section, three percussionists, three brass players and two vocalists.NOTE:If backers push us over our initial goal, we may consider doing a short run of vinyl, and/or a video for one or two songs.",,https://www.kickstarter.com/projects/153590836/laverty-torres-group-detroit-ii?ref=discovery_category_newest,153590836/laverty-torres-group-detroit-ii,"We have been playing together since 1995. After many years, we've settled in nicely with Steve Nyquist (Sprout) as drummer.We want to release one of our live performances on vinyl and cassette.Please help us and allow us to continue our journey to go further within our musical endeavors.The $1,100 will go mostly to printing the vinyl and cassettes, and some to paying for our live recording.If we happen to go over our goal, we will use the additional money to make upgrades to the production quality of the physical album itself, eg. better materials, packaging, etc.","This is our second attempt. This time, we're stripping away a majority of the production costs and shooting for the cost of printing vinyl and cassettes. A small amount of the money will go to the live recordist who will have to be on the premises for 2-3 days.The challenge is to bring the same energy and emotion that occurred in November of 2015. It will happen. When the four of us play, there is a chemistry that embraces the unknown and unpredictable."

This will be the PREMIER issue of what I hope will become a regular magazine of literature, stories, dreams, fears, and everything in between (that’s a lot of stuff to feature). All stories provoke a response and show us something, either from the writer or ourselves the reader, from love to betrayal, or adventure and philosophy. Imagine what a tree is thinking when it is the only tree when it is lonely, or maybe how it feels to loved, or maybe sneak a glimpse of the secrets told in coffee shops. Goal is $1,100.Curious yet? I have pledge levels that include Tweeter, Blogger, Poet, Novelist, and Playwright. There are also Stretch Goals that include being able to purchase/rent Adobe Photoshop ($1,500), add a second bookmark design ($2,000), and upgrade the printing of the magazine to premium ($2,500).Then come with me for stories to be told, and maybe you will be inspired in the process. ","This is a first for me, so there are a number of challenges that come with the first time out of the gate. I have to find a printer who has an amazing reputation and good cost. I need to find a printer who will provide me with stellar backer perks at a high quality of great costs.I expect that withing those two categories, that I will be facing ups and downs. I will be providing regular updates on the progress of the project.Another challenge is laying out of the periodical, so I will need to learn to be able to put a literature periodical together. The updates will also feature some of that process.But I am really excited to take this leap into a bigger and to chronicle this journey.

My name is Cindy, an Independent Writer, Poet, Storyteller, and Playwright, here to present my literary magazine to you.When I started the journey to self-publication, I wasn't sure what to expect. Deciding to become a fully independent writer, with all of the amazing highs and impossible lows was the right choice and the timing as perfect,finding my team and having an awesome support system. Everything I has experience since the beginning of the year has surpassed all of my expectations thus far.And that is just the beginning, becauseI found that not only am one helluvah writer and editor, but a salesman, a marketing designer, and a sticker artist.I still want to share my writing with all of you, I just have a better idea how to do it.So...After January, I started work on a PDF version of my literary magazine, Stories to be Told; an Issue Zero, with my editor-in-chief and layout designer, Anthony. That was an experience, but so much fun doing it. There was a lot of coffee and movie discussion that happened tduring that time. We finished Issue Zero within a month and a half later and were ready to tackle a Kickstarter relaunch in April.I have so many stories that want to be told, but I also realized that there are plenty of writers that also want that. So , there will be an inclusion of other writers, which is what makes a regular occurring magazine that much more exciting. We will bring you stories from near and far, wide and varied. Anthony and I are ready to bring them to you. We also have Beth as our resident artist who brought the August Tree to life, and I will be bringing in new artists as well to this project.There are a lot new ideas with this Kickstarter, starting with Art Prints of Beth's August Tree, Stories to be Told starting to feature other writers, and more. And as I want to keeping making issues after this Kickstarter, I want to meet these other writers. There will also be more promo stickers and bookmarks, even a monthly newsletter. That is only the beginning, Dear Backers.So, are you interested yet?I have many backer levels with lots of neat perks available.My goal is $1,100.00 to print Issue One and build a website.My stretch goals include: $1,500.00, which will allow me to upgrade my printing to premium printing (colour) and art prints of the August Tree available to all Backers as an add-on option; and at $2,000.00, which will allow me to do a limited printing of Issue Zero and release a T-Rex sticker for every backer.Come and join me, Anthony, and Beth on this journey (we have cookies)!","The biggest risk with any Kickstarter is that sometimes you don't get the funding. As long as you learn something from it, then you are doing good. I am determined to make funding this time, as I learned a few things about promotion and presentation. Also, since my last Kickstarter, I have created a PDF version of the literary magazine, that I plan to publish in print form by the summer. I took a month and a half to development this into something awesome and dubbed as Issue Zero that my Backers will enjoy. So, with Issue One, I have developed new perks and new promo items that will be offered this time around.I have learned that to be successful, in Kickstarter, or anything, there is some degree of failure, but within that failure there is success, and I hope you will consider joining me on my journey to be an Independent Writer.Thank you!"

I like projects with crazy weird rules. I like making paintings for other people. This is all those things! I make three word experimental paintings that are affordable and fit anywhere… and I get to try out new stuff! It’s a win win win!Each painting is three words- a prompt of sorts! Sometimes the words are mechanical- like media or techniques (“oil”, “sand”, “scratch”, scribble”, etc.), sometimes they're tangible things that you'll see (""cat"", ""mountain"", ""sword"", and so on), and sometimes they’re more ephemeral (""sad"", ""fancy"", ""important"", ""secret"", etc.). The paintings will be on a piece of 5x7” Yupo paper, which is a very fascinating tree-less paper with a unique, plastic-y finish. I might attach things to them, but the final piece will remain 5x7”. They all have to be mixed media as well; I always have fun mixing stuff, so I made it so each painting needs to use at least two types of media (acrylic, oil, pastel, pen, dirt, alcohol, etc.).The words are chosen at random (or, for a little extra you can choose some or all of them!), and then I get to work, make the painting, and ship it off to you along with a little plaque with the name, media, and date of creation.Also, if you add an extra $15 to your pledge, I can frame your painting before shipping it!You bet! Here’s a few I’ve already made: This is “Hollow Hills Family”- it is acrylic, chrome marker, and was the first one I made- it was a fun exercise in structures of ambiguous solidness.“Explosive. Soup. Cliff”- acrylic and oil. A little obvious and uh… baudy, but fun and contains a weird phrase.“Boxes- Cloud Dangles”- pen and oil. A few people have told me that they often ""feel like this"" when I show them this painting... me too. A fun mix of techniques, from stabbing with the brush to turpentine burning!This one is “Deer/Scratch/Melt”. Oil, wax, and pen- I wanted to create textures that felt both soft and disgustingly vivid at the same time. Also, there are some animals!“Sweet Bear Forest”- I’ll let you figure out what’s going on here. It’s watercolor, pen, acrylic, and oil marker. “Fuzzy, mountain (yellow)”- a very textured landscape done in pastel and oil. I don’t think I’ve been more happy with a sky and mountain combination I’ve done in a looooooong time.Oh, hi! My name is Justice McDaniel, and I'm an artist from Allston (which is a tiny part of Boston), MA. I make a lot of art with imagined creatures and lands, and love to experiment with different styles, techniques, and media to try to create a sort of ""extra layer"" of reality. I'm pretty loud and sometimes do science work also because that's what I went to school for. I've made over 500 songs, have a cat and two degus and a wonderful girlfriend who all share a tiny apartment with me, and once drank a gallon Tampico in a day. I'm also pretty friendly, so feel free to ask me any questions about the project, myself, or whatever!","There's a few things that can slow this down a bit- when I use oil it goes slower, and sometimes it takes me a couple days to get Yupo. Sometimes I get a bit of painter's block and need to take a few days without producing anything I like. Other than that, there are very few risks or challenges... rest easy: I will always be painting, and I like making stuff for other people.",https://www.kickstarter.com/projects/justiceeatstrees/weird-new-england-painted-polaroids-with-magical-animals?ref=discovery_category_newest,justiceeatstrees/weird-new-england-painted-polaroids-with-magical-animals,"Or is it maybe a little more? For this year's Make 100, I decided to posit my answer to this question while combining two of my major artistic loves: creature design and weird landscape photography!Pardon the introduction if you know me already, but my name is Justice, and I love to design and create magical creatures- always have, always will. They mean a lot to me, and I care a lot about each one, because creating them makes them real for me. When I get to paint or draw or sculpt them into existence, it gives them even more reality. Of late, I've also been crazy about photography; specifically, photographing nature in a way where process (instant film like Polaroids, pinhole photography, multi-exposure experiments, etc.) changes and reveals something hidden and different about the subject.This project is an idea I've been cooking up for awhile, where I get to bring these two passions together into one thing: an augmented reality project (if you'll indulge the term a bit) wherein I get to put my creatures into landscapes I've captured in my own unique ways using the beautifully faulty Polaroid cameras I've come to own. You never know what strange thing will happen to each shot, and it makes each photo a unique and special little surprise, full of life and character, which I then use to guide me in creating an animal in that tiny, one-of-a-kind landscape.The only thing I needed once I started painting these was a good way to display them- I usually don't care much for frames, as I feel they tend to separate people from the art they want, so after a lot of thinking and talking to friends, I settled on the ""Edgeless Frame""- of course, not finding any that were readily available AND exactly what I wanted, I decided to create my own, using acrylic and some basic shop skills... I think they're pretty cool! Just look at how the picture seems to float- plus, it's protected now: WIN WIN!I am especially excited to do this project, because it lets me create a great big menagerie of creatures and think about the kind of worlds they'd live in, and to practice and expand my ability in designing unique, bold beings. Then, I get to share all these lifeforms with YOU- the people who pledge! So, please- help me do what I love to do, and get yourself some cool, one-of-a-kind art in the process!So, I got to thinking... what if I got just a little more money for this thing? Could I ACTUALLY make 100, even if people haven't ordered all 100 yet? And the answer I think is yes! And then, if I DID make all 100, how could I share that with everyone? The answer: A ZINE WITH SCANS OF ALL 100. I'd do this as an add-on item that Kickstarter supporters could get for basically cost! Now, to afford all the film and paint to really get to 100, I'm asking to see if we can raise $1694 for this project (this number is supposedly the year that the photochemical effect was first officially described)- What do you think? Can we do it?","THERE ARE NO RISKS BECAUSE I AM GREAT AT THIS. ... I mean, stuff might get delayed a little, depending on shipping times for film and acrylic, but really, I don't see much that could go wrong here."

Submissions are collected in the spring, editors select a number of pieces, and a prize jury selects the winning short story and essay. Pieces selected by editors appear in the printed anthology which is available in November. The anthology is published by Rusty Scythe Publishing, an independent publisher located in Omaha, NE.PRIZESThe winning story author receives a $250 prize, as does the winning author of the creative nonfiction category.WHAT IS NEEDED TO FUND THE PROJECT?Some books can be completed for a small amount of money in a short amount of time with little effort. The Scythe Prize is not one of those books. With the hope that this book will become a series and a proven, trusted place for collegiate writers to showcase their work, Rusty Scythe doesn’t want to just manufacture a book; rather, Rusty Scythe wishes to publish an inspiring, beautiful, exciting book done right.“Done right” to Rusty Scythe means submitting a call for papers to thousands of colleges and universities across the country. It means advertising on social media and the web, hiring a designer and type setter, using an accomplished digital printer, employing a prize jury, submitting the book for awards and reviews, printing books for donors and authors who appear in the collection, and getting the book into the world’s largest distribution channels among other things.Together, we can create something wonderful, help aspiring writers, and reap a harvest of new voices to impact the future of literature. eric@rustyscythe.com.

If submissions are limited, there could be a problem. That's why a list of at least 1000 college professors will be attained, assuring the collection of getting a large enough number of talented and interested writers. With our knowledge of printing and producing on a timeline, we're aware of pitfalls and delays. That's why we use only the most reliable designers, editors and printers. With our experience, it's hard to say there will be any unexpected pitfalls, but there's nothing that can't be handled given our commitment to this project.",https://www.kickstarter.com/projects/1480360085/the-2017-scythe-prize-anthology?ref=discovery_category_newest,1480360085/the-2017-scythe-prize-anthology,"Narratives are essential for all of us. We tell stories about ourselves to record history, to keep the wolf from the door, to contribute to culture, and many other reasons. The 2017 Scythe Prize is an avenue for young writers to share their art and become celebrated as storytellers.The 2017 Scythe Prize is the second edition in the Scythe Prize series. Its aim is to give undergraduate and graduate student creative writers an opportunity (maybe their initial one) in the world of print publishing. Here's what a New York Times Bestselling Author says of the 2016 Scythe Prize:“What a great batch of fiction, with the very best of it worthy of any short story anthology I've read in recent years. I'm excited for the futures of these writers.”-Timothy Schaffert, author of the New York Times bestseller The Swan Gondola WHAT IS THE SCYTHE PRIZE?The Scythe Prize is an annual printed book comprised of short stories and creative non-fiction written by college students from around the world. A Call for Papers is distributed early in the year, submissions are collected for a period of time thereafter, the editor selects a number of pieces to be published in the printed book, and a prize jury selects the winning short story and essay. Winners from both categories get a $200 prize. The printed anthology is available late in the year. The 2016 Scythe Prize included over 40 previously unpublished stories and essays from college writers looking for a place to share their art (maybe for the first time).  PURPOSE   Young writers have few opportunities to be published in print. As this is a dream for many, the Scythe Prize satisfies that goal. Building confidence and notoriety are also aims of the Scythe Prize. A portion of book sales are also put right back into programs and non-profit organizations that build community and advocate for good. In the past, the publisher has donated to March of Dimes, the Nebraska Humane Society, and Bailing Out Benji, a non-profit that focuses on humane education and peacefully protests outside pet stores that sell puppy mill dogs.PRIZESOne author from the story category and one author from the creative non-fiction category receive a $200 prize. WHAT KICKSTARTER FUNDS WILL BE USED FORMost of the funds will go toward creating and printing the book, but marketing is essential. Some funds will be used to promote the contest and Call for Papers in various locations on the web. Funds will be also be used to print books, ship books, distribute free copies for review, design the cover and interior of the book, market the book before, during, and after the book is published, copyright the 2017 Scythe Prize book (not the contents- those belong to the authors), and pay category winners (and do anything else I can to help promote the book and celebrate the authors included).

Editor Eric Forrest should be commended for his vision in creating the Scythe Prize and his skill at bringing the volume through production and publication into such a handsome paperback.”“An incredibly diverse group of short stories. I am impressed with such a dazzling array of different works compiled by young authors. As an avid reader, I felt compelled by each story and excited to read the next one.”“Great collection of writing from many of tomorrow's sought-after authors. My favorite story is written by a law student from the University of Michigan, Rebecca Kaplan, entitled 'The Way Home.' Find a story you'll enjoy.”“Outstanding collection of writings from young and up and coming authors. Interesting reading from all genres and a glimpse of the future of literature and creative writing. Highly recommend to anyone who just enjoys a good read and wants to get in on the ground floor of the next best- selling author.”“What a wonderful group of writers! The stories are entertaining and diverse. A great read!”BACK COVER COPY from the 2016 Scythe PrizeThe 2016 Scythe Prize book is a collection of the best collegiate short stories and essays submitted for the award’s inaugural publication. Hundreds of submissions from 25 countries on five continents were considered for the prize, and these selections are the best collected.The aim of the Scythe Prize is to give students wishing to pursue a career in creative writing an opportunity to gain one of their first chances at entering the world of publishing. And while these are their first attempts, do not underestimate the submissions:“What a great batch of fiction, with the very best of it worthy of any short story anthology I've read in recent years. I'm excited for the futures of these writers.” -- Timothy Schaffert, author of the New York Times bestseller The Swan Gondola ","The risks and challenges that come with the 2017 Scythe Prize's creation are minimal as the 2016 edition was a success and wonderful learning experience. The biggest concern last year was getting a large enough pool of stories and essays to choose from. Over 40 selections were published and hundreds of others were turned down, so I'll do what I did last year to market the book and apply that (and new) knowledge to avoid this potential pitfall. 2016 saw hundreds of submissions from over 100 colleges in 25 countries on five continents. I have a competent designer. I have a base of people who helped me along the way last year and I'll lean on others to help make the 2017 version even better. I have published many books previously, so I know the process and am becoming more efficient each time I start a new project. The $1200 goal will not cover all expenses, but I'd love to have at least that much support so I can focus on creating something special without worrying about cost. The goal is to publish the work of young writers and to celebrate them by sharing their work in a printed book -- an opportunity not often given to the youngest of artists -- and accomplishing that goal is more important than spending some of my own money to complete the project. The 2016 Scythe Prize was created for about $2000. I set a Kickstarter goal of $5000 last year and fell short. I created the book anyway. For those who supported me in lieu of the failed Kickstarter campaign, I am confident they were pleased with the results and am thankful for their support. I am confident that the $1200 goal will go a long way towards creating a product everyone will be proud of."

The project aims to share the beauty of the New York City skyline, then and now.The two photographs in the artwork were shot by myself about 15 years apart, positioned in the same spot in Brooklyn when photographed.I am here on Kickstarter to raise the funds required for printing and framing. I have been an amateur photographer for almost 25 years, doing mostly local art fairs and small galleries. I am very familiar with quality printing and framing and believe in keeping retail prices for artwork very reasonable. I don't require a huge amount of money to get this project launched, just enough for some bulk printing and framing materials. That is the reason I am only looking for a modest pledge goal as I would like to be able to share this wonderful piece of artwork with a wider audience.The piece will be offered as a fine art poster or as a matted photographic piece as shown in the photos below (NOTE: the images of the framed pieces below do not do this piece justice. It is super sharp and looks much better in person)$15 Pledge RewardFreedom Restored 18 x 24"" Fine Art Poster. Offset printed on glossy heavyweight paper making framing/displaying easier.

Thank you for taking the time to view this project!",Since I have quite a bit of experience in the printing and framing field I do not see any obstacles that would delay the project. I have already had test prints and proofs created and the quality is superb.

The project is the first of a series of 12 photographs that will be printed as 18x24"" lithographic offset posters.I am here on Kickstarter to raise a part of the funds required for printing the 12 different posters. A few of the posters have already been printed in bulk and the quality is fantastic, but I do not have the funds required to complete this first series. With the $1200 pledge goal I am hoping for this will enable me to complete the printing of the series, the first of what I hope to be a 3 series total in the future if this project is successful.New York Nature Prints are a great and affordable way to beautifully decorate your empty wall space. They are easy to frame if desired, or simply display without framing by using a double sided padded tape. If framing yourself, 18x24"" is a common size ready made frame that you can find at many retail stores.With your pledge you will get the posters for $5 each, a 66% percent savings off the expected retail price of $15 each. You will also get my never ending gratitude :)!!!UPDATE: FEB 8THWE DID IT!!!! NEW YORK NATURE PRINTS WILL MOVE FORWARD THANKS TO YOU...A hearty and grateful Thank You to ALL of you who have supported the campaign, it has truly been inspiring. We are fully funded with 11 days to go, wow! Now the stretch goal possibilities...My ultimate goal is to get the posters into retail stores/galleries/coffee shops/gift shops, etc. in the Long Island and Upstate NY area. The $1200 initial goal we have reached will cover the remainder of the printing costs but now comes all the extras. To get them into retail shops will require the proper display bins, as well as 1 or 2 framed pieces for display in each store.A stretch goal of $2000 would enable me to get started with this (along with a lot of door to door soliciting until I get them in as many shops as possible).Stretch goal reward: If we reach $2000 all backers who have chosen rewards will also receive as a bonus a matted and signed photographic print of any image of your choice. The image can be chosen from one of the 12 posters or any of the images on my website. It will be 18x24"" matted.Once again thank you for making this happen!

We will work from sun up to sun down (and beyond). I conservatively estimate creating three or four thousand art nude images. From this massive compilation I will choose the very best for publication. The whole process will be documented for the behind-the-scenes film that backers will watch. I invite you to join us on this visual journey.Creative Process The book will contain 100% new images, to be shot in February 2017. Water, sand, light, river, waterfall, forest, traditional and modern house make intriguing patterns and are especially interesting when combined with the human form. The model will pose in various combinations and locations, with a strong emphasis on composition and aesthetics. After the week of shooting, the work has just begun. I will spend several weeks to choose the photos, edit, and create the book.Signed photo card Limited edition A6 postcard format (15x21 cm)    Project promo card, autographed by the model, Thank-you message and project details on the back.    Each card is a unique image not in the photobookBonus ImagesBonus images are great photos that don't make it into the regular book for any number of reasons. Maybe they don't fit with any of the chosen themes or are a bit too racey. Also be some behind-the-scenes.Bonus images are in addition to what is included in the book. They are high-resolution (200ppi and higher), downloadable.""Making of"" VideoA 30-60 minutes long, shot on high definition 1080p video and Downloadable.The film is a behind-the-scenes look at the making of the project. Chosen from the best 30-60 minutes of footage, it will center on shooting, but also illustrate the preparation, travel, and production activities. Although  the documentary will contain footage of the nude photo shoots, the goal is to satisfy intellectual curiosity; The documentary will not be gratuitous. It will feature photographer and model thanking high-level backers (see reward details) both verbally and in credits.AcknowledgementsEvery backer has the option to be acknowledged somewhere. We can mention your full name, firstname, or you can be anonymous. It may be on a web page, the book, or a model doing a shout-out in the documentary film credits. Some rewards guarantee a specific form of thank-you in the book, album or documentary. Everyone who wants to be acknowledged will receive credit for backing the project.","With international travel, there are always challenges. However I am an experienced traveler and a thorough planner. I live in Guadeloupe and i know it. If the model gets sick at the last minute, we have insurance to change travel and accomodation reservation. I am bringing multiple cameras, backup hard drives, and planning for other contingencies.This is my first project of such importance on Kickstarter. By consulting my sites, you will be able to note my devotion, my thoroughness and the quality of my work. I will not rest until I have created a beautiful product and keep in mind the satisfaction of the backers."

Here in the present she has one of the last remaining order of witches and it is ran like a crime organization. Wolf aka Drusilla Hood (Played by Stephanie Youif/ others) has a dark past and has fought to gain her current position. This makes her a cunning and deadly addition to this story.The Red Witch returns from the dead for revenge with the help of a mysterious warlock (“Toymaker played by Michael Julius Saunders”). Her fury is boldly expressed from her appearance down to her actions. Red was not only murdered by her sister Wolf but mutilated as well. Which explains the Toymaker's opening dialogue about her body, some what.The drunken Warlock known as the “Toymaker” is cursed with the visions of Wolf’s evil deed. That's what will define the horrible predicament he finds himself in.My goal is to put together a 40 minute film that tells a story about the last days of a powerful witch coven. This project will produce a series of original comic book characters, prints or photos. Our crew is a group of super talented and professional actors. Raised funds will be spent on compensation for my crew- lighting, makeup, camera equipment and a ton of additional costs that will undoubtedly spring up throughout the making of this film. 100% of your investment will go to what you see on screen.

Thank You!","I have been a director for over eight years now and I already know some of the struggles that lie in wait during this production. Our greatest challenge is time and availability. We all have jobs, school and other commitments. Which is why we look to Kickstarter for help. So that hopefully we can finish this really awesome journey with a little more security and perhaps attract some wonderful new fans! Thank you so much for your time.",https://www.kickstarter.com/projects/366150059/bam-issue-6?ref=discovery_category_newest,366150059/bam-issue-6,"My name is Terrell and I am an multimedia artist based in Detroit MI. About four years ago I created what I thought would be a fun way to stay connected to the world of comics. Sure we all love our Marvel and DC, but if you're a hard core fan, then you already know that there is so much more to this culture of ours today. In fact our once little clubhouse has become enormous! Now a days there's just an endless amount of content from Comics to toys, movies and anime! An awesome abundance of content that has in fact created many talented Artist in the industry today. ""That"", dear friends is the very reason why ""BAM"" exists. Breathe again magazine has been a small local publication that showcases  comic book creators,  artist and talented cosplayers from all over.BAM is presented in three specific formats consisting of print, digital downloads and video.   The printed version of the magazine is obviously the physical copy. However Bam can also be purchased and downloaded as a digital pdf file. With these two options we're able to give readers a look at amazing cosplay photography, interviews and previews of comics being produce by mainstream and Independent creators.Our videos are primarily news coverage, weekly podcast that report all comic book related news from mainstream to indie comics.With your help we are looking to expand this labor of love. Issue 6 is currently in development and this time around we want to reach more people! As well as create more networking opportunities that will take us to the next level.So to do that we need merchandise and the continued help of our spokes models/ cosplayers. The money raised here will help us acquire 500 physical copies to sell and promote over the next several months.  As well as allow us to pay the awesome cosplayers and models who will go on this journey with us. The funds will also go toward setting up accounts with online distributors  to give readers access to a downloadable, digital version of the magazine.Breathe Again Magazine is preparing more then 10 appearance’s this year at various comic conventions, stores and events!  By increasing our fan base and gaining more exposure this allows BAM to continue to cover comic book related news as well as produce our own content in the near future.Aside from the sheer joy of knowing you've helped us bring BAM to the people, we've lined up a number of lovely Perks:The benefits of funding this project are huge! While BAM has been a local and independent publication thus far it has also been wildly successful. Issue 5 sold out of the first run the very first day at the Motor City Comic Con. I want to top that! Obviously our main allies lay within the cosplay community and for good reason, we consider cosplay to be a legitimate art form. While BAM is one of many publications casting a spotlight on cosplayers, we take pride in having a close relationship with all creators in the convention going atmosphere. ","The risks are nearly nonexistent. The hardest part is creating the content, and that is already done. I've successfully self-published BAM before and I've put together a substantial amount of images, while building great content for the book. Not to mention I some how found time to create a few of the costumes for my models along the way.However I'm reaching out because the challenge is in fact the scale of this project. The money I'm asking for finances the production of the book and will aid with promotional work to set the course for future BAM issues!"
https://www.kickstarter.com/projects/101187357/retropolis-rocket-ship-limited-edition-archival-pr?ref=discovery_category_newest,101187357/retropolis-rocket-ship-limited-edition-archival-pr,"There are a couple of things that I almost never do. The first one's easy: I hardly ever show work in progress. That's so built in to my brain that it was true even when I was a much smaller artist who spent his days trying to escape from a crib. Honest: there's a story.The second thing is that I always want the largest possible number of people to be able to have a reproduction of one of my Retropolis pictures. I don't do limited editions because in the case of digital prints limiting an edition is a form of artificial scarcity. They're not, like traditional prints, based on physical plates that degrade over time. A limited digital edition is something else: it amounts to a promise that those who get the print now will be the only people who will ever be able to get one.This Kickstarter project breaks these two habits of mine. Onthe one hand the print we're funding here is a limited edition print. Only you,who back the project, will ever have a large format print of thepicture. I might put the picture in a book, or do something else with it that Ican't even imagine right now, but I'll never make it available as an archivalprint or a poster. Only the Kickstarter backers will ever get one, and the archival 24by 18"" prints will each be signed and numbered. On the other hand, not only will I show the work inprogress, but I'm going to turn that into a production in itself. I'll do oneor more screen grabs of the work each day, and I'll take notes about what theheck I thought I was doing at that point, and you'll be able to see whether Iwas deranged. I'll assemble the whole thing intoan animated presentation that shows how the picture progressed from day to day,all the way from its initial state - you'll see that in a moment - to the end,when hopefully it'll be wonderful. Only my Kickstarter backers will get a copy of that animatedpresentation - from me, anyhow. I won't raise a fuss if you want to give a copy to your Aunt Edith. This presentation will be a kind of documentary, on a small scale, and beyond that I have no idea (yet)just what it will be like; my guess is that whatever form it takes, it willtake as long to make the presentation as it did to make the picture. Why should you want that? Well, it's possible that since youknow I hate to show unfinished work you'll enjoy a chance to see mesquirm. I don't judge. But it's also possible that you've enjoyed my finishedwork at Retropolis, at Thrilling Tales of the Downright Unusual,and lately in my Pulp-O-Mizer - the world's most advanced custom pulp magazine cover maker- and you just want to see how that work gets done.I've done a rough layout for the picture and I have an ideaabout where it's going. It'll show us the inside of a rocket ship that's crewedentirely by women, unless I change my mind, and the inner hull of the rocketwill be covered with gadgets and gizmos and machinery a lot like we see inthose wonderful old comics illustrations by Wally Wood and Al Williamson. Ieven sort of know what the picture's title will be but that - like everything,so far - is subject to change. We'll all find out together. As we begin, the rocket ship is practically an emptyshell.... and here, a more recent work in progress version:Have a look at the project updates to see how the picture's evolved from its beginning to the possibly final version that you see above.We're doing this on Kickstarter and that means you'll allget to keep some part of what I make. Everyone who contributes at least tendollars will get a digital copy of the ""Making of"" video and adesktop wallpaper image of the finished picture. Everyone who contributes atleast sixty dollars (or for shipments outside the USA, $75) will get a 24 by 18 inch archival print of the picture, andlike I said, each print will be signed and numbered and no other large formatprints of the picture will ever be made.In addition to the prints themselves, you can get some other works from Thrilling Tales of the Downright Unusual: the full color, paperback editions of Trapped in the Tower of the Brain Thieves and The Lair of the Clockwork Book, and a few overruns from the hardcover edition of The Lair of the Clockwork Book. There are also postcard prints for Kickstarterbackers who contribute at a lower level.And then there's this: as we go along and funding reaches acertain level we will unlock some bonus rewards. At those pledgelevels, in addition to a signed, numbered print, I'll make - for you, thebacker - a custom title graphic for the Pulp-O-Mizer. While most people have tochoose from the same menu of titles I've made for everyone to share, you willbe able to unlock your very own personalized magazine title for use in thePulp-O-Mizer. That might be the name of your blog or podcast (or Kickstarter project); it might be somecatchphrase that has meaning only for you or for someone you know. Withinlimits, it can be anything at all, and you can use it to your heart's contentto make your own Pulp-O-Mized images or merchandise... just like any of thePulp-O-Mizer layers used by the common run of mortals. Limits? Did I say limits? I won't create a title for you that violates any trademarksor copyrights that are known to me, and I won't create a title that expressesracial, political, social, or religious intolerance. I'll be the sole judge ofwhether your chosen title is outside the realm of good taste - but I'll workwith you to come up with an alternative if that's necessary. Now when we unlock a Pulp-O-Mizer title reward therewill be a limited number of them available. When those rewards are all takenyou'll have to wait until we unlock the next level: and the next level willalways be more expensive than the last. So if you want your own customPulp-O-Mizer title I advise you to pile on early. If none are available rightnow, you should encourage as many people as possible to contribute to thisproject so that we can unlock the next Pulp-O-Mizer level. See how thatworks?The Pulp-O-Mizer goals start unlocking when this campaign reaches $2000, and then they continue at $1000 intervals from then on. The 'Great Graph of Goals' up above will show you how close we are to unlocking a Pulp-O-Mizer reward level. (I have to update that image manually, so it may lag behind the campaign totals.)If you go completely nuts and we exceed the campaign's goal, then the Pulp-O-Mizer levels from that point on will include some other extras. They'll start with things like ... well, I don't know, actually. Figuring that out would be a great problem to have, though, wouldn't it?First off, of course, I need to finish the picture. I'd usually figure that would take me a week or two, but this time I may need to build and texture several new models and that - especially when it involves character work - can slow me down. So I've allowed much more time for the Kickstarter project, especially because I'd also like to have the video completed by the time the project has ended.The video is still a little shapeless in my mind. It's not all that different from a project video like the one you see above except that I'll need to collect and edit a whole lot of material, and I'll need to record the voiceover, which on average takes me about 90,000 takes.Still, by the time this project ends I ought to be able to complete those tasks - or come very close to completing them, even if things get complicated.The prints will be printed on a very nice, heavy weight matte paper that I've used just once before. Because the paper has a matte finish it'll tend to make the image look a little darker, with a little less contrast, and so I expect to have to go through a couple of rounds of proofing . The shipping time for each round of proofs is an issue but this can all happen during the same time I'm working on the video.So in the best case everything could be about ready to go by the time the project ends. I don't like counting on best cases. So I've pushed out those rewards by about a month, just in case.That's the simple part. The custom Pulp-O-Mizer rewards amount to several separate tasks (making the images in several resolutions, installing them in a couple of places, adding some cryptic Javascript incantations and setting up the secure logins for those backers). If a whole lot of people choose the custom Pulp-O-Mizer rewards, that could add up to some time.I plan to complete all the other rewards before I do the Pulp-O-Mizer titles: that way everybody gets all or most of what they signed on for as quickly as possible. For this reason I'm pushing the Pulp-O-Mizer rewards out a little farther along the timeline - after the prints and video are done.Then why are all the rewards scheduled for June? Because that's as much resolution as Kickstarter gives me. I expect to deliver the video and ship the prints and books by the middle of June; I expect to deliver the last of the Pulp-O-Mizer titles by the end of June. I'll do the Pulp-O-Mizer titles in order, so the earliest backers will get theirs first, and if I should run late the last of them might not be ready until July. ","1. As in any Kickstarter project you need to wonder whether I can do what I'm promising. For the image and its print, I can refer you to my Retropolis web site (link above) - it's got many posters and archival prints and I think it'll convince you that I've been around this block before. The video's something new, but as I mentioned above it's not very different from a Kickstarter project video. Just more work.2. Also, apart from the work itself, you'd be right to wonder whether I can and will fulfill the rewards you sign on for. If you click on my profile in the sidebar you'll see that I've been around this block, too, and no one's had a problem getting their rewards from me. That includes one backer who waited almost two years to send me his mailing address: I shipped his book and print the next day.3. Will I do this on time? I've allowed myself an unusual amount of time to complete the picture and the video and I've pushed out the delivery dates for the rewards beyond that time. That amounts to padding the schedule twice.But if I'm not happy with the video I will take additional time on it. I don't think that either of us would want you to get something crappy and fast when you might get something good, but a little later. I don't think I'll be late: but who does? All I can say is that I'll do my level best to get all your rewards to you *ahead* of their delivery dates. But I won't do a lousy job in order to make that happen.The only rewards that concern me are the custom Pulp-O-Mizer titles, if there are a large number of them to do. I've explained why, and what I'll do about that, up above.",https://www.kickstarter.com/projects/101187357/patently-absurd?ref=discovery_category_newest,101187357/patently-absurd," So at $1400 we've reached the project's first stretch goal: that means that everyone, whether their Reward says so or not, will get an eBook copy of The Lair of the Clockwork Book (mobi or epub), and every backer who's getting a printed book will also get couple of custom bookmarks. If we reach $1900 I'll be able to schedule a Kirkus review for Patently Absurd. That's probably due to the people who pledged at the higher levels, so here's what they get: a 3 1/2"" by 5 1/2"" memo notebook. They'll have the Patently Absurd cover art on the front, with 48 acid-free recycled pages. They're really nice: I use one like this myself.And it looks like we've used up the ""Collector"" level rewards, which qualified for that add-on. So I'm adding a new (still limited) set of those - including signed hardcovers of Slaves of the Switchboard of Doom - so anybody new who wants one of the memo notebooks can still pile on. These six illustrated stories (like my novel, Slaves of the Switchboard of Doom) take place in the city of Retropolis. That’s where the future went when we got something else.       So nearly everyone in Retropolis has their own rocket ship, and there are robots pretty much everywhere, and in most ways it’s a pretty nice place to live.	A lot of that's due to the innovations of the mad scientists in the Experimental Research District.    The District is the only neighborhood in Retropolis where scientists are allowed to invent, and to experiment, and to find out what happens when you cross a Great White Shark with a lawnmower, and then add a rocket pack. If you're not a scientist you'd rather not visit the District, believe me. But if you are a scientist, in this world where all Science is Mad, you wouldn't want to live anyplace else. Which would be great, since by law... you couldn't. But there are risks in this social arrangement. If no one keeps an eye on them, one of these mad inventors may start to wonder what happens if you rotate the Earth by 90 degrees. Which would be bad, of course. So somebody has to keep an eye on the scientists, in a friendly, interested way, to see if anybody's started an experiment that has to be stopped. That's the secret mission of the Retropolis Registry of Patents. Five of these stories ran as serials at Thrilling Tales of the Downright Unusual. (You might know that best as the home of the Pulp-O-Mizer.) The final Registry of Patents story is The Enigma of the Unseen Doctor. That one wraps up the series and it’s quite a bit longer than the others. It will appear in Patently Absurd for the first time. As a 6x9"" trade paperback the book runs to about 260 pages, and there are forty (oops, now forty-three) illustrations. Yeah. That's a lot of illustrations. I noticed. Although there's nothing to stop you from simply releasing a book into the wild, there's no guarantee that anyone will notice it's there. So to give this book its best chance I want to handle the launch with a little more care. Patently Absurd will be released only after several months of work. The most visible part of that work is that I want to send advance copies out to reviewers, bloggers, and the book buyers for small (and large) bookstores. That includes trade publications like Booklist, The Library Journal, and Locus.There's a long lead time for these people, which is the reason I'm starting this now even though the book won't be published until March. But the advance copies - like everything else - cost money. So I'm inviting you in. If you choose to back this project and get an advance copy of your own, another advance copy will go out to reviewers and bookstore buyers (within reason: at some point, you're just giving away books). Part of these proceeds will also cover pre-production expenses, like Ingram's fees and a set of ISBN numbers. I've set a pretty modest goal for this project, but there are some important stretch goals (see below). I hope we can reach those levels too. If we raise more than that, I'll lean back and think about what I'd like to work on next. Which would be nice. You'll get your advance copy of the book about two months before it's released. That's when the reviewers and buyers get theirs, so it seems fair that you'll get yours at the same time. Like the Registry of Patents, this project also has a secret mission: to enlist you in the promotion for the book. Because I hope that once you have one, you'll talk about it; you'll mention it on Facebook, or Twitter, or Goodreads; you'll review it on Amazon, when they let you. That kind of grassroots promotion is the best kind there is. Your advance copy of the book can be in print format or digital (ePub or mobi); you may even get both, depending on your pledge level. I'll sign the printed books. In addition I'm offering ePub and mobi versions of TheLair of the Clockwork Book, with its 128 illustrations. If those aren't enough for you, you can have a signed hardcover copy of Slaves of the Switchboard of Doom, my novel of Retropolis; and if you still want more I'll send you a signed, 20 by 30 inch poster of the dust jacket art for Switchboard. In addition to these rewards, backers will get to hear about the book launch as it progresses from December through March. I'll probably tell the backers some things I might not talk about in public. Or I might not. I'm furtive. But here's something else. Remember that some of these advance copies are going to go out to the book buyers at bookstores? Well, if you back this project you can recommend your own local book shop. It will help if you can name the book buyer there - we want to make sure the book goes to the right place. And I'm not promising that every suggested bookstore will get one. But there's a pretty good chance that yours will. Backers can now add their bookstore recommendations in comments on the October 15, backers-only update. So far, we've financed some great promotion for Patently Absurd. But beyond those advance copies there are a couple of other things that would really help the book. Publishers Weekly and Kirkus charge fees to review independently published books like mine. Publishers Weekly even stuffs indie books into a supplement, rather than mixing them in with their other reviews. Although this is kind of annoying, I can see their point: there are a lot of indie books. So our stretch goals target fees for these two publications. We've reached the first stretch goal at $1400 so we can count on a review in Publishers Weekly. Next up is Kirkus Reviews.To get that we'll need to reach $1900. Details are now at the top!","The book is done; its print layout is done. I'll be formatting the eBook editions before the end of the year, and I've done that before. The advance print copies will use a printer I've used in the past, and I can't foresee any large problems there. So there's very little risk in your receiving your rewards.The only unfamiliar territory for me is that I'll be using Ingram for part of the print production (for the final, published books). They have some finicky preferences and foibles that I'll need to adapt to. But, like I said, that doesn't affect the advance copies. So it's a little special worry that's just for me.You can look back over my earlier projects (for Thrilling Tales of the Downright Unusual and The Lair of the Clockwork Book) and you'll find that I fulfilled all those rewards on time. Well. Except for one guy who never gave me his address, and I still have his package ready to ship if I ever hear from him again."

J’ai rassemblé tout le positif de mon parcours pour créer NOVA : ma marque de bijoux, mais aussi un peu la votre.Les charms NOVA sont conçus et dessinés chez moi à Bruxelles (Belgique) puis fabriqués dans un atelier spécialisé de New York (Etats-Unis). Ils sont enfin montés sur support et empaquetés à la main avec amour par leur créatrice <3.Ils nous marquent, ils nous transforment et nous les emportons avec amour. Ce sont des traces de nos aventures et de nos origines : les souvenirs. Certains les mettent sur des étagères, d’autres les affichent sur leur frigo, pour moi ce sont des inspirations que je transforme en bijoux.Voici les 5 « souvenirs » que j’ai ramenés pour vous d’Egypte, d’Europe et d’Asie. Combinez ces charms à votre guise en collier, bracelet ou boucles d’oreilles pour constituer votre parure unique !Spécialement pour ce crowdfunding, pour vous remercier de votre aide, les charms vous sont proposés de 14 à 20€ pièce : plus vous en achetez, plus le prix baisse.

The one small thing...that everything is comprised of. An infinity of atoms!It took years to design, with numerous changes along the way. Painstaking effort was brought to give the flourishing visuals everything they need. The backs look great in a spread and can easily be used as a vanished/blank deck routine.They will have an air-cushion linen finish, which is ideal for spreads and fans. The pasteboard is a high-grade German stock, that is extremely durable. The pips were re-designed from the ground up. Keeping with tradition, but manipulating them with the infinity symbol throughout. The spade slightly resembles the classic ""swords' suit, of old time decks.The faces have a classic style, but have the border removed. No crazy placement! The court cards are all customized as well, with some nice story elements added for you to run wild with. There are some hidden revelations as well, always something new to find when you look at them.

While I am there I will be working recording music I have written over the past 5 years using the Cascade Head Experimental Forest and Salmon River Estuary as my recording studio. I am able to do this by using Solar Power for energy. It is silent, clean power. Ideal for recording music. At the moment I can produce a modest 50 Watts of power per hour. I would like to improve that capability using plans from a Portland non-profit, Soltrekker, for their portable solar generator. This will allow me to progress with my recordings in a timely manner and produce enough electricity to power my music equipment with little or no time spent waiting for a battery to charge.A portion of my residency will be dedicated to community participation in nearby Lincoln City and Neskowin. During that time I will also use this equipment to teach local youth about renewable energy, music and the art of recording in partnership with Soltrekker and Old Library Studio.",,https://www.kickstarter.com/projects/548631809/collaborate-with-the-sunrise-review-on-a-solar-pow?ref=discovery_category_newest,548631809/collaborate-with-the-sunrise-review-on-a-solar-pow,"I am Graham Smith-White and this funding campaign is for my music project,The Sunrise Review.I am raising funds to help cover expenses for recording my next E.P.The Sunrise Review is a collaborative recording project focused on using natural spaces as inspiration for music. Solar powered recording equipment allows these spaces to function as a studio as well, adding a unique production style and opportunities for collaboration.I began writing music to the backdrop of the Pacific Ocean in 2005 while I was living on the Australian coast. In 2010, I recorded the first E.P. of these tunes,River East, RIver West, during an artist residency at the Sitka Center for Art and Ecology on the Oregon coast. These recordings combine Eastern and Western musical styles in a collaboration with an Appalachian string band, the Brown Chicken Brown Cow String Band, and Guitarist Geoff Metts. Printmaker Catherine Chauvin contributed artwork for the album and Ceramicist Mindy Chaffin contributed an Udu Clay drum to the instruments on the recordings.In addition to the 3 finished songs from those sessions, I started on a handful of other tracks in the forest on Cascade Head during my residency. In February of 2012 I will be going to Hawaii to work more on these tracks and finish a second E.P.,Palms and Pines.This is an excellent opportunityto continue working on the music I have written which was inspired by the Pacific Ocean.

I've started this campaign to help raise funds to go towards getting a small shop. After getting out of the United States Navy a few months ago I moved to Scottsdale, Arizona for work. Before I joined the Navy I enjoyed spending my free time making pens and other small items. Since I've been out I have purchased new equipment and have been making these beautiful pens out of the bed of my truck. With your help I will be one step closer to owning a new shop! This will allow me to add additional equipment and get into making furniture.Before we go any further let's go over some major events that have occurred in history:It's hard to imagine wood thats been around longer than the pyramids but thats exactly what this wood is. Bog Oak is a type of wood that is buried for thousands of years in the peat bogs and preserved from decay. Bog Oak represents the early forms of fossilization and if left untouched for millions of years it will eventually become coal. It is a rare wood and has been compared to some of the most expensive hardwoods available.",I've been making pens for several years now as well as other woodworking projects so I see no challenges as far as producing the pens. I have reliable suppliers for both my kits and the Bog Oak. I expect to have every pen produced and shipped by the end of March. The only reason this may take a little longer is if the project really takes off. If this is the case then delivery may run into early April.

The truth is a simple story that starts here....I started taking photographs when I was around 11 years old, I had no idea what I was doing or what I was pressing to make things brighter and darker but I loved it. I loved being able to capture a moment and make it mine.I was always different as a kid, I was like a square peg in a round hole; I was not very good at expressing my thoughts or opinions that I wanted to say. I am still like this, but with my camera I have been able to express many messages that Ibelievethat should be told.

We'd like to cut our teeth on Jim Heavily's manuscript, The Bringer of Culture. We believe this work supports our mission of bringing the best writing of the Américas to light. Hinchas de Poesía is a formidable online venue for writing from the Américas, but we don't sell advertisements so all operating costs and brain capital are shouldered by the editors of Hinchas dePoesía. The work that we publish in our magazine comes from a place of unmitigated passion and curiosity, regardless of language or pedigree.Every person that contributes $10.00 to our kickstarter project gets a signed copy of a poem from The Bringer of Culture. Every person that contributes $25.00 receives a copy of the book, once it is published. Either way, your contribution assists our efforts to publish Jim Heavily's first book of poems and entice other poets to publish their manuscripts with Hinchas Press. ","Distribution is the hardest nut to crack in the publishing racket. In other words, getting our book to market in a way that is cost efficient will always be what preoccupies us most. Even if we get 80 people to donate $25 ($2,000.00) we will have to spend at least four U.S. stamps on an envelope and mail it to our donors. If four stamps costs $1.80 then multiply that by 80 (# of donors that donated $25) to get $144.00, or the amount it would cost to mail 80 donors that donate at least $25 to our project.Even the distribution of the $10 prize would present a burden on our fledgling press that we would have to make out of pocket. Assuredly, there will be more $10 donations than $25 donations so that means that we would have to have a list of all the people getting a signed poem by Jim Heavily so we can send it to them. This will add postal costs to our endeavor, which should be remedied by one U.S. Post Office stamp ($.45) for each parcel. Still, let's say we only get 25 donors to give $25 that would amount to $625 and mean that $1,375 will come from $10 donors, 137.5 of them. So, in all probability, we are going to spend at least $61.88 just in postage to get out all the signed poems that are due to donors.",https://www.kickstarter.com/projects/ghazalsforfoley/ghazals-for-foley?ref=discovery_category_newest,ghazalsforfoley/ghazals-for-foley,"Ghazals for Foley is acollection of ghazals and non-fiction honoring the memory of American CombatJournalist, James Foley. Mr. Foley gravitatedtowards all types of people, from all types of backgrounds. But, it’s prettyobvious Jim felt personally responsible for informing the world about theatrocities being committed by the Assad regime against its own civilians. In 2012, Foley was kidnapped justinside of Syria; in Augustof 2014, Foley was murdered by ISIS forces onvideo after being held for almost two years. Foley was always a spiritualperson and a practicing Catholic, so his conversion to Islam while in captivityis a point of serious contemporary speculation. Ghazals for Foley seeksto bridge two seemingly disparate world views by using an ancient Arabic formto address the memory and loss of an American Combat Journalist, and honor hishumanistic tendencies.","Obviously, there are several risks and challenges. An obvious risk and challenge is that I will not get enough people to submit ghazals to generate enough to actually publish a book and not a chapbook. I've been cooking this idea for a bit and last month set out a preliminary email and received at least five ghazals already. I plan on sending out another call for submission from within our circle of writer-friends, but then I also plan to put out a general solicitation call on our FB page (Hinchas de Poesia), my personal FB page (Yago S.

https://www.kickstarter.com/projects/sirithil/the-art-of-pose-dare-to-translate-it?ref=discovery_category_newest,sirithil/the-art-of-pose-dare-to-translate-it,"With digital development, more and more art is being made . And yet we are also surrounded by the ever-present images created by mainstream marketing. There are, as a logical consequence, more and more photo models to populate these spaces. Who are they? Which networks do they use? What does exactly posing for a picture mean? How, and why, would they “become a model”? Social over watchon models acts like a magnifying glass. What insight does it have to offer about our relationship to our bodies and its image? And, once and for all, is modelling a proof of both narcissism and sheepish compliance to marketing standards?This book, at the crossroads between a how-to guide, a sociological study and a memoir tells the underlying story of a process : how we go from self-rejection towards self-transcendence, through self-appreciation and self-acceptance; how we need to separate the body itself from the image of the body in order to be in sync with the former without letting the latter overwhelm us; how we first start by instinctively rejecting consumer society standards in order to regain power over the body, through catharsis and a conscious use of our image in order to find our own voice; how we turn external validation into self-sustained legitimacy, looking for our own vulnerability and making it our best asset. So this is basically the synopsis of my first (fingers crossed) book, The Art of Pose. First, ""I"" is a twenty-six-years-old multiple-occupations french young woman. I work as an actress, writer, photographer and, more specifically connected to our subject here, as a model. I started modelling (mostly for photographers) during my philosophy studies. I wasn't an agency top model going to catwalks or doing big budgets commercials ; my partners in crime were, mostly, arty independant photographers. Over the years I worked for very different projects though, some connected with fashion, some more  personal projects or books or exhibitions or even photography classes.I learned a lot and I thought a lot about things I experienced during this while. I noticed that other people, the ones who didn't pose, were acting funny with me. It was like, because I was a model, I wasn't a good person anymore. It took me years to realize that this was a symptom of what our society did to us, not only the models, but all the people.One reflexion led to another and I remembered every time I had been street harassed, and connected them to the times when fake photographers were just willing to see girls naked. I remembered every morning when I would wake up and go to the subway and see the ads on the walls and these gorgeous thin and all-alike-looking women and say to myself : you little fat girl, and I realized anyone could hear that and maybe that was why they didn’t think I should be modelling - they didn’t think they should either. I slowly understood that, above all else, being represented didn’t feel right for everyone; and most of the people, as they weren’t represented, felt like if they got represented, they might be getting away with something.And then I understood that any representation of any body was politic, that perfect bodies all over were a way to tell us, the people with regular bodies: you shouldn’t be here. You don’t belong here. The public space is not yours. If you want the public space, you’ll have to earn it. By being as we say you should be. And in order to do that, you will buy our stuff. Buy. Our. Stuff.I also remembered how hard I’d seen people smash each other's heads for not being appropriate enough, covered enough, uncovered enough, and how silly it seemed - and how it was the very same thing as all the times I’d been called a whore, or a slut, or a wicked nymphomaniac, for modelling naked or half-naked. And it didn’t feel right at all. I ended up seeing The Pose, that activity I had first start in order to feel more comfortable with myself, as a lens to my world’s disorders. Everything was so  magnified that I couldn’t miss it anymore. I couldn’t unsee it. I wanted to talk about what I was doing to get people to understand what it was but I systematically ended up talking about consumption society, feminism, rape culture. About everyone’s lifes.At the very same time, I would get a lot of emails from people who wanted to model themselves. They would ask me questions and I would answer as well as I could, but at some point I started looking up resources about being an alternative model. There were so many alternative models, and so many more every year - there must be something. But I couldn’t find anything at the time - anything that I could send and say “this is proper material, check out this”, at least.So I just decided to make my own material about being a model. I wrote the book I would have liked to get when I first started, and I used every single advice I gave to question our relationship with body and image. And everything was a reason to think. And so, here I am, my book about alternative models in hands, with my three purposes : help young models through their beginnings ; explain to everyone (photographers, but also any audience) what it was to be a model and what was our work life ; and use all that to see society matters on a different perspective.This story led to the conception of The Art of Pose - Dare to Love Yourself (and then make something out of it). Unfortunately, I’m french, so I wrote it in French. In order to share it with a larger readership, I need to have it translated. This is where I need you help. Modelling and writing are real jobs to me, and translating is a completely different one, wich I can’t do properly on my own. That’s why I asked Agnieszka to do it for us, and that’s why we need your help here.I, as a model and the person who wrote the book, am obviously biased on why you should care about reading this. I definitely am. But I just want to say I started this project with a combination of frustration (based mostly on not being understood in my activity), anger (about what society does to all of us every single day), and hope (of making a change, as tiny as it would be ). Hope obviously won. I may be talking about models here, because that’s my area, but I couldn’t help but talking about humans. And as desperate to share what has been a passion and a living for me these last 8 years, I do think talking about it can lead to more wide-shared thoughts. And also, you might be interested in knowing how not every model is some full-of-self-confidence doll, and how most of them have actually trouble with their images. Maybe it will bring some perspective. Maybe it will bring some understanding between  each other. Maybe you’ll find something completely different, something I didn’t plan you to - and if you do, I want you to tell me what. So. Why did I decide to work on this project ? Obviously like anyone else I do need money for my basic human needs like  ̶s̶t̶r̶a̶w̶b̶e̶r̶r̶y̶ ̶m̶o̶j̶i̶t̶o̶s̶,̶ ̶r̶o̶u̶g̶e̶-̶n̶o̶i̶r̶ ̶n̶a̶i̶l̶ ̶p̶o̶l̶i̶s̶h̶ ̶a̶n̶d̶ ̶m̶i̶n̶t̶ ̶c̶o̶n̶d̶i̶t̶i̶o̶n̶ ̶L̶P̶’̶s̶ o̶f̶ ̶n̶e̶o̶f̶o̶l̶k̶ ̶b̶a̶n̶d̶s̶ ̶y̶o̶u̶’̶v̶e̶ ̶p̶r̶o̶b̶a̶b̶l̶y̶ ̶n̶e̶v̶e̶r̶ ̶h̶e̶a̶r̶d̶ ̶o̶f̶  rent and groceries. However when I started to read the book while looking at the gorgeous, eerie pictures illustrating it, I realized that it actually was written for me. Well not for me exactly, but the more I was reading it, the more it spoke to me.I’m neither a model nor a photographer. I do happen to have a body, though. And it has been judged and commented upon by people offering unsolicited advice more times that I can remember. I’ve been called too skinny and too fat, a whore and a prude, my clothes put under a microscope. So no, I do not use my body at a professional level.  But as a woman using such extraordinary territories like streets, clubs, bars or public transportation (and sometimes, even,  without the monitoring of a man), I see how there are so many people thinking  that our public image gives them some kind of rights upon us. And how our self-confidence can even start to depend on that external validation (or lack thereof). So yes, of course, this IS a book about professional modelling and photography, but to me, above all, it tells the story of every person who has ever been judged and condemned because of the image they project. If you have at some point in your life been considered inappropriate because of your body or your clothes, if it has undermined your self-confidence, this book is for you too. This is why I really wanted to be part of this project. If I can both have  ̶m̶o̶r̶e̶ ̶m̶o̶j̶i̶t̶o̶s̶  less frequent eviction notices AND spread some self-love and awareness, how could I say no to this ?Here is the summary of the book so far :1 Modelling : for whom, for what purpose ?

But if we rise more money than we need for the translation, that means we can think bigger. And that isHere are the pictures (all taken by myself) you can have printed (see the reward section)","This project was my first attempt to write a book, which was my oldest dream ever. Since I was a little girl I dreamed to get my words out into the world - though I wasn't expecting them to be talking about nude models and consumption society at the time - and it happened. And HOLY SHIT it was a huge feeling. This book was written from my French alternative model perspective, of course, and some of its parts may not be very useful for you people who live outside of France; I realize that. These issues can mostly happen in Chapter Five. That is why, while Agnieszka will be working on the translation of the beginning of the book, I'll be doing research and recasting that chapter to make it useful and interesting to everyone. Yay ! Rewriting !",https://www.kickstarter.com/projects/sirithil/sans-vouloir-vous-deranger-saison-2?ref=discovery_category_newest,sirithil/sans-vouloir-vous-deranger-saison-2,"Un grand merci, MERCI à toustes pour votre soutien lors de cette campagne ! Grâce à vous, nous allons pouvoir tourner la saison 2 de SVVD... Et autoriser la scénariste à réfléchir à une saison 3 !Si vous avez raté le coche de ce crowdfunding, et en attendant la sortie de la saison 2, en octobre 2018, vous avez toujours la possibilité de soutenir celle-ci sur Tipeee, de façon occasionnelle ou régulière, et d'avoir accès à ses prochaines productions !Sans Vouloir vous Déranger est une websérie humoristique centrée autour du personnage d'Estelle. Estelleest anxieuse. Estelle a peur de déranger. Estelle s'excuse beaucoup. Puis un jour, Estelle est bien obligée de se prendre par la main.Attention, si tu n'as pas vu la saison 1, la suite risque de te spoiler. Si comme moi, tu es spoil-proof, continue à lire, mais si tu fais partie de cette autre moitié de l'humanité qui coupe tous les réseaux sociaux quand une série redémarre, je te conseille de faire un crochet par YouTube :La saison 1, qui comprenait 6 épisodes, a démarré en 2016 pour sortir début 2018, et est un patchwork d'épisodes racontant le personnage d'Estelle, une étudiante en lettres haute en couleurs, au travers des situations qu'elle est amenée à vivre durant son histoire d'amour avec Luke, et l'évolution de celle-ci jusqu'au moment où les deux s'aperçoivent qu'ils ne sont ni l'un ni l'autre faits pour vivre en couple monogame classique et que, par égard l'un pour l'autre, ils s'y sont forcés, imaginant chacun que cela blesserait l'autre de soulever des alternatives. Outre l'importance de la communication, qui manque clairement dans leur relation, on y effleure la peur de l'imposteur d'Estelle : elle pourrait se sentir polyamoureuse, mais qu'est-ce que cela dirait d'elle qu'elle se soit raconté des histoires sur elle-même tout ce temps ? On y rencontre aussi Solène, la meilleure amie d'Estelle qui l'aide à prendre soin d'elle en se mordant les lèvres pour ne pas carrément lui dire quoi faire, et Jérôme, qui le premier va démarrer l'ébranlement des certitudes d'Estelle sur elle-même et les couples ; ces personnages sont deux récurrents de la saison 2. J'ai fait le choix dans un premier temps d'un entourage très bienveillant pour Estelle qui me permettait de mettre ses failles en évidence sans qu'on aie à se demander dans quelle mesure c'était la faute des autres. Sans Vouloir vous Déranger, saison 1, a été réalisée pour moitié par Franck Victor (Des Gens Bien Prod) et pour moitié par Cédriane Fossat, qui a repris le projet au moment où celui-ci est devenu plus feuilletonant... et ambitieux.La personne qui vous écrit là, c'est Florence Rivières. C'est moi. J'ai scénarisé ou coscénarisé la majeure partie de la saison 1, j'incarne Estelle et dans certains génériques je me cache sous le nom de The Rivers and Fox Prod. La raison pour laquelle j'ai autant de casquettes dans ce projet, c'est qu'Estelle... C'est un peu moi. Enfin disons qu'il y a beaucoup de moi dans tous les personnages de cette série mais que sur elle, ça se voit très fort.La saison 2 comprendra douze épisodes, soit le double de la saison 1. Ça fait partie des leçons que j'ai tirées de la saison 1 : c'est bien de savoir où on va dès le départ pour définir les étapes par lesquelles on veut y aller. Toute cette série est à propos de changement, de lutte contre la Résistance, cette force qui s'élève en nous pour nous tenir éloignés de nos objectifs. Et pour le coup, notre objectif c'est de parler de polyamour, montrer la réalité de ce que ça peut être tout en laissant la place à des voix dissonantes (Lila, Maud), et je n'ai pas vu comment le faire de façon non caricaturale en moins de douze épisodes.  Elle a deux axes principaux :• L'évolution d'Estelle dans son rapport à ses partenaires et à l'amour, au travers de l'exploration pratique de ce que peut être le polyamour• L'évolution d'Estelle dans son rapport à elle-même et à ses priorités, et notamment son rêve de devenir scénariste.Actuellement, les douze épisodes de la série sont écrits et finalisés. Je pense que toute l'équipe est comme moi et a hâte de tourner la suite, pour enfin avoir des réponses concrètes à ces questions : Estelle va-t-elle réussir à sortir de ses représentations limitantes et accepter que oui, elle est polyamoureuse, et que non, ce n'est pas mal ? Jérôme va-t-il conserver son don de double vision et son calme olympien devant la boule de nerfs qu'elle est ? Qui est Nico, et va-t-il se marier avec Solène alors qu'ils sont tous les deux contre le mariage ? Pourquoi Estelle s'excuse-t-elle tout le temps ? Va-t-elle réussir à réaliser son rêve ? Au bout de combien de jours de tournage l'équipe va-t-elle rendre obligatoire l'instauration d'une sorry jar pour la scénariste ?J'ai pu financer la saison 1 sur fonds propres, parce qu'elle était courte et que presque tout se passait dans le même décor (et qu'on n'avait pas encore élu Macron) (celle-là elle était gratos, bisous Manu), mais la saison 2, comme je le disais, est plus ambitieuse : elle introduit de nouveaux personnages, elle se passe dans un tas de lieux différents, et les épisodes seront plus longs (on passe d'une moyenne de 4mn à une moyenne de 8 mn avec un pic à l'épisode 10 qui est presque un double épisode), certains épisodes requerront des costumes spécifiques, et surtout il y a des frais incompressibles (nourriture, essence, parking pour ceux qui transportent beaucoup de matériel) que mes moyens seuls ne me permettent plus de prendre en charge. Je pourrais évidemment tout plaquer et aller vivre dans la forêt et utiliser l'argent économisé pour le tournage mais mon appartement est un des décors, ce ne serait pas très pratique. Soyons honnêtes.Les techniciens de la série viennent déjà m'aider gentiment (et un peu parce qu'ils aiment le projet me dit-on dans l'oreillette), mais leur demander de payer pour venir bosser, c'est juste impensable. Et voilà pourquoi on se retrouve sur Kickstarter.L'objectif du kickstarter permettrait de rendre la série faisable, dans les conditions de, notamment, l'épisode 6. L'argent récolté se répartirait comme suit :Si nous dépassions cet objectif, voilà ce qui pourrait se passer :Certains épisodes se dérouleront dans des lieux où la prise de son est plus complexe. Avec ce palier supplémentaire, nous pourrons louer un meilleur équipement pour ces épisodes, et nous aurons deux sondiers!Avec un troisième palier, nous pourrions non seulement louer davantage de matériel de prise de son, mais défrayer à notre maquilleuse le matériel qu'elle utilise sur nos visages et financer un mixage en studio professionneldes épisodes.Enfin, avec ce dernier palier, nous pourrons nous permettre d'investir un peu dans les costumes et certains éléments de décor.Si nous dépassions tous ces paliers, il nous sera possible d'un peu mieux défrayer toute l'équipe et de commencer à rémunérer les comédiens qui incarneront les différents personnages de la saison. Ce qui m'amène à vous les présenter :La RéalisatriceNée dans une famille de militaires, rien ne prédestinait Cédriane Fossat à une carrière artistique. Pourtant elle se met très tôt à écrire, d'abord de la poésie et des nouvelles, puis pour l'image. Elle a 16 ans quand deux de ses scénarios sont réalisés par le metteur en scène Pierre Lamotte. Dans ces premiers textes portés à l'écran elle développe un univers singulier, parfois teinté de fantastique, où le social côtoie toujours le drame psychologique.Bacchantes Tristes, son premier film en tant que réalisatrice, voit le jour en 2017 et traite de façon poétique et mélancolique des violences psychologiques au sein d'un couple.La ScénaristeFlorence Rivières est couteau suisse : ça pose en faisant ses études de philosophie, ça photographie tout en se rendant compte que ça veut devenir comédienne, ça finit par écrire un livre sur les modèles photo et soudain tout se débloque : elle veut écrire, et elle va le faire. De tout, et en tentant toutes les formes parce que sinon comment savoir si ce sont de vrais choix ? Elle n'est heureuse qu'en apprentissage permanent et une tasse de thé à la main, écrit des nouvelles, va à des stages de BD parce que pourquoi pas, et prend des cicatrices en photo. Une vie équilibrée.Son blog.Le Chef OpérateurSauveteur de bébé phoques depuis 15 ans, Pif interrompt sa tournée des compétitions internationales de skimboard pour apporter son sens de l'à-propos à la série.L'Ingénieur du SonGautier Seguin fait du son depuis trois ans, et depuis le dernier d'entre eux, il sert un peu de complice à la scénariste : prise de son, mixage, compositions originales, voix off, retour de l'être aimé, il fait tout !Le Second Ingénieur du SonBenoit Griesbach aussi fait du son depuis trois ans. En plus, il joue maintenant dans des chaînes Youtube !La MaquilleuseNotre maquilleuse s'appelle Alise Saint-Dizier.Maquilleuse aussi bien beauté que en effets spéciaux, vous avez déjà pu voir son travail sur le dernier clip des Red Mourning, dans des court-métrages, ou bien encore sur des shootings photo...c'est d'ailleurs comme ça qu'elle a rencontré Florence, grâce à ses photos de cicatrices, d'où est tirée cette photo de présentation !L'ÉtalonneurEudes Quittelier est notre étalonneur. Il a aussi été chef op' de deux épisodes de la saison 1, et il nous sauve la vie une fois par semaine. On a d'ailleurs monté un genre de collectif de sauvetage de vies.Le ScriptMaxence Fossat est notre script, et il est merveilleux à cela.Le RégisseurAprès des études en sciences des religions et quelques années d'emploi dans l'administratif, Jérôme a fini par se rendre compte qu'en fait, il préférait s'occuper de gens qu'il appréciait, que ce soit en cuisinant ou en débloquant leurs portes à 4 heures du matin quand ceux-ci s'enferment dans leur salle de bain. C'est donc naturellement qu'il accepta d'occuper le poste de régisseur.La Chef DécoCeri Lune était pâtissière, puis elle s'est dit qu'elle voulait changer de voie. Elle s'est mise à s'intéresser à la décoration et la chance a voulu qu'elle soit justement sur le tournage d'une autre websérie un jour, et par la force des choses, elle y a fait toute la décoration. Elle est restée dans les parages depuis.EstelleFlorence Rivièrespasse par de nombreux cursus avant de se décider à quitter le cocon de la fac de philosophie se former en théâtre. Elle passe par les cours Victor et le Centre des arts de la scène et se forme sur le tas en jouant dans des webséries : Spacefleet (2015), Paradoxe (2017), Sans Vouloir vous Déranger évidemment (démarrée en 2016), Les Souverains (2017), et prochainement Time Warp (2018), et des court-métrages : Feel the Life, Chroniques de Bastringue, La Noyée, Moi, je, me, Carrousel Funeste et Je suis un Renard qu'elle a écrit et réalisé en Islande. Ses premiers pas sur les planches, en janvier 2018, étaient sur celles de l'Opéra Bastille, dans Sex'Y, une création de Marie-Eve Signeyrolle interrogeant le rapport d'une génération à l'amour, au sexe, à l'intimité.SolèneDanseuse, comédienne, chanteuse de 23 ans. Marine Voyeux commence la danse classique à 4 ans, intègre la classe ballet à 6 ans, et sport étude à 10 ans. Durant ce cursus, elle découvre le jazz, la compétition, les galas, la scène !

Typiquement construire une saison (la saison 1) à partir de ce qui était censé être trois court-métrages indépendants, c'était un sacré challenge - mais on l'a fait.À titre personnel, écrire une série dont certains passages sont plus ou moins tirés de la vraie vie, puis jouer mon propre texte en face d'acteurs chevronnés, puis ensuite me confronter à tout ça d'un coup en étant ma propre monteuse, je ne vous le cache pas c'est en fait le plus difficile - et le plus gratifiant.On a essayé de tirer les leçons de la saison 1 pour en faire les forces de la saison 2 - je préfère cette formulation à ""ne pas refaire les mêmes erreurs"" - et il ne reste plus qu'à la tourner (et la monter) (et l'étalonner) (et la mixer) pour vérifier si nous avons réussi.Avec vous, on pourra le découvrir...!"

Children with autism frequently struggle with understanding, recognizing or expressing emotion through typical facial expressions.Drew's intent is to create a fun and helpful line of flashcards, posters and books that parents and teachers can use with their children to help overcome this hurdle in a unique and imaginative way.In order to integrate these tools into families and schools, the materials must be made durable, to endure rigorous and continued use. The KnowMySmile flashcards will be printed on waterproof and tear proof materials that will withstand excessive handling.To help keep the price down, this KickStarter will make these tools available to parents and teachers at an affordable cost.We are hoping to have products ready for shipment in September. This way, teachers and parents can incorporate the flashcards and other tools into daily exercises and learning when children head back to school.""As a teacher in a Specialized Instruction classroom for students with Autism Spectrum Disorders, I have seen the joy that Drew's work brings to children with ASD firsthand. His artwork is beautifully crafted to enhance learning without being overstimulating. The balance of simplicity and complexity in his work has truly helped develop excitement and passion for learning in my classroom. I couldn't be more encouraged and excited for what is to come!""                                          -JoAnna Barker, Specialized Instruction AutismThe Sea Life Loves Ice Cream set will only be available if we reach our goal - prints and canvases will be available, but once the Kickstarter is over, this limited run of adorable art will be retired.","It's very important that the Emotions flashcard sets be sturdy, waterproof and resistant to rips and tears.  This ensures that parents and educators can continue using the cards for years to come. We have found a manufacturer that specializes in this sort of paper and at this time we are looking at samples and brainstorming for other methods regarding durability.",https://www.kickstarter.com/projects/50709737/hard-enamel-pins-by-artist-drew-blank-for-all-pop?ref=discovery_category_newest,50709737/hard-enamel-pins-by-artist-drew-blank-for-all-pop,"Hello! You have just entered the mind of Arter & Writist Drew Blank.As a professional artist and writer I am always looking for fun new ways to expand my work and reach out to more fans. I have spent the past seven years traveling the comic convention circuit selling my art and books, all the while meeting so many amazing new people and creating a very loyal and excited fanbase. One thing I can no longer ignore, however, is that many of these fans have one very specific wish in common; that I would get with the times and start creating ENAMEL PINS!!!Well. I am doing it. The people have spoken and I am reacting in kind.Truth be told, I have had so much fun designing these pins that I am sure this is just the first wave in many. I already have stretch goal pins in mind, so if this campaign is a success, there will be many more pins to come!Each pin is roughly 1.5"" tall (or wide) and made of hard enamel. The rubber backings make them versatile and easy to display anywhere! Each pin will also come with a cardboard backer with the original DREW'S PIN ME RIGHT ROUND turntable design, and the back of each backer will be signed by me!What more can I say other than the fact that I am very excited and I look forward to starting a new branch of products available at DrewBlank.comNow on with the designs!","I found the initial process of wrapping my head around pin design a challenge. Working on a small scale, limiting color choices etc were all newer design challenges I had to face. Now, however, I find the entire process fun and exciting and I can not wait to share all of this with you!"
https://www.kickstarter.com/projects/rivalsmi/a-day-with-the-homeless-0?ref=discovery_category_newest,rivalsmi/a-day-with-the-homeless-0,"In each of us a creative... A phrase I often hear from a good friend of mine. I didn't necessarily believe it myself, at least not early on, as I didn't have a creative bone in my body, however I always admired those who did.It wasn't until 2012 when I was left broke and homeless that I decided to truly find myself. I picked up a camera and documented the streets of Detroit from my car. I was homeless, but I was happy, I was creating and even though I had lost everything I still felt like I had my voice.In each of us a creative... A term that resonated with me after that experience. It took a while, but I was eventually able to get back on my feet, and now that I am I want to give back the same joy that rejuvenated my purpose... Photography.How It WorksWhat I want to do is quite simple, give the homeless a creative voice, but also bring spotlight to the many talents and sacrifices they have made. By providing disposable cameras to the homeless they will have a chance to document their everyday life experiences and share their story with the rest of the world.Once the project is complete I will schedule a location to meet up with them collect the cameras, develop the film and upload and share the content with you all.The first project will take place in Detroit, MI. Each photograph taken regardless of quality will be uploaded online for you all to see. The home page of the website will be organized alphabetically, giving each photographer a separate page of their own. Here I will tell you about the photographer, their situation and finally display their gallery.In a separate tab there will be a link to look at what I think are the best images, these will be the images used to create the limited edition photo book.What I Need From YouDisposable cameras are one of the cheapest forms of art, however anything purchased in quantity can become rather expensive. The $1500 is the bare minimum in which I'll need to start this project off. Here is an estimate of the expenses.50 Disposable camera(s) - $400Film development - $600Reward Expenses - $200Website/Advertisement - $250That estimate brings us to a total of $1,250, however the larger the campaign the larger we can scale this project.Let's help this project see the day of light. Photography shifted my life into a more positive direction, I can't guarantee the same will happen to everyone involved in this project, but I know it will inspire at least one person.Everyone involved in this project will be listed on the website as co-creators.","Any problems with this project will be on the processing end. Although it is my wish to receive all cameras back from the project I can not guarantee that will be the case. However this is the reason why so many cameras will be given out, to compensate for any mishaps.",https://www.kickstarter.com/projects/rivalsmi/center-of-attention-a-keenanrivals-photobook?ref=discovery_category_newest,rivalsmi/center-of-attention-a-keenanrivals-photobook,"Why This Project?We live in a digital world, every day thousands of people go out, create and then store whatever they produced in the cloud or to a hard drive. The work we create is hardly every seen and when it is it's only appreciated for a few seconds.I love social media, but it's made everything so disposable, I'm only as good as the last photograph I take. For the longest time I was okay with that type of medium, but as of late, I've been feeling like my work needs to be elsewhere.In these images you see so much, I get to tell you a story about every day people, but I also get to share my own. My entire life I wanted to be somebody, but I was never brave enough to put myself out there. This is why I chose photography, it was the perfect outlet for me. I picked up a camera because I was able to hide behind it.After months of photographing I found myself growing more confident. Not just in photography but in life. In my earlier work, you see me taking photographs of people walking by, but as I developed my craft I began to photograph people head on.I went from a shy kid, to being the center of attention. I'm in every image, without being in any of them.The BookI've never created a zine, that's going to be another aspect of this project that creates value for not only those who contribute to the project, but to everyone who wants to create something similar.I'm going to document this entire journey. Designing the zine, finding a printer, figuring out how to ship it safely. I know there are a ton of creators who would love this information and once this project is complete it will finally be open to the public. With that being said, I'm not sure how many pages this zine will be, or how big it will be, I just know that I will max out on whatever I can to ensure that this zine is quality.RewardsI wanted to keep the rewards simple for this project. I'm a photographer, thus I thought it would be best if everyone received a photograph. Below are 5, 5"" prints that were taken during my NY trip. Each image is limited to 5 copies and will be issued out at random.Special EditionThe special edition is the aspect of this magazine I'm most excited about. For the past 3 years my ""Have A Nice Day"" photograph has been the most well liked photograph of mine. It's been featured a countless amount of time and has really circulated around the internet.Now it's going to land on the cover of my first zine. This alternative cover will be limited to 10 copies, they will come signed be me. Included will be a 8""x10"" ""HAND"" print, which will also be signed.After this zine, I plan to bury the photograph for a while. It's served me well, but it's time to create new images, this will be the last time you will be able to get a print this size for a while.Stretch GoalsThe project is now completely funded, however there are still copies of the book left. Ideally I'd like to print the full run and not a limited quantity. In order to put in an order we needed $1250, but to get all 100 zines printed we're looking at $2750. Let's push to make this happen!To make things more interesting I've added another 8x10 print option, which will come signed. These prints are typically $200 in my web shop, but for the campaign I'm offering them at $75. These will be limited, as they only go up for sale a few times out of the year.In addition to that I've given people another chance to get their hands on a Have A Nice Day Print. I plan to retire this print soon, so if you want one now is the time to grab it. It's also the cheapest I'll ever sell it for.The prints are 8x12 and there are only 6 of them. They're printed on 6 different types of paper (Deep Matte, Luster, Metallic, Matte, Glossy and Silk) and they will be shipped at random. These prints will also come signed.","This is my first photo zine. I may run into challenges that I may not be aware of. In order to get this printed I have to depend on others, thus the turn around is not 100% in my control. With that being said I've put a date in place that I think will give me enough time to account for any mishaps."

Making jewelry is what I'm good at, what makes me happy and what I want to do for my career. Over my life I have dabbled in many different things, from singing to painting to studying different languages. It wasn't until several years ago though that I tried my hand at sculpture and jewelry that I knew I had found what I really wanted to create in life. It was a strange sensation and if any of you have ever had anepiphanyas to what you were meant to do you'll understand the sort of welling of emotions I experienced when creating my first pieces. It's almost not enough to say I feel particularly fortunate to have been able to find my path so young.Aside from knowing jewelry designing (and making!) is exactly what I want to do, I am extremely passionate about anything I put my mind to: this Kickstarter being no exception. Let's just say I haven't been getting much sleep because I'm too energized around making this perfect and turn in to something that really gets others excited about what I am already so spirited about!Why Kickstarter?As you can see, I have already started a jewelry business of my own, but it's coming upon me fast that I will need to move out of my shared space studio and into a private one. With this is going to come great equipment costs, and without the help of you good people, it could end up putting me in debt instead of allowing me to create a beautiful new jewelry line!As a jewelry designer, I both design and create all my pieces by hand. Most of my work in nontraditional and based on sculptural concepts and high fashion rather than very traditional pieces. Whenever possible, I use recycled metals and materials and source my stones ethically.In the past few months, I have been looking for jewelry designing jobs to sustain my business, but it is clear to me that I want to work for myself, giving me the most freedom to create and keep on with what is beautiful and unique rather than what is accepted and commonplace,hopefullyallowing me to be the most successful I can be!The new collection I want to do will be based on some concepts I've already been formulating. They will encompass our human nature and the question asking if who we are is a function of our bodies, a function of a separate soul or is it a combination of the two? This will also tie into modern twists on ritual adornment that will hopefully include more gemstone laden designs.Along with the success and exposure that I've already had, I know that if I am able to set up my own permanent studio with all the machines, materials, chemicals, metals and stones that I need, I will be able to create my next collection that is sure to wow all my donors (and hopefully turn them in to loyal customers)!How you will make Artifaekt a success:There are so many costs that go in to creating a jewelry line, prices of metal are astronomical, sourcing ethically is expensive and the equipment needed to do it is not what you would call dainty. By making any level of donation, you make it possible for me to obtain the materials needed to invest in the new line of jewelry and expand the collection as a whole. I've tried my hardest to make the rewards the best they can be to make donating a fun, fashionable and rewarding experience. You will also see that what you get for donating is valued at a much higher retail cost. I also hope that by offering unique limited edition pieces, over time and with the success of my line they will become of greater value to you.I hope these rewards are enticing, and if you can think of anything else I could offer to you to make you want to donate, please feel free to comment or contact me!Bumper Sticker and T-ShirtThe bumper sticker and T-Shirt will have the same graphic (shown below). The T-Shirts will be white and come in a women's v-neck or men's crew in sizes XS-XL. On the shirt will be the lovely project logo!Spear RingNext there is the beautiful Bronze Spear Ring. It lays flat across your fingers (or straight out when you're walking around in the dark at 2am ;) The colors on this ring will vary because they are all hand-made and unique, but they will have a rainbow quality to them. Normal Retail Cost: $200.Wing I RingThis ring is also made of bronze and flares over the other fingers of your hand (and can also second as a weapon on those late nights!). Like the spear, the colors on this ring will vary but retain a rainbow quality. Normal Retail Cost: $240.ToothThis is the other option for the 100 dollar donation level. It's quite a fun piece and I think speaks for itself. Normal Retail Cost: $240.Extraction 1This ring is made of solid silver. It's a nice size and weight and can range from being quite elegant to every day depending on how you dress it up. Sorry everyone, this one isn't the best for self defense. Normal Retail Cost: $345Goals:Although $11,000 is a good amount of money, it still won't go very far in getting me some of the heavy duty things I will need in the studio when making the new line. A good bench alone can easily cost $1,000. This said, the $11,000 goal is the minimum I really need to get some of the essentials:-Jewelers bench-More flex-shaft bits-More wax supplies for casting-A basic casting centrifuge-A soldering bench-Vent for fumes-Allow me to work in bronze and silver-Cover some printing costs for 3D jewelryIf I can raise more than this, the opportunities are endless. The more money donated, the more I will be able to get and the better materials I will be able to use when creating the new collection:-Working in gold and other precious metals-Using precious gemstone-Polishing Wheels-Drill Press-Sanders-Jump Shear-Many other things that make the jewelry making process easier, more efficient and of a better quality for my customers","The worst thing I can think of happening after this project is funded is that I get overwhelmed with donations and have a hard time filling the rewards in the time specified. If this looks like it's going to happen, I will just have to hire some of my jeweler friends to help me process all the orders in a timely manner. Also, I will be sure to maintain a constant stream of communication with all my donors if anything like this happens.

Why Kickstarter?This is my second shot at Kickstarter!Unfortunatelymy last goal was apparently a little too ambitious, but this time I'm offering something different: jewelry based upon the weight of the soul. There have been studies that have debunked the theory since, but I am creating pieces that are based upon the idea that there was a cultural shift when scientists first put forward that the soul weighed around 21 grams. Instead of honoring andfocussingon the body after death, people wouldfocusinstead on their soul, thephysicalrepresentation being a constant reminder that our bodies are not all there is.As a jewelry designer, I both design and create all my pieces by hand or though 3D manipulation on a modeling program called Rhino.

With the donated money, I will be able to focus primarily on creating jewelry in Rhino, which requires very little in terms of a physical studio, but allows for endless creativity to create a new line for Artifaekt.Your Rewards!Bumper Sticker and T-Shirt The bumper sticker and T-Shirt will have the same graphic (shown below).

I thought it would be a fun way to tell my story with levity. The truth is I am a single-father with full custody of my two children. I love being a dad and am super blessed to have them living with me. Unfortunately, court ordered alimony payments consume the total of my discretionary income, and we struggle to get by. Put simply, I have a terrific full time job, but I can no longer make ends meet. I am more than willing to work a second job, but being a single-father, a second job would leave my children home alone most evenings and on weekends. I understand that a second job may be the route I am forced to take, but I would first like to try selling my art while maintaining full-time employment. I love painting. I love the joy it brings to me and the joy others find when viewing it. I love that I can paint with my children and share the joy with them. I would like to make an effort to sell my art at art fairs. This would allow me to spend time with my children both during the creation of the art and while selling it on the weekends, a much better option than working two jobs outside of the home. Following this dream requires purchasing a few items and paying booth fees that at present, I cannot afford. Your pledge will allow me to purchase a quality vendor tent and accessories, more painting supplies, more canvas, and pay both art fair jury fees and if accepted, booth fees. It will also go towards fuel and other expenses associated with exhibiting my art at various fairs and festivals. Most importantly, your pledge will allow me to continue being there for my children, being home to help them with homework, prepare meals, provide transportation to and from school events, being there to meet their needs, provide consistency, and demonstrate a love that only presence can afford.You may view some of my art here: Art by J Clint CarterArtist StatementSeveral years ago, my 11-year-old son held a secret family meeting and asked everyone to pitch in and purchase art supplies for my birthday. I awoke that morning to find an easel, canvas, set of acrylics, paintbrushes, palette, and the birth of a therapeutic hobby that at times consumes me. From spending hours mixing colors to find the perfect blue of a summer sky, to sanding and framing a completed painting, I enjoy the process as much or more than the finished product.Much of my work is inspired by a childhood running free on a farm near Wenden, Arizona. Located in the Sonoran Desert, Wenden is a tiny community sitting 100 miles from nowhere. Using acrylics and stencils, I attempt to capture the freedom and contrasts found in the desert, a peaceful wilderness where the flora and fauna stand armed to pierce, cut, or poison you. A place where the absence of water equals loss of life, but the call of the mourning dove or Gambel’s quail bounces off cacti and soothes worries.Immersed in the cowboy, indigenous, and Mexican cultures of the region, inhabitants of the rural Sonoran Desert embrace solitude but also delight in the community festivals and meals that celebrate the rich traditions, pageantry, and art found in these rural communities. My art is a humble attempt to share the story of this unique region and lifestyle.","I see the greatest risk to completing this project is finishing the commissioned pieces by the deadline.  This is why I have promised to have them finished by the end of the year. I will begin shipping the Giclée prints as soon as the campaign finishes.

This would allow me to spend time with my children both during the creation of the art and while selling it on the weekends, a much better option than working two jobs outside of the home. Following this dream requires purchasing a few items and paying booth fees that at present, I cannot afford. Your pledge will allow me to purchase a quality vendor tent and accessories, more painting supplies, more canvas, and pay both art fair jury fees and if accepted, booth fees. It will also go towards fuel and other expenses associated with exhibiting my art at various fairs and festivals. Most importantly, your pledge will allow me to continue being there for my children, being home to help them with homework, prepare meals, provide transportation to and from school events, being there to meet their needs, provide consistency, and demonstrate a love that only presence can afford.You may view some of my art here: Art by J Clint CarterArtist StatementSeveral years ago, my 11-year-old son held a secret family meeting and asked everyone to pitch in and purchase art supplies for my birthday. I awoke that morning to find an easel, canvas, set of acrylics, paintbrushes, palette, and the birth of a therapeutic hobby that at times consumes me. From spending hours mixing colors to find the perfect blue of a summer sky, to sanding and framing a completed painting, I enjoy the process as much or more than the finished product.Much of my work is inspired by a childhood running free on a farm near Wenden, Arizona. Located in the Sonoran Desert, Wenden is a tiny community sitting 100 miles from nowhere. Using acrylics and stencils, I attempt to capture the freedom and contrasts found in the desert, a peaceful wilderness where the flora and fauna stand armed to pierce, cut, or poison you. A place where the absence of water equals loss of life, but the call of the mourning dove or Gambel’s quail bounces off cacti and soothes worries.Immersed in the cowboy, indigenous, and Mexican cultures of the region, inhabitants of the rural Sonoran Desert embrace solitude but also delight in the community festivals and meals that celebrate the rich traditions, pageantry, and art found in these rural communities. My art is a humble attempt to share the story of this unique region and lifestyle.","I see the greatest risk to completing this project is finishing the commissioned pieces by the deadline. This is why I have promised to have them finished by the end of the year. I will begin shipping the Giclée prints as soon as the campaign finishes. If there are any delays or problems, I will keep my backers up to date with regular Project Updates."
