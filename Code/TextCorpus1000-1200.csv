https://www.kickstarter.com/projects/piratescanfly/poertraits-portraits-of-poe?ref=discovery_category_newest,piratescanfly/poertraits-portraits-of-poe,"- Italian then English -portraits of PoeUna miscela originale e divertente di caricature di Edgar Allan Poe tra giochi di parole e cultura pop.Partendo da una caricatura di Edgar Alla Poe sono arrivato a creare un set di oltre 100 illustrazioni che giocano con la figura di Poe ed il suo nome.Eccone alcuni esempiIl progetto POErtraits consiste nella realizzazione di un volumetto di dimensioni tascabili da sfogliare e gustare. Ma non solo. Insieme al volume queste immagini verranno raccolte in una collezione di 32 cartoline, chiamate POEstcard, e in un poster, POEster, da fissare per molto tempo alla scoperta di tutti i POErtraits.La cifra inserita nel crowdfunding è quella necessaria per coprire i costi di stampa di quanto detto sopra, ma attenzione: se la cifra raccolta dovesse superare quella richiesta e raggiungere i 4500€ il volumetto verrà stampato in formato cartonato anzichè brossurato. Se dovesse arrivare a 5000€ verranno stampate il doppio delle copie in formato cartonato. Ogni altro eventuale superamento dell'obiettivo verrà comunque impiegato nella realizzazione di gadget relativi al progetto POErtraits e portato a giro per l'Italia durante le varie fiere di settore.Il volume conterrà 101 POErtraits, i 12 segni zodiacali dell'oroscoPOE e l'aggiunta di alcuni omaggi a POErtraits realizzati da altri autori racchiusi nella categoria aPOEcrifi.L'obiettivo finale è anche portare in distribuzione questo volume grazie all'appoggio dell'associazione culturale Double Shot, che già in passato ha sostenuto progetti di autoproduzione, vedi Interni di Ausonia o My name is Palmiro di Sauro Ciantini.La Double Shot è un'associazione culturale senza fini di lucro che non parteciperà alle spese di realizzazione del volume e non percepirà utili dalla sua vendita riconoscendo il 100% degli incassi come diritti per l'autore. Consentirà comunque al volume di acquisire un codice ISBN e quindi essere riconosiuto come pubblicazione a tutti gli effetti e poter essere distribuita sul territorio nazionale attraverso i propri canali di distribuzione.Inoltre è mia intenzione presentare questo volume e gli articoli ad esso collegato durante l'evento Lucca Comics and Games 2015 nella Self Area ospitato per l'occasione sempre dall'associazione culturale Double Shot.Ho predisposto ricompense per ogni contributo, anche quello più piccolo di 1 €. Inoltre alcuni premi speciali per i sostenitori del crowdfunding come ritratti/caricature realizzati con lo stile del volume o stampe di singoli POErtraits. I volumetti acquisito tramite crowdfunding conterranno inoltre un POErtrait inedito, non stampato sul volume e realizzato a mano oltre ad una dedica di ringraziamento. Dedica che verrà realizzata anche per le POEstcards o comunque come indicato nelle varie ricompense.Di seguito alcune immagini esemplificative di come il volume apparirà una volta stampato.Seguite i link per visionare l'elenco completo e scegliere le POEstcards o i singoli POErtraits che desiderate.Spero che il mio progetto vi piaccia, vi faccia sorridere e vi stuzzichi abbastanza da spingervi a sostenermi.MarcoEnglishportraits of PoeFrom the first Edgar Allan Poe caricature, I drew more than 100 illustration punning with his name and figure.Here some example.The POErtraits project aim to realize an illustrated book to see and enjoy, plus 32 collectable postcards (POEstcards) and a poster (POEster) containing all the POErtraits illustrations.The amount I'd like to rise is the money I need to cover the printing costs of what I've described before. If I will rise more money I'll use them for a better printing (4500 from paperback to hardcover) or a bigger amount of copies of the book (5000). Any other overcoming of the goal will be spent to realize other kind of POErtraits gadget and to bring the book around Italy during comics exhibitions.The book contains 101 POErtraits, 12 horoscope (horoscoPOE) and some dedication to POErtraits from other artists (aPOEcryphal).I even would like to distribute this book to comics and bookshops thanks to the help of cultural association Double Shot, that had already supported independent projects like Interni by Ausonia and My name is Palmiro by Sauro Ciantini.Double Shot is a no profit cultural association and will not help this project with money and will not earn money from it. The 100% of profits from selling the book are considered copyright for the author. Double Shot will give to the book an ISBN code and will sell it using its distribution channels.I would like to present this book in november in the Self Area hosted by Double Shot stand at Lucca Comics and Games 2015, the biggest italian comics exhibition.I've prepared an award for any reward even for the lower contribution. For crowdfunding supporters I've prepared some special rewards like personalized portraits/caricature or prints of a single POErtraits.The books bought from the crowdfunding will also contain an unpublished handmade POErtrait and a dedication. As well as POEstcards or anyway according to how is written into the reward descriptions.Below some example images.Follow the link to see all the POEstcards or POErtraits to choice yours favorites.I hope you like my project and support it.Thank you.CreditsPOErtraits fontLuna byAmanda LeesonVideo filming and editing by Lorenzo CiacciaviccaVideo soundtracks“Ragtime” by Tate Peterson&“Rémy rêve encore” by Circus Marcus","- Italian then English -Ne approfitto per presentarmi.Mi chiamo Marco Rocchi e sono un autore di fumetti all'inizio del suo percorso.Attualmente ho all'attivo due pubblicazioni, la prima consiste in una storia breve in un volume antologico edito dalla allora Kappa Edizioni, mentre la seconda è una graphic novel, ""La Maschera della Morte Rossa"" edito da Kleiner Flug, di cui ho redatto la sceneggiatura e storyboard.Sto lavorando alla stesura di tre storie di cui almeno due di futura pubblicazione.Mi definisco autore e non sceneggiatore perchè sono anche in grado di disegnare e prima o poi lo dimostrerò.Questo volume potrebbe essere un primo assaggio.""La Maschera della Morte Rossa"" è un fumetto ispirato dal'omonimo racconto di Edgar Allan Poe e mentre ero in dedica allo stand della casa editrice insieme a Giuseppe, il disegnatore, è nato un gioco.Dopo il bel disegno realizzato da Giuseppe come dedica per gli acquirenti del volume io ero solito ritagliarmi un piccolo angolino in alto della pagina per una scherzosa caricatura di E. A. Poe.Ad un certo punto sento qualcuno che dice... ""Topolino"". E' stato un lampo, disegno subito una caricatura di Poe con le orecchie da topo, un toPOElino.Era nato il primo dei POErtraits.Da lì in poi non c'è stato più scampo per nessuno, chiunque si avvicinasse al nostro stand entrava in una sorta di sindrome di POE cercando parole con cui giocare con la sua caricatura.Il viaggio in macchina di ritorno dalla fiera (eravamo a Roma e tornavamo verso Firenze) è stato a dir poco delirante. Ogni parola POEteva diventare un POEtenziale POErtrait.Ringrazio a tal proposito Francesca, Giuseppe, Alessandro e Pippo che mi hanno un po' supportato e molto sopportato durante quel viaggio.Una volta a casa potevo contare su di un elenco di circa 100 parole, diventate poi che nei giorni successivi oltre 250.A questo punto non potevo più tirarmi indietro. La sfida era stata lanciata e divenuta personale. Avrei dovuto realizzare qualcosa. Così ho creato una pagina facebook (www.facebook.com/poertraits) che nel primo giorno, senza invitare alcun amico, ha raggiunto un centinaio di ""like"" solo sfruttando alcuni disegni. Magari non è molto, ma la cosa mi ha incoraggiato.Ho portato avanti il progetto e attualmente ho terminato la realizzazione di 101 POErtraits ai quali desidero dare una vetrina diversa dallo schermo di un PC o tablet o smartphone.Una dimensione tangibile fatta di carta.La prima sfida che ho affrontato è stata superata. La realizzazione dei disegni.Adesso è il momento della sfida più difficile: rendere questo progetto realtà grazie a questo crowdfunding.Grazie per essere arrivato a leggere fino a qui e spero di averti incuriosito abbastanza da spingerti a sostenere questo piccolo ma folle progetto.Marco--------------------------------------------------------------------------EnglishI will introduce myself.My name is Marco Rocchi and I am an italian artist and a cartoonist at the beginning of his career.Currently I have released some publication as screenwriter but I'm also able to draw and I will prove it.This book may be a first attempt.During a comics festival was born the first of POErtraits.Once at home I could count on a list of about 100 words to use creating POErtraits. After few days they became more than 250.I could not pull back. The challenge was on. I should realized something. So I created a facebook page (www.facebook.com/poertraits) that in the first day, without inviting any friends, reached 100 ""like"" only uploading few drawings. Maybe not much, but that encouraged me.I brought the project forward and now I have realized more than 101 POErtraits and I wish to give them a different support than PC or tablet or smartphone screen.A tangible stuff made of paper.The first challenge was exceeded. The realization of the drawings.Now is time for the greatest challenge: to make this project come true thanks to this crowdfunding.Thanks for reading so far and I hope you like my little but crazy project enough to support it.Thank you.Marco",https://www.kickstarter.com/projects/piratescanfly/the-masque-of-the-red-death-graphic-novel-edgar-allan-poe?ref=discovery_category_newest,piratescanfly/the-masque-of-the-red-death-graphic-novel-edgar-allan-poe,"A terrible pestilence, the Red Death, was sweeping the region, leaving in its wake a trail of corpses and blood. Once you had met her eyes, escape was impossible. Prince Prospero decided to gather within the walls of his castle a crowd of friends, healthy and free of worries, to wait out the passage of Death. The prince’s castle, a giant, improbably strong building, would offer enough protection and host a variety of distractions to all those invited.It has been six months since prince Prospero and his court locked themselves behind the impenetrable castle walls, to escape the Red Death. Not yet satisfied, Prospero decides to host the most exuberant and marvelous ball in human history. The party will take place across seven rooms, each lit in a different colour by enormous glass windows and gigantic braziers. The prince has made sure to procure everything his guests might need to have the best night of their lives.Alain is one of the musicians invited to play at the ball, and he harbors a deep seated distaste towards the prince and his friends. He will strike a deal with the Red Death herself to see his vengeful dreams become reality.Fans of the original Edgar Allan Poe short story ‘The Masque of the Red Death’ will have noticed that the final paragraph above introduces an entirely new element to the story: Alain the minstrel, main character of our story. The reason for this addition is that the aim of the book isn’t to be just an adaptation of the original story, but a new tale based on both Poe’s writing and our own personal influences.Introductions first: we are Marco Rocchi and Giuseppe Dell’Olio, the authors of this graphic novel. We met at the Scuola Internazionale di Comics (International Comics School) in Florence, where we both took a Comics course. Giuseppe was the first to come up with the idea of basing a story on the Masque of the Red Death, which he’s always been in awe of, and asked Marco to write a script for him to draw.The idea behind Alain’s character is that a story, any story, can’t really exist unless someone can tell it, perhaps someone who was present to the events in the first place. We used this to create a character with some ties to prince Prospero, which are slowly revealed through flashbacks, who can act as protagonist and narrator for the events as they unfold. A minstrel who can gather a crowd around the fire, and enchant listeners with his music and words, telling them of how Death won’t be intimidated by social status or the walls of a castle – no matter how tall or strong they might be.Alain’s character design is a tribute to one of our favorite Italian singer-songwriters, Angelo Branduardi, and to his song ‘Ballo in Fa Diesis Minore’ (Dance in F Sharp Minor), which explores the theme of Death and the message we brought into the book.The lyrics, inspired by the Danse Macabre and some medieval paintings, is perfectly in line with Poe’s story: nothing can stop Death, it doesn’t matter who you are or what you do to avoid her. We made sure to add the other part of the song explicitly in our story, and have Death lower her scythe to listen to the song played in her honor.The seven rooms that Poe wrote about made us think of the canonical Seven Deadly Sins, as we realized that prince Prospero’s lavish rooms hosting the ball – with its goal of over the top celebrations and mockery of Death – may very well be themed after each human pleasure.And so, our minstrel Alain, wearing the clothes of the Red Death, will have to move through each room before facing prince Prospero and exacting his revenge. We also added in the Dantesque notion of contrappasso, the idea that a sinner’s punishment is linked to the kind of sin they indulged in. Punishment that our minstrel will administer upon the castle’s guests.Will Alain see through his vengeful wishes?Graphic novel – 15x21cm (6x8.2 in) - 92 pages + extras, full color - paperback, matte coated.Here’s a preview of The Masque of the Red Death graphic novel.Click on this link to see the first 17 pages of the book (italian)!During the Italian book tour for La Maschera della Morte Rossa, Marco came up with the idea of POErtraits, a project that was Kickstarted and realized in 2016.

Impossibile sfuggirle una volta incrociatone lo sguardo. Ma il principe Prospero decise di radunare, all'interno delle mura del proprio castello, un nutrito gruppo di sani e spensierati amici, ritirandosi in isolamento in attesa che la Morte abbandonasse le proprie terre. La fortezza del principe, enorme ed eccentrica costruzione, avrebbe fornito la protezione necessaria e sarebbe stata teatro di ogni sorta di divertimento e svago per tutti gli invitati.Sono trascorsi ormai sei mesi da quando il principe Prospero e la sua corte si sono rinchiusi all'interno dell'impenetrabile castello per sfuggire al contagio della Morte Rossa. Come ulteriore atto di scherno nei confronti dell’epidemia dilagante, Prospero decide di allestire la più eccentrica e sfarzosa festa mai veduta da occhio umano. Sette stanze ospiteranno questa festa, ognuna delle quali caratterizzata da un colore predominante diverso, ottenuto tramite alte vetrate colorate e illuminate sul lato opposto da enormi bracieri. Il principe si era preoccupato di procurare tutti i mezzi per il divertimento dei propri ospiti.Tra i musici invitati ad allietare l’evento vi è Alain, un menestrello che serba nei confronti del principe e dei suoi amici più stretti un antico rancore. Egli arriverà a stringere un patto con la Morte Rossa stessa per vedere realizzati i propri propositi di vendetta.Chi conosce l'omonimo racconto breve, La Maschera della Morte Rossa dello scrittore americano Edgar Allan Poe, si è certamente reso conto che nell'ultimo paragrafo della breve descrizione appena letta vi è un elemento totalmente nuovo: Alain, il menestrello protagonista della nostra storia. Il motivo è che questo libro non vuole essere un semplice adattamento dell'opera di Poe, ma una storia originale che trae spunto, oltre che dal racconto omonimo, anche da altre fonti di ispirazione che hanno influito sulla nostra vita durante la sua realizzazione.Ci presentiamo: siamo Marco Rocchi e Giuseppe Dell'Olio, autori di questo graphic novel. Ci siamo conosciuti alla Scuola Internazionale di Comics di Firenze, dove abbiamo frequentato insieme il corso di Fumetto. È di Giuseppe l'idea di creare una storia prendendo spunto dal racconto La Maschera della morte Rossa, del quale si era da tempo innamorato, e chiede a Marco di realizzare per lui una sceneggiatura da poter illustrare.Il concetto alla base della creazione di Alain è che una storia, senza qualcuno che vi abbia assistito e che la racconti, è come se non esistesse o risulterebbe mera invenzione. Da qui l'idea di introdurre un personaggio, con un background legato al principe Prospero che verrà di volta in volta svelato, tramite vari flashback, e che possa essere protagonista e narratore delle vicende di cui è testimone. Un menestrello che, radunando persone intorno al fuoco, le possa incantare con musica e parole raccontando di come la Morte non si lasci intimidire dal rango sociale o dalle mura di un castello per quanto spesse possano essere.Il caracter design di Alain è un tributo ad Angelo Branduardi, un cantautore italiano che adoriamo e del quale amiamo in particolar modo la canzone ballo in fa diesis minore, le cui tematiche sono legate alla morte e il cui messaggio abbiamo voluto portare all'interno del libro.Il testo, ispirato al tema della Danza Macabra e tratto da alcune pitture medievali, è perfettamente in linea con il racconto di Poe: niente può fermare la Morte, non importa chi tu sia o casa faccia per evitarla. Abbiamo aggiunto al racconto anche l'altro aspetto presente nella canzone: la Morte che posa la falce e ascolta il ballo in suo onore.Le sette stanze raccontate da Poe ci hanno, a loro volta, portato alla menteil tema dei Sette Peccati Capitali, e non è fuori luogo pensare che le sfarzose stanze del principe Prospero, che ospitano la festa il cui scopo è eccedere in divertimento e schernire la morte, vengano dedicate ognuna a uno specifico piacere umano.Così il Menestrello Alain, indossando i panni della Morte Rossa, dovrà attraversare le sette stanze prima di arrivare di fronte al principe Prospero e completare la sua vendetta. Legato a questa è stato introdotto anche il concetto di contrappasso dantesco,cioè una punizione per il peccatore commisurata in base alla tipologia del crimine commesso. Una punizione che lo stesso menestrello infliggerà agli ospiti del castello.Riuscirà Alain a portare a compimento i suoi propositi di vendetta?ITA Volume unico - 21 x 28,4cm - 92 pagine a colori - brossurato, carta usomano.ENG Volume unico - 15 x 21cm - 92 color pages + extra - brossurato, patinato opaco.Ecco l'anteprima di alcune pagine di La Maschera della Morte Rossa.Seguendo questo link potrete vedere le prime 17 pagine del fumetto!Durante il tour promozionale in Italia per La Maschera della Morte Rossa nasce l'idea di POErtraits, un progetto realizzato nel 2016 da Marco e finanziato attraverso crowdfunding su Kickstarter.

We aim to share this vision with a six-minute animated film dazzling enough to go wildly viral on the internet. In 2009, John Teton, director of the award-winning animated film B’raesheet, set about writing and designing Thunder Head Clearing, and, in spite of a severe shortage of funding, has brought the project to the brink of full production with an elaborate storyboard created by a team of artists from many parts of the world. Through first-class 2D and 3D animation, Thunder Head Clearing will take viewers through a myth-like fantasy voyage laced with themes reckoning with the extent of world hunger and the potential of a global commitment in the form of an international treaty on food security to eradicate it.In Thunder Head Clearing, a large gathering of strangers from all walks of life unknown to each other find themselves drawn to a mysterious clearing in the woods where they are swept up in extraordinary series of events. (You can get more hints about the movie’s story from our Kickstarter video, but the most spectacular plot and imagery elements must remain hidden from the public until the film’s release, in order to preserve the element of surprise.)The first stage of the film’s production has been completed with the work of fine artists from far and wide working together over the internet. Many of them, like the film’s director John Teton, have volunteered their talents, motivated by the excitement of what Thunder Head Clearing will achieve as a work of entertainment and inspiration once it goes viral on YouTube.All that’s needed now to pull the trigger on its completion is production financing from the international Kickstarter community. Making it Happen Through KickstarterKickstarter.com enables people anywhere in the world to support creative projects with financial contributions—not for the purpose of accruing stock, dividends or tax deductions, but simply to help visions they find appealing come to fruition. There are, however, plenty of non-cash rewards associated with this project, items and/or experiences to enhance your connection with Thunder Head Clearing. Check out the Rewards sidebar of our Kickstarter webpage.A Note On AcknowledgmentsThe filmmakers hope that all contributors will know we value and appreciate every single contribution to the making of Thunder Head Clearing, large or small, and that, for some, a relatively small donation requires digging deeper into their pockets than larger contributions might require from others. We also hope everyone will understand that the large number of contributors to Kickstarter campaigns may make it too difficult to include all of their names in the film’s credits and that it may prove necessary to adopt the common practice of crediting only those making the largest contributions.The filmmaking team greatly appreciates the efforts of those of you who, while not in a position to pledge much or anything to the project yourselves, make an invaluable contribution to our film by sending the Thunder Head Clearing Kickstarter link to all those you know who might conceivably either become a contributor or send the link on to others they know. Success with Kickstarter campaigns is dependent on just this kind of networking.How are contributions gathered? Kickstarter has updated a centuries-old tradition of sponsor-backed creative work by using the internet to reach out to potential sponsors everywhere. Since its launch in 2009, Kickstarter has successfully raised more than $700,000,000 for more than 48,000 projects from more than 4,000,000 contributors.Contributions are arranged initially by pledges people make through Amazon via a link on this Kickstarter website. (Kickstarter has an alternate provision for pledging for contributors outside the US.) Charge cards are not charged and funds are not given over to project creators unless and until the tally of pledges reaches the level of the producer’s target budget within a pre-determined time frame. If the target is not met by the deadline, all pledges are nullfied. If the target is met or exceeded, all pledged funds are transmitted to the producer from Amazon via Kickstarter.How will the funds be spent?The greatest single cost in animation production is typically the motion itself. In this first attempt to finance the film via Kickstarter,Thunder Head Clearing has been budgeted to allow for a first-class production of the film’s fully scripted and storyboarded blueprint with the aim of completing the film and releasing it on the internet during 2014. Almost all of the funds will go to the artists working at a non-commercial rate. Some of the funds will cover expenses of the Kickstarter/Amazon system, contributors’ rewards, and the film’s distribution. Less than one-tenth will go to cover funds advanced for labor required during the four-year pre-production period.Should the pledges acquired in this initial round not match the target, pledges will be cancelled and the production design will be reformulated to correspond with the pledge total raised in the first round for a second round on Kickstarter to follow promptly after the initial deadline. (Please see Update #2 for more details.)John Teton has structured the film’s budget in the expectation that essential spending on artists will likely preclude his receiving a fee for his work as producer, director, and editor unless pledges exceed the target budget. However, pledges do sometimes exceed Kickstarter target budgets, and that would have a major impact on Thunder Head Clearing, allowing for even more stellar animation and artistic effects and a faster production time—no small matters when inspiring a world beset by a plague that kills tens of thousands and harms hundreds of millions every day.How You and We Can Join ForcesThe Thunder Head Clearing team is very excited about producing an electrifying work of film. We look forward to having you on our team through your contributions, large and small—indeed, most Kickstarter projects that succeed do so by the accumulation of many small contributions. Further, your help can be multiplied many times over by spreading the word about this project through conversation, tweets, or text and email links to everyone you know who might conceivably contribute and/or spread the word to their networks.We hope that you will celebrate the holiday season of 2013 by ensuring that Thunder Head Clearing gets funded so it can be completed and released over the Web for free during the new year to come. You can enable our artists to animate a real-world thanksgiving, in which hundreds of millions of people are spared the threat or curse of hunger.Please act soon—the funding deadline nears closer every day. Thank you in advance for making this most unusual animation come to life.  ","Producer and IFST Campaign Director John Teton notes, “While there may be no activity on Earth that’s totally risk-free, and while not every project I’ve tried to finance has gone forward, I have never failed to complete a project which has been fully funded, either for a client or myself. I consider the 1970s movie line “I eat determination for breakfast” applicable to me; for evidence of that, visit www.treaty.org to see how the IFST, a concept that was considered wildly pie-in-the-sky at the time I started it, has been corralled into the realm of serious international policy consideration. The success of establishing the Treaty's credibility through twenty years of unpaid, “free-time,” while earning a living mainly as a filmmaking teacher and video producer, has persuaded me more than ever that persistence can make up for a shortage of financial sponsorship when advancing an idea whose time has come. “I have produced videos for major corporations such as Olympus, Chevron, and Safeway, as well as an international award-winning animated short film ('B’raesheet') and have an excellent record for accuracy in pre-production budgeting. I’m confident that the budget target for ‘Thunder Head Clearing’ is realistic and adequate to produce a short film worthy of exhibition in some of the world’s premiere animation festivals. Further, my commitment to the project's completion will remain unshakeable even if the production and target budget must be sharply reduced in a second try at Kickstarter crowdfunding.“As for distribution, unless YouTube and the Internet disappear in the next year, worldwide distribution of the film is guaranteed. We want ‘Thunder Head Clearing’ to be made available to everyone without charge from the moment it is released. The prospects for a film with a hopeful message getting widely seen may be gauged by the results of a 2012 YouTube video promoting a campaign to capture warlord Joseph Kony, which picked up 80,000,000 hits on YouTube in its first four days. Even if the audience for ‘Thunder Head Clearing,’ with all the classy animation my crew of artists is capable of, turned out to be only 0.1% of that size, it would still lead to a great explosion of hope—and indications are that ‘Thunder Head Clearing’ will be able to hold its own in comparison to any animation or YouTube clip associated with hope for the real world social justice in terms of entertainment value, artistic craft, or potential for positive newsmaking.”",https://www.kickstarter.com/projects/2068553294/thunder-head-clearing-animating-the-world-hunger-f?ref=discovery_category_newest,2068553294/thunder-head-clearing-animating-the-world-hunger-f,"What is Thunder Head Clearing?Thunder Head Clearing is an animated short film fable envisioning the world freed of its most pervasive form of suffering—hunger. We aim to share this vision with a six-minute animated film thrilling enough to go wildly viral on the internet.In 2009, John Teton, director of the award-winning animated film B’raesheet, set about writing and designing Thunder Head Clearing, and, in spite of a severe shortage of funding, has brought the project to the brink of full production with an elaborate storyboard created by a team of artists from many parts of the world.Through first-class 2D and 3D animation, Thunder Head Clearing will take viewers through a myth-like fantasy voyage laced with themes reckoning with the extent of world hunger and the potential of a global commitment in the form of an international treaty on food security to eradicate it.In Thunder Head Clearing, a large gathering of strangers from all walks of life unknown to each other find themselves drawn to a mysterious clearing in the woods where they are swept up in extraordinary series of events. (You can get more hints about the movie’s story from our Kickstarter video, but some spectacular plot and imagery elements must remain hidden from the public until the film’s release, in order to preserve the element of surprise.)The first stage of the film’s production has been completed with the work of fine artists from far and wide working together over the internet. Many of them, like the film’s director John Teton, have volunteered their talents, motivated by the excitement of what Thunder Head Clearing will achieve as a work of entertainment and inspiration once it goes viral on YouTube.All that’s needed now to pull the trigger on its completion is production financing from the international Kickstarter community.Making it Happen Through KickstarterKickstarter.com enables people anywhere in the world to support creative projects with financial contributions—not for the purpose of accruing stock, dividends or tax deductions, but simply to help visions they find appealing come to fruition. There are, however, plenty of non-cash rewards associated with this project, items and/or experiences to enhance your connection with Thunder Head Clearing. Check out the Rewards sidebar of our Kickstarter webpage.Financing projects on Kickstarter initially involves a lot of guesswork as to how much can reasonably be expected to be pledged. The need for strict budget tightening—an historic necessity for most filmmakers—became clear during an earlier attempt to finance this film on Kickstarter with a substantially higher financing goal. Our average pledge on that round was well above the average for Kickstarter projects but the number of site visits to our project page was much lower than expected.Now the financing and production plans forThunder Head Clearing have been revisedto bring production costs and the new Kickstarter budget target into line with pledges already made during our initial run, by (1) seeking additional cash and in-kind financing outside of Kickstarter, (2) forgoing pay raises initially planned for the crew, (3) confirming that all of the new Kickstarter target budget will be allocated to expenses and crew other than producer/director/editor John Teton, and (4) most importantly, employing a more spare animation style that will enable us to use a mix of innovative and established techniques that can still yield an artistically sophisticated moviewith a sharp, original look and soundtrack.This multifaceted strategy will permit us to produce the movie as originally scripted and storyboardedwith the aim of completing the film and releasing it on the internet during 2014. How are contributions gathered?Kickstarter has updated a centuries-old tradition of sponsor-backed creative work by using the internet to reach out to potential sponsors everywhere. Since its launch in 2009, Kickstarter has successfully raised more than $700,000,000 for more than 51,000 projects from more than 4,000,000 contributors.Contributions are arranged initially by pledges people make through Amazon via a link on this Kickstarter website. (Kickstarter has an alternate provision for pledging for contributors outside the US.) Charge cards are not charged and funds are not given over to project creators unless and until the tally of pledges reaches the level of the producer’s target budget within a pre-determined time frame. If the target is not met by the deadline, all pledges are nullfied. If the target is met or exceeded, all pledged funds are transmitted to the producer from Amazon via Kickstarter.How will the funds be spent?Almost all of the funds will go to the artists working at a non-commercial rate. A small portion of funds will cover expenses of the Kickstarter/Amazon system, contributors’ rewards, and the film’s distribution. To keep costs to a minimum, none of the present Kickstarter target budget will be allocated to John Teton for his work as producer, director, and editor. Pledges do sometimes exceed Kickstarter target budgets, and we hope that will be the case for Thunder Head Clearing, as that will allow for more stellar animation and artistic effects and a faster production time—no small matters when inspiring a world beset by a plague that kills tens of thousands and harms hundreds of millions every day.A Note On AcknowledgmentsThe filmmakers hope that all contributors will know we value and appreciate every single contribution to the making of Thunder Head Clearing, large or small, and that, for some, a relatively small donation requires digging deeper into their pockets than larger contributions might require from others. We also hope everyone will understand that the large number of contributors to some Kickstarter campaigns may make it too difficult to include all of their names in the film’s credits and that it may prove necessary to adopt the common practice of crediting only those making the larger contributions.The filmmaking team greatly appreciates the efforts of those of you who, while not in a position to pledge much or anything to the project yourselves, make an invaluable contribution to our film by sending the Thunder Head Clearing Kickstarter link to all those you know who might conceivably either become a contributor or send the link on to others they know. Success with Kickstarter campaigns is dependent on just this kind of networking.How You and We Can Join ForcesThe Thunder Head Clearing team is very excited about producing an electrifying work of film. We look forward to having you on our team through your contributions, large and small. Further, your help can be multiplied many times over by spreading the word about this project through conversation, tweets, or text and email links to everyone you know who might conceivably contribute and/or spread the word to their networks.We hope that you will celebrate the holiday season of 2013 by ensuring that Thunder Head Clearing gets funded so it can be completed and released over the Web for free during the new year to come. You can enable our artists to animate a real-world thanksgiving, in which hundreds of millions of people are spared the threat or curse of hunger.","Producer and IFST Campaign Director John Teton notes, “While there may be no activity on Earth that’s totally risk-free, and while not every project I’ve tried to finance has gone forward, I have never failed to complete a project which has been fully funded, either for a client or myself. I consider the 1970s movie line “I eat determination for breakfast” applicable to me; for evidence of that, visit www.treaty.org to see how the IFST, a concept that was considered wildly pie-in-the-sky at the time I started it, has been corralled into the realm of serious international policy consideration. The success of establishing the Treaty's credibility through twenty-one years of unpaid, “free-time,” while earning a living mainly as a filmmaking teacher and video producer, has persuaded me more than ever that persistence can make up for a shortage of financial sponsorship when advancing an idea whose time has come. “I have produced videos for major corporations such as Olympus, Chevron, and Safeway, as well as an international award-winning animated short art film ('B’raesheet') and have an excellent record for accuracy in pre-production budgeting. I’m confident that the budget target for ‘Thunder Head Clearing’ is realistic and adequate to produce a short film worthy of exhibition in some of the world’s premiere animation festivals. “As for distribution, unless YouTube and the Internet disappear in the next year, worldwide distribution of the film is guaranteed. We want ‘Thunder Head Clearing’ to be made available to everyone without charge from the moment it is released. The prospects for a film with a hopeful message getting widely seen may be gauged by the results of a 2012 YouTube video promoting a campaign to capture warlord Joseph Kony, which picked up 80,000,000 hits on YouTube in its first four days. Even if the audience for ‘Thunder Head Clearing,’ with all the classy animation my crew of artists is capable of, turned out to be only 0.1% of that size, it would still lead to a great explosion of hope—and indications are that ‘Thunder Head Clearing’ will be able to hold its own in comparison to any animation or YouTube clip associated with hope for real world social justice in terms of entertainment value, artistic craft, or potential for positive newsmaking.”"

This may cause the printing process to be long - effectively causing the shipping date to be set to April 2018.Furthermore, due to the nature of living in a small country, it is likely that the shipping process can be quite long.

Cristoforo Regular will have some 300+ glyphs.You can see specimens of the source typefaces on my blog.If you are not familiar with Kickstarter, scroll down to the FAQ and learn more about how it works.Columbus and American Italic were classic typefaces by a master craftsman. But there's never been a decent digital version of these fonts. With Cristoforo, I want to make a pair of professional quality digital fonts, complete both in standard character coverage and in having many assorted alternate letter shapes. (For example, the graphic above shows the swash alternate versions of C, V and R originally available in Columbus Initials.)Cristoforo has a huge history here. Its predecessor, Columbus, was the typeface used to create the logo for the Call of Cthulhu roleplaying game, inspired by the horror fiction of H.P. Lovecraft. The Call of Cthulhu RPG first appeared in 1981, and for over a decade Columbus appeared on the covers of not only the game rulebook, but also a couple of dozen supplemental books and adventures. After falling out of use on supplements in the 1990s, it has still continued to be the primary game logo to the present day, with only a couple of brief interruptions. Thus Columbus has an iconic status among many fans of Call of Cthulhu and/or H.P. Lovecraft. The game introduced many to Lovecraft’s fiction. The Call of Cthulhu campaign adventure Masks of Nyarlathotep, which I designed most of the “clues” for, remains the highest-rated campaign or adventure ever published for any role-playing game. Here are a few of the Call of Cthulhu books using Columbus.What's that black book at the top of the picture, holding the others at a handy angle? I hand bound a copy of the rulebook, hardcover in leather. Why, yes, I am that obsessive.Cristoforo also has a key link to classic Americana. Its predecessor, Columbus, was the typeface used as the basis for the original logo for Cracker Jack (the candied peanut and popcorn snack), back in the 1890s. The candy was such a basic part of the baseball stadium experience that it was immortalized in the hit 1908 song, still sung today at most major league baseball games, ""Take Me Out to the Ball Game"":“Take me out to the ball game,Take me out with the crowd;Buy me some peanuts and Cracker Jack...”Although the logo has since been updated and modernized, the current version still shows the influence of the original letterforms.",,https://www.kickstarter.com/projects/tphinney/cristoforo-victorian-cthulhu-fonts-revived-again?ref=discovery_category_newest,tphinney/cristoforo-victorian-cthulhu-fonts-revived-again,"Help me rescue this funky cool typeface from becoming forgotten history!Cristoforois my name for a trio of new fonts: two are reviving classic American-Victorian art nouveau metal types by Hermann Ihlenburg:Columbus(1892),Columbus Initials(upright swash capitals) and the italic companionAmerican Italic(1902) and American Italic Initials, while the third font is related symbols and stand-alone swashes that may be useful.You can see specimens of the source typefaceson my blog.UPDATE: Help me reach the stretch goal(s) of Greek support!Yes, the project was funded at $6400. The first stretch goal of $7,500 meant I’ll be adding support for Central European language support, Reaching $10,000 meant I will do Cyrillic as well.I was reluctant to add Greek, because Greek lowercase is challenging to do well. But I do like a challenge and it would be cool to have full pan-European language support. So here are the final stretch goals for Cristoforo and what I will add at each new pledge total!$10,750: Greek caps$12,000: Greek lowercase$13,000 full-on polytonic Greek (useful for scholars and pre-1982 book reprints)See the FAQ below for more details on the stretch goals.If this project looks familiar, it’s because I tried it on Kickstarter a month ago and only reached 60% of the target, meaning no funding at all happened. But I’m nothing if not tenacious, so I am trying again with newly reconfigured rewards, includingnew personal-use font licenses at $12, or $24 for all three fonts! Full commercial-use license for all three fonts with all their alternate glyphs and goodies remains at $48. Remember that regular commercial-quality fonts of this level run $30-$35 per font style (e.g. Adobe’s Pro fonts such as my own Hypatia Sans Pro), so a trio could cost you around $100.If you are not familiar with Kickstarter, scroll down to the FAQ and learn more about how it works.Columbus and American Italic were classic typefaces by a master craftsman.

Letters like “e” and “c” should dip slightly below the flat bottoms of other letters to look the same height, but they don’t... and as a result they look like they are floating a little higher than their neighbors.Although the logo has since been updated and modernized, the current version still shows the influence of the original letterforms.",

Fast forward to 2016 and there is an extreme lack of that. I WANT TO BRING THAT ART BACK TO YOUR EARS AND YOUR HEART.  My first single Siren, released 3 months ago, has managed to get 143,000 Listens on Spotify in over 50 different countries and 46,000 listens on Soundcloud. For a self-funded, non-promoted project, that's unheard of. I truly believe I have something special to bring to the world with my music, but in order to keep 100% creative freedom by not signing with a label, I need YOUR help to fund the rest of my EP.I’m Tanerélle and music is the love of my life. My roots are in Atlanta, but I moved to Los Angeles three years ago to make my dreams a reality.  I’ve always been infatuated with telling stories. I’ve been writing songs since I was eight years old.  Through my music, I’m able to bring people into my world for a bit. I can paint the colors of a sunset or draw the pain of heartbreak with just my words.Music ties everything together. It’s my passion and I want to spend my life creating it for others to enjoy. Almost a year ago I graduated with my BFA in acting, turned 21 and decided to record my first single Siren.The amount of love and support I've received from all over the world makes me feel like the luckiest girl. I can't believe someone else besides my mom is playing my song on repeat. The only thing that tears me up is that everyone is asking for more music and visuals and being an independent artist; theres no label to front the cost of recording, mixing, mastering, photography, visuals, promotion, etc. It's all me, all on my own. I Need YOUR Help. I want to give you your 2016 summer anthems that you can play on repeat while getting ready, riding around town, singing in your mirror, ALL OF IT! You tell me you want more music.

Also, If we can raise more than the 25K I'll use that to start working on the next E.P. (which is already written), hire a publicist and start a fund to get into some festivals so I can actually meet all you lovely people that are everyday with each listen making my dreams come true. But lets start with the main goal for now :)Some E.P. tidbits-The genres my music would fall under is indie pop, trip hop, indietronica and dream pop..

With water scarcity increasing due to climate change, pollution and human population growth, it is evident our relationship to water must change. The purpose of this exhibition is to inspire that change.This opportunity for an exhibitionwas commissioned by the TORONTO 2015 arts and culture festival PANAMANIA, presented by CIBC. PANAMANIA will represent Toronto’s best in arts and culture to the world during the TORONTO 2015 Pan Am / Parapan Am Games.Although the commission was generous, it did not meet the full amount required to complete this expanding project. I'm requesting your support and that of the Kickstarter community to help meet this goal.The workis a conceptual series capturing our dependence on water ethically and ecologically. It raises questions about our connection to help us re-envision that relationshipfrom that of a commodity to an essential part of life. It will look beneath the surface into the deeper currents of our understanding about it and in this way begin healing our relationship with it.Ihave been working diligently on this for over a year and am dedicated to thequality of the work and the importance of its message. This project has involved research, relationship building with Indigenous communities, collaborations with other artists, extensive location scouting, becoming PADI certified, familiarizing with freshwater diving, production of underwater shoots and of the actual exhibit.For this project, I am collaborating with indigenous artists and teachers to understand how other cultures view water. Relationship building with Indigenous communities has been very important as we learn to work together and protect our water.A portion of sales from the exhibit will be donated to The Mother Earth Water Walk.http://www.motherearthwaterwalk.com/We are living in a time in history where our high consumption, abuse and lack of water conservation is leading to a future without water. Our awareness and action towards a more sustainable life will help us overcome this crisis. This project will help bring that awareness to an international audience during theTORONTO 2015 Games.The message of this project affects us all and I'd love to hear what you have to say!As indicated in rewards 9, 10 and 11 you will have the opportunity to be filmed and talk about your personal experiences with water. This footage will be shown as part of the exhibition and you will receive your own copy.Follow behind the scenes oninstagramor mypersonalaccountI’ve shot the work predominantlywithin the Georgian Bay area to explore the primordial necessity of our freshwater and to stay connected with what’s in our own backyard in southernOntario. I'm halfway through the shooting process and will complete them at the end of December. All of the travel and production costs are accounted for in these. After the shoots are complete, I will be begin the editing and printing process along with designing promotional materials.Check out more behind the scenes images of my shoot inTobermoryTheconfirmed location of the exhibit is in the Allen Lambert Galleria inBrookfield Place downtown Toronto. It's a dream come true!It hostssome of North America’s most prominent exhibitions, art installations, andspecial events. It’s 85 feet high inside and 360 feet long, so the scale of mywork has to be large in order to fill the space. There are 350,000 people who pass through thegalleria per year. The exhibit will be shown for the length of the games from the 13thof July to August 16 2015. There will be an opening reception, which you areall invited to. The date is to be determined, but will be posted on my website. If the campaign is successful, I would love to meet you and thank you in person.PhotographyinstallationThe layoutof the photo exhibit plays an integral role in bringing the viewer into thestory. It consists of four to eight photo displays spanning 15 feet in widthand ten feet in height. The images will be printed on fabric and a custom metalframe for each one is being built.VideoinstallationThe videoconsists of a two-channel moving-image installation. The monitors arepositioned back to back, one playing on a loop and the other playing footage ofinterviewed collaborators who will include public figures, global environmental activists and Indigenous leaders.There arevery high costs associated with shooting underwater and creating an exhibitionof this magnitude. The remaining printing costs are where I need the most help.1)Printing costs:$13,786– The photo installations are very large and are printed doublesided in order to fill the space and create impact. This comes with a highcost. Each 10’x 15’ fabric panel is $3,000 x 4 = $12,000, plus shipping $200.00,plus tax $1,586.If enough money is raised past the goal, I will be creating additional panels, which the venue is requesting.2.Production costs:$3,500– There are many collaborators helping bring this project toreality and their labour and talents require compensation. In the next phase ofthis project, I will require some help with film editing, administrative andproduction support.3.Self-Promotion:$2, 500– Although the Panam Games and Brookfield Place will beproviding some promotion to the project, I’m responsible for my own website,business cards, printing of flyers and brochures.*Please note regarding prints*  Since the exhibition is seven months away, prints from Sacred Water will only be available once the exhibit launches in July of 2015. If you would prefer a more immediate reward for your donation, you can choose prints from my past work on my website. The estimated delivery of these prints would be February, 2015. As a supporter, you will also receive a Sacred Water eNewsletter with a first look as the project progresses containing highlights from shoots and behind the scenes footage.You’ll benefit from the sponsor rewards listed here, but you’ll also be a part of something literally very big-10 by 15 foot panels in Brookfield Place at the TORONTO 2015 Games!My goal is to have the exhibit travel across North America to reach as many people as possible.

I've been working on Requiem of Water for over a year and a half and am in the final stages of its creation.The support of this Kickstarter will cover the remaining costs of this exhibition that shares an important message about water.The mission of this campaign is to raise the remaining funds I was unable to acquire through corporate sponsorship or other monetary support to finish this project. Remaining costs include, printing, production, promotion and costs associated with the opening night reception. Deadlines are quickly approaching, so your support is most appreciated and vital to bringing this project to its highest level of potential.In return for your generosity, I've included amazing rewards of limited edition prints, rare custom photoshoots and options for you to participate in the exhibition that will be seen by thousands during the Toronto 2015 Pan Am/Parapan Am Games. Requiem of Water is a large-scale photography and video exhibition commissioned by the TORONTO 2015 Arts and Culture Festival, PANAMANIA. PANAMANIA will represent the best in arts and culture to the world during the TORONTO 2015 Pan Am/Parapan Am Games. The exhibition will be on display from July 13 to August 14, 2015.Requiem of Wateris a conceptual and narrative series capturing our dependence on water. With water scarcity increasing due to climate change, pollution and human population growth, it is evident our relationship to water must change. The purpose of this exhibition is to inspire that change.This project has involved over a year of research and location scouting, diving in the Great Lakes and abroad, working withother artists and collaborating with Indigenous teachers and creatives tounderstand how other cultures view water. Relationship building with Indigenouscommunities has been a very important part of this project as we work together to protect our water.Having exposure on an international platform is an incredible opportunity personally, but also a great way to start a conversation about the importance of water. The goal is to have the exhibition travel across North America after its presentation in Toronto. I'm teaming up with like-minded organizations like The Great Lakes Commonsand the Mother Earth Water Walkto promote the importance of our freshwaters.A portion of sales from the exhibit will also be donated to The Mother Earth Water Walk.http://www.motherearthwaterwalk.com/to support their efforts in protecting the water.The confirmed location of the exhibit is in theAllen Lambert Galleriain Brookfield Place downtown Toronto. It's a dream come true!It hosts some of North America’s most prominent exhibitions, art installations, and special events. It's a high traffic area where the exhibit will be exposed to thousands of people.Although the commission was generous, it did not meet the full amount required to complete this project.It has also evolved into a much bigger project than when it began over a year and a half ago. Originally, the exhibition was designed to be shown in a gallery, but the opportunity of showing it in Brookfield Place became a reality. This is an amazing opportunity, but because it's a very large public space, I have unanticipated costs.(Printing larger pieces, additional production, insurance, storing of artwork in 4'x4' skids, shipping, metal frames made out of aluminum and steel for security, barriers for opening night reception, clean up crew etc.)2) Printing costs of the exhibition– The photo installations are very large (6' x 15') and are printed double sided in order to fit the requirements of filling the space at the venue. This comes with a very high cost. 3) Production costs - Test prints, van rentals, delivery fees, storage, installation etc.4) Self-Promotion -Although PANAMANIA and Brookfield Place will be providing some promotion for the project, I’m responsible for my own website, business cards, printing of flyers and brochures.5) Opening night reception - It's my responsibility to cover all costs associated with the opening night reception. I'm doing my best to find food and alcohol sponsors, but because it isn't a conventional gallery space, I have to spend money to section off the area, provide audio, a bar area etc. LIMITED EDITION PRINTS - Choose your print(s) from these 18 images below for print rewards. I am still editing the project, so these prints are newly released and only available to the public through this Kickstarter prior to the exhibition opening in July, 2015.

Over the past months I have been commissioned to do a lot of watercolour paintings. The process and being able to paint something for a specific reason is truly the best. However, there are also lots of people asking for a print of some of my past works.So thats the reason why Iam hoping to investing in a Good quality photo Inkjet printer which will allow me to continue producing small batch customized art prints beyond this project! In return, I will work with each one of you to produce a customized silly animal print in the style shown below!The reason being that most of them require a large quantity to be ordered at a time, which then I won't be able to produce many different styles of art prints at once.I hand drawn these fun animals in the full set of alphabets. Using these as the template, I'll scan and adjust them into different sizes and design for digital downloads and the prints. The prints will be on Premium Matte Paper printed with professional quality ink (Which can last approximately 200 years with protection!)and then hand cut by me.The examples shown here says ""Crazy PLANT Lady"", with the word PLANT being spelled out by silly looking cats and dogs illustrations.

https://www.kickstarter.com/projects/spoonybardprod/eskimo-bob-series-reboot?ref=discovery_category_newest,spoonybardprod/eskimo-bob-series-reboot,"Eskimo Bob was one of the first big Flash cartoon series to hit the internet back in 2001. It found an audience through its memorable characters, unique humor, and atmosphere heavily inspired by retro cartoons and video games. There are 57 short episodes viewable online at EskimoBob.com, but we feel we have a lot more stories to tell.The two main characters in Eskimo Bob are Bob and Alfonzo. Bob is a nearly mute character, speaking mostly in grunts and burps. At the same time, he’s probably the most intelligent character in the show, letting everything happen around him before finally stepping in to solve a problem.Alfonzo is Bob’s best friend. He’s the instigator to a lot of events in the show, like bothering the local wildlife or going on some wild goose chase. While Bob is a lot more laid back and relaxed, Alfonzo is a lot more restless, and always looking for something to do.Bob and Alfonzo are surrounded by a cast of characters including the Walrus, the Seal, and the Fish in a Spaceship, voiced by Phelan Porteous. The series also has a large roster of villains, including Yuck, the Penguin, and the Yeti.Back in 2001, Eskimo Bob caught on quickly through websites like Newgrounds. Alan and I were still teenagers at the time.I love hearing from people who are now adults who have all these great memories of watching Eskimo Bob when they were in junior high and high school.We’re hoping that we can do a high-quality series reboot with better art, animation, and stories than we’ve ever done before. We would like to raise $8000 to support the development of a new 10 minute episode that will be split into two parts and released online over the next year. If the response is good enough, we may try shopping this new episode to TV networks as a pilot. Our dream, and the dream of a lot of our fans, has always been to see Eskimo Bob on TV. Even if this can’t happen, we would still love to see Bob and Alfonzo live on. Any money raised above the $8000 goal will go towards developing even more new episodes. We’d love to take Eskimo Bob to a whole new level of greatness, but we really need your help to make it a reality. Donate, tell your friends, and get the word out there. Only you can make this happen.","This is the first major redesign of Eskimo Bob in 13 years. We hope that the new character designs and style remain true to the spirit of the original, and are something that fans both new and old will appreciate. The is also the first time we've asked fans to fund development of an episode. What we're making isn't just another short 1-2 minute Flash video. We are striving to make an actual broadcast-quality animated cartoon.We realize that if we pitch this idea there is no guarantee we will see Eskimo Bob on TV, but we want to make something that we can be proud of and that all of our fans can enjoy.",https://www.kickstarter.com/projects/spoonybardprod/eskimo-bob-for-the-nes?ref=discovery_category_newest,spoonybardprod/eskimo-bob-for-the-nes,"Eskimo Bob for the NES is an arcade-style puzzle-platformer with 64 levels, 15 enemy types, two playable characters, two support characters, and a fully functional password system allowing you to save your progress the good old-fashioned way.The initial Eskimo Bob Kickstarter goal has been reached! Thanks to everyone who made this happen. I can't tell you how much I appreciate this.Stretch Goal #1 - $10,000 CAD - Instruction Manual Mini-Comic - METStretch Goal #2 - $15,000 CAD - Enhanced PC Version - METStretch Goal #3 - $20,000 CAD - A New Eskimo Bob EpisodeIf the campaign hits a goal of $20,000, a new episode of Eskimo Bob will be made in the classic style of the old episodes. The episode will be an animated version of the comic included in the game's instruction manual.Eskimo Bob is a series of Flash cartoons that was popular on Newgrounds in the early 2000s. It's a series that has always had a special place in my heart, because I'm one of the guys who made it! Anyone familiar with Eskimo Bob knows that the series was filled with references to the classic Nintendo games of my childhood, and making an Eskimo Bob game for the NES has always been a dream of mine. Well, now that dream has become a reality. As one of the creators of Eskimo Bob, I wanted to be sure that this game would be true to the spirit of the original series instead of feeling like a retread of an existing NES franchise. Bob ends each level with a huge burp, Alfonzo pokes things with his stick, the fish in a spaceship grabs you with his claw, and Maurice the pigeon poops on your head. Every gameplay mechanic was designed to feel familiar and natural to both fans of the original series and newcomers alike.The primary goal of this campaign is to release Eskimo Bob on a physical cartridge. The standard version of this game will be available on a classic-style grey NES cartridge. For the duration of the Kickstarter campaign, I will also be offering a special white cartridge. This version of the game will not be available after the Kickstarter is over, so grab it while you still can!Each physical copy of the game will include a 20-page manual containing a mini-comic detailing a backstory for the game, as well as the standard information on game controls and enemies. The goal of each level is to collect all of the fish. In order to do this, you have two playable characters, Bob and Alfonzo.Bob and Alfonzo control very similarly, but have slight differences in their abilities. Bob has greater mobility due to having more powerful jump, but Alfonzo has the advantage of using his stick to poke things. You will need to use both of them in different situations throughout the game in order to get through each level.You start every level using Bob. If you want to switch to Alfonzo, you’ll need to find an igloo. Entering the igloo will allow you to switch characters and use Alfonzo. If you’d like to go back to using Bob, just go back into the igloo as Alfonzo.  The game is filled with plenty of enemies, as well as a few friends. For example, the walrus can be used as a platform to help you reach a place where you couldn't normally jump, and the fish in a spaceship can carry you around with his claw.If you would like to try playing the first few levels in the game, you can play the demo right here!Eskimo Bob was developed with the NES in mind as the primary platform. However, I will also be porting the game to PC and providing all backers with a digital copy.The PC version of Eskimo Bob will optimized for modern systems instead of simply being an emulated ROM of the NES version. It will include features not available on the cartridge such as remappable controls, an in-game instruction manual, and the ability to save your game progress. The core experience of the game will be unchanged, however, remaining 100% true to the NES version.Tomas Guinan has been a lifelong fan of the Nintendo Entertainment System. Back in the late 90s and early 2000s, Tomas was heavily active in the NES ROM hacking and translation scene, producing complete English translations for various Japanese games including The Glory of Heracles 2, Mitsume Ga Tooru, and Keroppi's Great Big Adventure 2. His interests then shifted to animation, releasing the first episode of Eskimo Bob in 2001. It was inevitable that these two threads of interest would eventually converge one day.Programming and level design for the game are complete. The game has been extensively tested on original NES hardware as well as a few clone systems such as the RetroUSB AVS and Retro Duo. Unfortunately, the game does not work on emulation-based systems like the Retron 5.Thanks for checking out my project! I hope to have your support.","The game is already completely programmed, so there is no risk from a development standpoint. However, producing NES cartridges is not cheap, and the overhead costs are prohibitive to me on my own.I have already been in contact with suppliers for raw materials such as circuit boards, cartridges shells, and printed materials, and I have a good estimate of what it would cost in order for me to produce a small production run. I have a working prototype using the same type of circuit board which will be used in the final product.Based on other projects similar to this, I believe a January 2018 deadline is realistic. However, this will be the first production run of an NES cart that I have ever done, so it is possible that the estimated delivery time may change depending on the number of carts that need to be made. If there are any delays, all backers will be notified of the situation immediately, and carts will be shipped as soon as possible."

Each  animal, bird, and even every last insect within GeMuEn's open, detailed world is a musical instrument.  Their responses to each other and the player determine the nature of the ever-changing music.The videos below demonstrate the 2.0 version of the GeMuEn engine. Two more improved versions are anticipated, before final release. This unique approach to sound design was inspired by techniques developed by modernist composers such as John Cage, Karlheinz Stockhausen, Steve Reich, and Phillip Glass, as well as the popular musician Brian Eno and pioneering groups such as Throbbing Gristle (inventors of the ""Industrial"" music genre.)Procedural musical apps have been on the market for years- but none currently available come close to the complexity, structure, and variety of music that will be offered by GeMuEn.This is accomplished using a proprietary music engine. Below is an extreme simplification of the principles at work:Essentially: as stated above, the ""musicians"" are the various animals, insects, and birds who call this world home. Their motions are governed by a series of simple flocking AIs. As the AIs meet, they will interact, causing the musical elements and sequences to be triggered. As their motions are determined by dozens of external factors, their triggers will differ, each time they meet.As the GeMuEn engine will initially draw upon hours of audio assets, the possible permutations range in the millions, ensuring that users will never hear the same music, twice.Users, of course, will be able to record their own musical experiences, to share with friends and familyCurrently, virtual musical instruments are in the initial stages of design, which will allow the user to add their own sounds to the mix..GeMuEn features a large, open world consisting of three islands- each with their own pace and style of music.The Violet Island features a fanciful alien landscape, and music at 135 BPM. The Green Island is a calmer and more contemplative 90BPM. The yellow island is the home of ambient music generated at 45 BPM.Care has been taken to create a serene, opening environment, lush with detail, light, and hidden, comforting nooks where the user can enjoy the music, as it passes by. Flocks of birds butterflies fill the air as mice scamper underfoot. Foxes dance, tigers prowl- each adding their presence and contribution to the user's musical experience.In between the islands are three smaller islets where one can relax, enjoy the serene landscape, and listen to waves lap at the shore as deep, ambient drones reverberate above. The world features a full day/night cycle, weather, sandstorms, deserts, forests, and winding paths that invite the user onward to discover more musical vistas.This is a world one will want to visit, and listen to again and again.10K OVERSHOOT: Development of mobile versions for iOS and Android would follow, allowing users to take their music with them.20K OVERSHOOT: Allows development of a VR version of GeMuEn, allowing users to fully experience the 3d, environmental qualities of their personal music.Get on the email list for updates, screenshots, and news! Also: here are five hi-res GeMuEn wallpapers!Thanks- you're gonna get a lot of email and pictures from us, plus five wallpapers... Nah- let's make that ten wallpapers!  You will also get a mention in the game credits.You get all of the above, PLUS: you get to test out our beta!You're on our email list, you're gonna be just BURIED in wallpapers, you get to test the beta, AND you get a copy of GeMuEn, when released!You're on our email list, you're gonna be just BURIED in wallpapers, you get to test the beta, and you'll be wearing a pristine GeMuEn t-shirt, when you boot up your complimentary copy of  GeMuEn.All the above,and our t-shirt's gonna feel nice and comfy while you're thumbing through a digital book featuring the art and technology that went into making GeMuEn!While you're clearing out room in your closet for that t-shirt, make sure you have room in your bookshelf for a hardcopy of the GeMuEn book!The three islands of GeMuEn will be named in honor of the first three people who donate, at this level.  Subsequent donors at this level will be able to name other significant in-world objects, such as lighthouses and gazebos.The first one to donate at this level will receive, upon the release of GeMuEn, the 200-page hardcover sketchbook containing every last original sketch, note, and scribble that was made in the production of the game. You will see the original schizophrenic, frantic sketches of the GeMuEn musical engine- the pencil and pen sketches that defined this world on every level. Plus, hundreds upon hundreds of other pieces of original art, plus a good fart joke or two scribbled in the margins.  The Central Ocean of GeMuEn will also be named in their honor.Subsequent donors at this level will receive original sculptures, by the creator.He has worked as an illustrator and colorist for numerous publishers, including ""High Times"" Magazine.He worked for Atari as an animator in the late 80's, pulling 80-hour shifts to produce the ""Batman Returns"" videogame for the LYNX.He worked as a librarian for Fantagraphics books, and a security guard for Wal-Mart. His video work has graced the jumbotrons of Times Square in New York no less than three times.  Unfortunately, he never had the chance to see them in person- only on TV.In 2003, he started a multimedia political website, ""Bushflash.com"" which led to him being cited as the ""Inventor of the 'Do-It-Yourself Attack Ad' by the New York Times.  He was invited to speak at the JFK School of government twice, and sat in the very same chair that Jon Stewart did the day after he had called Tucker Carlson a ""dick.""He has also been a staffer for two presidential campaigns, produced his own currency, ran a short-lived podcast, and has been actually stranded on an island- twice.This is his first musical work.","RISK: This ""Blumrich"" guy admits that he's not a musician- how dare he presume he can create a work like this?HOW TO OVERCOME:  I've been developing this concept in various forms for over 20 years.  The GeMuEn engine now exists, and will only be refined, should it be given the funding and time required.  As far as quality of product goes, in the words of Oscar Wilde: ""I might not know 'Art', but I know what I like.""  I have been a studious music gourmand since I picked up my first ""Kronos Quartet"" cassette tape at the age of 16.I'm now 46.I know what I'm doing.RISK: A VERY small current staff of two.HOW TO OVERCOME: Where some see disadvantage, I see advantage. The vast majority of the design and building of the GeMuEn world was completed in such a short time because two people can focus on a single job, far better than a staff of ten can tackle three jobs or more. I have been in many offices where the most man-hours were wasted, simply trying to keep a large staff all on the same page- mostly in vain.As production moves forward, independent agents will be hired on a per-job basis to assist with scripting, additional art, and writing. This will be to ensure that we're not spending our meager funding on paying contractors for ""down time.""Emphasis will be placed on hiring talented local people, right here in Maine.",https://www.kickstarter.com/projects/1919560960/peace-island-demo?ref=discovery_category_newest,1919560960/peace-island-demo,"Peace Island is a open-world, story-driven adventure game set on a remote Maine island community.The story - a mix of science fiction, alternative history, and mystery - unfolds from the perspective of the nine cats who call the island home, when they wake up to find their human companions gone.Peace Island is an interactive story-driven experience which will focus on discovery and exploration, rather than combat. The player has the opportunity to experience multiple divergent storylines, as they approach the ultimate decision: “Are the humans worth bringing back?”At the start of the game, the world's your CheezBurger - relax in the sun, explore - but be sure to keep your stomach filled!TREAD CAREFULLY:Some of the other animals you meet on the island might not be as welcoming as you would like- gain their confidence to unlock new side quests, and ensure safe passage through their lands.FORGET ABOUT CHASING MICE:There's an invasive, destructive species on the island that needs to be contained, but also just might be the key to everyone's survival.INFILTRATE: Gain entrance to dozens of buildings, to uncover the secrets of Peace Island. Some buildings are easier to get into, than others.There are dozens of unique, hand-crafted interiors, loaded with detail, side quests, and clues that might help you along the way.  EXPLORE:A huge persistent game world so teeming with life and important stuff to do, you have no need of, nor interest in Fast Travel.DISCOVER:The secrets of the humans, through the documents and artifacts left behind. A unique, alternate-history timeline covering over 200 years.COOPERATE:Gain the confidence of the other animals on Peace Island - it's good to have friends, in tough times.All nine cats must work together to secure a future for themselves, and their world.STARE AT WALLS:When you've got nine cats with a lot to do, how better to coordinate their efforts than setting up a point-to-point portal network?When the conditions are right, any two of the cats on Peace Island will be able to trigger a shortcut through which their companions can pass.However- only one cat can pass through his own portals.NOTE: This is a feature that is currently in alpha, hence the awful screenshots.Peace Island is also a personal homage to the beauty of Maine Islands, and to the cats who I have been lucky enough to meet and share my life with.Elizabeth hasn’t had the best of days. It began with being gently shoved into the big plastic box that usually meant a trip to the doctor. She made her opinion about the situation well known as she was carried away.The anticipated pokes and prods never materialized, thankfully enough, but it was loud, and bright, and noisy outside of her tiny confines. Fortunately, the box was lined with her favorite blanket. Her occasional protestations were met with a steady stream of reassuring murmurs, and generous treats shoved in-between the shiny bars of her temporary prison.The ever-changing tableau of alien color and shape outside faded as a grudging sleep overcame her. She was with her human, after all. As long as they were together, she knew she was safe.When she awoke some time later, the door to her cage was open. Any fear of the unfamiliar was banished, when she caught the scent of fresh food, just beyond her confines. Yet- the apartment she finds herself in is silent.Her human is nowhere to be found, and the unfamiliar sight of an open door beckons. She would rather stay inside, but she can hear the cries of one of her kind, just outside. Thus begins the story of “Peace Island.” A mix of Science Fiction, Alternate History, and Mystery. As Elizabeth emerges into the world beyond, she learns about her new home, the other cats on the island, and the now-departed human residents.Her journey will take her and her companions to the furthest reaches of the island, as they work to ensure their own survival, and decide the fate of humanity itself.Peace Island will feature a large game world- including four distinct communities, woodlands, scenic coastlines, secluded farmlands, crumbling WW2 ruins, and much, much more.The vast majority of the island’s 50-plus structures will be accessible, as well - including homes, studios, offices, abandoned factories, victorian-era mansions, and no less than three museums.There is a local public radio station, as well as a newspaper that served the Island’s erstwhile 100 year-round residents.Care is being taken to accurately depict the architecture and atmosphere that is unique to island life in Maine- right down to the schoolhouse (Inspired by the Cliff Island schoolhouse- one of the few remaining one-room schools in the United States.)Created using the Unity game engine, Peace Island will feature realistic weather, day/night cycles, and dynamic, interactive fauna, including deer, mice, flocks of birds, and even insects.Emphasis is being placed on aesthetics- Peace Island will be a place  you will want to visit time and again!Over the course of the game, the player will take control of each of the nine cats who call Peace Island home.  Each has their own unique personality, strengths, weaknesses, and their own role to play.Once a cat has been unlocked, the player can return to him/her at will, or as the story requires.Peace Island will feature an immersive, atmospheric soundtrack featuring the works of composer Kyle Preston, who provided the music for Time Magazine's 2015 game of the year ""Prune""The previous Kickstarter for Peace Island might have not reached its goal, but it attracted tremendous media coverage from all over the internet, and the world, including print and TV.Check it out:HARDCOREGAMER.COM: ""All the people are gone, which might be a serious problem for dogs but merely a point of interest for the average cat.""WSCH-TV:""Maine-developed video game is based on Peaks Island""WJBQ:""'Myst' meets 'Secret Life of Pets'""BANGOR DAILY NEWS:""...Aparadigm buster, one that eschews the common rock-em-sock-em combat play in favor of “discovery … and exploration.”AUTOMATON.AM: ""Ask(s) an animal's view about how a pet and a person should be""WCYY:""Maine has been a popular setting in books, movies and television shows, it hasn't exactly been a hotspot for video games. But a Redditor took to sharing some screenshots of a game they are creating, and it looks absolutely sick.""As you can see, the receptionhas been universally positive - I believe this indicates that there's a very good future audience for Peace Island.Peace Island is a game every bit as independent as the state in which it is being created.  For the first six months of its development, it was only me, and my friend Laura working on the game:Eric Blumrich: Writing / environment design / scripting / 3d modelling / interior design / graphic designLaura Mackey: Writing / conceptual design / 3d modellingScotty Arsenault:  Graphic design / conceptual design / illustrationJoão Baltieri: Character design / animation  Alex Kostas: Scripting/interactivityJose Calderon: Writing / conceptual designAt every tier of support, you will gain access to cool stuff:Exclusive daily dev news and content.Your name will appear in the game credits, and you get immediate access to the Peace Island alpha.This will be a first, external ""warts and all"" version, as it exists at the time of the end of this Kickstarter.

You will also receive a certificate guaranteeing you a copy of the full version of Peace Island, when released (Estimated release is 2/20 - one year after beta demo release.)You will also get a signed and numbered ""Cats of Peace Island"" print by the talented Scotty Arsenault, whose work appears throughout the game.At the ""Founder"" level, your name (or a name of your choosing) will be added to a plaque adorning ""Founder's Rock,"" and will be woven into the story of the gameWhen you pledge at the ""Omniseer"" level, you get everything listed above, plus:During your travels around Peace Island, you will find, at the end of a shady, worn trail, land set aside in perpetuity by the Island's founders as a place to commemorate extraordinary pets.At this pledge level, you can claim a marker to commemorate a departed friend, whether it be a cat, ferret, or even a dog.  The garden itself is shaped as a heart, and will be an important location in the story of Peace Island.  I will work with the people who pledge at this level to ensure respectful treatment of their memorial.I want to be able to produce a full, playable proof-of-concept beta demo by late February, 2019 .The initial goal is to release the demo on PC, as Peace Island is being developed on that particular OS.If, as detailed below, this Kickstarter campaign reaches a stretch goal of $10,000, an alpha and beta demo for mac will be released, concurrently with the PC version.I realize that a lot of folks out there are hesitant to throw their support behind an unknown quantity such as myself, no matter how appealing the project might be.After all, aside from an iOS ""Game for cats,"" I have never independently published a video game, much less anything of this size and scope.I understand that you work hard for the money that you pledge to folks like me, and don't want to get burnt by yet another upstart who promises far more than he can deliver.In setting, as my main goal, the creation of a proof-of-concept demo of Peace Island, I will have the opportunity to prove that I can deliver a product as promised, within budget, and on-time.That will lay the groundwork for the development of the game, as a whole.- Full access to the open world of Peace Island- One interior- Elizabeth, the first cat- A rich soundtrack- ""Sneaking"" minigame- Full access to the open world of Peace Island- Ten interiors- The first three cats - Elizabeth, Sushi, and Boy- Intro quests- Dozens of artifacts- A rich soundtrack- ""Hunting"" and ""Sneaking"" minigames- An extensive introduction to the story of Peace IslandIf I am able to reach $10,000 in pledges on this Kickstarter campaign, I will be able to acquire the equipment and talent to release concurrent alpha & beta demos for the Mac, as well as the PC.If I am able to reach $12,500 in pledges, I can quit my dayjob entirely, and pursue this project, full-time. This means a better-looking, smoother-running, and more immersive demo!$15,000 in pledges ensures two months of runway after the demo's release to push ahead with development of the full game.Here is an initial outline:Obsessive financial records will be kept, and will be available to all contributors.Environment external: 100%Environment internal: 100%For the purposes of the Peace Island beta demo, both the interior and exterior locations of Peace Island are ready for prime time.Character models: 50%Character animation: 75%My main challenge over the next few months is to round out the Player Character models, including fur shaders. Fortunately, I know a guy...NPC models: 75%NPC animation: 90%These are mostly background players, in terms of the demo. However, it will be good to have them as close to complete, for the eventual full version.Interactivity: 50%Just over half of the player's interactions with the world around them (Examine object, open door, eat, sleep, attack, etc...) have been integrated. However, some of the mini-games (such as sneaking around, hunting, etc) have yet to be fully scripted and integrated.Conversation engine: 75%The ability for the player to converse with other cats and animals on the island has been brought into the project, but not fully integrated into the demo, as of this writing.AI: 10%This is the one place where Peace Island requires rapid development. While the birds and insects move through the world and skies smoothly, the independent motion of deer, dogs, and even the other cats requires serious work, over the next six months.Overall, after 8 months of Solo work, Peace Island is 69% complete, towards a functional beta demo. With the external funding that this Kickstarter campaign provides, I believe it is well within the abilities of myself and those I work with to carry this project towards completion.Thanks so much for taking a moment out of your busy day to check out Peace Island. I hope you consider the project worth your patronage, over the next six months.","The greatest challenge I am facing in finishing this project is that I am currently working 40-hour weeks, and only have a few hours a day I can set aside for Peace Island development.Despite this, I have been able to bring together two-thirds of the game, within eight months.  If I am successful in this campaign, I will be able to double the amount of time I can spend on this project, and bring additional talent in to take a bit of the burden off of my shoulders.  Under such conditions, release of a beta demo by February  is a fully realistic goal."

The entire market for this type of fare is untouched in this area. My intent is to fulfill this need, with a restaurant built around the idea of an Italian family meal. The kind of food made by a grandmother in a little rustic kitchen on the outskirts of Sicily…and the food she then feeds to her family in a day-long procession of homemade dishes that somehow are never alike. I want to re-create for my customers, the passion in each dish and the love of feeding others spread onto each plate.With a small dining area, the quarters are close, but the atmosphere is perfect. The chef is accessible in the open kitchen layout, to chat with diners as their food is being prepared. In this manner, I will deliver a casual lunch atmosphere, served to anyone who walks in, as long as there is room. Being that it’s Athens, I can imagine if there aren’t vacant tables, a chair will be offered by any of the diners that are already seated but have an open spot at their table. Meals will be able to be served quickly, to accommodate for lunch schedules, as there will be only two choices each day, menu changes occurring weekly.Dinner service at the restaurant will be an event. Diners are invited to stay as long as they would like, enjoying course after course of elegantly presented dishes and socializing amongst themselves or with other diners. Depending on the customers visiting on a given night, I can see it becoming an entire room of laughter and talk, with tables being pushed together and it becoming one big dinner party. Other nights, it will be fairly quiet, with couples celebrating an evening out and preferring their own space to enjoy each other’s company. Currently, these types of customers compete for limited space in the few upscale options available in this area. I intend to give diners a five-star experience for their evening out. The price point is higher, making it imperative that the entire dining experience is unlike any other…perfectly planned and executed, from music and ambiance, to food and service.When my customers end their evening, I want them to be far more than satisfied with their experience, I want them to return.","For those of you who have been following, you have already witnessed the first of many obstacles (unsuccessful funding on the first try).

https://www.kickstarter.com/projects/statedclearly/teaching-evolution-with-animations-stated-clearly?ref=discovery_category_newest,statedclearly/teaching-evolution-with-animations-stated-clearly,"This project did not meet its goal but we are starting a new Kickstarter. Learn more at:--------------------------------------------------------------------------------OUR GOALAt StatedClearly.com we are creating 21 short animations which teach genetics and evolution to the greater public in simple friendly language. We have created 4 so far. The videos are on YouTube for everyone to watch and enjoy. See samples of our work below. Our videos are receiving hundreds of thousands of views, they have been featured by the Royal Institution of Great Britain, and by the Richard Dawkins Foundation.It costs us an average of $6,400 to create an animation. In this kickstarter we are raising a minimum of $27,000 to fund the next 3 animations, rewards and fees, and give us some extra money to publicize the videos. See details on how funding will be spent below.We hope to raise more. $115,000 would fund the entire 21 part series. These are the three animations we will create when our minimum $27,000 goal is met:People who back our project will receive awesome rewards like our ""Defender of science"" stickers and t-shirts with Charles Darwin riding Archaeopteryx.This document is a bit lengthy because we care about answering all your questions before you contribute. Below is an outline of topics covered here:Our mission is simple: to promote the art of critical thinking by exposing people from all walks of life, to the simple beauty of science.Our first video series covers the interrelated topics of Genetics and Evolution. We feel these are the most powerfully engaging subjects that can be studied and understood through the scientific process. They have huge potential to excite curiosity and help people develop analytical minds.Genetics and Evolution are two topics which are greatly misunderstood by the American public and the world. Genetics is often considered too complicated to bother studying, and Evolution is often rejected for perceived conflicts with personal beliefs. Both topics have been butchered by the media and popular culture which contributes to the public’s confusion.Our teachers need better tools for teaching evolution, and curious free learners need good online resources for evolution.We have discovered 3 main obstacles which stop people from learning about and accepting the concept of evolution:Our animations are designed to help people overcome these obstacles.Lack of interest in scienceOur videos are accurate and thorough as well as being short, colorful and entertaining. They are designed to catch the eye and hold attention of the viewer. Our target audience is students in middle school and high school, although our currently published videos are being used by people of all ages.Difficulty understandingAnimations can show people how the concepts within the theory of evolution function. We are able to demonstrate ideas in a way that no textbook or chalkboard lecture could ever accomplish.Our scripts are written at about a 6th grade reading level so we can reach people of all educational backgrounds.We have found that trying to remember new vocabulary words is distracting for students when listening to a lecture, reading, or watching a video. Because of this, we never introduce more than 3 new words during any video, and every time these words are used in the video (or in future videos) they are written out on screen and accompanied by a picture to remind students what we're talking about.Some take offense to evolutionEvolution has been controversial since it was first popularized by Charles Darwin. Some are offended by the fact that humans are related to other animals. Others are offended by perceived conflicts with religious beliefs. The Theory of Evolution, even though it says nothing directly about God or religion, is strongly associated with Atheism in pop-culture. Our videos use language that is friendly and religiously neutral without jeopardizing the science.The friendly nature of our videos makes them easy for everyone to watch. The religiously neutral language makes them easier to watch for people of different religious backgrounds who might be concerned by the implications of science on their faith.Neutrality also permits our videos to be freely used in public classrooms with a mixed audience.Our videos are mainly being used by individuals who are interested in learning during free time and we have received an increasing number of reports from teachers who use our materials in the classroom. Our videos are being used as homework and lecture aids in middle school, high school, and even college classrooms around the world. Our videos have been featured by the Royal Institution of Great Britain, and by the Richard Dawkins Foundation.Our minimal goal for this fundraiser is $27,000.$19,200 of that will go to labor (research, writing, animation, sound, editing)$2,000 will go to promoting the videos on YouTube after they are published.$3,100 is designated for the special rewards that go to our awesome Kickstarter backers. $2,700 will be used to pay KickStarter and transaction fees. Since launching our first video in 2011, we’ve received the following comments on Facebook and YouTube without any promotion or testimonial requests on our part.Excellent. I'm going to use this in my 6th grade class tomorrow to prep them for a strawberry DNA extraction experiment the following day. I even made a worksheet using screenshots from your fantastic video. Keep up the superb work.-abeechr (comment on the “What is DNA” video)I just saw your videos on evolution theory and natural selection for the first time - they're fantastic! I've never seen these concepts explained so well before-Kate My 10 year old daughter just watched all 3 of your videos - completely focused! After the Evolution video, she started explaining genetic engineering to me.-Linda PetersonI LOVE THIS CHANNEL!!!! You literally just saved me for my Bio test coming up. Thank you so much for making such an awesome channel!!!-Adrian SullivanYour videos are amazing. Thank you so much for making and posting these. I teach middle school life science and have Flipped my curriculum this year. Your videos are some of the best I have seen-Tracy McCabeThank you for the wonderful videos! Explaining evolution to my younger sibling in such a simple clear way is something I was having trouble with but with the illustrations on the videos he gets it. Thanks again!-Mariana TrejoThese videos are fantastic! Please keep making more. I'm a new science teacher, and it's so hard to find simple videos to help my students to understand these complex topics that don't put them to sleep!-mkrspillnaceWith the dearth of approachable, engaging science information out there (Neil deGrasse Tyson can't be everywhere!), you all have put together videos and information that can even keep the attention of my 10 year old girl (not easy, trust me). I will be telling people about you, that's for sure.-Linda PetersonI'm a Biology teacher and I think this video is AMAZING! Clear and concise, not too fast and not too slow, great looking animation and great vibrant colors. Definitely a ""go to"" video to supplement my teaching. I have already passed this on to several other teachers.-polahsmartell (comment on the “What is DNA” video)We used this in school for learning about DNA, same with your genes video. Thanks so much for making us understand better, you rock!-Josef Andersson EngmanToday my chemistry class watched this and it got a standing ovation from us. well done!-Finoa D’ Souza (comment on the “What is DNA” video)","Our goal is to have the three planned videos published by the end of April 2014. Our past videos have each taken roughly one month to complete, although the peer review process can delay script approval. We will strive to keep a steady pace.In an effort for transparency, progress will be posted on our Facebook page (https://www.facebook.com/StatedClearly) and here in Kickstarter as we continue the process. Script excerpts and screen shots of the videos will give insight into exactly what stage of the project we are working on.",https://www.kickstarter.com/projects/statedclearly/defend-evolution-with-clear-friendly-instruction?ref=discovery_category_newest,statedclearly/defend-evolution-with-clear-friendly-instruction,"We have successfully funded our first video but need continued support to fund the other three. You can help by contributing financially if you are able, and by spreading the word by sharing this project with everyone you know!Funding Goals:ThanksJonThe theory of biological evolution is the foundational concept of biology. It helps us understand why living things are they way they are, and how it is that they change and adapt over time. Discussions on the topic often blow up into fiery debates with people on both sides resorting to personal attacks. At StatedClearly.com we are creating tools which you can use to talk about and defend the science of evolution with clear friendly instruction.Stated Clearly is a group of artists, scientists, and educators who have come together to create a series of short animations teaching genetics and evolution in a simple, friendly manner. You can easily share these videos with others to promote healthy conversation. Our videos are: We have produced 5 animations so far. They have been used as teaching tools by the Royal Institution of Great Britain, the Richard Dawkins Foundation, and NASA's Center for Chemical Evolution. They are used in middle school, high school, and college classrooms. They are being shared between friends all around the globe through e-mail, Facebook, and Twitter.We have 15 more videos which need funding to be created. The purpose of this Kickstarter is to raise the funds we need to create the next 4 animations:What is the evidence for evolution?This animation outlines the main groups of evidence for evolution (comparative anatomy, the fossil record, embryology, and so on) and uses the example of whale evolution—from land to sea—to show how evidence from multiple groups is used together to understand the past. How do new species evolve?This animation touches on the various working definitions of a “species” and shows viewers what kinds of events and pressures cause a population to diverge into two species. What is the speed of evolution?This animation discusses the gradual process of evolution and talks about the true meaning of “Punctuated Equilibrium”, a concept which is often misunderstood.How does new genetic information evolve?There are 5 known natural mechanisms which can produce new genes. This animation discusses them in plain language and takes a look at the evolution of snake venom to see how these processes work. Our creative team consists of artist Jon Perry who founded the group, Jeremiah Deasey of Upheaval Design, Anthony Danzl of Proof Avenue records, and Rosemary Mosco of Bird and Moon Comics. Our science advisory panel consists of Tom Cochran who taught high school science; Dr Nicholas Hud, Brian Cafferty and Eric T. Parker from NASA’s Center for Chemical Evolution; Dr. Nicholas Casewell of the Liverpool School of Tropical Medicine; Dr. David Lynn of Emory University; Dr Ram Krishnamurthy of the Scripps Research Institute; Angelica Menchaca of the Natural History Museum; and Dr. Jay T. Goodwin of the National Science Foundation. On average it costs between $4,800 and $6,400 to create an animation. Our minimum fundraising goal of $7,200 will pay for the creation of one animation, plus allow us to print t-shirts and ship rewards out to contributors. Our ultimate goal of $25,800 will pay for all 4 videos plus rewards for contributors.We have many rewards for those who help fund our project, including t-shirts, stickers, and video downloads. Contribute to our Kickstarter and become a DEFENDER OF SCIENCE!","The most difficult part of creating these animations is simplifying the principles taught so that they can be understood by non-scientists, but not over-simplifying them to the point that they become inaccurate. By combining graphics with narration, we're able to pack a lot of information in a small amount of time without using much jargon. On our team we have professional scientists, artists (which have little or no scientific training), and teachers like Tom Cochran who has been working in the public school system for over 50 years. With this diverse team we are able to make sure that the messages are accurate and impressive to college professors, yet clear and friendly for everyone else."

After months of research, I’ve selected an eclectic group of songs made up primarily of obscure gems from the 1920s, 30s, and 40s that have been long forgotten and lost to the public all these many years. Some of these songs were written by women, some deal with the human condition, while others are simply fun, uplifting swing tunes.This project is about more than just me. I’ve already contacted top arrangers and musicians to work on this record with me, since these songs deserve nothing less that to be immortalized with the highest caliber of inspired creativity and musical sensibility. The money being raised for this project will be used to cover the direct costs of studio time, recording engineers, mastering, CD manufacturing, and fees for a producer, musicians, and arrangers.After the record is released, I plan to tour so audiences can experience the magic of these wonderful songs in a live setting that is sure to transport them back to an earlier time in the history of American music.Thank you for your interest.Peace * Love * Gratitude,- rd",,https://www.kickstarter.com/projects/729701756/midnight-in-new-york-vintage-jazz-roberta-donnay?ref=discovery_category_newest,729701756/midnight-in-new-york-vintage-jazz-roberta-donnay,"Thank you for your interest in my recording project! If you saw Woody Allen's latest film ""Midnight In Paris"" then you already know what this project is about. Since many of the artists and songwriters represented in my projectwere based in New York,I've namedthisendeavor ""Midnight In New York"". Imagine being transported back in time to the roaring 20s and 30s jazz era. The history of this American art form has always fascinated me as a musician, artist, and student of jazz.I just need your help to make this recording a reality.About Kickstarter: 1. Kickstarter is all or nothing funding for creative projects. All the funds must be received by the date above or I receive nothing. 2. No money changes hands until I reach my goal. After the goal is reached, the full amount is deposited into my account (minus 3-5%). 3. The money raised will directly pay for studio time, musicians, producer fees, arranger fees, mixing, mastering, andCD artwork. 4. You can give any amount you choose. There is no upper limit to the amount I raise. If I manage to raise more money than I'm asking for, this money will go towards additionalhorn arrangements, additional songs, and the associated musician and arranger fees. Any overflow after that will go towards promoting the CD and touring.Why This Project?I grew up in the Washington DC area, and was fortunate enoughtohear this musicplayedat home, on old records and on the radio, from an early age. My first experience singing in public was at age five, when I sang a song from the 20s at awedding. Isaw the magical effect this music had on everyone, instantly bringing a smile to their faces.Of course, I was hooked and at that moment decided I wanted to become a professional singer. As a runnaway teen, with no foundation and little to sustain myself, these songs became a safe haven for me. By age 16, I was already a working musician, and after years of travelling and working, I moved to San Francisco to find my true home.There, Iwas adopted by the local jazz community, which provided me with thehomeand family I had always craved. Music literally saved my life. Now, many years later, I find myself wanting to pay homage to the artists and music that made it possible for me to thrive as a singer. This recording project celebrates the vibrant, colorful history of the early jazz age that influenced my growth as an artist. Ihave selected an eclectic group of songs, most of which areobscure gems from the 1920s and 30s, for this recording. Many of these songs have been long forgotten and lost to the public. Some were written by women, singing about theirrelationships, suffering, joys and challenges, while others are simply fun and upliftingswing tunes. This project has already receivedinterest!I've been offeredsupport from a record label to promote, manufacture, and distribute the final recording. So thisCD has a very good chance of making itto radio and being heard internationally. After the release of this record, I plan to tour so audiences can experience the magic of these wonderful songs in a live setting that is sure to transport them back to this fantastic era. I'm already incorporating brief ""jazz history lessons"" into my live shows, providing interesting background stories and facts about individualsongs, artists, and writers. Audiences who have experienced my recentperformanceshave been enthusiastic about the music and haveencouraged me toinclude even more history.SoI can't wait to get into the studio with my musicians so we can lovingly record this music, and ultimately share it with an evenwider audience.Thank you for your interest and support.

Take back the cloud and deliver the highest standards of cloud computing at the lowest possible cost2.	Democratize access to Quantum computing.Inspired by the great Raspberry Pi community, we believe that the time has come to give everyone access to the highest-performing computing platform available; closing the knowledge gap.If we can achieve our Goal we will open the door to quicker breakthroughs, greater problem solving in key fields such as science, medicine, technology and human development.Maybe this will help one of you guys out there to change the world in a positive way.The Quanta@Home Platform (a sub-feature of AmiCloud)To make quantum computing accessible, we need access to a service that is affordable, open, and easy to use. The goal of the Quanta@Home project is to provide such a service.We intend to provide easily accessible services for everyone that work effectively across platforms.The Quanta@Home clients will be available for Windows (X86), Linux (ARM,PPC,i386),AROS i386, OS X (PPC/i386) and AmigaOS (68k/PPC)OpenSource:We will make all clients sources publicly available under the APL license Error! Hyperlink reference not valid.(http://aros.sourceforge.net/license.html)Affordability:Hardware costs and SDK costs have always been a huge barrier to entry for developers looking to develop high performance applications.Our goal is to circumvent the Quantum high performance computer cost by offering a Just-In-Time access and sharing model, making it an affordable platform for all.The Quanta@Home service is based on our upcoming AmiCloud infrastructure (providing storage, VM's and VCPU) and D-Wave's Quantum TechnologyThe Quanta@Home conceptQuantum computers can compute many tasks many thousands times faster than conventional computers. However those monsters are more like special tools designed to solve only a limited number of problems so they can't replace universal computers. However Quanta is all about simple yet powerful conventional cloud computing and it is all powered by AmiCloud – our cloud computing service. So you see it works together amazingly well. Simple right?So for any conventional tasks and access to virtual machines Quanta@Home incorporates AmiCloud's cloud processing, which offers the perfect solution to run calculations via distributed computing on ordinary servers.As soon you connect your Raspberry Pi (or Amiga, or Mac) to Quanta@Home it will become your Terminal to a Supercomputer or a high-end Workstation (see FAQ about 3D CAD)To us there is no bigger satisfaction than seeing someone use our platform for a purpose that we could never have imagined.Together we will work on an easy scripting language to enable easy lua like development so even coding noobs will be able to create interesting projects or utilize the power for interesting tasks. **My personal interesting task is Project MiNX (minx). MiNX is inspired by Kitty the AROS mascot and is the equivalent to Siri or Cortana. For now it is a so called weak AI but with enough computational power it will allow faster learning and improved automation, with every conversation between you and her.We believe that if everyone had affordable access to the latest technology then earth would become a better place.Where we are todayWe are glad to have one if not the best OS-bundle available for the Raspberry Pi. AEROS is unique because of it's Hybrid nature (a mix of two OS'es , AROS and Linux).To overcome the power limitations of our niche PPC and 68k based as well as low-cost ARM based computers we came to the conclusion that the time has come to outsource heavy calculation to servers.Every member can (optionally) offer some of his computational power to the Quanta@Home Framework. This can be used by others to solve problems (BOINC Network for example) or you can sell them to gain credits back or higher priority in the Workload-Queue.Why are we asking for your help?Well, we believe we are helping each other.Universities, and private technology enthusiasts get the chance to work with the bleeding edge.Isn't it a pity that only big companies and institutions like Google, NASA, NSA get to work on the best projects?None of us will get access in the next 1 or 2 decades to Quantum Computing. The only way to access Quantum computing is through a broad community movement – starting with a crowdfunding campaign.Together we can write the next generations history and catapult us into the age of Quantum-computing.What will your pledges be used for?The pledges will be used for purchasing additional server infrastructure/collaboration with existing services/api/client programming.Also if you like we will produce custom Pi~Wave cases for the Raspberry Pi 2. The case is modular. You can stack up multiple Pi's or just use the Basic housing, which has room for a SSD. If there is interest we can redesign the case based on your thoughts – so let us know what you think we can’t wait to answer your questions ☺The Pi~Wave can be your own server (it can accommodate the micro SD of your PI as well as a SSD). The case will be decently illuminated from LED's inside the case. The Pi~Wave text will glow white and between the black plates are blue glowing stripes.You can choose your own color from green, blue, and red, black and white.Only here on Kickstarter.Every case will have an individual serial number.Besides the Pi~Wave case we offer only here on Kickstarter the W4LK3R computer based on the Raspberry Pi 2 and inspired by the Amiga Walker design.Kickstarter exclusive Pi~Wave Computer PDFKickstarter exclusive W4LK3R PDFWhat is the benefit to you?- You will be a part of the movement to bring the Amiga spirit back to the mainstream- You will allow us to pay more of our core developer's to work on our projects (speeding up development)- You will get free cloud storage with unlimited traffic- You will get access to JIT VM's (just in time and configurable)- You will get a virtual turbo via VCPU- You will get access and let the D-Wave Computer work for you- You will have the chance to experiment with new ways of solving problems- You will learn new skills and enhance the way to program- Studying Quantum mechanics with a practical component- Encode /transcode media in the cloud- Learn coding; earn money with offering computational power- Run the latest games on your decade old Computer independently from HOST OS and CPU- Run always the latest and greatest applications on any compatible device.With AEROS, AmiCloud and Quanta@home the Pi will become the most cost-efficient Thin-Client and CAD-Workstation on the planet.AEROS Premium will include Medusa:http://www.cad-schroer.com/products/medusa4-personal/free-private-use.htmlABOUT USWe are a team of enthusiasts working under the ARES Computer brand to bring AROS, one of the spiritual successors of Amiga OS to the next level.With the release of AEROS we introduced a hybrid-OS, which mixes AROS and Linux, allowing us to use the best of both worlds side by side.We are members of the OpenInventionNetworkBesides our indieGO!-Marketplace which allows developers to reach customers on every OS and every Hardware platform, we also introduced indieCoins which act as a bonus system to let developers and content creators enjoy games and apps developed by other community members.We released in 2010 AMC (Amiga media Center) and this year we released the VAN-format (a Vector based lossless video codec). This thing allows transcoding from pixel to vector based movies. The resulting size is comparable to a 1080p h264 but with the nice bonus of being endless up scalable. (size can be reduced by reducing complexity and number of colors)Long story short... we are enthusiasts and quite innovative. With a bit more support (so far we have reached 1400+ registered users) be believe that we can beat major companies in terms of innovation;)FAQQ: Will it only work with the Raspberry Pi ?A: No, but because of our AEROS for Raspberry PI background, we are focused on it. The Quanta@Home service will be accessible from everywhere. Also on ordinary PC's and virtually any ARM soc and Android devices.Q: What is AmiCloud?A: AmiCloud is a WIP Cloud service like Dropbox, made for niche systems like AmigaOS and AROS, as well as obsolete ones like OSX for PPC. Every Quanta@home user will get also a basic AmiCloud account.The basic AmiCloud account will offer limited cloud storage.The best thing compared to services such as Dropbox:There is no traffic limit.I quite often use up the storage capabilities of my dropbox pro account. I am also disappointed that dropbox stopped supporting PPC Macs... We come from the absolute niche (Amiga Computers) and we care about each other and individual users unlike big companies.Q: What is AEROS?A: AEROS is our AROS / LINUX distribution for Raspberry Pi and i386 which allows to execute AROS and linux applications side by side as well as windows application with wine. The ARM Premium edition allows also the execution of i386 binaries. (Screenshot shows the Raspberry Pi Premium version)Q: What can I cloud-process ?A: Everything. The basics are that file conversations like transcoding video or image manipulation will be done by Quanta instead of your local Computer. Providing a faster processing speed. For example if you wanted to batch convert files on a Raspberry Pi 1. It would take quite a while. Instead you can now do a right click on the files and chose ""cloud-process"" and let the servers do the work.Q: 3D- CAD on a Raspberry ? Serious?A: Yep. AEROS Premium will include a CAD Software called Medusa.Medusa has one advantage.. It is free for everyone, also professionals. You pay only when you create a Product and are ready to publish it. Starting at roughly 3€ per drawing...But: Off course Quanta will also allow you to run cloud based CAD. Your clients can be cheap like a Raspberry. You will need approx. 5Mbit to work in HD over the internet. You will be connected to a Virtual CAD Workstation powered by Nvidia Grid.Q: So I get access to a virtual machine all the time?A: Yep, if we reach our goal we will provide a pool of VM's accessible for your needs. On top of that you can order additions like commercial software (Siemens Solid Edge, AutoCAD or similar). The additions will cost extra.Q: So there will be a SDK to write own Quanta powered apps?A: Yes. We will provide example codes and some ideas:A video converter could use the power. As well as a vectorizer as used in out lossless VAN Vector Animation Codec.The AEROS desktop called Wanderer will get a right click option to cloud process (convert files) for example.Q: How will the credit system work? Is it real money?A: We will utilize our indieGO!- Marketplace to offer a dedicated selling platform for your vcpu based app creations. On the Appstore people earn indiecoins.Those coins can be donated or used to buy products inside the store (games, apps, music and so on). In the Quanta@home system you can use those coins to buy additional software(CAD for example) and or get a speed boost by buying computational power from other users.Q: Could Raspberry Pi replace my expensive workstation?A: With Quanta@home... yes! The Raspberry will act as the Client and connect to a Nvidia Grid powered Workstation. You will need to pay a subscription plan based on the software you would like to have installed (you can also install your own licenses manually). The service fee will be based on the Power and usage time. So costs will only appear when you really do work. Professionals will get guaranteed access 24/7. Basic user accounts will be able to access free pool VM's at any time.BTW: AEROS is also available for cubox-i and Odroid U2/U3...Don't worry. In case the fundraiser fails you will get a refund of you money. Only if the fundraiser issuccessful we will get your money paid out.Beside the Pi-Wave you can also exclusively buy while supporting us the W4LK3R computer inspired by the never released Amiga Walker concept.The W4LK3R share the ""stackable"" feature of the original. Additional stacks can be placed below it so it grows to a full tower.You can choose your own color from green, blue, red, black and white. Only here on Kickstarter. Every case will become a individual serial.http://www.cad-schroer.com/products/medusa4-personal/free-private-use.html","The Quanta@Home/Amicloud projects carries risks like any major engineering project. Any design flaw can set product releases back months.We know as well as anyone that it only takes a single bug to make a product unusable.We will work together with existing partners of D-Wave to ensure quick execution and delivery.We are very confident that we can deliver what have proposed! Still, we want to make it clear that we can't guarantee that we will be able to deliver. If you do make a pledge to the Quanta@Home you are doing it knowing that there is a risk that something will go wrong. The one thing we can guarantee is that AmiCloud will be ready providing cloud processing we will put our entire energy and passion into this project (like we do with AEROS ). The Pi~Wave case design is virtually done. Now it depends on you.So this is our crowdfunding campaign – what can I say? I think I’ve said it all now it’s up to you guys. We are looking forward to your contributions both financial and technological, we really are all about community so we look forward to expanding and growing ours… and having you as part of it.Remember it is just as important to share our campaign as it is to contribute to it, so don’t be shy now push, promote and share our campaign to everyone you know even those who think won’t be interested or who think won’t understand. What we are doing affects everyone in the long run.Most of all do whatever you can we are eternally grateful guys and remember - this is just the beginning!!",https://www.kickstarter.com/projects/681890174/indiego-all-in-one-retro-game-console-raspberry-pi?ref=discovery_category_newest,681890174/indiego-all-in-one-retro-game-console-raspberry-pi,"We have updated the project description with a ""reward section"". This was needed to reflect the good news we had in the past days (reaching stretch goals and addition of decals for example - last update was 28th of December 2015)As featured on:What is it?The ultimate all-in-one-Retro console with a built-in DVD-RW drive to run games forAmiga CD32, Sony PlayStation, Sega Saturn*, Sega CD*, TurboGrafx* and more .The (*)-marked Systems will require additional ROM files in order to work. Easy-to-follow installation-instructions are provided in our included user manual.Of course it can also play ROMS for other consoles such as SNES/Super Famicom, Genesis/MegaDrive and more.The indieGO! is silent, power efficient and very unique, when compared with other ARM-based consoles, because of the integrated DVD-Drive.The Hardware consists of:The OS:Pre-installed games include Doom (sharware), Quake (Shareware), Duke Nukem (Shareware) and Whacky Wheels (shareware) and Jim Power Full-Version -more areaccessible from our appstore.For games you add by yourself andwhich are normally played via Keyboard and mouse we will offer a joypad-mapping tool. (a Default mapping will cover a lot of games) - Of course you can also connect a USB-Keyboard and Mouse if you like toGames downloaded from the indieGO!-store are ready2play (mapped to be played with a pad)The song-snippet (see link below) is the piano edition of the Jim Power title theme.. Which will be exclusively available at the indieGO!-Appstore and you can get it here for free ; ) - just help us.Now it is time and we cangrant you instant access to a working system right after reaching the goal! Yep.. we can shipindieGO! with the features mentioned above already in march 2016with the final 1.0estimated tobe ready in June. We will releasefrequent updates for backers.Yep... if we can successfullyfund it you can get the beta right away. It will be far away from being perfect.. but it will work and you can follow our development and stay updated. Also it will be always possible to just run the mentioned features shown in the video from day 1. They are cool even just by themselves..The system will keep itself updated. You get also access to a member area on our Websites www.aeros-os.organd www.indiego-gaming.comUnlike other ""Retro-console campaigns"" we will not just put a Raspberry Pi with a Retropie like distro on it..Well... to be honest you can install it still if you like.. side by side or on top of our solution ; ) And to be even more honest you will get a dual boot to enable you both worlds..Our system is called indieGO!-OS and is based on EmulationStation, Kodi, AEROS, AMC, indieGO!-Marketplace and EmuLA.AEROS itself is based on Debian linux and indieGO!-OS is again a fork of AEROS aimed for gaming and emulation purposes.The indieGO! allows to choose between indieGO!-OS(™), AEROS and Android(™) - Just reboot into a indie-Console, a Android console or a Mini PC.Unlike older ""hand-glued"" projects we offer you a real AppStore which will be filled with tons of free games, demos and commercial full versions of games for all kind of retro platforms but also NEW stuff exclusively for indieGO!-compatible systems.But you are 100% free to add own stuff to your console from every existing source! Your home, your castle.On top and included in the price is your own Cloud-Storage (25GB) to store games, data and media... just logIN on a friends machine and access your data from everywhere on the globe.In first Quarter we will also release a Android/IOS web app to access your AmiCloud from underway.Hmm.. you got already a Pi, Pi2 or Odroid?Don't worry you can just buy the Software on MicroSD-card!You like to be able to place your existing ARM SoC in any itx case?Hooray! You can also buy the I/O shield and System-holder for Raspberry and Odroid systems while still supporting us!Cool? Yep. If we reach 10000€ we will release the 3D-Printer compatible (STL) files for the Adapters and indieGO!-OS (without exagear license ->can be bought with a discount).Our system can be based on Raspberry Pi2, Odroid C1, Odroid U2/3 or Odroid XU4..So you can decide... With a XU4 you can play more modern games like Doom3 + Expansion or emulate a Dreamcast in full speed and run PC-Games like Counterstrike!We include a DVD-RW because so you can just insert Amiga CD32 and Playstation original games! And if you take care to include needed rom-files you can also run Saturn, SegaCD and other CD-based console games.One special feature of indieGO!-OS is a recognition layer for PC and console games on CD/DVD. If you insert a ROM it will be scanned and a wizard will help you to add it to your library. No manual config is needed.Insert, install run! = FUNThe basic pack includes a digital/analog USB-Controller perfectly fitting the retrogamer needsOptionally you can also use original controllers with USB-Adapters (see rewards)This exclusive indieGO!-Console bundle will be only available here! No later production is planned! This is an exclusive and one-time chance!For everyone coming too late to the party, we will only be able to provide the indieGO!-OS and the I/O-shield + system mounting adapter to build your own indieGO!-machines.All prices here are are quite modest compared with what the components would normally cost.This is meant as WIN/WIN campaign for you and us!Thank you very much for supporting us! Please spread the word! it is time to show how much more ""enthusiasm"" can be vs. money driven mainstream ; )Plug and Play! With the launch of the console you will get access to the indieGO!-library which consists of Games (demos, full versions, shareware, public domain) of all platform the system is capable to emulate or execute natively.Remember: insert a disk an the system will install it.If it is not recognized, just use the member-forum to request compatibility and we will work on it.The indieGO!-Appstore is open to all developers and runs on all important systems! On top we can support you to develop and publish games for all out target systems. You can get more infos on www.indiego-gaming.comhttp://www.facebook.com/indiegoretroBONUS! Only for Backers! Everyone who back us with at least 25€ will get Jim Power Extended edition for free! (for one platform of his choice)Jim Power Extended Edition comes with an exclusive Piano Edition of the Jim Power Title theme.. Boom! Nice ; )Update: (see Update 19 for the latest news regarding Stretch goals)When we reach 10000 € we will send you a case in the color of your choice (see available colors above) and we will release STL files of the I/O shield and SoC-holder(mounting adapter for itx cases). If we will hit a sum below 10k we will send only black/red cases like the one shown on the fotos below.When we reach 15000 € we will add a wifi usb-stick ""plugged in internally"" to the indieGO! Which will allow you to surf the web, watch youtube or other streaming services. (reachedalready)If we reach 20000 € we will create a original carton box for the console with your names on the back.(reached already)If we reach 25000 € we will add a 1500indieCoin gift card to each Hardware bundle (also to the DIY kit for 99€) (this equals 15€)If we reach 30000 € we will create an old school  scenedemo for Windows, OSX, Linux, AmigaOS, AROS, MorphOS and indieGO!(see update 19 for details) and will show it on Evoke 2016This demo will celebrate this successful campaign and will honor all backers with their names being part of the demo animations. Become immortal !If we reach 40000 € we will give you an AmiCloud client for one of the following systems for free: Windows, OSX, Linux, AmigaOS, AROS or MorphOS (see update 19 for details) so you can access your 25GB storage from your computer as well.Yes you can. We included AEROS our own Distribution for ARM based mini Computers like the Raspberry Pi or Odroid series.We have added this 'Reward section on 28th of December 2015 to reflect the latest additions and changes we made during the first days of the campaign. Some are based on request and ideas from YOU! Thank you!hmm... good point : ) You should ask yourself if you need something like indieGO! + 25GB Cloud-storage + Kodi Media Center + ARM based Computer + Jim Power + A nice mini itx case with DVD-RW ?If yes, check if you get it elsewhere for your Raspberry or Odroid.No? So go ahead and support us! You will get also new friends.. us.1. Product Prototyping (done) and software finalizing and testing.. your part : pjanuary-april 20162. building and packaging (oh my god my hands will bleed ; )April-mai3. shippingJuni-JulyDepending on success of the campaign we could hire additional coders/designer and helpers... it is up to youRight now we have a prototype ready.. Prototype is the wrong word.. The HW is there.. We use a mini-itx case with a ARM SoC of your choice. (Raspberry Pi2, Odroid C1 or Odroid Xu4).The Board will be fittet with a 3D-printed I/O shield designed by us. We will use the time during software finalization to optimize the 3D-Modell.The desktop side of our OS is ready already (www.aeros-os.org).The i386 Wrapper is ready as well and included in our OS. (AEROS Premium is available since a year).The App Store is ready as well... checkhttp://www.indiego-gaming.comDevelopers can find there also the developer guide to upload content.Jim Power Extended version is ready and available in the store..What we need to finish is only our own Game- and Emulauncher.. this is planned to happen together while you can enjoy games...So we will in worst case deliver a complete plug&play solution based around a raspberry Pi or Odroid capable to run Windows-, AROS- and Linux-apps.. Emulation station, KODI and featuring a Appstore and a free game ""Jim Power"" plus a exclusive Jim Power title theme piano version done by Patrick Nevian (known through Chris Hülsbeck Piano Collection)How it looks in real life:This is nice and kicks ass ; )Also it is future proof because we can add support for new ARM SoC'S as we like, just in time.Have fun and please spread the word!","indieGO!(™) ©2012-2015 Pascal Papara.

Be sure to watch Jeff's welcome video belowThis project is our second attempt to fund a very worthwhile endeavor: publish a full-size fine art book of portraits of homeless people, and give 1,000 copies to the agencies that serve people without doors to show appreciation for the breakthrough results already being achieved.Until early 2017, the entire project was backed by a Veteran of the United States Navy from the Vietnam Era, who was himself homeless after his military service. When health issues prevented him from completing the project, a primary Kickstarted round was attempted, which raised almost $10,000, but did not meet our goal of $25,000.Instead of defeat, that first attempt convinced our team that we can achieve our objective. Three independent backers have now pledged approximately $15,000 to the project, so that this second Kickstarter attempt need only raise $10,000.We hope you will join us.

Deziner Dogs cares and wants to create doggy equality by including as many breeds as possible but the costs involved can be staggering. That is why we need your help to fund our company. With your generous support we will be able to add more dog breeds to our line, complete our up-and-coming line of raincoats (hopefully in time for Spring!), and help us expand our production facilities.Deziner Dogs was created not only by me, but by every pet owner I run in to. Owning a pet service business for numerous years has introduced me to so many breeds. As I was walking a dog, another dog-owner came over to greet us, and asked, “What kind of dog is that?” I came to the realization that I have been asked this question on a daily basis for years! That’s when the light bulb went off and Deziner Dogs was created. We started with our current line of hoodies, tanks and leashes.Not only will Deziner Dogs differentiate your dog breed with our apparel & accessory line, it will also start many conversations between dog owners. Our mission is to make high quality, fashion forward, fun products for you and your pet! BUT most importantly we give back to S.N.O.R.T Rescue group with every order placed. We help this great non profit organization raise funds to place dogs in homes. Help us give back!Thank you so much. Every pledge is appreciated!","Challenges I foresee are manufacturing issues, making sure that the material, color and sizes are correct. If they are not, there is always the chance of a delay in delivery. I will be on top of the manufacturer, making sure there are no issues. So far, I have overcome these obstacles with the hoodies and tank tops and now I am beginning the process of the raincoats. Samples are coming and I will make sure everything is correct before I can place an order.",https://www.kickstarter.com/projects/dezinerdogs/animated-tv-pilot?ref=discovery_category_newest,dezinerdogs/animated-tv-pilot,"We are producing this TV pilot/short film in hopes of getting it on TV so your children can watch an entertaining cartoon with very important lessons on bullying. There is no animation out there like it. Bullying just seems to be starting earlier and earlier this day and age. My goal is to nip it in the bud in a child's earliest of stagesI am funding this with a lot of my own money. However, the costs are very high and I need your help. Please remember this is an ALL or NOTHING campaign so if I do not reach my goal, I do not receive a penny of your money. I ask that you please pass this along to anyone who loves animals and is a big anti-bullying advocate.Raising: $7,500 to complete the remainder of the projected budget.Thank you so much for looking at my campaign!I hope we get this made together! Thank you!!","The biggest challenge is getting the team together since everyone is very busy. I am working with all professionals that are actively working so we need to find the time that works for everyone for each stage. Animation is very timely and difficult to create so the project can take longer than expected. There are always changes with the script and the animation. This is normal in this business. The end result will be an amazing ""made for tv"" animated pilotI will keep my backers posted along the way!"

With your help hopefully so.","Very minimal risk, or challenges. There are Teams all over North America (and now the world) so getting more teams involved is not an issue.I am experienced doing this, as you can see.",https://www.kickstarter.com/projects/2131015647/just-breathe-adults-living-with-cystic-fibrosis?ref=discovery_category_newest,2131015647/just-breathe-adults-living-with-cystic-fibrosis,"About the BookCystic Fibrosis is a fatal genetic disease, affecting roughly 35,000 Americans and Canadians (70,000 worldwide). It’s been widely viewed by the public as a “childhood” disease, simply because it was usually fatal by the mid-late teens.But that has changed now. The median age is now mid to late 40s. Because of medical advances in drugs and lung transplants, what was once an early death sentence is now the gift of life.The goal is to photograph portraits of adults living with CF. Beside each of their portraits will be something they have personally written - it could be their feelings,an experience, thoughts about their future, whatever. The goal is to give a voice and raise awareness that people are living longer because of advances made in the medical community. The public perception is that CF is still very much a childhood disease. By putting a new face on Cystic Fibrosis we want tochange the perception, and show that research and transplants are making all the difference. But adults are dealing with other problems as well,and this is to also shed some light and understanding on the other issues adults with CF deal with.The project is called ""Adults LIVING with Cystic Fibrosis"", not Adults Dying from it. I have spoken to over 300 people about being part of this project, and the main thing I have learned out is theirindomitable spirit. Their stories you will read will be so inspiring.I am looking to photograph minimum 60 people, even upwards of 100 (depending on funding) right across North America.I have to be very clear that a good portion of the money raised will be used for the production of the project - car rentals, hotels, GAS, gear rentals, etc. HOW FAR I can travel (and how many people) depends on donations!!!!!I am looking to raise (at least) $7,500... but more is of course better. This will provide enough to produce the project.This book is as much my journey, as it is the stories these adults have to tell.THE TRIPI am planning two separate trips to hopefully gather enough people for the project. Trip#1 will be heading west and north, through Detroit and over to Chicago area and ending in Minneapolis area. Trip#2 I am trying to coordinate with the CF Conference in Atlanta, Oct.9. I'll be travelling through Connecticut for sure, and down the coast, passing through Baltimore, NYC, Chapel Hill, Atlanta and if time and money permits into Florida.SPECIAL THANK YOU:To comedian Lewis Black for the shout-out and his great support fighting CF, and the fantastic supporters that have helped to promote this from DPReview.com, The Phoblographer, The Mighty and Photoblog.ca (Vistek.ca).http://www.cysticfibrosis.ca/your-impact/hear-from-our-cf-champions/ian-pettigrew/http://www.thephoblographer.com/2014/05/19/photographing-faces-cystic-fibrosis-interview-ian-ross-pettigrew/http://prophotoblog.ca/indie-of-the-week/ian-pettigrew-portraits/http://www.dpreview.com/news/2014/05/09/just-breathe-portraits-of-adults-with-cystic-fibrosisYOUR MONEYProduction is expensive, especially that I will have to drive to most of my locations, due to the amount of gear I have but also because of my own CF. (stuck in an airplane is like being in one giant germ container)Also factor in fees for the fundraising, Paypal fees, taxes, shipping, etc. The money will be used to produce the actual book as well as all the expenses that go into this endeavour.I am a portrait and fashion photographer from Hamilton, ON (Canada). I am also a 45 year old male with Cystic Fibrosis.Luckily my diagnosis is considered a milder variant of the disease, but it is CF nonetheless. I was diagnosed about 7 years ago.Before that I had no idea, but looking back on my life I always had the symptoms, just no one ever knew it was CF (like incredibly salty sweat).It wasn’t until I was unable to have children I was finally diagnosed, with F508 del and L206T mutations.WHAT YOU GET:The book. At least 60 portraits of people living and dealing with this disease. Please see a full list of the perks.My focus is mainly North America, due to the cost of travel. But could this go International? Why not! With the right support and funding lets go worldwide.The plan is to have this as a multi-tiered project: awareness will be gained by the exposure of the project in a final book form, that can be promoted(i.e. morning talk shows?? etc).SAFETY GUIDELINES: I’m very aware of the serious considerations of CF patients in the same proximity, and have been in contact with CF Canada as to how I might deal with these situations.Given that my CF is very mild, there would still be strict precautions in place in dealing with my subjects as per outlined guidelines from both CF Canada and the US.http://stranoandpettigrew.com","I have already started with the portraits, but without the funding the project cannot expand. I need a cross-section of adults to tell me there stories, and I need to travel to get them. I want to make this a book people will talk about, to get the conversation started about this serious illness. Some funds have already been raised and will go towards book production.I am an experienced, professional photographer and have already taken 10 portraits for the book, so I know what I am doing. I have a top Toronto-based graphic design firm helping me out, and a printer all lined up and ready to go."

There are all sorts of things you can do with a device like this. You can create wearables like a watch, bracelet, pendant, or buckle that displays color images, attach sensors and display data in text or visual form, display debug information, create a graphics user interface, or even make simple retro games.The display on the Pixelduino is compatible with Adafruit's GFX library. This library provides functions for blitting images, drawing primitives like lines and circles, and even includes basic bitmapped font support. The theoretical maximum speed of this display when streaming from the SD card and refreshing the entire screen is ~10 fps. This is based on the speed of the SPI bus and the amount of data that needs to be pushed around.The display controller also has some graphics acceleration built in, allowing you to redraw only specific parts of the screen (enabling sprite rendering by tracking dirty rectangles) or change the display offset to scroll vertically. (Of course, if you want to do horizontal scrolling in hardware, you can always rotate the screen by 90 degrees!)The Pixelduino is also compatible with the Arduino's SPI and SD libraries. Communication with the display and MicroSD card are both handled with the SPI bus on pins 10-13. Pins 8 and 9 are also used to command the display. Aside from these, the rest of the pins are available for any use. The I2C bus for example is available on pins A4 and A5. In the image above you can see the board includes a convenient 2mm JST PH connector, just like those found on small LiPo batteries and some alkaline battery packs.The board can run on 1 to 3 alkaline, lithium, or NiMh batteries, as well as single-cell LiPo batteries. The on-board boost regulator efficiently steps the voltage up to the 5V the board requires, and has a built in linear regulator to step the voltage down when needed.New firmware can be loaded using the Arduino IDE with the same USB serial FTDI programmers boards like the Arduino Pro use, or with an ISP programmer using a pogo-pin adapter.The circuit seen in the video is a proof of concept using the same screen and processor that will be used on the final board. The final design is complete and ready to go into production as soon as we reach our funding goal.The Pixelduino is open hardware and the schematics and PCB layout will be made available so you can manufacture them yourself or learn from the design and improve upon it!Here is the timeline for completing each phase of the project:We set out to design this board after seeing a similar product with a tiny monochrome screen that we thought we could improve upon.

We will also be adding an individual with significant museum experience to our staff.All of the Kickstarter Benefits (aside from the Museum Admission) will be in stock and ready to ship well before the Kickstarter Campaign concludes.",https://www.kickstarter.com/projects/bobbleheadhall/negro-leagues-vintage-baseball-bobblehead-series-make-100?ref=discovery_category_newest,bobbleheadhall/negro-leagues-vintage-baseball-bobblehead-series-make-100,"In 2020, the Negro Leagues is celebrating its 100th Anniversary, and bobbleheads are the perfect way to celebrate, commemorate and educate current and future generations about the Negro Leagues!Starting in 1960, generic bobbleheads featuring every MLB, NFL, NHL and NBA team were produced and quickly became popular collectibles. However, vintage bobbleheads of the Negro Leagues teams have never been produced...until now!The National Bobblehead Hall of Fame and Museum and Dreams Fulfilled have teamed up to create this series of high quality, officially licensed, limited edition bobbleheads. Each bobblehead in the series will be individually numbered to only 100 as part of Kickstarter's Make 100 Campaign.Each bobblehead is being made with extreme attention to detail from the design through production. We have consulted with experts and historians to ensure the colors, logos and other elements are accurate representations.Each bobblehead will come in a collector’s box that includes the list of teams. We hope the bobbleheads will serve as a motivation for people to explore the history of the Negro Leagues and its players.The only way to secure the Negro Leagues Vintage Bobbleheads is by supporting the project before production of the series begins. Only 100 individually numbered gold base bobblehead sets will be produced.If successful, we will work to create a second series that will be accessible to even more people. Backing the project will help achieve that important goal.If bobbleheads from the series of 100 remain available after the campaign, they will be made available in the National Bobblehead HOF and Museum’s Online and Retail Stores, Dreams Fulfilled’s website, and the Negro League Baseball Museum Store while they last.We are also giving Kickstarter Backers the ability to contribute in increments of $25 to receive one of the Negro Leagues Centennial Series Bobbleheads or Special Edition Bobbleheads that have already been produced and are in stock now. This is a $5 savings off the standard retail price.Your contribution at any level is greatly appreciated and will help us fulfill our mission of creating bobbleheads that celebrate, honor and educate future generations about the Negro Leagues.With Make 100, Kickstarter asks the creator community to bring 100 of any work into the world and invites backers to support the one-of-a-kind—or at least one of 100—ideas. Make 100 projects are required to launch in January and we're excited to be participating in this unique opportunity, especially since it coincides with the 100th anniversary of the Negro National League that will be celebrated this year.Not only does the project coincide with the Negro Leagues Centennial and Kickstarter's Make 100, but it will also be live during the duration of Black History Month.Black History Month is an annual celebration of achievements by African Americans and a time for recognizing the central role that black people have played in U.S. history. We we think this is a perfect way to celebrate and honor the tremendous achievements of the Negro Leagues and its players.The following 10 teams will be included in the Vintage Bobblehead Series. If the project is successful, we will strive to honor more teams with vintage bobbleheads.We were able to reach the goal within 24 hours of launching and greatly appreciate the early backers who made these meaningful bobbleheads a reality!Since we hit the goal, we are doing two things:1. Giving backers the option of purchasing non-numbered green base versions of the vintage bobbleheads individually for $30 each plus shipping. The green base version, which are pictured below, will not have the Negro Leagues Centennial logo. This will enable more people to access the series since not everyone is able to purchase a complete set or wants every team. Existing backers that would like any of the green base bobbleheads can increase the pledge in increments of $30. To purchase the full set, the pledge can be increased by $250 to receive all 10 teams.2. Adding a stretch goal to include five more teams in the set. If we hit the $15,000 mark, we will add 5 additional teams to the series: Kansas City Monarchs (Road Jersey), New York Black Yankees, Philadelphia Stars, New York Cubans and Chicago American Giants. Existing backers can add the additional teams for a discounted rate of $100 with no additional shipping cost by increasing the pledge amount. New backers can either pledge for the set of 10 or 15.Since we hit the goal so quickly, we're putting the bobbleheads into production right away!The Negro Leagues Centennial Bobblehead Series is being produced by the National Bobblehead Hall of Fame and Museum in collaboration with Dreams Fulfilled and the Negro Leagues Baseball Museum.Negro Leagues: The first successful Negro League was founded by Rube Foster on February 13, 1920 at the Paseo YMCA in Kansas City. Foster believed an organized league structured like major league baseball would lead to eventual integration of the sport and racial reconciliation. Foster did not live to see his dream come true. Others picked up his cause and in 1947 Jackie Robinson broke Major League Baseball’s color line.National Bobblehead Hall of Fame and Museum: The National Bobblehead Hall of Fame and Museum, which is located at 170 S. 1st. St. in Milwaukee, Wisconsin, opened to the public on February 1st, 2019. The HOF and Museum also produces high quality, customized bobbleheads for retail sale as well as organizations, individuals and teams across the country. Visit us online and on Facebook, Twitter and Instagram.Dreams Fulfilled: Dreams Fulfilled was organized to promote the Negro National League Centennial in 2020. Its founder, Jay Caldwell, has been selected by the Negro Leagues Baseball Museum as the primary exhibitor for an art and artifact exhibition at the museum between February 13th and May 31, 2020. Dreams Fulfilled will be exhibiting 300 original pieces of art honoring Negro League players and nearly 100 artifacts of African American baseball dating back to 1871. Visit us at www.NegroLeaguesHistory.com or www.facebook.com/NegroLeaguesHistory.Negro Leagues Baseball Museum: The Negro Leagues Baseball Museum (NLBM) is the original museum dedicated to preserving and celebrating the rich history of African-American baseball and its profound impact on the social advancement of America. The NLBM operates one block from the Paseo YMCA where Andrew “Rube” Foster founded the Negro National League in 1920. In 2006, the NLBM was designated as “America’s National Negro Leagues Baseball Museum” by the United States Congress.Graig Kreindler: The bobbleheads are being based off the amazing artwork of Graig Kreindler, whose art will also appear on the sides of the boxes.Graig Kreindler, born in 1980, grew up in Rockland County, New York. In 2002, he graduated with Honors from the School of Visual Arts in New York City with a BFA in Illustration and received his Masters in Art Education from Lehman College. His award-winning sports work has appeared in juried shows and museums nationwide, as well as having been featured in nationally distributed books, newspapers, magazines, and both Internet and television featurettes. To Graig, no other sport embodies the relationship between generations and the sense of community like baseball. His goal is to portray the national pastime in an era when players were accessibly human, and the atmosphere of a cozy ballpark was just as important as what happened on the field. He is proud to act as a visual historian: recreating a history that he has never experienced, yet, like millions of fans, maintain a profound connection with.","The National Bobblehead Hall of Fame and Museum has produced hundreds of thousands of bobbleheads for retail sales as well as for teams, organizations and individuals across the world.Prototypes of all 10 bobbleheads have been produced and we are ready to begin production if the Kickstarter Campaign is successfully funded. All necessary licensing approvals have already been secured from the Negro Leagues Baseball Museum.We recently completed all of the bobbleheads for the Negro Leagues Centennial Series Kickstarter Project, which was our largest undertaking to date featuring 40 unique bobbleheads.  We have the capacity to handle the project and are excited for the opportunity to continue to honor the Negro Leagues and keep the legacy of the league alive as the 100th anniversary is celebrated this year."

I didn't know what to do or how to get out of my situation. After three grueling years, I just decided to quit my job that I had spent five years of school and north of $100,000 bucks preparing for and jump off that cliff, hoping to figure it all out before I hit the ground. Over the past decade, I've built up my reputation, grown my network, and developed proven methods and techniques on how to be seen in a busy world. And then I put it all into a book.I've used these techniques to be invited to the White House, featured in Entrepreneur Magazine, hustle my way onto hosting a business TV show on ABC, land an interview with Daymond John, raise money from the team that started the Weather Channel, and so much more!Most people market themselves wrong. And wonder why they can't get results.If you want to be noticed, you have to set yourself apart and be memorable. You can't do what everyone else in your industry is doing and expect different results. You have to be the anomaly.Anomalies are memorable.You don’t forget an anomaly because they’re different and they stick in your head.There are millions of people fighting for attention online. Digital marketers, small business owners, internet personalities, and more.If you want to stand out from the crowd either online or in person, you have to differentiate yourself.The two things missing from most brands are confidence and strategy.Confidence. The confidence to ask for business, to get in front of people, to take a risk. Confidence is the most important part of marketing. It's the heartbeat of your brand. If you don't have confidence, you're setting yourself up for failure.Strategy. Having a plan in place can make all the difference. I don't mean having a business plan. I mean knowing what steps you need to take to get in front of people, and ultimately have them do what you want them to do. Whether that's subscribe to your YouTube channel, follow your account on Instagram, or buy your product or service. There's no such thing as a one-step business. You can't expect to just sell something and that be the only step in the process. You should have 7-12 interactions with a prospect during the sales process. The sales process doesn't end at the sale either. You should be maintaining relationships for the lifetime of your customer.I wrote Anomaly to help people grasp those two ideas.This book is different from most marketing and business books. I don’t just ramble about high-level topics that turn out to be nothing more than a plethora of cliche “rah rah” phrases that are supposed to get you excited about business. I don’t talk about how to grow just one type of business that may or may not end up being applicable to you.Marketing is simple. It is anything you can do to get a positive reaction out of someone and to ultimately get them to buy what you are selling. How can you get someone to look up from their laptop? You have to be the anomaly.Anomaly was written for anyone who is trying stand out from a large number of people. Whether online or in person. For a personal brand, your own business, or the company you work for. If your goal is to start getting noticed or getting people's attention, then Anomaly can show you how to do exactly that. People like:So if you're tired of spinning your wheels and running in place, it's time to take action and get results. Anomaly will dig deep into what you might be doing wrong, and what you can start doing TODAY to start seeing the results you want.Millions of people are fighting for attention every day. People that are doing anything in their power to get in front of as many people as they possibly can. Whether that be online or in person. It's becoming virtually impossible to stand out among the crowd.How big of a crowd,you ask?If you want to be seen, stop doing what everyone else is doing. You have to be different, memorable, and everywhere all the time. If you find yourself running in place and working your butt off but getting no results, you need to read Anomaly.If you're trying to:Then Anomaly is for you.What I do is tell you what you can start doing TODAY to grow your brand. Things you can implement immediately and start seeing results. Things you might not have thought about, or haven’t thought you’re able to. As with any book, you can’t just read it and expect to make progress. You have to put in the work. But I promise that if you follow my steps, and implement these techniques, you will see results.Anomaly is broken down into 3 main parts, each detailing a specific ingredient of the sales and marketing process.Stephen Reinstein owns and operates a marketing agency that targets martial arts studios. He came to me for help in the very beginning, because he knew how difficult it was going to be to get people's attention.In Part 2 of the book, I cover a technique called the 50 Ten Method. It's an easy way to get in front of a lot of people, and really understand the language you should be using in your sales process.Here's Stephen talking about how this method helped him find his first customers.Here's Kenya. He quit his job as a nuclear engineer to start his own automobile detailing business. This was the first business he ever started, so there was definitely a learning curve. But he, too, came to me early on to help him nail down his marketing plan and positioning.This is Kenya talking about just how far his business has come from when we first sat down together a few years ago.Tracy owns a security business, but she was on the verge of closing up shop after a rough couple of months. Lucky for her, she changed her mind after meeting with me.Before Tracy and I met, she was making about $40,000 dollars a year. After implementing some of the techniques I taught her, she's making $40,000 every couple of weeks!Here's Tracy talking about how I helped her transform her business.""The best advice I ever got from Zack Miller for launching my small business was ""enter contests"". Now that seems strange, but winning comes with free PR. So I tried it and won the first one I entered. Never miss an opportunity for free PR. I've won many, now and only have Zack to thank.""- Tracy LinkAlong with the book, my team and I are producing an online course to supplement the material. A book can be great by itself, but if you really want to master the material and see immediate results, then the course can take you there. I’ve put on hundreds of webinars over the years and have gotten tons of feedback regarding my presentation style.Some of us learn better visually. And my team designed this course with those people in mind. I’ll walk you through each phase of the book and tell you EXACTLY how you can start implementing each strategy and start standing out in business.Anomaly walks you through the steps to get whatever you want to be seen to be seen. You need more customers. If you aren’t getting more exposure you won’t be getting more customers. Anomaly will give you strategies to leverage the work you’ve already done to attract way more exposure for your business. We cover all of the avenues you should be using that will teach you to build a bigger audience and convert more customers.After the Kickstarter campaign, this course will retail for $1,000. So, if you want access, now is the time!Whether you’re starting a business from scratch, or are growing an established business, the methods and techniques covered in Anomaly will help you get to the next stage. It’s time for you to finally stand out from the crowd!There are various costs associated with getting this book published. I have already secured a contract with a reputable publishing company that states I need to meet several financial requirements in order to get the ball rolling.Since I am producing an online course to go along with the book, there are even more things that will require money to start. Some of the costs associated are:The book is in its final stages of production. Now is your time to get in at the early, cheapest pricing of the book!I started my career out of college as a TV photojournalist, but during that time, I hated my life. I needed a change. So, I decided to leave the world of journalism and TV news, and enter the world of business.A world where I was starting from scratch and competing with people who had decades of experience over me.So I had to stand out from everyone, both physically and ideologically. I was the guy, in a room full of suits and ties, wearing a t-shirt and jeans. I immediately stuck out in people's minds.I also separated myself by thinking differently from everyone else. I started in a community that was stuck in the past, and I was able to bring in a new set of ideas to the community, While I can't say it was all adopted seamlessly, piece by piece people started buying into what I was saying.In a world flooded with business plans that will likely never be followed, I proposed new ideas. For example, that people should first validate their ideas, and find potential customers as steps 1 and 2, rather than spend time writing a business plan. Business plans involve a lot of guesswork and estimations. Most that will never come true. So why spend 40-80 hours writing a hypothetical plan when you can just go out into the world and test your idea.I also presented new ways of approaching the sales process. A lot of which made it into this book. But, as more and more of the companies I worked with had success, the more people listened to me. I've been recognized several times over years.Honors & awards:I want to take my decades of experience working with people in virtually every situation and cram it into 1 value-packed book. I can't WAIT for you to read it.I was miserable working a corporate job and wanted more. I didn't know what to do or how to get out of my situation.

https://www.kickstarter.com/projects/hmward/the-arrangement-instant-video-series?ref=discovery_category_newest,hmward/the-arrangement-instant-video-series,"This is our chance to make THE ARRANGEMENT into film! Eeep! I've had offers from names that will knock your socks off, but I just can't sell the rights.Holly, why are we doing this ourselves? Why not sell it?Because I want Sean to stay Sean.If I sell the rights, then we have no say with what they do with him. They could decide to make Sean into Mr. Sparkles meets Mr. Maroon. *cringes*Even my editors try to tame Sean and we don't want that. The best way to keep Sean, Sean is if we maintain control and fund this ourselves.My daughter still hasn't forgiven the producers of the Percy Jackson movies. I'm not going to let my fans end up feeling that way.What does 'doing it ourselves' mean?It means that we control everything from the script to the director. It doesn't mean I'm doing all that stuff. It does mean that I'm overseeing it, choosing the people to make it, and having final say on casting and the script, as well as the final cut. It means you get the real story, exactly the way I pictured it in my head with no filters or marketing people trying to change your beloved characters.This has been a fan-driven series from the beginning, so here's your chance to be involved again! If we fund this project, it allows me to produce the film as a series and retain complete control giving you the Sean Ferro you know and love, plus the rest of THE ARRANGEMENT characters.The first season of THE ARRANGEMENT series (TV-like episodes) will be for sale *worldwide via instant video or DVD(where permitted/ available). We will be creating one season of episodes. The number of episodes will be determined depending on which writer we go with and the length of each show.I already have my eye on a very talented writer!I've already spoken with Emmy Award winning screenwriters and producers about making the first season of THE ARRANGEMENT. Major distribution companies are thrilled to be involved and give us even more options.Everyone wants in on this project and with over 5 million books sold and a rabid Ferro fan base, I can't blame them. I already have my eye on several people and I'm really hoping things work out. I can't say yet--we have to wait for funding and then confirm schedules--but OMG. You're going to swoon big time!If we fund this, your donation is going toward hiring the people needed to make THE ARRANGEMENT series come to life, including but not limited to, the actors, director, production, scriptwriters, location fees, sets, crew, etc.This is a huge project and I can't thank you enough! I have amazing fans and I know it. You guys rock big time! I know if we all chip in that we can easily hit this goal because there are so many Ferro fans out there!Not only will this series tell the story of Avery Stanz, and follow THE ARRANGEMENT books, but it will also go deeper into Sean's life and many of the mysteries surrounding the Ferro family.There's so much going on behind the gates of that vast New York estate that's yet to be stated. Just because I didn't write it yet, doesn't mean it's doesn't exist. I know exactly where Sean was before he met Avery, what he was doing, and who he was with.There is more story to be told, more places to flesh out that will add to the story you know and love. Rather than taking away from it, this series will add to the original canon, and die hard fans will know its canon because I made it.That's why we're here right now. It's to bring Sean and Avery to life and get a glimpse into their spectacularly broken world. By using an episodic format it will emulate the feeling of the books while adding more layers of mystery and emotion.This formula also allows us to retain the steamy sensuality of the books that many readers are worried about losing. Since I'm overseeing it, I can make sure it's tasteful, and hot. Love scenes are part of a love story. I'm not going to cut them out.This series will draw in the brothers stories and tangle with THE ARRANGEMENT story, just like the other Ferro books do! So if you're crushing on Peter or Bryan, don't worry - they'll be there.Easy, look at the list of prizes on the right and click. Then tell your mom, tell your friends, tell your dog. This series got it's huge following from wonderful fans like you who shared the sexy, unstoppable Sean Ferro. Do it. Pass him around. Every dollar helps.Who is this Sean Ferro and is he hot?Hells yeah! He can give Mr. Christian a run for his money without the red room. Holy hotness! Yeah, it's true. Go see what all the fuss is about over here. Right now the entire series is in Kindle Unlimited so it saves you a bunch of cash.WHAT HAPPENS IF WE DON'T HIT THE GOAL?If we don't raise the total amount of funding designated for the goal, this project will NOT be made. You will not be charged. There will be no show, no Sean book, no nothing. Total suckage. Seriously.We're raising over $2 million dollars to create a series of episodes of THE ARRANGEMENT. To make it perfectly clear I AM NOT FILMING this series. The professionals that know what they are doing and have done it before will be hired to make the series.The funding goes to these areas plus more:And that's not everything. You still have your writers, consultants, producers, crew, assistants and more. It's daunting and would have been much easier to sell the rights and allow a company to make the series and do what they want with it. But that isn't what you guys wanted. We wanted to make sure the story remained true to the series and true to the author. The best way to do that is to oversee the production by offering the funding, which is what this kickstarter was designed to do.That's right, when you become a 'backer' on kickstarter you are making a donation to help this project become in a reality. In this case, you are pledging money to make THE ARRANGEMENT into an instant video series.The number of episodes and the length are yet to be determined - that depends on the amount of funding raised. The best part is that you get the series when we hit the goal AND you get special perks for being part of the awesome group of people who funded this project.Donations can be made by clicking the green button on the upper left side of the page. You can also share this project with your friends by clicking the social media buttons at the top of the page right under the main video. SHARING IS SO IMPORTANT! REMEMBER TO SHARE!As pictures of the prizes become available, I'll post them here. Please note that someperks are cumulative. They come with the items stated only so read carefully.Below is a picture of the crystal tee shirt. OMG IT SPARKLES LIKE CRAZY! This shirt has the most crystals out of any Ferro shirt we've made. This is the Ferro family crest that die hard fans have had tattooed on their bodies. It's SO pretty. Please note the shirt is fitted and meant to be worn snuggly. Order a size larger if you don't like fitted. It comes in a ton of sizes, including plus sizes!DELETED SCENES FROM THE ARRANGEMENT:Initially, I toned things down a bit. This prize allows you to read a few pages of never printed text from the New York Times bestselling series. Don't bother trying to read these pages, because they're not the real thing. Only donors get this perk! :)More pics to come!Stuff to know about prizes:Thank you so much for your time and consideration. If every Ferro fan donates a dollar we can easily hit this goal, but I can't do it alone. Help spread the word so that we can make the Ferro family come to life. Everyone is so excited to see Sean in the flesh! So am I!Thank you to every single person who has donated and took the time to read, donate, and share this project! You guys are the ones who make being an Indie awesome! It's all about the fans and always has been. Rock on Ferroholics! And new folks that gave a dollar because I mentioned Christian Grey, you won't be disappointed. :)*Waves* Peace out peeps! Let's rock this!","After the project is successfully funded the fun things start. I'll check with the actors, producers, and writers that I've been eyeballing to make sure they are available. My goal is to move quickly, but I will NOT sacrifice quality to do so. That may mean we have to wait for an actor or a director, which can cause filming to be delayed. Other factors may pop up also, such as permits, unions, and so on. My goal is to work efficiently and create the best product possible in a timely manner.We currently have a projected date of December 2015/ Jan 2016. If that changes, I will let you know. My drop dead date (dear God I hope we're done date) is Dec 2016. Since I've already selected the people I'd like to work with, it's a matter of timing and hoping they say yes and can do it when we need them to start. Coordinating schedules is one of the hardest parts.I know many fans are afraid this will stray from the books. I can tell you right now that it will not stray, but it will ADD TO THE STORY. This series will fill in the rest of the story that's yet to be told. I'll be there overseeing everything and ADD TO THE STORY the parts of the Ferro family that are NOT in the books. More Ferro is always better. I will keep donors up to date on the project via email and a dedicated facebook page. I am always accessible to my fans via facebook. Feel free to come by and say hi there. Finally, I want your participation. You guys helped shape this series, and I'd like you to help shape the film series as well.THE BIGGEST RISK OF ALL IS LETTING THIS OPPORTUNITY SLIP BY. Those who know me are aware that I'm 100% Indie and the millions of fans that found me did so without a cooperate whale at my back. It's just me. No one dictates what I do or what I write. The freedom to do that in a film series about THE ARRANGEMENT is wonderful, exciting, and a little freaky. I get to see very clearly how many people have faith in the project and in me. I promise I won't let you down.",https://www.kickstarter.com/projects/hmward/the-ferro-film-project-1?ref=discovery_category_newest,hmward/the-ferro-film-project-1,"This Kickstarter has ended. To keep up with this project go to www.FerroMovie.comThe ticker below shows our daily total amount with H.M. Ward's pledge match.WE HIT OUR GOAL *throws confetti* BUT THERE'S STILL MORE TO DO...WHAT ARE STRETCH GOALS? A stretch goal is an additional funding goal set for this campaign in the event that we surpass the initial funding goal, and will be used to finance other aspects of this project. We hit our initial goal of $7,999, but there's still more to do. I'd planned on making multiple little campaigns where we can raise what we need for the next step, but we may not need to, depending on how much we can do now. In the event that we fund this quickly (and we did -2 days!- which is epic), we can keep going, which will give us the funds needed to unlock the next phase of production. That means we can progress faster than anticipated. Meeting stretch goals will take us further into the fundraising for the production.  New rewards will appear as we head toward the stretch goals. You can update your reward level at any time prior to February 4th.Want more info about stretch goals? Read this post.YES!I'll match every $1 pledged with $1 from my own pocket, up to $15,000. So instead of just giving the $2001 that I already promised for the script, I'm increasing my donation to match yours at $8,855 which is the current pledge total, which puts us at $17,710. When there are more pledges, my contribution will match it up to $15,000 USD.So it'll be really easy to hit that casting goal! That means the Mr. Turkey reward has unlocked and we are really close to getting that $20K reward unlocked. Help spread the word. Together we can do this!The Arrangement series by H.M. Ward has had over 20 New York Times bestsellers and over 30 USA Today bestsellers, plus it's sold almost 13 million books in three short years. This is your chance to see the characters you know and love in the flesh.Many of you have already heard of our struggles with finding the perfect home for Sean Ferro. Despite our best efforts to find the perfect traditional film studio to bring The Arrangement to life, this has been the response every time: I'm sorry, but this is too dark for us.I get it. The Ferro series at its core is about the rawness of humanity and what we're willing to do to survive. Sometimes it's not pretty.The Arrangement series is an evocative journey with real rawness and grit. It twists together family, survival, and sexuality into a tight knot. That's why you love it.Removing the darkness of the central character ruins the story. There, I said it. I admit it. I can not see how anyone would want to watch a lighter version of this series. Then, I thought I was just another author in love with her own voice, so I asked you guys. Should we tame things down and brighten them up a little bit?You answered LOUDLY.KEEP SEAN FERRO DARK.These are only a tiny fraction of the replies on this topic. Opinions came flooding in quickly, along with multiple requests to start a crowdfunding campaign to raise the money. You want to keep Sean the way he is in the books, darkness and all. You didn't want to tame that and I can't blame you.In fact, I agree with you. There are some things that can change from book to film, but without the darkness that shrouds Sean Ferro, there is no story. It becomes diluted and loses meaning. You pointed that out along with all the extreme contrast between Sean and Avery. If we were to take a lighter path with the film version that would be lost, too. Then you suggested that we do it using Kickstarter, so here we are!This campaign gives you the chance to bring Sean and Avery to life in an episodic screenplay and get a glimpse into their spectacularly broken world with Sean Ferro fully intact.This Kickstarter is to fund the creation of the script. I've selected a talented, experienced female screenwriter who gets Sean and Avery. She loves the Ferro world and all its dark, sexy details.To make it perfectly clear: I AM NOT WRITING THE SCRIPT. I tried that and with all honesty at this point in my career, I'm a novelist, not a screenwriter. There is a difference, which is why I selected someone with experience and talent.The math: The script costs $10,000 to create. Hey, Holly, why are we only raising $7,999, then? Because I've already donated a little over 20% of the script budget in the amount of $2,001. That leaves us with $7,999 to raise, which is the goal of this Kickstarter.Another major fan concern was remaining faithful to the steamy parts of this tale. If we do it this way, the author you know and love is the one overseeing the script creation. I can make sure it is dark, tasteful, hot, and in line with my original vision that you love so much.Sexy scenes are part of a love story and a major part of this series. You won't have to worry about having those encounters toned down. In addition to that, you'll get more insight into Sean Ferro, his mannerisms, his personality, and his family. You'd like to know him better and this is a great way to do that.Look at the list of rewards, select the thing or amount you're happy to offerand click to contribute (upper right side onyourdesktop, or bottom of thepage on mobile).If you'd like to give an amount without getting a prize, that's awesome too. Donations can be made by clicking 'make a pledge without a reward' at upper right side of the page (desktop). The funds you donate aren't watered down in order to send out rewards and we'll fund the entire thing much faster.Every single dollar helps. And I know you're thinking a single dollar doesn't matter. Sometimes I feel that way too, but if 7,999 people all contribute $1, that's it. We'll hit our goal in a blink. Holly, that's a lot of people. I know, but Sean has a huge following with almost 60,000 facebook fans. Every single pledge helps in a huge way. This is a place where YOU do make a difference. The premium deluxe hardcover and collector's paperback are pictured so you can see what they look like and the cover design. Please note that some perks are cumulative.

SHARING IS SO IMPORTANT! REMEMBER TO SHARE!If we don't raise the total amount of funding designated for the goal, this project will NOT be made.You will not be charged. I never see your credit card number (that info is secure with Kickstarter). There will be no movie, no script, no nothing. Total suckage. Seriously.But why? Because if we don't have enough people interested to meet the $7,999 threshold then there aren't enough people interested in viewing the series to warrant creating the movie.How can you help? Make sure all your Ferro friends know this is going on and that they can help shape the movie! Click the share buttons and spread the word!You made this series what it is today. You shaped the storyline. This is your chance to see Sean's swagger and hear that rich voice. Your excitement will do wonders for this project, which means Sean will come to life that much faster.Sean Ferro is the hero in the wildly successful New York Times & USA Today Bestselling seriesThe Arrangementby H.M. Ward.In the event that you have a Ferro fan as a friend or you stumbled on this page and you'd love to know more about this series to see if you want to be involved, you can get the first ebook for FREE (reg. $2.99).To get the ebook, just head over here. The ebook will be delivered to your inbox in a matter of moments so you can see what all the fuss is about for yourself.There's no risk because if you don't enjoy it, it was free. If you like it, you can come back over, select a reward level if desired, and jump in chatting with other Ferro fans and be part of something amazing!The Arrangement is a fan-driven series where fans were able to shape the storyline by interacting with the author, H.M. Ward, via social media. People talk to me. I'm not a totally scary person, so a fan-driven series (as crazy as that sounds) worked really well. Plus lots of fans made amazing friends along the way.Remember finding your first Ferro Friend? *nostalgic twinkle in eye* Friendships formed across cities, countries, and even oceans because it doesn't matter who you are or where you live, Sean Ferro is that appealing. You shaped the books and voted to keep them dark, unsuppressed, and raw. Now you get to have the same impact on the movie.You were thinking it and you should. If I'm asking for your hard-earned money than it's only fair that I tell you how I'm helping with this project.Yes, I am contributing a lot of time and money to this project. I'm donating $2,001 USD of my own money toward the script goal, which is 20% of the script budget. It will help us get the script made that much faster!That means I'm doing what you are and putting my money into creating a movie that will portray The Arrangement series in a way that is loyal to the books and exciting to the readers. Instead of walking away from a film where you feel let down because so much was cut out, we can make something that amplifies the books and remains true to the author's vision. That means more authentic Sean Ferro moments, just for you!You will NOT be charged until February 4th, 2017 when the campaign ends.  That means you can bid today to hold whichever reward you like and then pay for it on February 4th.Make sure your final pledge is in place before the campaign ends. We do NOT use a pledge manager so please manually back the project before the end date.These are the ways to help make sure Sean Ferro comes to life and we have an amazing movie!Thank you so much for your time and consideration. If every Ferro fan donates a dollar we can easily hit this goal, and with your help anything is possible. Please help spread the word so that we can make the Ferro family come to life. Thank you so much for your donation and taking the time to read and share this project! You are the type of person who makes being an Indie awesome! It's all about you and it always has been. Rock on!*Waves* Peace out peeps! Let's rock this!","My goal is to move quickly, but I will NOT sacrifice quality to do so. Screenwriting is a creative process and we need to give the writer the time needed to make sure everything is amazing.  There is a lot of coordination involved for the stretch goals which can slow things down a little bit. Although I have experienced help with this project, this is my first-time completing a Kickstarter and venturing into film. There will be hiccups, and I'll work my way through them and thank you ahead of time for your patience and good humour.Updates about this project will be posted here in detail and major issues or highlights will be posted on my facebook page.

We like to go where things are happening, and kicking off 2014, the big events are the Orlando HamCation in February, and the Dayton Hamvention® in May. With your help, we'll go to both (again) and make some Tour and Interview programs that will show you the people and stuff that make these events special.We've been to both hamfests for several years running (Dayton back to 2007!). You've probably seen some of the video, but here's are links to take you to the start of last year's Orlando and Dayton coverage.So why a KICKSTARTER this time? Easy. You need the threat... er, incentive, to provide the funding to make it happen. Past years, we've shelled out the cash to go, produced the shows, and then asked you to contribute. Some of you did (awesome)! But not nearly enough. And as much fun as it is, we're kind of out of money. The gas stations, hotels and restaurants all want their slice. And frankly so do we (that's Gary, Jeff, Cyndi and Cliff).We've included 10 ""Corporate Underwriting"" reward level opportunities at $500. That should be affordable enough that some smaller (or bigger) Ham Radio enterprises can get a short message out to our audience, riding our train of quality with a little sass. Drop us a note if you have an idea or question: kn4aq@arvn.tv. If this is successful, we'll extend the model to cover some of the other events coming up, like the ARRL National Convention in July, the Huntsville Hamfest in August, and maybe a few others.HamRadioNow and our ""parent"" ARVN have made over 140 really good shows for and about Ham Radio (and one or two stinkers) – head and shoulders above everyone else in both quantity and quality. We need your eyeballs and your cash to keep going. Thanks! - Gary KN4AQ","There are a few things that can get in the way. We (Gary, Jeff, Cliff) can get sick or injured. We can have ""catastrophic"" transportation failure (don't wanna think what that can be). Our video hardware can go up in smoke. Really bad weather or other calimity can cause the hamfests to be curtailed or cancelled. So far, our track record is 100% (success, not failure). Someday something's going to mess up, but odds are low.",https://www.kickstarter.com/projects/860504337/hamradionow-video-of-the-2014-arrl-tapr-dcc?ref=discovery_category_newest,860504337/hamradionow-video-of-the-2014-arrl-tapr-dcc,"The ARRL and TAPR Digital Communications Conferenceis an annual, three-day event that covers just about everything digital in Amateur Radio - hardware, software, operation. TAPR's roots are in packet radio in the 1980's, and that's still around, but their scope has widened dramatically to include software defined radio, digital voice, and all the data modes in use in ham radio. At the DCC, you'll see the first hints of what will be mainstream in ten or twenty years.HamRadioNow.tv produced high quality video of the DCC in 2008 and 2009 (released on DVD), and 2011, 2012 and 2013 (released on high-definition streaming video). We covered every talk, including the Saturday banquet ""keynote"" and the Sunday Seminar, usually a four-hour ""deep dive"" into a single subject. It's been an invaluable resource for hams who weren't able to attend the sessions, and even for hams who were there in person and wanted a review.In 2014, the DCC is in Austin, TX, far from our base in North Carolina. We'd love to produce video of this year's DCC (and TAPR would love for us to do it), but we need your support. Our $8,000 goal is about ""break-even"" for our expenses and a reasonable return on production and editing time.So the deal is simple: we meet our goal, we head to Austin and produce the video. We don't meet our goal: we stay home. Last year, you and our ""corporate underwriters"" met the goal and then some.And if we significantly exceed our goal, we'll spend some extra time on the road shooting stories about exceptional hams somewhere along the route between Austin and Raleigh, NC.Almost as important as making a pledge is letting other hams know about this KICKSTARTER campaign! Please spread the word, on mailing lists, forums, Facebook, Twitter... any place you think hams will be interested in helping us produce the video, and won't feel too badly spammed.","HamRadioNow has successfully produced DCC videos five times, so we've got a perfect track record (knock wood). Risks include the health of the producer, Gary Pearce KN4AQ (he's in pretty good shape!), severe transportation delays that prevent him and his equipment from arriving in Austin, and ""catastrophic"" on-site equipment failure, since this is a one-time, live event. Sadly, these risks are ""killer"" (er... sorry about the health-thing, Gary. We don't mean it literally), and would make it impossible to complete the project."

A mixture of horror, Sci-Fi and dark humour combined with spectacular scenery and amazing practical effects.Our film stars Darren McAree (The Slayers, Crispy's Curse), Ricky Tomlinson (The Royale Family, Nativity etc), George Newton (This is England, Dead Mans Shoes, The Slayers) and many more to be announced soon.The film will feature practical make up effects from world renowned special effects Artist Gary Pollard (Alien 3, Labyrinth , Slaughterhouse Rulez, The Fifth Element, The Harry Potter series, Game Of Thrones, Dr Who, Star Wars - Episode 1 and many more. Gary will also take charge in building the fearsome werewolf for the film, a totally original design and one that will live long into the memory.The film is written and directed by multi award winning director and producer John Williams, whose previous credits include the feature films The Mothertown, Crispy's Curse and the Slayers. Co-producing is the talented Claire Ward.Here is my showreel for an example of my workTales Of The Creeping Death tells the story of Goose, a seasoned hitman who responds to a call, but this is not the kind of call he was expecting.Deep into the bowels of the English countryside stands an old gothic mansion, within it waits Harold. Harold is a very old, disabled gentlemen who has called upon the services of Goose. Why on earth would a elderly man like Harold require the services of a hitman? Harold explains as they sit by the grand fireplace, his face glowing from flickering flames "" You need to keep me alive until 3am"" commands Harold, he continues ""Nobody is coming to kill me and I live alone""""He's clearly nuts"" thinks the confused Goose as he relaxes in the large chair by the fire as the growing storm thunders and cracks outside, ready to collect his easy money.To pass the time, Harold begins to read aloud from a large book of old newspaper clippings, each one making up the four terrifying Tales Of The Creeping Death. Only until the very end will we find out the mystery behind Harold and his invitation to Goose.Some Examples And Lots MoreIn Tales Of The Creeping Death, Billy Cook (Traveller, Eat Locals, Ripper Street) gives a terrific and emotional performance as a happy go lucky young man celebrating his birthday with his friends, needless to say things turn out in a unexpected and unwelcome way.Also starring is Darren McAree (The Slayers, Crispy's Curse) is set to play the social misfit that is Shane Lymer, Darren is a very talented character actor who is set for a bright future.Also, turning his hand at horror is the wonderful Ricky Tomlinson (The Royale Family, Nativity) in probably his most bizarre role to date.We also welcome back George Newton (This Is England, Dead Mans Shoes) in the ever increasing cast. More to be announced very soon.Easily the biggest challenge in creating the film is the special make up effects so, I am incredibly humbled to have on board world renowned special effects artist and sculptor Gary Pollard. Gary, along with his team, has already created some outstanding effects for the film and is chomping at the bit to begin work on the films fearsome werewolf. This will NOT be some guy running around in a werewolf mask howling at people, this will be something much more and will be something like you have never seen. Gary needs no introduction but this part of the pitch would look odd without one so here are a few examples of the work that Gary has done over the years.We need your help to complete production and post-production on what is my most ambitious film yet, featuring a full bloodied Werewolf attack on unsuspecting and packed Bingo hall.With your support, we can complete our film with all the grandeur and scale we envisage, and market it so that we can show it to the widest audience possible. We've used our own money so far, along with support from our friends, without who we would not have got close to this point, but to complete production and to finish post-production, we need your help. I have dedicated everything to creating fresh, exciting, and, above all else, original horror films, but because of this, i do struggle to get mainstream funding. The only way that these off the cuff, risky films get made and released, is with the support of fans like you. So, we sincerely hope you'll join us on our exciting adventure, and help us to show the world that there is an appetite out there for original stories that are done in a way that challenges the norm. In return for your support, we'll work tirelessly to produce rewards that you'll be proud to own, and films that you'll love to watch. Every penny we get we will match with our own blood, sweat and tears as we devote ourselves to making Tales Of The Creeping Death my best film yet. Because of the way kickstarter works, if we don't hit the target..we get nothing..squat..zilch! So its all or nothing.Should we go over our target, rest assured every extra penny will go towards extending the werewolf massacre, the more we get the more werewolf action you get.Every single person who takes advantage of our lovely perks will be entered into a prize draw that will be picked at random at the end of the campaign, if of course we reach our target.

Every cent of your contribution will cover paying the authors, cover artist, and music artists FIRST.This is a PAYING publication. Contributors get paid for their work. As Harlan Ellison said: ""PAY THE WRITER!"" Everyone gets paid BEFORE I (the publisher/editor) do.What You Get & Why So Few Rewards?You get EXACTLY what is in the right-hand column (eZine and images) in a timely fashion -- early December.The reason I don't offer more is because I am a one-man show. I am not a large company which is going to add ""stretch goals"" (which are usually not real stretch goals, simply carrots dangling from sticks to make people dig deeper into their pockets). I am about giving a great product at a greater price. Thank you for understanding.Of course, if you have questions, ask!Is there a print version?No, I'm sorry. At this time, there is not. FMO is a high-quality PDF you can print out though.

Our pops are made with fresh fruits that are in season. Sorry folks, no flavors such as Watermelon Cooler or Cherry Cardamom in winter!It’s also about supporting local farmers and small entrepreneurs just like usin the beautiful province of Alberta.

Yes we are a small vendor, but with a big heart! We want to bring a positive contribution in our community one popsicle at a time. Our“pops for a good cause” campaign was a huge success.

Some of our pops contain chunks of fresh fruits while others are moreintricate with chocolate dipping, various toppings and different layers. Two recently created flavors (Cookies N' Cream pop andChocolate Banana Hempsicle)where we pushed the boundaries of a traditional popsicle were well received by customers at the farmers' market we attend. The reason behind the successful introduction of these unique flavors is because we used locallysourcedcookies and hemp. Why popsicles? It’s Fun Fun Fun! So you wonder how we made over 80 flavors since February 2015? The answer is quite simple: we create new flavors every week and aftergetting the nodapproval form our testers (family & friends), we bring them to the farmers' markets we attend.We also have fun by presenting a new art work onour menu board every week. Most of these are works are done by our little nephewsand nieces. But I must admit that adults too have fun drawing onthe chalk board.

They shared an interest in Bluetooth Technology and started creating wireless devices as a hobby (Yeah, it’s kinda nerdy, we know.) What was once a hobby followed them in to the work place, where they became engineers at companies like Intel and Emota. They loved the work, but they wanted to see the full potential of their own talent and skill. They moved to San Francisco and began consulting as MbientLab, building hardware for companies looking to use wireless technology to help others lead happy lives.Around this time, wearable technology started creating a buzz in the design world. Laura and Matt were excited that the technology they were already working with could play a role in the next wave of devices, but the first wearables proved to be disappointing. Early smart watches were clunky, and early headgear was too futuristic for some. They wanted to bring the masses into the world of wearables in a way that would seamlessly improve the awesome things people were already doing.And so, Cubit was born!Still working under contracts to help pay their ridiculously high San Francisco rent, MbientLab forged ahead with a mission to Cubit. Laura and Matt gathered a small team of young and excited professionals around them. We rolled up our sleeves and got to work. Check out some of the 3D renderings below to see what some of our first ideas looked like! Next came many, many late nights building and prototyping in our studio (well, ok, our “studio” was actually the top floor of our house). Hundreds of design improvements and thousands of Diet Coke cans later, we had finally created an awesome, progressive wearable device. With the technology and design in place, we developed our first batches of prototypes (check out those below too!), finalized our model, and put in a call to our manufacturing partners to let them know that Cubit was on it’s way! We launched on Kickstarter in November 2013, and with the help of amazing fans like you, we made millions happy, broke world records for high pledges, and changed the face of affordable, wearable technology forever! And we all lived happily ever after!(Ok, the last paragraph may be made up… But with an awesome product like Cubit, who’s to say it can’t happen?)Cubit has already been two years in the making. The Cubit that you see in the video is a real, working prototype. It has been especially crafted to be manufactured in large quantities and we've already met with our manufacturing partner, who is incredibly excited to start the process. Cubit is all ready to go, we just need your help to get it out of the factory. We can't wait for you to have one!Check out our bio and get to know us!Check out http://kickingitforward.org","""Wow, you guys are gonna have to sell a lot of Cubits!""The Mbientlab team is very excited and proud of Cubit as a product, and we set our financial goal high to reflect its value. Our Kickstarter goal may seem lofty, but we're willing to take the risk because we intend on seeing Cubit all way through to completion.We see project after project on Kickstarter that doesn't estimate costs correctly, or underestimates the value of what's being made. The end result is a great idea that's never produced.We work hard to be a responsible and passionate company that is absolutely serious about production and delivering the best product to our customers. So far, we're doing great. We want you to know that Cubit is not ""in-progress"", it is a finished product just waiting to be unleashed!Our ambitious financial goals reflect the researched information and real world pricing that can actually mass produce Cubit and bring it to you.

It comes in a tiny form factor to fit any product and is manufacturing ready, certified, and cost optimized.All you have to do is create an iOS or Android App and in minutes, you have a production quality Bluetooth Low Energy product you can sell!With MetaWear, You can create hardware that connects to a Smartphone effortlessly.Everything works right out of the box so you can build prototypes fast and effortlessly.Simply download or fork the API on Github, pick and choose the sensors you want to use on the MetaWear board, customize your App, turn on LEDs and get feedback from the accelerometer and voila!You have a functional product with hardware and a mobile App!You can check out how easy it is to get started with our LED Toggle Demo here.We love development boards, they are great for prototyping but they can only take you so far. Traditional development boards have a lot of shortcomings including size, cost, and scalability. A Raspberry-PI doesn't fit into a necklace, a bracelet, or a shirt. You cannot send an Arduino prototype to a factory or ship it to your customers door.MetaWear removes the step between prototype and fabrication; it is built with simplicity and manufacturability in mind. The board has beencost and BOM optimized so you can easily make 1 or 1 million.The antenna on the board has been CE and FCC certified by a professional TCB lab in California. This makes it easier if your are selling your MetaWear based product and reduces your expenses and paperwork.We take the hardware development out of your product and reduce prototyping time and cost by more than 90%.MetaWear is only 17mm x 26mm.The micro form-factor means you are free to embedded the board in any device, no matter how small.There are no limitations anymore, MetaWear is so tiny it can be embedded into a t-shirt, watch, bracelet, key-chains, glasses, even jewelry.We created MetaWear because we love building things; especially Smartphone and Bluetooth connected things. So while the kit is fun enough on its own; it is the projects you can build with MetaWear that really excite us.Here are just a few examples of what you could build:These are just a few of the projects that we have imagined. We will be sharing these ideas, and any others hacks we build in the future, through Kickstarter updates and on our site.Our developer friendly API means you control the MetaWear board from an iOS or Android App.The API is all about Bluetooth connectivity and leveraging sensor data from your MetaWear board to any Android or iOS Smartphone. With the API you can connect the MetaWear board to any BLE (Bluetooth Low Energy) smart device seamlessly.You control all peripherals, sensors, and IOs using simple function calls over BLE.Just download our documentation and sample Apps from Github and get started. It's that simple.Do you want to toggle the LED On and Off using a random color? There is one API call for that.Need accelerometer data for your Fitness Tracker? There is one API call to enable the accelerometer and one callback to get the X,Y,Z data.We wrote the firmware on the ARM Core for you. That frees you up to focus on your App and the user experience of your product.Now all you have to do is customize the MetaWear sample iOS or Android App for your application.We don't want your beta testers to see a bare PCB board so we make it easy by providing you with CAD enclosures that fit the MetaWear board.Get on the MbientLab MetaWear store on shapeways.com and print our MetaWear ready enclosures.You can choose from shapes including a heart pendant, a bracelet, a pill-box, or a simple rectangular case to complete your MetaWear based product.Now you are only hours away from a fully demonstrable prototype.This board packs a punch in a tiny form-factor; there's nothing you can't build with MetaWear.The MetaWear basic platform comes with the MetaWear board, a rechargeable USB battery, a coin vibrator, and a buzzer. Keep what you want, leave out what you don't.The MetaWear kit comes with the MetaWear board, a rechargeable USB battery, a coin vibrator, extra goodies, and a surprise bonus accessory you will get when we ship.We don't want you to be limited in any way so MetaWear was built for everyone; professional and learners alike.There's even extra GPIOs and an I2C bus you can use to add additional sensors to the board. You can add an LCD screen, a Heart Rate sensor, or a gyroscope and extend MetaWear's functionality.We are a team of engineers, designers, and thinkers who wanted to help lower the barrier to creating compelling Smartphone connected hardware. Many people have been involved in various ways, but the core team members are Matt and Laura.We've been building connected hardware and consumer products for a long time and we really love doing it. We are BLE and embedded devices experts and we wanted to help future hardware developers, engineers, hackers, tinkerers, and Makers.We set out to build a different kind of development board. We don't have the time or the budget to build custom PCBs for every project and we hate ripping apart our prototypes to salvage components. Most dev boards are simply too big and power hungry for many projects where we only need a few pins and sensors. And so MetaWear was born!GENERAL SPECSHARDWARE SPECS","There are always significant challenges in manufacturing and delivering any hardware product at scale. Mass manufacturing isn't the same as prototype development; besides making the Metawear board work, we have to make sure they are secure and reliable, and that they can be manufactured efficiently at larger volumes.Fortunately, we've have been working hard and established relationships with manufacturing partners in the US and China that will help us bring Metawear to your doorstep. Plus, the Metawear does not require the same tooling expenses and long lead times that products with injection molded enclosures require, which significantly decreases our fixed costs and delivery timeline.Of course, there are still risks associated with producing the Metawear board. Unexpected changes in component lead times, availability, and cost are examples of factors outside our direct control that could affect our delivery timeline, but we are working hard to mitigate those risks and plan to be transparent throughout the delivery process.The other risk with this and any other project that involves physical delivery comes with shipping. There are a number of unforeseen circumstances that can cause problems during the actual physical shipping of the Metawear boards. We plan to work with proven companies to help ensure that our boards arrive (in perfect condition) at their delivery destination. Since unforeseen circumstances can sometimes impact the shipping world, we will also make sure to have methods/resources in place to overcome any difficulties."

The first launched on iPhone in 2011 and two sequels have since been published. All three have been featured by Apple and made appearances on several prominent blogs. Cavorite 2 even appeared in Wired Magazine's 2012 App Guide!The games are loosely inspired by H.G. Wells' First Men in the Moon. In Cascadia Games' interpretation, Dr. Cavor is a world traveler and gentleman scientist whose biggest -- and possibly last -- adventure takes him to the moon where he encounters the nefarious Selenite inhabitants of the lunar underworld. The gameplay can best be described as a mix of Professor Fizzwizzle and Super Mario 2.It's no secret that while iOS represents a huge slice of the mobile market, Android devices make up the bulk of smartphones in distribution today. We believe there is a now large enough game market for us to start taking our games to these devices.There's an old Internet stereotype that ""nerds"" prefer Android. If that's so, then the brainy Cavorite games should fit right in with this audience! (We're definitely nerds at Cascadia Games.) And if not, the games are still fun for anyone who is a fan of either the puzzle or platformer genres.We're looking to bring these games to Android 4.1 ""Jelly Bean""and newer.$10,000 -If we can hit this funding amount, we'll bring the game to Ouya and MOJO. It's often said that the Cavorite games are very good on touch screens but great with physical controls like iCade or GameDock. We think the Cavorite series would be awesome on these machines.You can find out more about the games here on DrCavor.com. If you or your friends have an iOS device, the games can be checked out on the App Store using the links below. Or view the games' trailers:","There are many more devices, screen sizes, and so forth on Android, making it a harder environment to make games for than iOS. The good news is that because we've already made games for 3.5"" and 4"" iPhones, iPads, and Macs, our current Cavorite builds can support 4:3 to 16:9 aspect ratios without issue. What we won't know, however, is exactly which devices will work and which won't until we start developing. We expect there to be minimal issues on newer phones and tablets. But beyond that, we'll just have to figure it out as we go.Because we're delving into the unknown, there could also be delays in the project's delivery date if we run into unforeseen problems with the port.",https://www.kickstarter.com/projects/cascadiagames/moon-raider-fast-paced-2d-action-platform-game?ref=discovery_category_newest,cascadiagames/moon-raider-fast-paced-2d-action-platform-game,"Moon Raider is a colorful, action-packed adventure game beneath the surface of the moon.Ava is the young daughter of the brilliant-but-aging scientist Dr. Cavor and Selene, the former queen of the moon. As a selenite, Selene's life depends on the special energy only moon gems can provide. With none left and time running out, Dr. Cavor enlists his daughter to raid the moon of as many gems as she can find!Ava must survive the treacherous catacombs deep beneath the surface of the moon. Her enemies, a legion of corrupt aliens that now rule the moon with force, are far less primitive than they first appear. Their world is full of terrifying technology, deadly traps, and armed soldiers at the ready. Ava soon realizes that the only way to save her mother is to save the moon from itself.Ava Cavor is a 15 year old, half-alien girl. As an earthling, she has always felt small and weak. Once on the moon, however, she gains the strength she never knew she had!Avery ""Aphid"" Cavor is the 11 year old, younger brother of Ava. Much like Ava, this small half-alien boy only discovers his true power when exposed to lunar crystal energy!Dr. Henry Cavor was the first man on the moon. He is the inventor of cavorite, an anti-gravity spray that allowed him to journey to the moon -- and ultimately escape it!The Wanderers are a group of intra-solar explorers who have been imprisoned on the moon by the selenites, who seek to drain their rockets of gem energy. Ava can find and free the 10 different variety of these beings as she explores.Selenites come in several varieties from primitive spear-wielders to armored guards with blasters.Royal Selenites rule the moon with a giant, green fist! They are an even bigger selenite variety and often come with extra dangerous powers.Moon Monsters come in all shapes and sizes. If you run into a small one, you can be confident you'll run into a bigger one!Cybernetic Monsters are monster-machine chimeras created by the selenites to get in the way of any intruders.Mega Machines were built by the selenites for the purpose of mining and processing gems for energy. But watch out, they are gigantic and very dangerous.Funds will be used to develop more key art, particularly for the game's story, as well as to afford the team extra time to polish the game. The game has been self-funded up to this point and worked on for years. We want this to be the best it can be!","Because the game is already over 90% complete, we are confident that we can finish it on-time this year. With that said, there are always risks in software development. Delays can happen. While the game has already been approved for publication on consoles,  it hasn't yet been handed off to the port studio. As such, we don't know how long it will take to pass QA and certification on consoles. We will also need to work with the port studio on how to deliver download keys for consoles."

It requires a “digital to analog/audio” converter (otherwise known as DAC) to turn those files into sound that you can hear.Portable device manufacturers (smartphones, tablets, laptops) use the most basic, internal DACs possible, because DACs drain the device’s battery.So, while headphones have improved, that improvement does you no good if you use them through the headphone jack/DAC of your device.That’s why OnBlink has created the OnBlink Mini Amplifier and the OnBlink Plus Digital to Analog (DAC) Converter and Amplifier.The OnBlink Mini Amplifier and the OnBlink Plus has to be plugged into the headphone jack of your device. The Amplifier will amp up the sound to a great extent. The OnBlink Plus Digital to Analog (DAC) converter will deliver amazing sound quality that you just don’t hear from the device’s internal DAC.The size of your headphones dictates, to some extent, whether an amp may be needed. Most earbuds and in-ear headphones are typically very efficient and are less likely to have any benefits from an amp. Larger headphones, on the other hand, will benefit, or even require, a headphone amp to reach audible volume levels with portable players.We have created a supply unit which can split output power far more stably in headphones. Other amplifier divide the power when connected with 2 headphones, but we designed 2 power lines to both the output jack which helps OnBlink mini and OnBlink plus to achieve incredible level of performance even when both the headphones are connected. Large size amp which are used for concerts have been using such technology from years, but this is the first time such a technology is introduced in such a portable size. This technology helps to run both the headphones of their maximum ohm.Onblink plus uses the same outer body like many other amplifier in the market and there is a reason for that. That uni-body design helps to completely seal the chip of the DAC+AMP which does not interferes with portable device antenna. We noticed a sound interferance and disturbance in headphone before every incoming calls, that sound was the DAC getting affected by the portable device antenna. Hence we decide to use a uni-body design which completely isolates the chips from the reductions of the antenna. Few other reason pushed us to use the design was its compactness, durability and elegancy. This design also fits in our size of Advanced circuit and has ample of space to fit in a huge Lithium-ion batteries. This outer body which is readily available also brings down the cost exceedingly thus reducing the production delay altogether.Other companies only have AMP in such a small and compact size. As we used Advanced circuit design using the latest IC technology, we could fit both the DAC and AMP in Onblink Plus. This has completely changed the Audio industry and has exceedingly enhanced your hearing experience. We have invested 2 years just to refine Onblink plus.Onblink is the world’s smallest AMP + splitter, we have created a custom circuit for maximum performance, this changes the complete audio output circuits. We have successfully placed an audio chip TI OPA 1612 in such a small chamber. This technology would be hard for counterfeiter to even try.

Once only worn in Pakistan, the Peshawari Chappal have now become increasingly popular and are worn by fashion-lovers across the globe.We want to ensure that the cultural origins of the Peshawari Chappal are credited and preserved. That’s why our ladies sandals are designed in Britain and handcrafted in Pakistan, by artisans who are fairly paid for their craft.In 2014, the Peshawari Chappal became the focus of a worldwide fashion debate when British designer Sir Paul Smith created a similar shoe, retailing at £300, which caused thousands of complaints on social media saying the shoe appropriated the culture and craft of its original Pakistani makers. After a strongly supported petition towards the designer and UK government, the shoe’s description on the website was changed to say it was “inspired by Peshawari Chappal”.As a British-born Pakistani, I want to combat the disrespectful stealing of cultural ideas in fashion without any due credit. The Peshawari Chappal is a sandal that I have fond memories of wearing throughout my life, at celebrations like Eid and family weddings as well as day to day. It’s my dream to modernise this traditional sandal: by maintaining the cultural heritage of Pakistan and introducing the shoes to women around the world who would love to wear them too.We’re putting this dream into action through everything we do as a business; right down to our name, Çaplait. The Peshawari Chappal is called “saplay” by the local people in the region of Pakistan where the sandal originates. We wanted to honour Pakistani heritage by keeping the traditional name, while adding our own modern and fashionable twist with a French translation.We currently have three core sandal designs for women: the Jisti, the Swati, and the Hara. Take a browse through our full collection - which would you pick?As a special bonus for our Kickstarter backers, we have added these beautiful, hand embroidered Jisti Wall Hangers and Jisti Scarfs to our collection. These gifts are only available for our Kickstarter supporters and will not be sold elsewhere!So, how did we create our designs? Traditionally the Peshawari Chappal is a man’s shoe, designed in plain, dark colours. We’ve adapted the shoes into beautiful, colourful designs that can be worn by women. We want for women wearing our shoes to feel like they’re giving something back to a culture, while owning a unique and special piece of fashion.The designs have been inspired by traditional embroidery called Phulkari, a type of embroidery practiced throughout many regions in Pakistan. Phulkari emblems traditionally take inspiration from life in the villages, so typically feature geometric patterns from everyday life and motifs like wheat and barley heads.All of our sandals are handcrafted using the highest quality, genuine leather and suede, as well as being embroidered with cotton.To bring our ideas to life, we’re working with renowned shoe designer Jessica Beecham. Born in Argentina, raised in London and trained in Italy, Jessica has been working in the industry for over a decade and brings a multicultural background and hybrid versatility to her designs.If you have any questions about sizing, please email info@caplaitshoes.com. From the off, we are placing the Peshawari Chappal artisans at the heart of everything we do. The Peshawari Chappal would not exist without the multi-talented Pakistani artisans who craft them. This is not fast fashion. Our major motivator for this campaign is to ensure that the artisans are working in ethical conditions, are properly credited and fairly paid for their creations.Handcrafted footwear is a dying trade. The artisans in Pakistan that we’re working with are worried that their craft, which has been passed down across the generations, is losing out to large commercial factories. By supporting Çaplait Shoes, you’ll be financially helping the Pakistani artisans to continue creating these beautiful shoes. None of the work we’re aiming to achieve will be possible without the support of our Kickstarter backers, so to show our gratitude we’ve got some fantastic rewards on offer! Here are the rewards you’ll be receiving by pledging to support our Kickstarter campaign.If we raise over and above our £10k target, here’s what we’ll be able to achieve:We’ve already had brilliant feedback from the designers, stockists and customers who have seen prototypes of our shoes and learnt about our company mission.""It's fresh! Very chic, comfortable and affordable all at once with a very beautiful story to tell."" -Jessica Beecham, Luxury Footwear Designer""A passion for ethical production and appreciation of good design is rare in the fashion industry, Çaplait Shoes are a unique company"" -Alice Selwood, Textile Designer""In the current world of fast-fashion, handcraft skills are quickly being forgotten. I believe it is so important to hold onto these skills and introduce quality products back to the western market. I’m extremely proud to be a part of Çaplait as the goal is not only to create a brand of beautiful items, but also to give back to the communities in Pakistan who are blessed with these incredible skills."" -Charlotte Crombie, Textile Designer""You just cannot ignore the brilliant creativity and imagination shown by Çaplait’s design team - a blend of modern and traditional design, while never forgetting the heart and soul of the Peshawari sandal."" -Anser Wasim, Director at Quadri GroupHere’s a little look at how we’ll be spending the money we fundraise.All of our backers should expect to receive their rewards within three months of our Kickstarter campaign ending.

The Peshawari Chappal is a sandal that I have fond memories of wearing throughout my life, at celebrations like Eid and family weddings as well as day to day. It’s my dream to modernise this traditional sandal: by maintaining the cultural heritage of Pakistan and introducing the shoes to women around the world who would love to wear them too. We’re putting this dream into action through everything we do as a business; right down to our name, Çaplait. The Peshawari Chappal is called “saplay” by the local people in the region of Pakistan where the sandal originates. We wanted to honour Pakistani heritage by keeping the traditional name, while adding our own modern and fashionable twist with a French translation. We currently have three core sandal designs for women: the Jisti, the Swati, and the Hara. Take a browse through our full collection - which would you pick?  As a special bonus for our Kickstarter backers, we have added these beautiful, hand embroidered Jisti Wall Hangers and Jisti Scarfs to our collection. These gifts are only available for our Kickstarter supporters and will not be sold elsewhere!So, how did we create our designs? Traditionally the Peshawari Chappal is a man’s shoe, designed in plain, dark colours. We’ve adapted the shoes into beautiful, colourful designs that can be worn by women. We want for women wearing our shoes to feel like they’re giving something back to a culture, while owning a unique and special piece of fashion.The designs have been inspired by traditional embroidery called Phulkari, a type of embroidery practiced throughout many regions in Pakistan. Phulkari emblems traditionally take inspiration from life in the villages, so typically feature geometric patterns from everyday life and motifs like wheat and barley heads. All of our sandals are handcrafted using the highest quality, genuine leather and suede, as well as being embroidered with cotton. To bring our ideas to life, we’re working with renowned shoe designer Jessica Beecham. Born in Argentina, raised in London and trained in Italy, Jessica has been working in the industry for over a decade and brings a multicultural background and hybrid versatility to her designs. If you have any questions about sizing, please email info@caplaitshoes.com. From the off, we are placing the Peshawari Chappal artisans at the heart of everything we do. The Peshawari Chappal would not exist without the multi-talented Pakistani artisans who craft them. This is not fast fashion. Our major motivator for this campaign is to ensure that the artisans are working in ethical conditions, are properly credited and fairly paid for their creations.Handcrafted footwear is a dying trade. The artisans in Pakistan that we’re working with are worried that their craft, which has been passed down across the generations, is losing out to large commercial factories. By supporting Çaplait Shoes, you’ll be financially helping the Pakistani artisans to continue creating these beautiful shoes.None of the work we’re aiming to achieve will be possible without the support of our Kickstarter backers, so to show our gratitude we’ve got some fantastic rewards on offer! Here are the rewards you’ll be receiving by pledging to support our Kickstarter campaign. If we raise over and above our £10k target, here’s what we’ll be able to achieve: We’ve already had brilliant feedback from the designers, stockists and customers who have seen prototypes of our shoes and learnt about our company mission.""It's fresh! Very chic, comfortable and affordable all at once with a very beautiful story to tell."" - Jessica Beecham, Luxury Footwear Designer ""A passion for ethical production and appreciation of good design is rare in the fashion industry, Çaplait Shoes are a unique company"" - Alice Selwood, Textile Designer""In the current world of fast-fashion, handcraft skills are quickly being forgotten. I believe it is so important to hold onto these skills and introduce quality products back to the western market. I’m extremely proud to be a part of Çaplait as the goal is not only to create a brand of beautiful items, but also to give back to the communities in Pakistan who are blessed with these incredible skills."" - Charlotte Crombie, Textile Designer ""You just cannot ignore the brilliant creativity and imagination shown by Çaplait’s design team - a blend of modern and traditional design, while never forgetting the heart and soul of the Peshawari sandal."" - Anser Wasim, Director at Quadri GroupHere’s a little look at how we’ll be spending the money we fundraise.All of our backers should expect to receive their rewards within three months of our Kickstarter campaign ending. Here's our timeline of delivery for the project.With special thanks to:OK Production - Karachi Photography & FilmMASH Productions - Peshawar Photography & FilmMuzhaira Bibi -  Scarfs Production Manager Anser Wasim - Quadri Group Salman Alam Khan - Video EditingAllan Melia - Videographer & EditingLahcen Mellal - Model VideographyCharlotte Heather-Cray - Product PhotographyKirsty Furey - Product PhotographyEllie Rees - Social Media ManagementCorrie Jones - MarketingIsmail and Junaid - ""Ranra""Lastly, thank you so much to our backers for your support! ","We’ve got a whole team of passionate experts working to deliver this project and have done everything possible to minimise the risks involved. We’re already working with a host of artisans in Pakistan who have been crafting Peshawari Chappals for decades and have implemented quality control throughout the process (however, as each item is handmade our backers should expect slight variations). We want to work directly with the artisans and factories, but travel to Pakistan is expensive. Exceeding our Kickstarter goal will allow us to visit the factories and ensure product development is running to schedule. We’ve calculated all of our shipping costs and fees in advance, so that there shouldn’t be any unexpected surprises. However sometimes goods can get stuck in customs, which causes delays and increases import duty rates."

Everyday is full of creativity.  My workspace is my farm ... my farm creates my job ... my job feeds my creative soul ... my creative soul is fulfilled when Ishare. It comes full circle. One of the greatest gifts my work has given me are the people I have met along the way. I travel to shows, markets, and local yarn shops, sharing and teaching, laughing and gaining from them the inspiration and support to further in my endeavors. Every show is uniquely different. Some are more of a Farmer's Market set up, others are more Fiber Festival displays, and some boutique like. I attend shows that are inside and some that are outside, each requiring different ways to display various amounts of Hand-dyed Yarns, Knitting Kits, our Farm Calendars, Note Cards, and Needle Felting Kits. Secondly I am a teacher.  From simple beginner's classes in needle felting to more advanced personalized and unique felting projects, my students learn creative ways to sculpt using natural colored as well as hand-dyed wool, mohair, and alpaca fibers. I also teach fiber dyeing techniques for custom designed yarns and spinning batts. While teaching my classes, I spend time educating.  It's so enjoyable watching my students get excited and amazed with what they can do! Everyone is an artist if given the freedom to create! :)Its time to take Romney Ridge Yarns & Wool to the next level! It's a idea I have had for almost a year ... I want to bring more passion for color and lots of creativity to you!  Imagine a new way to arrive at a class with better options to serve my students, or to arrive at a show or market with a full selection of each line of yarn I produce in every color, and a better variety of our knit and felting kits. I have thoughtlong and hard about the best, most cost efficient and practical way to achieve this ... and this is what I have come up with. I have enjoyed meeting many of the food truck owners at the markets I attend.  I have looked at their very creative designs and talked with them about the logistics and have thought this might be a fun option, but it would be another engine to maintain and not a sensible option for traveling longer distances cost effectively or practically.  So how about this? .....I have been exploring a custom built cargo trailer that I can tow to shows, markets and to take to classes fully equipped and include a dyeing station! The design would allow me to stock the trailer as a traveling yarn and wool shop. It would be complete with skylights for lighting, wiring for electricity, shelving for products, a small sink and energy efficient electric burners for teaching and demonstrating at markets and classes! I have sketched out the design to utilize every space in and outside of the structure and customized it with a crisp clean interior and exterior in neutral colors I could even come to you if you would like to have a Fiber Arts block party in the Summer and Autumn months ... in the New England area for now :) I would also use my trailer for education, helping my customers to choose the best fiber for their projects with demos and displays explaining each attributing factor of each yarn, showing where it comes from, how it is best processed and what it can be best used for. I would even be able to include yarns from several of my fellow fiber farms offering an even better variety of small, unique, farm-grown yarns. With space and mobility like this the possibilities are endless! ","A good friend recently shared his enthusiasm for creativity and encouraged me to look into myself for the why, how and what of my own passion for creativity.   For many years I have been in love with color, structure, farming, sheep, fiber, and the simple earthy goodness I feel in my soul when I sit in the barn smelling the sweet sheepy air feeling the peacefulness of their presence.   With kindness and nurturing, they provide me with my medium.    From freshly shorn fleece, to carded fibers for spinning, to the simple twist of a strand of yarn wrapped around my needles, I am inspired to create from their gift of beautiful wool.   The colors I choose come from my surroundings. Be it the blues and greens of the salt marsh near my home, or the deep brick reds and neutral shades of stone that I enjoy when I visit the city.  Even the natural ombre shades of the sheep themselves excite me!  I consider my dyeing to have no rhyme or reason, but yet to let the inspirations from life dictate my palette.  My understanding of fibers and their best use comes from 16 years of working in the fiber industry, volunteering on sheep and wool associations, judging fleeces and fleece shows, attending educational seminars from the American Sheep Industry, and talking and learning from farmers and knitwear designers and you, my best teachers ... my customers.   I have spent almost a year researching this idea.   The only challenge I foresee  is organizing time to fit in all of the shows and markets and classes I wish to attend and teach. :)   But I have already committed to many starting in August once the trailer is up and ready to roll ... the skies the limit as I will be expanding my reach and excitement and passion for sheep, wool, yarn and design.

When her and a group of young counselors help rebuild the camp, it doesn't take long before they remember why it was shut down in the first place. These are Jason's woods, and anyone who enters must deal with the consequences.Reviving Camp Blood is a Friday the 13th Fan Film, set in 2018, 30 years after Camp Crystal Lake was closed up for good. While this does take place in the present, we still pay homage to the 80’s horror franchise we all know, and love.The script we have written includes extensive amounts of practical effects, as well as traditional filmmaking elements, which requires products that we as independent filmmakers just can't afford. Independent filmmaking is extremely difficult and expensive, and that’s where we need your help.Here is a breakdown of how your funds will be utilized:PRODUCTION: This will cover all of the equipment that we will use in the production of the film such as; cameras, sound, lighting, insurance, etc.MAKEUP AND EFFECTS: We are heavily relying on practical effects, rather than VFX, to make our kills, and our killer, look as realistic as possible.PROPS/WARDROBE/JASON COSTUME: This portion will help us dress our counselors and Jason, and buy all the props and weapons to make sure that every scene is memorable.POST PRODUCTION: These expenses will help cover our editing and visual effects added after the film is shot, and will add any finishing touches to the project.KICKSTARTER FEES AND REWARD FULFILLMENT: We will need this to help cover our expense in getting the rewards to our loyal fans.

It has been a privilege getting to know these songwriters and musicians who exhibit so much humility and boldness through their lives and through their music, and now it is our mission to introduce these musicianaries to the rest of the world.The $20,000 that we are raising through Kickstarter is the next chapter in our story. We feel the Lord leading us to buy recording equipment and create a travel budget to record these musicianaries songs and share their stories—something we are unable to do without your help. About half of the money would go to purchasing the microphones, cables, stands, computer, and interface we need to record high-quality audio in a variety of settings. The other half would go to covering travel expenses, as we venture to different locations around the world.In the last two years of living in Los Angeles, God has connected me to producers, managers, lawyers, and mixing/mastering engineers that are ready to help me launch this label. I myself am a certified recording engineer, and have been working in the industry full-time since 2015. I've been leading worship and writing songs for the last seven years, and my experience overseas has taught me how effective music is in ministry. I am passionate about music and seeing missionaries taken care of, and I feel the timing of God on my life to bring the people together to start this movement.The average cost of full album comes to approximately $10,000, so how are we expecting to start a record label with only $20,000? Instead of diving in right away into recording albums, we will be traveling to missionaries around the world and recording and filming a song they have written in a location significant to their work and call. This establishes the missionaries as musicians and helps them start the process of building an audience while creating a hub for all types of musicianaries to be discovered. For musicianaries who are ready and interested, we can set up a budget and begin the process of producing their music through the extensive network that our company has in Los Angeles.We need approximately $6,000 in recording equipment to get high-quality recordings in a variety of settings. $2,000 will be set aside for equipment rentals and studio time for some of these projects. $8,000 isdesignatedto travel expenses, covering airfare, public transportation, food, and lodging for a team of recording engineers and filmmakers. $2,200 will go to shipping and manufacturing CD's and merchandise, and about $1,800 will go to Kickstarter (5%+3-5% in processing fees).The greatest marketing is word of mouth. Anyway that you can put us in touch with missions organizations, recording studios, and musicianaries around the world will help us expand our company to reach more missionaries and record more songs. Please follow us on social media, i.e. Facebook, Instagram, Twitter. We are always posting updates on our projects and promoting musicianaries from all over. Share our posts and share this video to help us meet our funding goal!","The music industry is constantly changing. Laws are being changed and added to get artists paid in a world that wants free music, and labels are often forced to fend for themselves. Record labels also get a bad rap for offering horrible record deals to unassuming artists, and many musicians are afraid to sign anything with a label because of it. On top of this, missionaries are already in full-time ministry and are not always interested in going on tour and playing live shows—which is where most money is made in the music industry today.These challenges present us with the opportunity to try unique business strategies that no other record labels (that we know of) are trying. Due to the nature of the musicians we will be working with, production costs will be higher than normal, and it may take longer to release albums. Please bear with us as we navigate new territory in music and missions. We will be sure to keep everyone informed and up-to-date about any change in plans we make.

Here's a link to download a FREE 10-page sample of the eBook >> Click to download.I've written two blog posts about Kickstarter, what it is, why it's safe and other frequently asked questions. Check them out below:Majestic and Magical - the Kickstarter CampaignWhat is Kickstarter?Majestic and Magical is a large format, hardcover photography book, featuring more than 130 images of Dominica captured around the country— from Scotts Head to Laudat, Calibishie to Syndicate, Roseau to Trafalgar and beyond.The main objective behind this project is to show the world how beautiful Dominica really is, and these images do just that, by featuring the sites and landscapes that make our county unique.Through this Kickstarter project, I'm asking for your help to raise enough funds to print 1,000 copies of the book.In an age when everything is either online or 'in the cloud', you've probably wondered if it even makes sense to print a book.I chose this medium because it is tangible, durable and it engages more than just one of our six senses. Flipping through the pages of a book forces you to focus your attention on those pages and puts the larger-than-life images right in front of you.This large format book can be given as a gift of considerable value to visitors and Dominicans alike. It is an item that we can all be proud of and excited about.The finished book will be a hardcover, 12x9 inch, color book, 145 pages in length, and printed on 157gsm gloss coated art paper.Majestic and Magical will contain more than 130 images, so you'll mostly see photographs while browsing through the book. However, I've included a caption for every image that includes its name and the location where that image was captured.I've also included brief write-ups throughout the book. In some cases I give information about the history of the locations and in for other images I talk about how that particular images was created.I hope that these write-ups enhance your viewing experience.Apart from signed copies of the book, backers stand to receive limited edition Greeting Cards and museum-quality Canvas and Metallic Prints.This reward comes with five custom designed 5x7 inch stationery cards that can be used as a greeting cards, thank you notes, or decorations. The cards includes images from the Majestic and Magical book -- both in black and white and in color.Backers may also receive Canvas or Metallic Prints as part of their rewards. Both print options are museum-quality pieces of art, created to last for generations (in favorable viewing conditions).The Canvas prints will be shipped to you ready-to-hang, right out of the box. The larger Metallic prints are sold unframed and must be framed before hanging.The quality of both of these print options is truly amazing and over the last 3 years of selling various sizes of both, I've never had a customer complaint or return. On the contrary, customer consistently report successful deliveries and they're amazed by the color details and lifelike quality.In order to receive these limited edition items and to enjoy the Kickstarter special pricing, you must pledge to support this project. I've tried to include rewards that suit many different types of supporters:Look through the list carefully to find a price-point that is comfortable for you:Pledge $2 - 3 phone backgrounds from the Majestic and Magical book.Pledge $10 - Majestic and Magical eBook and 3 phone backgrounds from the book.Pledge $25 - 5 Greeting Cards, the Majestic and Magical eBook and 3 phone backgrounds ('The Supporter Pack').Pledge $49 - A signed copy of the Majestic and Magical hardcover photo-book (early bird special).Pledge $59 -A signed copy of the Majestic and Magical hardcover photo-book (no early bird discount).Pledge $79- A signed copy of Majestic and Magical and the Supporter Pack.Pledge $129 - Two signed copies ofMajestic and Magical and the Supporter Pack.Pledge $199 (perfect for the art collector)- A signed copy of Majestic and Magical, your choice between a 20x30 inch Metallic Photographic Print OR a 16x24 inch Canvas Print and the Supporter PackPledge $269(share with your family) - Five signed copies of Majestic and Magical and the Supporter Pack.Pledge $399 (decorate your home)-Two signed copies of Majestic and Magical, your choice between a32x48 inch Canvas Print OR a 30x72 inch Metallic Print, and the Supporter Pack.Pledge $699(share with your entire office) -Ten signed copies of Majestic and Magical, your choice between a 32x48 inch Canvas Print OR a 30x72 inch Metallic Print, and the Supporter PackPledge $999 (a private tour) -Come with me to one of the locations from the book and we'll create images together! Then, over dinner, ask me anything you like... personal projects, photography, Dominica... anything! You'll also get two copies of the 'Majestic and Magical' photo-book, a 32x48 inch Canvas Print and the Supporter Pack.Presenting photos in the best way possible through print and then getting those books to Dominica is very expensive. Almost 70% of the money I receive will go towards printing.Given that book printing is central to this project, choosing a printing partner was an important decision I made early on. My research led me to a printer based in Michigan in the United States, with printing facilities in China.The head of the company (with whom I'm in constant contact) has 30 years experience in the art book printing industry, and has designed, engineered and managed more than 8000 printing projects during that time. I have complete confidence in their ability to deliver a quality product on the agreed upon timeline.My funding goal is $16,000. This just about covers printing and shipping 1,000 copies of Majestic and Magical.More funding means more book orders to fulfill and more perks (greeting cards, photographic prints, etc.) to send out to backers, like yourself. So, for the most part, that's where the extra funds will go to.However, if this project is funded above and beyond my initial goal, I have a plan for the extra dollars:Here's my website - www.yuriajonesphotography.com. I post new articles there regularly and I currently have a 32 week photography challenge that you may be interested in.

Jones PhotographyandEmbrace Dominica.This project means a lot to me, not just because it's my first photo-book, but because I truly believe that it could significantly impact Dominica's visibility on an international level.If you're not able to pledge money towards the project, please share it all over your social media channels so that everyone you know finds out about it.Please remember this: Kickstarter is ""all or nothing"", meaning that if the project does not succeed, the book will not be published.Thanks for taking the time to learn more about Majestic and Magical. Happy Pledging!","The book is ready to be printed: I have completed the design, layout, proofreading and editing of all text and images.There's no financial risk to you, the backer.

Since the previous campaign failed, this is the real deal!Q: How are you so sure that this campaign won't fail too?A: I made a few big changes... my goal is now $8,500, as opposed to $16,000 in the previous campaign.

It will have long takes to give a unique atmosphere of the space and intensity of characters. Journey by Moonlight, the work which inspired this film, is a key text in modern Hungarian culture. But is little known outside of Hungary. So we are hoping to bring an under-appreciated classic of world literature to the audience.",https://www.kickstarter.com/projects/hardlysane/roleplay?ref=discovery_category_newest,hardlysane/roleplay,"Roleplay is inspired by the Hungarian novel Journey by Moonlight (Utas és Holdvilág) by Antal Szerb - a modern classic. This short film, scripted in English and Hungarian, imagines the meeting of the three central characters from the book in present-day Budapest.This project is a collaboration between friends from Galicia and Budapest. We started with the idea of creating our own interpretation of a Hungarian story we have fallen in love with. Now we need your support to fulfil this dream.Roleplay [Látszat]- PlotIn a tall, old house in the hills of Budapest, brother and sister Tamas and Eva create a world for themselves, of imagination and fantasy. When they organise a fancy dress party, an old friend, Mihaly, arrives at the door. As they recount old stories and make fun of each other, buried emotions and anguish begin to rise….The film is about individual feelings that challenges the relationship codes set by the society. How does one deal with the internal anxiety and conflict born out of this? And how this anxiety manifests in present day Hungary, amongst the youth at the frontiers of Europe.Writer/DirectorTyagi Pallava works across fiction, documentaries and commercials in Budapest and New York, while pursuing a doctorate in practice-based arts. His previous career was in design and publication before he graduated with an MA in film directing jointly from the Film Academy in Budapest, Lusofona, Lisbon and LUCA, Brussels. He is developing this short film as part of his work on a feature length narrative fiction.Everyone supporting this project will receive news on the ensuing feature film project.CinematographerAdam Fillenz is a multi-award winning cinematographer. He has worked on features, short films, music videos, documentaries, and commercials. His movies have premiered at Cannes and the Locarno Film Festival. In 2012 he received the Balazs Béla Prize for Outstanding Achievement in the Art of Film. He has since received many awards for his work. (www.adamfillenz.com)We are infinitely grateful to the team who have worked on the film for this campaign and the many people have supported us this far. You know who you are. Thank you all.We hope to continue getting your support to realise this project.ProgressAfter completing the current pre-production development phase, we plan to begin a 5-day film shoot in May. We have a small team of talented professionals, a skilled production company, Focus Fox, and equipment company Sparks on-board. Thanks to their support, the voluntary work of committed friends and supporters, and the donation of equipment by Sony Electronics, we have been able to get this far. We created a new kickstarter campaign learning from the previous one and getting pointers to our project.We created a new budget and now only need €8.6k to start shooting the film.Why support a film project?!","The planned cinematography of the film is technically challenging and takes us to the limits of our estimated budget. It will have long takes to give a unique atmosphere of the space and intensity of characters in the close proximity. It will be somewhat like the film Innaritu's Birdman. Journey by Moonlight, the work which inspired this film, is a key text in modern Hungarian culture. But is little known outside of Hungary. We are hoping to bring an under-appreciated classic of world literature to the audience through a snapshot of contemporary life in Budapest.

https://www.kickstarter.com/projects/398172523/hitch-hiker-om-lightweight-balanced-tripod-head?ref=discovery_category_newest,398172523/hitch-hiker-om-lightweight-balanced-tripod-head,"Are you tired of fighting the gravity flop-over battle that comes with a conventional tripod head?  Are you also weary of the point-and-clamp then unclamp-adjust-pointing-reclamp routine?  And what about the sticky, sloppy or high friction rotations of many conventional tripod heads?  Tired of those, too?  And are you frustrated by tripod heads that don't even define left/right and up/down -- correcting in one direction while creating an error in the other?Conventional tripods heads simply are not built for rapid, precise composition of photos in a dynamic environment -- especially involving up/down movements.  Are you only willing to explore a flat world?The patent-pending Hitch Hiker is a lightweight, balanced-motion tripod head designed for people on the move -- perfect for photography; birding; Nature-watching; video; and binocular astronomy.  The nimble Hitch Hiker is light enough to replace standard tripod heads but enables precisely controlled, all-around rotations that normal tripod heads can't do.High megapixel digital cameras demand steady support for maximum resolution. But the Hitch Hiker doesn't just provide support. It also provides control -- deftly gliding along arching paths requiring simultaneous rotations in both left/right and up/down directions. The retractable guide-handle aids in tracing free-form paths, but it is the gravity-nullifying, balanced rotations that provide the key. Follow action wherever it goes with positive control. Let go and aim is maintained on-target -- no clamping needed. Stay ready for the next shot. Compose photos rapidly, accurately, and easily. While the following photo of a Great Blue Heron taken during testing of the Hitch Hiker is not a showpiece because of the extreme distance, it does unquestionably indicate the precision and control of the Hitch Hiker by showing its ability to quickly center the bird in the frame before it could land after a chance spotting of the heron in flight. The telephoto lens was zoomed to 300 mm on a DX format Nikon D7200. Single-point auto-focusing was being used with the focus point fixed at the center of the frame. So, the heron had to be very precisely centered for the exposure to work -- and the precision of the centering is clearly evident in the full frame. And the photo was snapped in single-shot mode, as well -- no ""shotgun"" exposure burst. Also, the Great Blue was flying right-to-left while the camera was being panned left-to-right -- so the direction of the pan had to be quickly reversed. And the heron was descending rapidly, which added to the complexity of centering the bird. But centering and snapping the photo was accomplished in about a second despite all of these complications. Only a tiny section of the frame is included in the inset. For this high total zoom factor, the Hitch Hiker had to be following the heron smoothly.Better birding photos will come -- but as a test of the agility and precision of the new Hitch Hiker, this photo was breathtaking!Note: All of the photos of the Hitch Hiker shown on this project page are of one of twenty-one prototypes that have been in extensive use by various people for months. The purpose of the Kickstarter project is to place the highly developed and patent pending Hitch Hiker into regular production.Spotting scopes, large binoculars, and small telescopes also benefit from the Hitch Hiker's smooth, balanced rotations and steady support.  The CNC machined guide-handle with knurled grip is great for steering these instruments -- and an optional finder bracket makes pointing to astronomical objects much easier.The Hitch Hiker was developed with hiking in mind.  Since it can be comfortably carried up a rocky, steep mountain trail it can be carried just about anywhere with ease.  A perfect match for lightweight carbon-fiber tripods, put them in/on your pack or carry them over your shoulder.Balanced rotation about the altitude (elevation) axis allows the Hitch Hiker to follow up and down motions without fighting gravity and to remain aimed on target without clamping.  To accomplish this feat, the Hitch Hiker provides for shifting the payload up/down as well as fore/aft.  The following diagrams explain.  For visual simplicity, let's pretend that the center of the rotating mass coincides with the center of the heavy stainless steel weight.  We will ignore the masses of the saddle, payload platform, and guide-handle -- all of which also contribute slightly to the rotating mass.The Hitch Hiker's camera rotation device was designed so that a typical DSLR camera can be rotated from landscape to portrait mode without disturbing the two-axis balancing of the load. Balance is also closely maintained for mirrorless cameras. This remarkable property is demonstrated in the following video. Note the smooth, low-resistance motions of the Hitch Hiker -- both before and after camera rotation. And note that the camera stays aimed without any clamping. And also note that the camera can be aimed straight-up and straight-down.We have long experience in manufacturing precision mounts for astronomy. The Hitch Hiker was developed from the same high-rigidity/low-weight design principles that have been effectively utilized in our astronomical mounts. And exquisite CNC machining used for manufacturing elite telescope mounts has also been applied to the Hitch Hiker. Twenty-one prototype Hitch Hikers were built using our highly evolved production techniques -- establishing most of the set-ups that will form the basis of actual Hitch Hiker production.The Hitch Hiker is fully developed and ready to go into production immediately. Prototype Hitch Hikers have been rigorously tested by multiple users in a variety of circumstances and applications. As expected, a few tweaks have been incorporated into the Hitch Hiker for production, and everything is set to go upon the completion of the Kickstarter campaign. We're limiting the total number of units available through Kickstarter to match the scale of production we've done many times, insuring timely delivery using the same manufacturing system employed for the astronomical mountings.Also, the same shop that has been machining parts for our telescope mounts and which machined the prototype Hitch Hikers will also machine the parts for production Hitch Hikers. Directed by an experienced industrial engineer who works closely with us to achieve the desired, high-end results, the shop utilizes nothing but nearly-new, state-of-the-art CNC machining and turning centers and premium tooling and fixtures.Deliveries of Hitch Hikers to Kickstarter backers will begin in February 2017 and will be completed in April 2017. Domestic shipping of Hitch Hikers will be via USPS Priority Mail with full insurance and tracking. International shipments of Hitch Hikers will be via USPS Express Mail with full insurance and cross-border tracking.We are sticklers for perfection! The Hitch Hiker prototypes were exceptional -- and the production Hitch Hikers will be even better.Clear anodize with black accent parts is the standard color scheme. Clear anodize never fades or discolors and remains cooler in direct sunlight.  The regular price is $799 plus shipping.  The optional black anodize version has a regular price of $829 plus shipping. Kickstarter backers making a pledge of $599 will receive the clear anodize version, including US shipping. A pledge of $629 secures the black anodize version, including US shipping.All Hitch Hikers sent as rewards to Kickstarter backers will have special Kickstarter commemorative serial number tags.The following timeline assumes that Hitch Hikers will be built for the maximum number of Kickstarter backers. Even with the maximum number of units we might beat this projection. However, doing quality work is our first priority.Jake Riddel holds bachelors and masters degrees in mechanical engineering an has eight years experience engineering specialized drilling tools in the oilfield equipment industry. He has also been a part-time contributor to the design and manufacture of the astronomical telescope mounts. And he is the co-designer of the Hitch Hiker. Jake also enjoys outdoor pursuits including mountain biking and fishing. He is learning more about digital photography -- and is thinking about a design for a pylon to fit in his boat to carry a Hitch Hiker and camera for photographing shoreline wildlife.Thanks to Timothy Daniel Allen of +Timdan//Creative + Production for editing our video.","Manufacturing is a complex undertaking with many variables.  But risks for the Hitch Hiker project have been reduced to an absolute minimum.First, the Hitch Hiker's design was evolved from the design of our astronomical mounts that have been manufactured and used for years.  Moreover, prototype Hitch Hikers were produced using the same processes that will be employed for production -- and the design has been extensively tested in the field.  All tweaks to the design have already been fully developed.Additionally, the manufacturing techniques employed for building the Hitch Hiker are the same as those used for building the astronomical mounts for many years.  The same CNC machine shop previously used for building the astronomy mounts will now machine parts for the Hitch Hiker.  Assembly methods are also the same.  For the time being, the scale of manufacturing for the Hitch Hiker has been limited to be similar to the scale of our previous manufacturing efforts.Costs for manufacturing the Hitch Hiker are well understood and where outsourced services are involved have already been negotiated.The upcoming end of year holidays starting in late November will have some impact on the timing of the first production run -- but the schedule has been adjusted to account for the holiday period.We are ready to go.",https://www.kickstarter.com/projects/398172523/hitch-hiker-lightweight-balanced-motion-tripod-hea?ref=discovery_category_newest,398172523/hitch-hiker-lightweight-balanced-motion-tripod-hea,"Are you tired of fighting the gravity flop-over battle that comes with a conventional tripod head? Are you weary of the point-and-clamp then unclamp-adjust-pointing-reclamp routine? And what about the sticky, sloppy or high friction rotations of many conventional tripod heads? And are you frustrated by tripod heads that don't define left/right and up/down -- correcting in one direction while creating an error in the other?Conventional tripods heads simply are not built for rapid, precise composition of photos in a dynamic environment -- especially involving up/down movements. Are you only willing to explore a flat world?The patent-pending Hitch Hiker is a lightweight, balanced-motion tripod head designed for people on the move -- perfect for photography; birding; Nature-watching; video; and small telescope and binocular astronomy. The nimble Hitch Hiker is light enough to replace standard tripod heads but enables precisely controlled, all-around rotations that normal tripod heads don't do well.  High megapixel digital cameras demand steady support for maximum resolution. But the Hitch Hiker doesn't just provide support. It also provides control -- deftly gliding along arching paths requiring simultaneous rotations in both left/right and up/down directions. Follow action wherever it goes with positive control. Let go and aim is maintained on-target -- no clamping needed. Stay ready for the next shot. Compose photos rapidly, accurately, and easily. The Hitch Hiker can even improve composition and sharpness for what might be considered hand-held cameras -- especially involving moving subjects.Note: The photos of the Hitch Hiker shown on this project page are of prototypes that have been in extensive use by various people for months.  The purpose of this Kickstarter project is to build a small pre-production run of the highly developed Hitch Hiker. These will not be prototype mounts -- but the full production model -- a number of which will be used for formal reviews in magazines and online review sites.Spotting scopes, large binoculars, and small telescopes also benefit from the Hitch Hiker's smooth, balanced rotations and steady support. The CNC machined guide-handle with knurled grip is great for steering these instruments -- and an optional finder bracket makes pointing to astronomical objects much easier.The Hitch Hiker was developed with hiking in mind. Since it can be comfortably carried up a rocky, steep mountain trail it can be carried just about anywhere with ease. A perfect match for lightweight carbon-fiber tripods, put them in/on your pack or carry them over your shoulder.Balanced rotation about the altitude (elevation) axis allows the Hitch Hiker to follow up and down motions without fighting gravity and to remain aimed on target without clamping. To accomplish this feat, the Hitch Hiker provides for shifting the payload up/down as well as fore/aft. The following diagrams explain. For visual simplicity, let's pretend that the center of the rotating mass coincides with the center of the heavy stainless steel weight. We will ignore the masses of the saddle, payload platform, and guide-handle -- all of which also contribute slightly to the rotating mass.The Hitch Hiker's camera rotation device was designed so that a typical DSLR camera can be rotated from landscape to portrait mode without disturbing the two-axis balancing of the load.  Balance is also closely maintained for mirrorless cameras.  This remarkable property is demonstrated in the following video.  Note the smooth, low-resistance motions of the Hitch Hiker -- both before and after camera rotation.  And note that the camera stays aimed without any clamping.  And also note that the camera can be aimed straight-up and straight-down.We have long experience in manufacturing precision mounts for astronomy.

In the words of Johnny Cash we make it ""one piece at a time"". The artistry and elegance of a more traditional old world glass is something my wife and I have always loved. Being able to create something so lovely is truly exciting and truth be told, a bit addictive.   We had our shop running a few years ago and as with every glass furnace the intense heat begins to wear down the bricks and it has to be completely redone. Having a great love for the craft of glass blowing we are hoping to rebuild our hot-shop and make glass again. The advent of social media and the heightened ability to reach a wider audience has given us hope that we can finally make a living from the glass we truly love to create.   Raising our family and working at other jobs had to be a priority for us for a while. The funds to fire back up our shop just aren't there. We have never given up on the dream of going full on into the business of being glass artists, but to get there we would need some backing.    One thing you may not realize is that art glass is a very expensive art form to produce. The furnace must be kept running continuously 24 hours a day, 7 days a week to keep the glass in a molten state. This makes our gas bill around $800+ a month! Once you factor in all the other items needed as listed below, you see why these beautiful objects of art don't come with a dime-store price tag.  Most glass studios purchase furnaces for upwards of $40,000. George has the ability and skills to design and build his own furnace from scratch. This means he is able to make state of the art equipment at a fraction of the cost. He in fact built the entire shop alone including the glory hole, glass working bench, custom made hand tools, annealing ovens and the furnace.   We have already taken out a small loan to buy our bricks so we can start the furnace up quickly, and begin creating pieces once we are funded with the kickstarter project.

Having a great love for the craft of glass blowing, we are hoping to rebuild our hot-shop and make glass again.We spent a few years blowing glass and selling at art fairs.  We were able to get into a few galleries to display and sell our creations.  Just as we were gaining momentum, the furnace (after much good use) began to wear down. The advent of social media and the heightened ability to reach a wider audience has given us hope that we can finally make a living from the glass we truly love to create.

However, all successful projects are bound to face challenges. In our case we foresee most of our difficulties to arise in terms of delivery. Shipping large quantities of our products to various corners of the world can prove to be a challenge, especially from the viewpoint of courier service. Thankfully we have a good and transparent working relationship with our couriers. This ensures that you can expect your deliveries on time without uncertainties.",https://www.kickstarter.com/projects/voromotors/orca-mark-i-most-convenient-and-powerful-electric?ref=discovery_category_newest,voromotors/orca-mark-i-most-convenient-and-powerful-electric,"We designed ORCA Mark I with the riders in mine. We were looking for a scooter that can be used for daily commute, not just fancy electric scooters that can only travel 3-4km. On a single charge, the ORCA Mark I is able to travel up to 60 kilometres, equivalent to 37 miles.The ORCA Mark I is made of aircraft-grade aluminium alloy, it's light, most importantly, it is very durable.The dimensions of the ORCA Mark I, compact yet pack lots of battery juice. It does the job of covering your last mile travel, you really never have to get stuck in the traffic again. No more charging of electric scooter every single day when you had only used it for 1-2km.Fit it in the trunk of your car easily. Bring it everywhere with you. Many of us have that dreadful last mile travel, right? Where the last mile journey consists of bumpy, inconsistent roads. Small scooters just don't cut it.Go over humps comfortably with your triple suspension systems.The ORCA Mark I is rated IP54 Water Resistant. Also built with Anti-Skid 12"" Rubber Tyres. We want our riders to be safe.Secure your ORCA with our built in internal anti-theft alarm system. An alarm will be triggered if someone tries to:Battery is included in each remote control key, the alarm is 120dB loud. Alarm is highly noticeable. Power-cut feature will be enabled if someone turns on the scooter.User-friendly, ORCA Mark I is really easy to use. You don't even need a manual. This is suitable for riders of all ages.Comes together with your ORCA Mark I packaging.","Despite our detailed planning, developing and manufacturing a high-tech product is a great challenge, as you can imagine. That is why we have worked relentlessly for the past year and will continue to work this way. We are also partnering with world renowned parts suppliers including matured factories in order to reduce production risks to a minimum. We love our vehicle and we think that everybody should get the chance to ride the ORCA.The final product will be assembled by a contract manufacturer under our supervision. The ramp-up of the production for a new product requires a lot of attention to details. Tolerances may need to be adjusted or tools may need a redesign. These changes will become necessary during the planned sampling phase when we receive the first vehicles from mass production. These changes contain the potential to delay the production and delivery in the order of weeks to months. Of course, these are regular challenges of manufacturing a new hardware product. There can be unforeseen issues leading to delays, but we promise to do everything in our power to reduce the impact of such events as much as possible.Even a simple light electric vehicle involves many components and services that we source from other suppliers, and supplier credibility and quality is always a challenge in the world of manufacturing. We leverage the influence our manufacturing partner has over component and service providers to ensure a steady stream of quality components. Although our partners have strong track records working with their suppliers for many years, we’ve separately identified multiple suppliers for the same components during our two-year design phase. We have established testing methodologies and metrics for our components, and have quality control programs established for volume production.Our partners, who have years of experience delivering excellent products in large quantities, have enough confidence that our design will be liked by customers that they are willing to work with a small team at very reasonable price. There may be some surprises as we begin manufacturing, but we believe any challenges will be overcome by combining experience and dedication, and our overall goal of making the best possible product.Any pledge amount brings us one step closer to making the ORCA Mark I a reality and a boon to commuters and the environment. Help us make your commute fun and clean by clicking the ‘Back This Project’ button at the top of the page and helping us spread the word by sharing our page.Most importantly, our priority is to be fully transparent in our communication to you, our backers. We only have one interest: delivering the best and most convenient electric vehicle to you.THANK YOU."

However, nothing is normal about the forboding Orphanage. The sign over its cast iron gates reads Mrs Prendergast's Home for Wayward Children yet nobody has ever seen the children in the grounds.Founded by Mrs. Elspeth Prendergast in a time where everything looked bleak and dreadful, many folks thought that it would be a perfect place for those wretched homeless street urchins to grow up. How wrong that turned out to be...Now, the townsfolk see figures walking around the house through the windows and shuffling henchmen guarding the perimeters. Various whispers on the streets of Victorian London say that no-one ever leaves that place. They might suspect that something isn’t right, but no one will dare to say it out loud. Hushed talk about a tall fellow that seems to float through the building and a ghastly green glow emanating from one room.The last man that dared to speak up, has been missing ever since.Every child who is a resident of the place nicknamed “The Awful Orphanage” will gladly tell you about all the terrors that lurk in that wretched building, if you can find one to talk to you that is.So, we have asked some brave writers to do just that; to find all the scraps of information that might have leaked from that dreaded house.

A reputation stemming from an urban geography that’s been shaped by historical and entrenched prejudices. Big issues deserve big attention.In an effort to shift the narrative, we’d like to show that Chicago isn't as divided in heart as we might be by neighborhood. With your support, we will fly a banner featuring Chicago artist Hebru Brantley’s Flyboy character and the phrase “we all live here” over all 77 Chicago neighborhoods. The banner is a statement of equality for all of Chicago, and with this project we’re giving you a chance to add your name to that statement. As a project backer, your name will be on the banner that flies over Chicago, symbolically covering the city in a unified stand for equality. After the banner flies it will be on display at future events we organize to get people involved to support causes like equality, the environment, etc.“We all live here” is a Chicago-based organization that uses art and technology to create public reminders to work together and help one another succeed. Primarily, “we all live here” works with schools to create public art projects that use “we all live here” as a theme. These activations are located in public space so that they can be supported and enjoyed by everyone regardless of age, race and religion.Why does this project exist?“We all live here” was started as a response to the violence happening in Chicago. We believe many people want to do something about this problem, but don't feel they have a meaningful outlet for response. We exist to create opportunities for people to take action in support of these challenging issues.After sharing the phrase “we all live here” through public art around Chicago, we found the phrase was connecting with people. While working on “we all live here” murals, people honked their car horns and gave us high fives in support. Everywhere we created art, people stopped to talk to us about our message. We started creating public art as our message to the people of Chicago. But we thought, what would happen if we gave the people who honk and high-five a chance to be a part of the message themselves? Who is Hebru Brantley and Why is his 'Flyboy' Symbolic?Hebru Brantley is a Chicago-based artist who rose to prominence when Jay-Z and Beyonce purchased one of his pieces at Art Basel. Since then, George Lucas and many other celebs have added their names to the roster of Hebru Brantley collectors. A recurring image in his work is ‘Flyboy.’ On its creation he told Lupe Fiasco:“You’ve got animated sponges and ducks and birds and whatever, and it’s very rare to see a popular character within any medium that is African-American, Latino, even Asian. What I wanted to do was create [that kind of character], but in a space of high art and [with] some historical context to that character. So I looked at the Tuskegee Airmen, who were fighter pilots in World War II. They flew successful missions and they never lost a person. But at that time black folks were treated far less than equal.“What is the Chicago Children’s Choir?Founded during the Civil Rights movement, the Chicago Children’s Choir is a non-profit that has changed lives through music for 60 years. They inspire and unite youth from diverse backgrounds to become global citizens. The organization is much more than just a choir. The programs the Chicago Children’s Choir operates advocate education, expression, and excellence in 79 Chicago schools and reach 4,300 students. Artist Hebru Brantley created the artwork for their upcoming album titled ""we all live here"", which we’ll celebrate with the flying of the “we all live here” banner. The Chicago Children’s Choir is equality embodied, and we’re proud to be working with with them.It will cost $25K to fly this banner, create a website for backers to see where their names are on the actual banner, and document the project for everyone to see afterwards. By backing the project you will help this come to life and you will get to make a statement that you believe in equality. ","The only potential hiccup in our plan could be the weather. If Mother Nature doesn’t cooperate on our planned flight date, we will keep all project backers updated and fly the next possible day.",https://www.kickstarter.com/projects/wealllivehere/lasalle-language-academy-we-all-live-here-mural?ref=discovery_category_newest,wealllivehere/lasalle-language-academy-we-all-live-here-mural,"***IMPORTANT******PLEASE DONATE TODAY******THIS CAMPAIGN IS ONLY AVAILABLE UNTIL July 24th 2020******UNFORTUNATELY KICKSTARTER ISN'T SETUP LIKE A SHOPPING CART. PLEASE TOTAL YOUR DESIRED ITEMS AND MAKE YOUR DONATION IN THAT AMOUNT. FOLLOWING THE CAMPAIGN, THERE WILL BE A SURVEY SENT OUT TO GET YOUR SIZES AND DESIRED REWARDS.Since 2015,we all live herehas been spreading a positive and inclusive message around Chicago by creating public art with schools. Founder Rich Alapack, wanted to do something about racism and hatred so he created a program for schools called ACT (Art, Community, and Technology) that creates public art using the phrase as a theme to invite community participation and support via crowdfunding technology.Last fall, all LaSalle Language Academy students participated in an assembly where Rich shared what he's been doing and taught our students the basics of graphic design. The students did drawings that inspired the official we all live here at LaSalle Language Academy logo which goes onto the merchandise we're selling as rewards for backers of this campaign to raise money for our very own we all live here project. At LaSalle Language Academy we are excited to participate in this growing positive and inclusive movement. Here is a link to Rich's TEDx talk if you're curious to learn more about we all live here:https://wealllivehereproject.com/pages/tedx-columbia-college-chicago All LaSalle students drew pictures during the assembly for each word in the positive and inclusive phrase: we all live here. They then learned some graphic design through examples of famous company logos. Rich, then asked the students to combine what they learned in order to start brainstorming an exclusive we all live here at LaSalle Language Academy logo. ]The point of this exercise was to get our students thinking about being positive and inclusive and to generate the official we all live here at LaSalle Language Academy logo so we can use that on official merchandise to use as rewards for this fundraiser to create a Magnetic Mural on the school's West facing facade. The students will be able to reposition the magnets that make up the world map to create pixelated versions of popular landmarks around the world. The map will also be painted on in dots (as pictured) on so that the students know where to put their magnets back to recreate the map.  Our goal was to give our students a creative canvas that they can use to express themselves in an interactive way while spreading this positive and inclusive mindset. This mural will also help us market LaSalle Language Academy by highlighting the languages that our students learn. We hope you will support this project by donating to this campaign so we can begin work on our mural the week of August 3rd, 2020. All donation amounts are greatly appreciated. All donors will have their name commemorated on the project's plaque (unless they wish to remain anonymous) explaining what we all accomplished together.Please see below for images of the reward items.",The biggest risk is simply that we don't raise all the funds. Kickstarter is all or nothing but the LaSalle Language Academy community should be eager to support this kind of project at their school. I'm confident with our unique school themed rewards we'll meet and then surpass our goal.

We produced another short in 2002, ""Where There is Smoke...There's Bob"" and lost to Mega XLR. I continued to fight for Longhair and Doubledome then and I am still fighting for them now. I have always believed in this concept, and with the encouragement of some fans out there and the belief that traditional animation still has a place in this world. I reached out to the Cartoon Network and they agreed to waive their rights to Longhair and Doubledome so that I could give it another crack of the whip. I look forward to creating a new episode, getting these cavemen out of their cave as many times as I can and make fun stuff for the fans of this show.With this Kickstarter campaign, my stubborn ability to ignore convention and an unwillingness to declare 2d animation dead, I plan along with your creative input and the solid work of some top pros to make this episode of Longhair and Doubledome all that it should be.In this new episode, Longhair and Doubledome are drop-kicked into the death-defying duty of daycare with an adorable yet terrifying, little Neanderthal child, ""Kiwi"" in mankind's first recorded, babysitting adventure. The details of this episode will be determined after our contributor's have been able to ""CHIME-IN"" (see rewards.); giving us suggestions on story, visuals and gags. This Kickstarter gives us the unique opportunity to receive valuable input from our audience before this episode is complete.REWARD SAMPLES:","Creating a high quality animation using 2d traditional techniques along with the current technologies is risky when you are dealing with shrinking budgets.  2d animation has never been known as “cost effective” or particularly innovative and so it has looked to cut any corner it can to stay relevant.  Each year things move less, get flatter and now everything 2d seems to be under a ""rigged motion graphics”  umbrella.  Much of what was known in 2d animation is being homogenized or forgotten.Innovation is key, especially with the remarkable technological tools available to us;  however, if you only have one animation language then any innovation will be limited in scope.  With my experience and knowledge of traditional 2d animation, underused animation techniques and years producing animation, I plan to innovate a 2d style and production model that can be more cost effective, and create a different 2d language.  Over the past few years, I have experimented with certain aspects of perception and this knowledge base alone, it has greatly influenced the possibility of new approaches that were unavailable to the old school traditional cel animator.I am shooting for finishing this project in one year’s time, our first pilot, “Good Wheel Hunting” took 8 months with the full Knock Knock studio behind it.  The good news is that a good portion of the preproduction is complete and I have a great people available to work on it.The only guarantee I can give is that I have always finished what I started.",https://www.kickstarter.com/projects/259218198/the-dawn-of-longhair-and-doubledome?ref=discovery_category_newest,259218198/the-dawn-of-longhair-and-doubledome,"First, I would like to thank the Cartoon Network for giving me the permission on this project and allowing me to continue to work (once again) on these inept cavemen.This is the Good Wheel Hunting pilot, my studio Knock Knock Cartoons created for the Cartoon Network featuring two of my favorite characters, Longhair and Doubledome, the last traditional cel labor of love job of my career. The story of Good Wheel Hunting has been worked into this very broad and funny story for the graphic novel, with touches of Tex Avery like gags but focused on how these two Cro-Magnon men meet and the Neanderthal world they must lead, that is what this graphic novel is all about.So to put it as simply as possible This is the kind of work (below) I have been doing for the last 15 years, digital, generic and ______________. fill in the blank.And this is the kind of work I would like begin doing again. Hand drawn, fun, comical, a bull in a china shop of fun but I need a kick in the starter for it to make sense.I have chased the digital design monkey around for a while now and I really miss the analog, pencil and paper, land of mistakes and constant artistic feedback. Yes, I will finish the images in Photoshop, as all my cel paint is now harder than my noggin, but it is the drawing of the thing that I yanks my art chain. Drawing and animating the traditional way is what I enjoy the most.Over the past year, I have concentrated on different ways of getting Longhair and Doubledome out there, it was painfully apparent that if I ever wanted to do another animated project with these whackos, I needed to grab a larger audience. A graphic novel is a great place to start in my estimation. I contributed to several really excellent campaigns, did some much needed research and decided to give it a shot. And although I am early in the process, I am asking the universe for a sweet kick in the backside with this Kickstarter. I so want to be able to say no to some of the bland generic work that comes smoothly animates across my screen nowaday and dance with true characters. Please help me kick myself off the hamster wheel of generic digital work.The best news came when my good friend Max Cannon came on board as a co-writer and creative consultant on the project. Max and I have been very good friends since we worked together on Max Cannon's Shadow Rock, a webisode series for Comedy Central. Max and I have all ready finished the story outline for this endeavor and are meeting in Tucson to finalize the working script. I should be drawing before the rubber hits the road of this crowdfunding extravaganza.REWARDS!!!!!By the way here are some mock-ups of the rewards offered (samples onlyT-shirts will be provided by my T-shirt company Fiasco Lab. If you would prefer a different shirt for that particular reward, take a look and we will provide.https://shop.fiascolab.comAs far as ""stretch"" goals, I am a bit ambivalent to say, Perhaps a book about the process of creating the graphic novel or if we really kick some start, I will do a book about my animation process, my art or all of the above. I just want to succeed at this and get the caveman boulder rolling. If we get funded we will announce stretch goals as we go.  I will cross that bridge when we come to it in updates through the campaign, and would love your feedback. I would appreciate all or any support and due to the fact that we are just getting the gas in the tank, we appreciate your patience too. I have always delivered. So I have printed out the model sheets and grabbed over 300 screenshots from Good Wheel Hunting for reference. I am redrawing and reframing everything from scratch but this get the old feet on the ground.  So let's do this, as Doubledome says, ""Let's call it a WHEEEEEEEEEE, cause it's fun""ThanksBig G","Sometimes you have to change the direction in life to make things happen.  I am trying to do just that.  I am an analog loving artist in a digital world, and I am hooting and hollering to get back to breaking pencil points again.There are plenty of risks and challenges when you have to draw a small boatload of drawings, color them and put together in what will be my first ""graphic novel"".  In my research, I have noted that most experienced graphic novelists use Kickstarter not to start a project but to finish or publish it.  But due to the fact that this is my first rodeo, I am using this Kickstarter to start the process which means it may take some time before you receive your final copy.  I am shooting for a little less than a year of work with three months set aside for printing (standard from my research) I am fast, so I may even be able to finish it sooner, but I also want to be realistic.PS MANY REWARDS WILL BE SENT BEFORE THE BOOK IS FINISHED and we will keep you feverishly updated in our production blog.What this Kickstarter can do, is give me the ability to say, ""No"", a powerful tool for an artist.  I am sure digital work will continue to drone in and without this opportunity to turn my broad back on it, I will be forced to work on its generic compilation of human, politically correct diversity without having any characteristics of ethnicity or even personality.   So, I am looking to this Kickstarter to change the dynamic of my life and return to what I love.  Drawing with a damn pencil with a demand for skill not the warm fuzzy blanket of 100 ""undos"" until you get it right.So I must ask for your patience and your help at the same time, and I totally understand that that is a lot to ask.Luckily, I am not alone in this process, I have been working with Max Cannon of Red Meat, an alternate comic genius who has helped me write the story for The Dawn of Longhair and Doubledome and who will be a constant voice guiding me along the way and making sure I am giving you a high quality piece.That being said, I am confident and excited about the prospect of getting back to an actual drawing table, of once again being able to experiment and tear through a couple reams of animation paper.  I am fast, and unafraid of mountain of drawings as I have boxes and boxes of art from my animation days.  I have never not delivered a project and I know what I am getting into.  Every commercial I ever worked on created on average 500 plus pieces of art, so producing a ton of drawings is not a problem for me.  I look forward to sharing my progress and getting your feedback through the production blog and in that way insure that you are a part of the process and progress of the piece.- Thanks, Gav"

We have been reached out to set design crews who have worked on shows like Game of Thrones and Once Upon a Time and they want to realize the Requiem art we have. We want to utilize them but we need the extra funding from a successful Kickstarter to make it happen. We are going to make a final push in the last 5 days of this Kickstarter to try and make it happen. Time is running out, so please support us and help make Requiem the best it can be!We are a group of coffee loving nerds with 25 years of business management experience behind us looking to open a 24 hour video game themed coffee shop near Disneyland to give nerds a home away from home. We have investors backing us but want to utilize crowdfunding to get a little more to make it extra special. We put together some amazing art, some great rewards, some humorous videos, and we're hoping you'll want Requiem to exist as bad as we do.Requiem is a video game themed coffee shop heavily inspired by nerd culture. For lovers of coffee, tea, and all things nerdy, Requiem will provide a cozy escape and the perfect destination to meet fans of the same things you're into!Sports fans have sports bars where they can go for countless hours to feel at home, surrounded by people who understand their passions — why don't fans of anime, books, cartoons, comics, movies, tv shows, or video games? Sure we have conventions but there's a growing demand for a more intimate venue to engage with others who share your sensibilities.Requiem is designed to attract an extremely diverse community of fans and it will have something for all of them. If you're an introvert who wants to sit peacefully in solitude and enjoy a tea latte in a magical atmosphere, you belong at Requiem. If you're an extrovert wanting to gather with friends and talk about the latest episode of your favorite temporally displaced doctor, you also belong at Requiem! Even if you're just looking to find friends who are into the same things you are, you can find them at Requiem unlike you could anywhere else!Finally, the foundation for Requiem, much like video games, is escapism. – having a safe place to get away from it all. No matter what is going on in the world outside, for as long as it exists, Requiem will be a safe place for anyone who needs somewhere to go. There won't be judgment or discrimination in Requiem. We will have zero tolerance for harassment and bullying. No matter what your situation, Requiem will always welcome you and offer you sanctuary with sensational atmosphere and delicious drinks.Requiem will feature many aesthetics inspired by video games and other elements from nerd culture from books, comics, shows, and more. It will be a visual love letter to all the things we love about fantasy and sci-fi. At its most basic, all these elements will be present regardless of the success of the kickstarter. Should we reach the higher ends of our donation goals however, Requiem will feature 4 themed sitting areas, modeled after distinct genres. While no actual locations from video games are used (which would turn into copyright nightmare land), the various art styles will make it easy to draw clear comparisons with your favorite video game worlds.You can see high definition photos of Requiem here. Our 3D architecture was beautifully constructed by Kyle at Pixel Wave Designs. He worked tirelessly with me on developing these wonderful architectural renderings. He did an amazing job catering to the high standards I had to make Requiem the best it can be. We worked hard to give you the best idea of what would be possible with a successful Kickstarter. And though you won't find any copyrighted element usage in our images (for obvious reasons), you will find some parodies and references to enjoy throughout. For instance, what's going on on that table in the forest area?We will serve some of the best locally roasted coffee available and we'll have all the specialty coffee shop staples you'd come to expect.In addition, we'll have themed drinks such as our ""Moon Harvest"" selection which will make your favorite fall drinks (and more!) available year round! For a blast of refreshing fruity flavor, we will have delicious potions served in glass bottles. We'll have a great tea collection, boba, and our pastry chef will provide tasty treats for customers looking for something to munch on. We'll have ""Heart Piece"" tarts, magic wand cake pops, themed bento snack boxes, and many other goodies. Just take a look at some of the treats in store below!Thanks to generous investors, we need less than ever to make Requiem possible! No matter how successful this Kickstarter campaign is, Requiem will always feature certain elements that are indispensable to our identity. Even with a bare minimum donation goal achieved, we still offer:Our general business plan as we originally prepared it can be found here:https://goo.gl/S2Ou65All funding from this Kickstarter will go toward the design and features of Requiem.

This sculpture class meets once a week at the Art Center and is completely free for all students (many of which are on fixed incomes).  The Center provides free tuition and free supplies for the entire class. There are about 20 students who take the class that runs from September to May each year.

We are in the process of finding a new partner, but this means that our product launch will be delayed by roughly 3 months.We understand that thishas significant impact on our backers, and many of you have or will need to withdraw your pledge due to the fact that you will not be able to use our concussion sensors for 2017 football season. We thank you for your support, especially the teams and coaches from SJPAL league.When Maddox wanted to sign up for the 2015 football season, our mother was worried that he would get a head injury because of news articles she had recently read. Eventually, we made a deal with her where we would build something to monitor head hit impacts. In exchange, our mother would allow Maddox to play football. With the help of Arduino classes and meet-ups at San Jose TechShop, we designed our prototype and quickly realized that many players like Maddox could benefit from this. We spent most of 2015 and 2016 developing and fine-tuning our design, and now comes the AoS module.The SensorBased on research done by the Department of Physics and Astronomy at University of Rochester, the Department of Neuroscience at Columbia University, and the Department of Organismal Biology and Anatomy at University of Chicago (see this research paper here), an evolution of g-force from hit impacts happens inmilliseconds and the threshold of a concussion happens around 200g (see figure below from above quoted paper):The AoS sensor is a specially designed sensor module that can be easily attached to the helmet, with a customized accelerometer chip that can measure +/- 400g.When a player absorbs an impact in a potentially dangerous way (currently set at 50% of concussion threshold, using both Severity index and Head Injury Criterion), the sensor lights up to alert the player.The Mobile ApplicationThe impact data can be downloaded to smartphones on the sideline, using Bluetooth Low Energy, socoaches andparents can monitor the behavior.Coaches and parents can add players to their smartphone app (with permission granted), so they can monitor any given player's situation. Each player also has a designated guardian with whom he/she share the such information and alarms.The Cloud Based Data Storage and MoreThe data is also uploaded to the database on AWS cloud. Not only can parents remotely monitor players' situation, records of their hit impact can be used by medical staff to diagnose the players' symptoms.If we collect enough players' data over a long enough period of time, with enough volunteers' permission, we hope to collaborate with engineering and medical schools from universities to build a model that can better predict how hit impacts will lead to long-term brain damage. With such a prediction model, we will be able to perform real-time predictions and preventions.We have identified our manufacturing partner for all electronics needed (Made in U.S.A.), and we arein the process of finalizing agreements with manufacturing partners for outside package.We have built the Android version of the app, and will port to an iSO version soon.We are youngentrepreneurs, but we have big dreams and we are growing our skills to make it happen. We need your help to transfer our prototype into production.We pledge to keep you updated on our progress on our website.

We fine-tuned the design in 2017 for 2nd generation design, and have made first batch of initial production.Feel free to watch the HD version of the video below (on Youtube).What is the Aegis of Soteria ProductThe SensorBased on research done by the Department of Physics and Astronomy at University of Rochester, the Department of Neuroscience at Columbia University, and the Department of Organismal Biology and Anatomy at University of Chicago (seethis research paper here), an evolution of g-force from hit impacts happens inmilliseconds and the threshold of a concussion happens around 200g (see figure below from above quoted paper):The AoS400 sensor is a specially designed sensor module that can be easily attached to the helmet, with a customized accelerometer chip that can measure +/- 400g.When a player absorbs an impact in a potentially dangerous way (currently set at 50% of concussion threshold, using both Severity index and Head Injury Criterion), the sensor lights up to alert the player.The Mobile ApplicationThe impact data can be downloaded to smartphones on the sideline, using Bluetooth Low Energy, socoaches andparents can monitor the behavior.Coaches and parents can add players to their smartphone app (with permission granted), so they can monitor any given player's situation. Each player also has a designated guardian with whom he/she share such information and alarms.The Cloud-Based Data Storage and MoreThe data is also uploaded to the database on AWS cloud. Not only can parents remotely monitor players' situation, records of their hit impact can be used by medical staff to diagnose the players' symptoms.If we collect enough players' data over a long enough period of time, with enough volunteers' permission, we hope to collaborate with engineering and medical schools from universities to build a model that can better predict how hit impacts will lead to long-term brain damage. With such a prediction model, we will be able to perform real-time predictions and preventions.PatentWe have filed US patent earlier this year regarding our cloud-based approachWe have manufactured the first batch of initial production (see this link on where all those components are coming from).This is our production site:And here is our products:We have built the Android version of the app, and plan to port to iSO down the road.We are youngentrepreneurs, but we have big dreams and we are growing our skills to make it happen. We need your help to transfer our prototype into production.We pledge to keep you updated on our progress on ourwebsite. If you are in the bay area, we are happy to meet you to get your advice and help.We have authorized adults with thorough experience in semiconductor industries to help us make sure everything is running along smoothly with no complications.","The AoS sensor and associated app are not concussion prevention tools. It is used to provide objective data for medical professionals to make educated assessment. However, our dream is to be able to collect enough data (with volunteers' permission) and build a predictive model over long-term."

We have advanced from GameSir G1, G2, G3,GameSir G4s to the current GameSir model. However, this feat has come with a set of challenges that have impacted the design process. Our seasoned developers work tirelessly to overcome these challenges and deliver high-level performance that players associate with our company. We take every minute detail very seriously and hope to bring our core products within reach of all our supporters. Some of the challenges we experience are as follows:Risk/Challenge#1 : Timeline can slip After one year of design experience collaborating with some of the leading gaming companies in the US and incorporating ideas from gaming fans, we have learned lessons in regards to timing. We have developed and tested many prototypes, and we are now ready to translate these designs into finished products for the mass market. Even though the testing phase took longer than expected, we relish in the comfort of having two reliable Chinese suppliers. Both suppliers have more than five years’ experience in this trade, and they have the capacity to produce M2 in time as we gather funds from Kickstarter. We have already raised some funds from investors, and we look forward to your support as well.We take quality very seriously and for this purpose, we shall send a few samples of the gamepad to our fans so they can give us feedback. If there is a need for further alterations to the gamepad, we will extend the testing process for one or two months until we get it right. Keeping you updated is critical to us, and therefore, we will inform our supporters in case of any delays in the timelines.Risk/Challenge#2 : Reward fulfillment Deciding on a suitable reward system is another challenge we faced, but after careful considerations of plausible options, we arrived at a solution. We planned ahead and set the ball rolling on ordering the rewards such as gamepads and t-shirts to ensure they arrive as scheduled.  We have enjoyed a long partnership with our suppliers, and this makes it easier for both parties to communicate and adhere to the set deadlines. We placed an order of controllers and other materials that are only slightly above their minimum order quantity. This way, we are confident that any delays will not pose a serious threat to our timelines. While we appreciate every minute spent on our products, we will strive to get these rewards delivered to you in time.Risk/Challenge#3: Product QualityQuality is at the heart of our designs, and we choose to work with only top manufacturers in China who can deliver the level of quality we desire. We always make a trial order for sample testing before releasing the products to our valuable supporters in large scale. With this Kickstarter initiative, we promise that every backer will get our full customer service to address his or her concerns.",https://www.kickstarter.com/projects/gamesir/gamesir-g5-the-next-gen-gaming-controller-for-moba?ref=discovery_category_newest,gamesir/gamesir-g5-the-next-gen-gaming-controller-for-moba,"GameSir G5 is the next generation gaming controller and the first gamepad that is designed for mobile MOBA games and First/Third-Person Shooting games. Merging several revolutionary inventions: trackpad, surrounding button layout, extra configurable buttons, GameSir G5 strikes the ordinary way to mobile gaming and brings out the brand-new control solution with your iOS/Android smartphone. If you are a mobile gamer who loves battling online, it is the ultimate secret weapon to win.First of all, GameSir G5 is the world's first MOBAs and shooting gaming controller for smartphones. It has literally a different look from the other controllers. In design, we used cool and futurist concept with the black color scheme that looks great and fits in with the typical gamer aesthetic.GameSir g5 has literally a different look from the other controllers. It has a cool and futurist design, but what makes the GameSirG5 so unique is the trackpad and the around button sets on the right side of the gamepad.The trackpad is responsive and sensitive to track your finger’s input precisely. It allows you to tap, drag to cast a spell or move your camera around in shooting games.The trackpad is also loaded with four raised dots to secure your blind control. It allows youto tap on the dots as pressing ABXY buttons.Surrounding the trackpad are the buttons, with the new layout and design, the buttons are designated to simulate multi-function hotkeys work for different occasions.First, they are MOBA friendly. If you are playing Arena of Valor, the upper buttons function as level-up spell hotkeys; the lower buttons become the summoner spell hotkeys.Second, if you are playing Rules of Survival, those buttons are the supplier pick-up hotkey.We’ve been testing lots of existing controllers in the market and realized that even Xbox One controller or PS4 controller, has the mushy and long-distance L1/R1, L2/R2 triggers. Long key travel triggers may cause finger fatigue when you use it for long periods of time.Speak of the control, it also makes the response of commanding slower, which is worse for gaming, Instead of using the traditional linear moving triggers, we use mechanical triggers with a short key travel distance.The 1mm distance of key travel gives you an effortless pressing experience yet still provides you a clear and clicky feedback.To maximum the support for gaming, we added four extra customizable buttons. Dual shoulder L4/L5 triggers and dual L5/R5 rear buttons. It supports the custom assignment of any button function in accordance with the needs.Inherited from all other controllers of GameSir, we've added the stretchable mounting 3.54 inch length stand which allows to securely hold a broad range of screen size of your smartphones in multi-angles of 110° and 150°.Adopting Bluetooth® 5.0 connection, the latest wireless data exchanging standard which provides 2 times faster of speed, 4 times larger of range and the more stable connection between the controller and your smartphone compare to previous 4.0/4.1 standard. GameSir G5 is compatible with Android devices (version 4.0 and above), iOS devices (version iOS 7.0 and above).GameSir G5 is mainly designed for MOBAs and FPS games. Playing games with GameSir G5 does not require root or jailbreak on your phone. Just need a little effort to set up at the beginning, you may enjoy the full potential that GameSir G5 can offer. They are two methods to play the popular game titles:If you are an iOS user, you need to install ""Happy Chick Emulator"" app and play the selected popular game titles directly through the app. *This method does not require a jailbreak, and will neither hurt the game nor the phone.If you are an Android user, then you need to install ""GameSir World"" app and use GameSir remapper A2 (a USB stick tool comes along with the controller) to remap your phone first before you play games. The remapping process is easy and hassle-free. *This method does not require a root, and will neither hurt the game nor the phone.We will keep updating the list of the popular mobile MOBA and FPS game titles on the app consistently so you don't have to worry about missing the hottest games.By default, pre-selected games have the pre-set button configuration so you don't have to worry about the setting thing.However, for advanced users who want to customize their own button setting, we provide the extreme flexible way for you to configure buttons. By pressing the home button on the GameSir G5, it pops up the configuration window. Drag and place any button icons over the on-screen buttons and use the GameSir G5 to control it!More info about the button configuration please visit theofficial page HERESo let's talk about our motivation to make this controller. As a leading gaming controller company, we saw a great boom in the gaming industry where online battle games took over the market rapidly in following years. Nowadays, MOBAs and FPSs have become two of the most popular choices across all smartphones. With the rapid growing market in mobile games, MOBAs and FPSs require more complex controls which are not friendly to all gamers. Realizing this issue, we kept investigating and figured out some of the most concerns for mobile MOBA gamers: 1. One of The Biggest Issues is The Control Messy buttons on the touchscreen is a nightmare for most of the players. On the most occasion, it is somewhat unfriendly to control almost every command on a small screen with only two thumbs. It is even worst with FPSs when your right thumb is used to fire, jump, reload, pick-up equips and control the camera at the same time. b. The Vision is Poor It happens to everyone that your fingers often partially cover the screen and block your view when touching the on-screen buttons. For some other casual games, this isn’t a big deal, but in MOBAs and FPSs, it is frustrating because a poor vision can mean a death to you. c. Hand Fatigue and Injury Holding your smartphone and gaming are not ergonomic. Your thumbs are stressed and twisted all the time. The prolonged gaming session hurts your hands. Therefore, with a commitment to bring gamers the best peripheral like always, we decided to invent the controller which ultimately solves the common issues brought from playing MOBA and FPS games with smartphones. With 2 years research and development, we are glad to show our pride gaming solution: GameSir G5, the next-gen gaming controller for mobile MOBAs and FPSs.We are GameSir team. We have been researching and developing mobile gaming hardware since 2013, collaborating with over 30 game companies and publishers.Currently, GameSir G5 is still in the final production, the estimated delivery time will be started at last period of March 20181.	How does the gamepad get connected? Bluetooth connection for Android/iOS devices.2.	Which games can be supported? a. For both iOS and Android user, we keep looking at the top-ranked games and make sure those games which match GameSir G5 will be supported by the app updating. b. If you are an Android user, you can remap any games that are not on the list, however, a tool GameSir Remapper A2 is required before playing.3.	Where can I download the games for GameSir G5? a.	For Android users: please install GameSir World app to acquire the game list. With the remap function of GameSir Remapper A2, MOBA and FPS games can be played. b.	For iOS users: please download the cloud adapted games from Happy Chick Emulator.","We, GameSir, attempts to bring all backers the finest controller with the highest-grade quality. Prototype stage was successfully finished, currently, we are testing the pre-production models.With our GameSir team with 5-year experience in gaming controller development, we are trying the best to improve the production of GameSir G5. There may be some challenges could jump up in the future:1. Some mirror changes of the appearanceTo offer gamers the most ergonomic gamepad, we have been spending a lot of effort on appearance designing. We’ve researched into over 200 gamers’ hand shape and molded over ten prototypes to ensure it fits as many people’s hand as possible. The texture, grip, face and the button layout might be slightly changed in the final mass-production. 2. The delivery timeWe have a good maintenance and communication with manufactory to ensure the production and delivery time. however, the risk of delivery delay still remains. If there are unexpected delays during the manufacturing and delivery, we will always keep our backers posted.3. The GameSir G5 games from the appWe consistently update the most popular MOBAs and FPSs titles in could adapted version to the apps, however, we cannot guarantee that the games you wanted are on the list because it is labor limitation. To play your favorite game which is not listed on the app, you need the tool GameSir Remapper A2 (bundle with the controller) to remap it."

No. We do not own the rights to Godzilla or any of the other monsters. They are trademarks of Toho Company., Limited. This film is not endorsed by Toho, Legendary or any other studio. This is a passion project being created by fans and talented individuals who love the character and the project. We will not be making any profit off of this. Any digital copy, blu ray or any other rewards produced will be for backers only for their personal use and as a thank you for helping produce the film. The film and these rewards will never be duplicated or mass produced and the film will not be released on the internet.This is purely a labor of love with no ulterior motives or intent to exploit the intellectual properties for monetary gain.What is Godzilla: Heritage?Since Godzilla's first attack in 1954, mankind has been under constant threat from gigantic creatures known as ""Superfauna"" - animals mutated by the coming of the nuclear age and man's abuse of the atom's destructive power. Humanity was united against a common foe and for almost 60 years, worked collectively to study and combat the creatures as millions died, cities crumbled and the world's economy continued to collapse. Now, the world seems to finally be bringing the threat under control. Jack Martin is a correspondent for United World News and the grandson of Pulitzer Prize winning journalist Steve Martin, who's riveting coverage of the 1954 raid on Tokyo made him a legend. With his grandfather's shadow always overhead, Jack has spent his career attempting to forge his own legacy, showing great promise as a journalist before spiraling into depression. In the process, he has severely damaged both his reputation and his marriage to family friend, Kaori Ogata. Before leaving the agency, Jack decides to travel to a small pacific island with his life-long friend Mitch Lawrence, who now runs UWN's old newspaper division. While the two wait to attend a ground-breaking ceremony for a new building, Godzilla suddenly reappears after nearly 30 years of absence...and he hasn't returned alone. With the King of the Monsters' threat looming, Jack must decide whether to flee or finally embrace his heritage and report the attack as it happens - risking not only his life, but the lives of his best friend and his wife.What kind of effects will be utilized for the monster action in this film?Godzilla: Heritage will utilized traditional suitmation (man in a suit) techniques and animatronics alongside extensive sets and detailed miniature work, similar to Japanese giant monster films. These scenes will be blended with more contemporary visual effects.Who is behind Godzilla: Heritage?Godzilla: Heritage's concept has drawn the interest of several talented artists and actors on an international level. The project was conceived by Upstate NY filmmakers Tim Schiefer and Greg Graves, life-long monster movie fans.Rashaad Santiago will be creating most of the film's creature effects. Rashaad is a very talented and upcoming effects makeup artist from The Bronx and the winner of the 6th season of Syfy channel's reality show Face Off. Rashaad is also a life-long fan of the film's titular character. Creating the film's non-creature makeup effects along with Rashaad is the wonderful Tess Laeh, another of the talented individuals featured in season 6. She will also be making some of the props used in the film.The creatures' concept art was created by Greg and Elden Ardiente, who worked together extensively to come up with new, naturalistic and interesting looks for the many monsters that exist in the world of Godzilla: Heritage. Elden is a graphic designer and creature concept artist residing in Sydney, Australia and his amazing visions are being transformed into creature suit form by Rashaad.The visual effects for the film will be created and supervised by Chris Bloomer.

What would the funding be used for?Making a feature length giant monster film, even one that utilizes mostly practical effects is quite an undertaking and even though 25,000 dollars is a lot of money, in the scope of today's film production it's a shoestring amount.Extensive work has and will continue to be put into making the best possible creature suits, for example. Materials for these suits can add up and there are still multiple suits to construct for the film. In addition we've rented a make-shift sound stage for the production, where several miniature sets and stages will have to be constructed.Many people have agreed to work for us at incredibly generous rates, or for no money at all because they enjoy the concept so much. However, many of these people will still be travelling long distances to take part in the project or have to provide for their families while devoting most of their professional time to Heritage. These generous people will need to have their traveling, lodging and meal costs covered while they are working.In addition there is still some equipment that has to be purchased and rented for the production. Additional lenses and accessories for the A camera, additional cameras for certain scenes, as well as lighting and some additional sound equipment. Hiring an experienced composer will also be a factor.Our goal is to tell a fantastic story and provide the best possible quality of filmmaking we can. We have very creative people on this project who will be very flexible and resourceful with our budget. Every cent asked for will go directly into the production and any additional funds will be wisely used to make the project even better.AND...if the fundraiser goes beyond the monetary goal we have set, not only will we be able to make the film even better, but we will also donate a portion of these extra funds to Japanese Tsunami Relief operations, which are still ongoing.What's the film's status?Right now Godzilla: Heritage is in pre-production, the script is complete and being polished. Most of the film is cast with remaining casting to be done in July. The crew members are working already or ready to go. If the film is successfully funded, we can begin filming by the end of the summer and have the finished product by the summer of 2015.How can I help?By pledging an amount you will be helping to make this dream a reality and you'll be eligible to receive reward exclusive to those pledging through this Kickstarter page. Browse through the column on the right and see what sort of rewards we're offering. Think of pledging as pre-orders for them once the film is complete.","This is an all or nothing campaign. If we cannot get funding, the production of ""Godzilla: Heritage"" could be suspended indefinitely and never be produced. There's always the possibility there could have some setbacks on any project.

Although our first Kickstarter fell short of its goal despite the many generous donations by our backers, it did give us a good idea as to how much we can raise for the project. What we propose this time around is simple: funding the project in two stages.This new ""Phase One"" Kickstarter will give us the opportunity to raise a more reasonable amount of money to get the ball rolling. This way, we can begin production and get a good portion of work done on the film for a second Kickstarter down the line to raise the rest of the funds we need to finish the project completely. It will also give future backers a far better idea of what the crew is capable of and what the final film is going to look like.Is this an official studio production? No. We do not own the rights to Godzilla or any of the other monsters. They are trademarks of Toho Company., Limited. This film is not endorsed by Toho, Legendary or any other studio. This is a passion project being created by fans and talented individuals who love the character and the project. We will not be making any profit off of this. Any digital copy, blu ray or any other rewards produced will be for backers only for their personal use and as a thank you for helping produce the film. The film and these rewards will never be duplicated or mass produced and the film will not be released on the internet. This is purely a labor of love with no ulterior motives or intent to exploit the intellectual properties for monetary gain.What is Godzilla: Heritage?Since Godzilla's first attack in 1954, mankind has been under constant threat from gigantic creatures known as ""Superfauna"" - animals mutated by the coming of the nuclear age and man's abuse of the atom's destructive power. Humanity was united against a common foe and for almost 60 years, worked collectively to study and combat the creatures as millions died, cities crumbled and the world's economy continued to collapse. Now, the world seems to finally be bringing the threat under control. Jack Martin is a correspondent for United World News and the grandson of Pulitzer Prize winning journalist Steve Martin, who's riveting coverage of the 1954 raid on Tokyo made him a legend. With his grandfather's shadow always overhead, Jack has spent his career attempting to forge his own legacy, showing great promise as a journalist before spiraling into depression. In the process, he has severely damaged both his reputation and his marriage to family friend, Kaori Ogata. Before leaving the agency, Jack decides to travel to a small pacific island with his life-long friend Mitch Lawrence, who now runs UWN's old newspaper division. While the two wait to attend a ground-breaking ceremony for a new building, Godzilla suddenly reappears after nearly 30 years of absence...and he hasn't returned alone. With the King of the Monsters' threat looming, Jack must decide whether to flee or finally embrace his heritage and report the attack as it happens - risking not only his life, but the lives of his best friend and his wife.What kind of effects will be utilized for the monster action in this film?Godzilla: Heritage will utilized traditional suitmation (man in a suit) techniques and animatronics alongside extensive sets and detailed miniature work, similar to Japanese giant monster films. These scenes will be blended with more contemporary visual effects. Who is behind Godzilla: Heritage?Godzilla: Heritage's concept has drawn the interest of several talented artists and actors on an international level. The project was conceived by Upstate NY filmmakers Tim Schiefer and Greg Graves, life-long monster movie fans.Rashaad Santiago will be creating most of the film's creature effects. Rashaad is a very talented and upcoming effects makeup artist from The Bronx and the winner of the 6th season of Syfy channel's reality show Face Off. Rashaad is also a life-long fan of the film's titular character. Creating the film's non-creature makeup effects along with Rashaad is the wonderful Tess Laeh, another of the talented individuals featured in season 6. She will also be making some of the props used in the film. The creatures' concept art was created by Greg and Elden Ardiente, who worked together extensively to come up with new, naturalistic and interesting looks for the many monsters that exist in the world of Godzilla: Heritage. Elden is a graphic designer and creature concept artist residing in Sydney, Australia and his amazing visions are being transformed into creature suit form by Rashaad. The visual effects for the film will be created and supervised by Chris Bloomer. His VFX credits include Zombieland, Dragonball: Evolution, Warehouse 13 and Lost Girl. Mr. Bloomer's work is fantastic and he will be essential in blending the film's practical and visual effects.

But when things don’t go as planned, and romance crashes down around her, it launches her on a quest to understand what it means to truly love another person. Will Grace finally discover love or ruin her chances for happiness forever?1. This is a Christian Romantic Drama MovieMovies are divided into genres, or categories that quickly help you identify the type of movie you're about to watch, such as Animated, Sci-Fi, Epic, Drama, Western, etc. Princess Cut's genre is a Romantic Drama / Comedy.Now there's a lot of debate about whether Christian is a genre or not, or whether such a thing as a ""Christian movie"" even exists. To make it plain, we simply mean this movie is squarely based on a Christian worldview. So if you were looking for a Buddhist romance movie, or a New Age romance movie or an Islamic romance movie, sorry, wrong number. But if you're looking for an entertaining movie to watch that's going to be categorized by ""the powers that be"" alongsideFireproof, Love Comes Softly, October Baby, Mom's Night Out, When Calls the Heart, etc., then these flowers are for you!2. This is not a Courtship Movie...and it's not a Dating movieOne of the peculiar things about human nature is that we tend to swing to one extreme or the other on any given issue. Democrat vs. Republican, Calvinist vs. Arminian, cats vs. dogs, and...you guessed it, Dating vs. Courtship. But what happens is, we think we know what the terms mean or stand for, but often, upon hearing the ""buzzword"", we (wrongly) attribute our own ideas onto the term. That's not what we're trying to do with this movie.This is a story about the Nature of Love.Everyone wants to love and be loved. But what, exactly, IS love? What does love look like and how does (or should) a person in love act? That's what we explore in this movie. Hint: it doesn't matter if you call it dating or courtship, it's how you act that matters. Can I get that door for you, ma'am?3. This movie does not contain nudity and profanityPopcorn has been popped, soda poured, and you're ready for a great love story. So you go down to your local video store or pull up Netflix in search of the perfect romance, and here's what you get with most ""chick flicks"" today: 9 out of the 13 romance movie releases in 2014 are rated R and contain graphic nudity and strong profanity. Wait a minute, what's happening to our romances here? How come we're getting more 10 Rules for Sleeping Around and Sex Tape and fewer Roman Holiday or Pride & Prejudice? We're trying to reverse that trend that's been taking us in the wrong direction, and we choose instead to affirm that purity is a treasure of inestimable worth.4. The title Princess Cut does not refer to cuttingNo, this movie does not have a princess who pricks her finger on a spinning wheel. And no, this is not a documentary movie about or that contains the practice of cutting. Rather, a Princess Cut is an exquisite diamond ring shape, one of the most popular ring choices in the world, and worn as a symbol of a couple's love, and fidelity. This is is what Grace wants slipped on her finger, and you'll have to watch the movie to find out if she achieves that goal!5. This movie is already completedJust to make it clear, we thought we'd state it plainly one more time. All the footage for Princess Cut has already been shot, archived, and soon to be locked in the editing timeline. Once we add the finishing touches, this movie will be coming to a theater near you or ready to be popped into your DVD player, hopefully in time for Valentine's Day 2015. Romantic evening straight ahead!So if the movie's already completed, what are we running a (2nd) Kickstarter for?Over the past four years, I (and numerous other people!) have spent literally hundreds of thousands of hours writing, planning, budgeting, organizing, casting, producing, creating, building, filming, directing, and editing. But there are some things I simply don't have the expertise or tools to accomplish on my own. Here are two critical pieces of the puzzle that we are specifically focusing on with this 2nd Princess Cut Kickstarter campaign:1. Sound Design and Mix (Audio Post Engineer)""Films are 50 percent visual and 50 percent sound. Sometimes sound even overplays the visual."" ~ David LynchThe importance of sound in film cannot and should not be underestimated. It's so vital that the Academy of Motion Picture Arts and Sciences, recognizing the artistic contribution of exceptional sound editing, at its Annual Academy Awardshands out an Oscar for Best Sound Editing. Without good sound design and a sound mix to complement the gorgeous visuals, a film like Princess Cut will crash and burn.First, someone has to own or have access to all the right tools (which I don't) such as digital audio workstations, huge sound effects libraries, mixing boards, and countless other pieces of expensive audio paraphernalia.But secondly, and even more importantly, you've got to know how to use these tools skillfully to craft an engaging soundscape that includes all the dialogue, sound effects, and musical score. Thisonly comes from years of experience and frankly, even if I could purchase all the tools today, it would take years for me to reach the same level of audio excellence a professional with vast experience on multiple feature films already possesses. Besides, you don't want to wait that long for your romance movie, do you?2. Musical Score (Composer)""If I weren't a director, I would want to be a film composer."" ~ Steven SpielbergAn expertly crafted musical score can elevate a motion picture to a point of brilliance. Music's purpose and place, like a queen reigning alongside the king, are to complement, draw out, and highlight the soul of the film's story. Who can forget the soaring melodies of John Williams or the riveting rhythms of Hans Zimmer or the heart-string plucking tones of Thomas Newman?Now some people may not know this, but I am an accomplished classical pianist in my own right. So I understand and appreciate the difficulties of coming up with an original score. And while it is certainly possible that I could attempt to plunk out a score for Princess Cut, I think ultimately that would be a disservice to the film, and in turn to you, the viewer. Because you deserve the very best, most memorable, hummable and touching score I can pair up with this story!Here's my proposal: help me reach my goal on Kickstarter, and I'll hire the professionals who will get this job done most effectively, so you can thrill to crystal clear 5.1 surround sound and get a sweeping theme stuck in your head. Please say yes!This time around we've lowered some of the levels to be even more reachable, and added some NEW rewards such as the Digital Soundtrack of the film!Here are some of the other fantastic rewards we have lined up for you:• Your name in the credits, both on the official movie website and in the movie• A Digital Download, DVD, or BluRay of the Princess Cut Movie• Annotated Princess Cut Script, from either the director or star actress• Personalized Script Analysis from writer/director Paul Munger• Custom movie photo book• Framed movie prints• Dinner with the Director and Select Actors• Vacation getaway to Oak Haven, where the movie was filmed• And many more!Note that each level includes all of the rewards from the levels preceding it (unless of course it is a limited or exclusive reward, such as the custom kitchen island seen in the picture below or the annotated script from our leading lady Ashley Bratcher)Writer/Producer/Director Paul Munger is an award-winning filmmaker who has been working in all types of media for over 10 years.

Princess Cut has been a passion project for Paul and his wife Sheilah, each drawing from their combined personal experiences to craft a beautifully engaging, humorous and heartwarming love story. Of course I didn't make this movie alone! I had a phenomenal team of professional filmmakers, and I want to expressparticular thanks to my outstandingCasting Director Katrina Cook, Line Producer/1st Assistant Director David Cook, and Director of Photography Spencer Weaver, all of whom have long lists of film work credits and whose experience and insights were invaluable.Some people have asked me, ""Why didn't you get to keep the $13,000 you raised from your first Kickstarter?""Here's how it works: Kickstarter is the largest crowdfunding platform for creative projects in the world. Awesome fans and supporters just like you join together and pledge to donate funds in return for cool rewards offered at different giving levels. But if you don't reach your goal, no money exchanges hands. This time around I've set a modest goal of $10,000 to be raised within a 15 day timeframe but again if we don't raise the entire amount by that deadline, then we receive none of the funds and we wouldn't be able to give you the rewards. The important thing to keep in mind is that Kickstarter is all or nothing.Allow me to introduce you to the amazing cast of Princess Cut. I love this cast to death!

But the good news is, we've already overcome a majority of the hurdles! With God's help I raised all the funding for principal photography, discovered and directed our talented cast, hired a hardworking, dedicated crew, and have been editing the film, which is now nearly complete. The risks that yet lie ahead require putting finishing touches on the film, so there could be scheduling conflicts that delay post-production and secondly, dealing with the pressures of a crowded marketplace is a major (but by no means impossible) challenge. With the years of experience and connections of myself and my cast/crew, and combined with your kind assistance, I'm confident we can finish strong!"

I have a very clear memory of one particular guitar solo by Scott and the musical interaction between him and Charlie.  I can’t remember the tune or really very much else about the concert, but I do remember being blown away by the nuance and melodic nature of the solo. It began with a small single line motive, becoming more elaborate and complex with stylistic references to Jim Hall or John Abercrombie, eventually wrapping up with several Wes Montgomery-esque octave lines hinting back at the melody.  This experience began to shape my idea of what great music is and could be.I must have seen Scott play hundreds of times since that evening, and have heard him play everything from straight ahead jazz or funk, to folk and rock.  What I find remarkable about his playing is that Scott always sounds like Scott, while at the same time pulling his influences from a diverse set of musicians, poets, songwriters, and visual artists.  When Scott and I began talking about producing his record, I had a very clear idea of the record I wanted to make with him.  I have listened to him play for the last twenty years, and although I enjoy his previous recordings, there is a range and depth to his musicality that I feel has not quite been captured yet.   My goal with this recording was to bring out the various sides of his playing and writing that have not made their way to record yet.Once the plan had been formulated and Scott started sending me the original material for the recording, I became even more excited.  Scott has written some of his best work ever. We also chose several tunes to be reinterpreted, including a jaw-dropping version of Nick Drake’s “Riverman,” sung by Grammy nominated vocalist Kate McGarry.  The chosen group includes some of the finest musicians in North Carolina.  The core group consists of Dave Finucane (tenor sax), Ron Brendle (a-bass), Brian Sullivan (drums), Bobby Cohen (drums). and very special guests Kate McGarry (voice), Tony Williamson (mandolin), and Bruce Piephoff (spoken word). The record will contain eight original compositions, two tunes from the more modern popular songbook, one standard, and a poem/improvisation from Bruce Piephoff.Now in the final mixing stages, I am truly excited to bring Scott’s fans a record that encompasses the many facets of his musical talent.  In order for us to complete this recording, we are asking for support and pre-orders. The funding will pay for:Scott has offered great rewards for your support, including lessons, performances, lead sheets, high-resolution downloads of Dreamers, other downloads; a great bargain for any guitar and music aficionado.Scott and I thank you all for your support, and promise you’re going to dig this record! ~ Jason Richmond A Note from Scott Sawyer:So, it's been 5 years since the release of my previous album, “Go There”...time flies. I've managed tostay busy with music, appearing on 10 albums and performing with a variety of musicians andprojects. I'm also an adjunct instructor at East Carolina University (School of Music/Jazz) and continueto work with a handful of private students at home.As an independent musician, I've always “produced” my own recordings. For “Dreamers,” it's been areal pleasure letting go...and handing over the production duties to Jason Richmond. I've known Jasonfor years and we share more than a few musical interests; he's an excellent recording engineer andunderstands where I'm coming from, too...(musically and otherwise). Big plus.An intriguing group of musicians was assembled for these sessions. Old and new friends. I've knownRon Brendle, Bruce Piephoff and Bobby Cohen for years. More recently, I've crossed musical pathswith Tony Williamson, Dave Finucane and Brian Sullivan. Prior to the sessions, Kate McGarry and I hadmet briefly, in passing...we got together once, just days before recording to sketch out some ideas.In music, the vibe and feel are what's most important to me...it was big fun hearing these songs –some old, some new – come to life in the studio.Thank You for taking the time to read about “Dreamers”. To complete the album, we'll need to raise atleast $10,000. If the project interests you, please consider “pre-ordering” the CD or album downloadby making a pledge. And if you have any questions, I'm happy to hear from you...please be in touchand I'll respond asap.All the Best! ~ Scott SawyerBio and Press:Scott Sawyer displays his musical diversity like a badge of honor, re-visiting his blues & rock rootswhile continuing to explore the jazz tradition & beyond. He's performed at countless venues here andabroad (Asia, Brazil, Canada, Central America, Europe, the Middle East) including prestigious festivals& concert halls, music clubs and beer-soaked dives.Sawyer has toured extensively with jazz singer Nnenna Freelon and was a member of the 1992 PhilipMorris Superband which featured jazz icons Phil Woods, Jimmy Heath, Kenny Barron and BobCranshaw, as well as rising stars Joshua Redman and Christian McBride. Other tours include CentralAmerica with vibraphonist Jon Metzger (USIA, Arts America Program). Sawyer has shared the stage and/orrecorded with countless notable artists including Charlie Byrd, David Murray, Jack Wilkins, (prima ballerina)Marie-Christine Mouis, Willie Pickens, Ed Thigpen, Bob Cranshaw, Carroll Dashiell, Keith Waters, BrucePiephoff, Buster Williams, Oteil Burbridge, Kofi Burbridge, Bill Anschell, Mel Melton, Jon Lucien, SteveKimock, Melissa Reaves, The Meldavians, Lois Deloatch, Ghezzi, Adrian Duke...to name a few. Sawyer's album “GO THERE” (2007) charted on XM Radio. Numerous sideman recording creditsinclude pianist Keith Water's ""Carolina Tracks"" (2012; guitar and Associate Producer); Bruce Piephoff's""Still Looking Up at the Stars"" (2012, produced by Sawyer); ""The Meldavians-Farewell toArigemon"" (2012); Nnenna Freelon & John Brown Big Band ""Christmas"" (2012); Nnenna Freelon's""Homefree"" (2010) plus her 1997 Grammy-Nominated ""Shaking Free"", “Live” (at the Kennedy Center;2003) and ""Listen"" (1993); Lois Deloatch's “Roots: Jazz, Blues Spirituals” (Sawyer co-produced); GaryBrunotte's “Manic Moments” and Bill Anschell's “a different note all together”.Sawyer is an Adjunct Instructor at East Carolina University (Greenville, NC); teaching Applied JazzGuitar and Jazz Chamber (small-groups). He continues to offer private instruction to guitarists andother instrumentalists. He's been a featured artist/clinician/speaker at numerous colleges, schools andvenues, and has presented workshops in public and private schools.###""It’s perfectly understandable why connoisseurs of fine music often refer to Scott Sawyer as a jazzguitarist. It’s because he does the jazz thing so well. He’s an expert at breathing new life into that oldgraveyard of American Popular Song. By artfully reinvestigating this body of familiar melodies andpicking through the harmonic bones, Dr. Scott has resuscitated many a standard.Jazz, however, is merely one of the many tools within his gig bag. He fingers the blues electric with theauthenticity of someone who has lived them. That’s not all. With country-boy affability, he strums andtwangs. Chicken-picks. Shucks. Jives. Funks it up. And then breaks your heart with that one poignantlove note that’s soft as an angel’s wing.Like his better-known contemporaries John Scofield & Bill Frisell, Sawyer was weaned on the Beatles,the blues & ‘Bird’. You can hear it in everything he plays, a new kind of guitarspeak comprised of pop,improv and sounds never before heard. It is a language Sawyer uses with authority."" (Joe Vanderford)(on Scott Sawyer “Go There”) ""I've been a fan of Scott Sawyer's music for years and consider him to beone of the greatest guitarists in the country. That there are so few recordings of him available is one ofthe music world's great injustices. Compounding this difficulty is that his playing is so damn good in somany diverse styles, which means there are still a lot of CDs to make if the public is going to have aninkling of his gift. Go There is Scott at his genre-busting best. What would you call this? ""fusion""?""jazzy jamband""? In the end it doesn't matter: this is just cool music, from the soul, with inventivewriting, fantastic players, and heartfelt improvisations. Go wherever you have to to get a copy of thisdisc."" -- Alex Martin""The Allman Brothers Band will continue what’s being called the “40 Years of Highs and Lows” tour, allpart of a 60 date US tour. While in NY, I got to do a gig with Go There, who I recorded with in 2006.Scott Sawyer and Kenny Soule are two of my favorite musicians to play with."" - Oteil Burbridge (ChrisJisi, Bass Player Magazine (Jun 01, 2009)""Welcome to Scott Sawyer, the funk, rock, blues--and jazz-- player...With a preponderance of Sawyertunes, (GO THERE) is all groove underneath...If you're looking for a pure, hard-line jazz album, this isnot it. But if you think it represents a compromise, think again. It's its own species."" - Owen Cordle,News & Observer (May 06, 2007)""I remember hearing years ago about ""...this guy Scott Sawyer...He's the one guy around here who hasa totally cool vibe while being one of the best guitar players in the region."" The guy who said that wasBrian Dennis and he was right. - John Custer; Grammy-nominated producer (Dag, Cry Of Love, COC) """"I did do one CD with this great guitarist named Scott Sawyer.

Just ridiculous, man...They have a guitarist, Scott Sawyerand a drummer Kenny Soule...We went into the studio and did this and I felt like we had been playingtogether for thirty years. It was just amazing how natural it was."" - Oteil Burbridge (jambands,com )…we're pleased to play Scott's music...it sounds great on the air and fits the channel perfectly. Keep upthe great work...” – Russ Davis (Program Director, XM Radio “Beyond Jazz”; 11/16/07)""Scott Sawyer is one of North Carolina’s guitar masters... To this listener, Go There sounds like arighteous amalgam of jazz, funk, rock and blues performed by a crew of very solid players. Forimmediate inspiration, check the brilliant, funkified arrangement of George Harrison’s “Tax Man.” "" -Philip van Vleck (Metro Magazine) (on Ed Paolantonio's ""Dad's Blues"")….Sawyer grabs you on the title cut with soul and intellect, sort oflike bluesman B.B. King meeting jazzman Jim Hall---N&O; (Raleigh, NC) (on Ghezzi's ""Taking No Prisoners"")...Vocalist Ghezzi and guitarist extraordinaire Scott Sawyer pack asolid blues punch on this fine outing... Sawyer delves deep into his blues soaked Chicago roots, equallyat home on rockin' blues or coolly perfect weepers like ""Nobody Knows You When You're Down AndOut.""---Gene Hyde (Spectator; Raleigh, NC)""(Charlie) Byrd played amplified acoustic guitar, Sawyer electric guitar. As an accompanist, Sawyersubtly shadowed Byrd. As a soloist, he paced himself thoughtfully and showed much rhythmic variety.He occasionally evoked Wes Montgomery and Jim Hall...throughout the concert, Byrd was a generousleader, swapping solos and phrases with Sawyer""...)--- (N&O; Raleigh, NC)""A thoughtful improviser, Sawyer selects notes carefully from among the many that lie beneath hisfingers. Like master trumpeter Miles Davis, who punctuated his solos with pockets of emptiness,Sawyer lets each note find its own gravity before moving on to the next. But just when you thinkyou've got him nailed as an aw-shucks guitarist who picks unobtrusively in the shadows, one listen toStream reveals Sawyer's alter ego: a boisterous blues man who honks nasty and loud... ""Blue Diner""jolts like a boiling cup of coffee.""---Joe Vanderford (The Independent Weekly; Durham, NC)...""There is refinement in his ability to develop, bend and restructure a line. His compositions andextrapolative improvisation insinuate themselves into your mind.......Sawyer's NC sideman are ascogent and hip as their more nationally recognized counterparts.""---Owen Cordle (N&O; Raleigh, NC)""(Sawyer) obviously enjoys the bop and Coltrane-style free improvisational genres. On those trackswhere he uses a sax, he lets the horn player lead with good effect.....there are a pair of selectionswhich I've always felt were the guitar's forte-a gentle ballad and a melodic piece that builds inintensity with each successive pass. He uses each to effectively demonstrate his own strengths.""---PaulMatthews (CADENCE)""The album's title brings to mind third stream jazz, in this instance mixing electric guitar with acousticinstruments to invent compositions with rock, straightahead, and new music elements. In The Streamis an engaging yet uncompromisingly provocative effort for the serious jazz listener.""---Wayne Self(JazzSouth)""This is meaty, modern, modal stuff. Key is Sawyer's playing: No strummy sloshing around here; it'sdead-on, down to the last well-placed blue note. This is an adventuresome group.""---Dean Smith(Charlotte News & Observer)","All tracking is complete and mixing is underway.  If we reach our goal, the album will be released no later than May 2013.

In Asia, milk tea is a popular drink. You can find it in any store and on the corner of any street. The affordability of the drink and the variety of flavors makes it a drink to die for. The texture and taste of milk tea are so unique that it makes people want to drink more and more. The tea is brewed from organic tea leaves, natural cane sugar, and combined with creamy, fresh whole milk which makes MilkT so tasty. Not only that, it has health benefits of the two that neither both of them have by themselves. Throughout history, people got to know one another through drinking together. By sharing a MilkT, you get to rebuild or create a new relationship with one another. We do not put any artificial preservatives or sweeteners because we want to advocate living a healthy lifestyle. I first started this business by making the milk tea at home and delivering to the customer’s location. Since then, we have grown from our humble kitchen and need to expand to other means of growing our business. We want to introduce delicious milk tea drinks that made people’s childhood a blast. MilkT is a beverage company that is fully committed in supplying organic tea mixtures, created to protect and nourish the health of our planet and you.Earl Grey Milk TeaJasmine Milk TeaBrazilian Coffee Milk TeaGreen Milk TeaAs a child, I really enjoyed the taste of milk tea. However, as I got older and moved away from home, milk tea wasn’t readily available in stores and only in ethnic enclaves. Plus, I realized the powder that stores were using contained many harmful ingredients to my health. Therefore, I started to make my own and for my friends using organic, all natural resources. As people started to want more and more, I started to deliver milk tea to people’s locations. As this business grows, I need capital to fulfill more orders. Therefore, I turn to Kickstarter to help me raise funding, and I want everyone to know about this yummy drink and one day be sold in a store near you!We wanted to put this project on Kickstarter because it is the fastest way for us to get the drinks into your hands and make improvements as a community. We believe that MilkT is great, but we need your help making it even better. Combining milk and tea into one drink you get the nutritional content of not one, but two.

That's crazy! The ingredients they use like high-fructose corn syrup, milk powder, and tea powder can lead to an increased risk of heart disease and diabetes.I was an avid milk tea drinker. I was going to the boba shop more than 5 times a week and I noticed that I started to grow horizontally and not vertically(which I thought milk was supposed to do LOL). I asked my friends and colleagues that if there was a healthy milk tea on the market which I didn't have to worry about the calories and I can drink to my heart's content but there wasn't.Thus, I took it upon myself to create Naicha, which means mandarin for ""milk tea"". I started making it at home and went door to door to ask others if they would like to try it. I started with the three most popular flavors: Jasmine Green Tea, Orange Pekoe Black Milk Tea, and Lavender Earl Grey Milk Tea. I got great feedback and began to expand to the UC Davis campus and to local farmer's markets in Sacramento.Naicha got so popular that UC Davis kicked me off campus! We sold out at the first UC Davis Asian American Night Market. Traction started to gain at Farmer's Markets and in a year I distributed over 2,500 bottles. How was able to do that? Every Saturday, I made milk tea at my commercial kitchen from 10 pm till Sunday 7 am to ensure that I served the freshest milk tea.In Fall 2019, Naicha was honored to participate in the first Real California Milk Accelerator sponsored by the Real California Milk Advisory Board and VentureFuel. In this accelerator, I learned a lot about the dairy and beverage industry. This truly helped with accelerating our commercial formulation and packaging design which we were able to complete in 2020. I decided to add probiotics to Naicha milk tea to make it even more healthy! The probiotics I added are called bacillus subtillis which has been clinically studied to improve the digestive and immune system. Total calories and sugar have been reduced by more than 80% and only use organic and natural ingredients.Fast forward to this year, 2020, which has been a rollercoaster ride of the year. Thankfully after searching endlessly for a year, we have secured a co-packer to manufacture our product to increase our shelf life up to 9 months! In order to get started, we need to hit the co-packer's minimum order quantity which we need your help to do so. That is why we started a Kickstarter with a $10,000 goal to breakeven. The funds we raise will go towards manufacturing, licensing, and product development for future flavors.Naicha isn't just a company but a community for milk tea enthusiasts. I want you to be part of our growth and journey to share a healthy probiotic milk tea for you and for the environment.Thank you for your support!!!!Notable Competitions:****Perks****Variety 3-Pack $16 (Retail $18 Save $2)1 Organic Probiotic Lavender Earl Grey Milk Tea1 Organic Probiotic Orange Pekoe Black Milk Tea1 Organic Probiotic Jasmine Green Milk TeaVariety 6-Pack $33 (Retail $36 Save $3)2x Organic Probiotic Lavender Earl Grey Milk Tea2x Organic Probiotic Orange Pekoe Black Milk Tea2x Organic Probiotic Jasmine Green Milk TeaVariety 12- pack $66 (Retail $72 Save $6)4x Organic Probiotic Lavender Earl Grey Milk Tea4x Organic Probiotic Orange Pekoe Black Milk Tea4x Organic Probiotic Jasmine Green Milk TeaNaicha Consumer Advisory Board Membership $2,000Be a member of our Consumer Advisory Board where you will receive exclusive lifetime first access to future flavors and your feedback will be used to bring the product to market.

Pledge ASAP to get this offer! NatureNow2030.orgURGENT Hello, I am Erik Callender The Reptile Guy and I am a wildlife educator who creates wildlife awareness presentations and literature for children.In this Kickstarter campaign I am following up on our first Quest for Kids mission that made it possible to create the Children Creatures Culture book series and to deliver books to children worldwide.Now we are ready for Quest For Kids 2 which will complete the creation of the Nature Now 2030, a video magazine (featuring VR videos) and wildlife web series (whose name will be kept secret until we reach our first milestone) While moving towards Zero Extinctions by the year 2030.The purpose of this video magazine and web series is to take children of all ages on a fun, heartfelt journeyinto the lives of creatures that they may have neverknown were living right in their own back yard! It will also provide some awesome ways to maintain our planet and protect all living things!After more than 23 years of being a wildlife educator and experiencing the success of Erik's Reptile Edventures, I've finally gathered the courage to shift our company to a mostly virtual, digital, and print media company. The first phase of our journey included the original Quest For Kids campaign and the nationwide release of our PBS documentary Doing The Reptile Rumba in 2017.Now we are in a new phase: Quest for Kids 2 Nature Now 2030 Video Magazine and web series! Here, the focus is on reconnecting to animals in nature and utilizing a hands-off approach to uncover and gain understanding of their lives. This method has made it possible to create content unlike anything I've ever seen! It has also brought to light things that we can do to live in harmony with nature and each other.Each issue features one species that is presented through awesome articles, activities (digital and printed), and videos (high definition and VR-360). The video's codes are hidden inside the pages, and once discovered, you can scan or click on them to unlock the amazing video. One code in each issue contains an episode of the secret web series ! If you're lucky it could also contain one of ten special green ticketsthat could win you a trip into nature!We are planning to get you your first official issue by the second week of August 2020, while the digital issue may be available sooner. You will be updated if expected release dates change due to circumstances that are out of our control.We are currently in the midst of a mass extinction that many are not aware of. There is a solution to this, however, and it lies in our daily interactions with nature.Here's what some people have to say about our work:From holding a camera while filming at the salamander pond and virtual reality content creation, tomarketing, editing, or just calling for support, we could have never gotten this done without this awesome team of wonderful human beings!With these funds, we will begin production as swiftly as possible with a target date of August 14, 2020. At that time, it will be shared virtually with children around the world, and when circumstances allow, in person. Our ultimate goal is to get our magazine and web series to be produced monthly and reach our goal of Zero extinctions from human impacts by the year 2030 for the expansion of biodiversity.Now time for the rewards! This is a bit different than a donation because you're pledging to help bring our project to life. In return, you'll have the satisfaction of knowing that you helped create an awesome project, and you'll receive a special gift!All of the above rewards valued at greater than $25 will include additional issues, provided that we reach our stretch goals. Stretch goals will post once we reach our initial goal of $10,000.In 2015 we launched our first successful campaign called Erik The Reptile Guy's Quest for Kids. Because of the supportive nature of the Kickstarter community, this feels like the best choice for a creative project like ours. Magazine pre-orders will give us the necessary capital to create the best quality magazine that subscribers will love.This Kickstarter campaign gets us thefunding we needto create magazines, to travel to wild locations, and to get amazing video footage and deliver them to children worldwide. Although gas is cheap these days, we still have to pay for it and feed our 20+ animalsthat are often featured in our wildlife web series.","The only risk comes when we have not given it all we've got. The challenge is staying focused in the NOW!  With the current state of events there may be a challenge regarding USPS mail delivery. However, we are ready to plan around that and will meet each challenge as they arrive."

It led to a military test program that developed drugs from organic compounds. Minerals. Flowers. Plants. All things that had been right under our feet this whole time.The drugs gave their users, what can only be described as, supernatural abilities.Turns out that while everyone wrote drugs off as party aids or short cuts to self pity, if you did the right ones, they actually gave you magic powers.""-------------------------------++++++++++++++------------------------------------------------------------------++++++++++++++-----------------------------------Stimulus is an ever evolving anthology series. Each story is specially tailored fora different artist and vary in genre, setting and style, but allencompass a similar theme and center around drug experiences derived from the ""Seafarer"", a fictional hallucinogenic plant found on the ocean floor.The series is an opportunity for me to look inward and address the drama and conflict inside each and everyone of us. Too often the antagonist or threat in a story is an outside aggressor. But I find that most of the time, it's more personal and internal what drives us.And that's exactly what I aim to do with this live action short film, ONYX, an adaption of the short story of the same name.The story follows Cam, a war veteran, who after returning home and attempting to reconnect finds he's much more comfortable being back in the violence. Cam finds himself pushing deeper and deeper into the darkness of his own heart and soul... literally.Sometimes a redemptive pursuit can actually lead us to a much darker place,but who's to say that's not where we wanted to be from the start.READ THE FIRST TWO STIMULUS SHORT STORIES HERE:http://bandittown.tumblr.com/stimulus-------------------------------++++++++++++++-----------------------------------With your support, I aim to bring this story to life. The character Cam will be played by Cameron McHarg, who has also starred in my previous short film ""Frontier""You can see ""Frontier"" here:https://vimeo.com/42257464""Frontier"" was my first short film out of college and was made on a shoestring budget. My hope is to take ""Stimulus: Onyx"" to the next level of professionalism and raising the money through Kickstarter will give me what I need to succeed. Your contribution will enable me to realize this project from beginning to end as I will hire a great crew, secure the right equipment and locations and follow through with sound design and scoring in post production. Any and all support is welcome and most appreciated.The Cast and CrewLead actor Cameron McHarg (http://www.cam-mcharg.com)Producer: Gabrielle Roussos (www.gabrielleroussos.com)Cinematographer: Sergio Bautista (http://88phases.com/section/film)Music: Vercetti Technicolor (https://soundcloud.com/vercetti-technicolor)Costume Design: Molly GirardCasting: Isabel Reyes-------------------------------++++++++++++++-----------------------------------THE REWARDSTo thank you for your donations and support, I've prepared an assortment of rewards. Outside of my cinematic ambitions, I write comic books. I've colored multiple books for Marvel, but the past few years I've spent pursuing my own original stories. My first comic book was UNDYING LOVE. Which I co-created with Tomm Coker.A tale of horror-action, equal parts vampire mythology and Chinese folklore, set in modern day Hong Kong. Ex-soldier John Sargent has fallen for a beautiful Chinese woman named Mei. The only thing keeping the star-crossed lovers apart: she''s a vampire. To free Mei from the curse, Sargent sets out to destroy the vampire that made her. The only problem: Mei was turned by one of the most powerful vampires in history...My second series was the love letter and throwback to 90s brawler and fighting video games like Streets of Rage and Mortal Kombat, BURN THE ORPHANAGEin which I collaborated with childhood friend and former editor of The Walking Dead, Sina Grace.A young orphan named Rock was left for dead, now he's out for revenge. With partners Lex and Bear by his side, our hero will find out who burned down his home and family to the ground. If that means taking on every goon, punk and topless stripper ninja in the city... then so be it.Signed copies of Undying Love Vol.1 and Burn the Orphanage Vol. 1 and Vol. 2 are available as rewards as well as a limited edition postcard set.On top of those, I wanted to offer a special limited edition reward just for thiskickstarterand what better then the actual first five Stimulus short stories in print! I'm doing a limited printing of 100 copies of the book and this kickstarter will be the only place to get it. The book will contain short stories with art fromacclaimedartists: Dan Morison, Henrik Sahlström, Maz, Sina Grace and Tomm Coker.If you're not interested in books, Sina Grace has graciously offered to do 15 original drawings. Sina will draw you an 9x12 image of anything you want. And I mean anything...Lastly, if you'd like a piece of the short film to hang in your own room, we're offering hand made replicas of the Neon Lips sign. These will be hand crafted and very limited. Transparent plastic with back lit light box, encased in neon. (Final art in in development)","There is always a factor of the unknown when anyone sets out to accomplish anything, but, I've done my best to plan and prepare for all possibilities. I've completed a detailed budget with cost estimates for crew, locations, pre and post production, costumes and props. Locations are pending.

The story follows a time traveling scientist back to the dawn of civilization in his 100th attempt to stop human conflict from starting.Maybe this time he'll save the world.Then again. Maybe not.When I read Malachi's short story, I immediately wanted to turn it into a live action short film. The story jumped off the page at me and I couldn't stop thinking about the questions and ideas it raised: the dawn ofcivilization, the role of technology, god, belief, the fallacy of mankind, ego...So I spent the better part of a year saving up to shoot the film.During that time I worked with DP Brent Mata to develop the look of the film. We tested lenses, storyboarded scenes and researched our look (aka watched loads of movies together). I scoured the greater LA area looking for the right talent while costume designer Ashley Heathcock designed and built custom looks to bring the characters of the story to life. Production designer Justin McClain designed and built the sets leading up to the shoot. And production ran smoothly thanks toProducer Gabrielle Roussos...Which brings us to today.The film is shot. Picture is locked.But I now need your help to cover the final costs ofVisual Effects,Sound Design and Original Score Composition in order to complete the film and submit it to the festival circuit.Utu is an exploration of time, space and ego, asking even after we create god-like technology, allowing us to travel back in time, can we ever actually change history and the world for the better? Or are we doomed to live out the same cycles over and over again, never learning from our mistakes.

After that, it'll be SXSW and beyond.Only with your help will I be able to see this through. I can't wait to share the final finished film with you.                          ","Post production is a long winding road full of detours, up hill battles and long stretches where only faith can suffice. But at the end of the road, there is a complete film. I have all the elements I need to craft a polished professional film, I just need help paying for them. I wish I could afford to self finance this whole project but I unfortunately can't. That's where you come in. With your help, I can finish my movie. I can't wait to share it with you."

Each piece eludes to one of the great themes of life … birth, childhood, brotherhood, aging, loss, wonder, and love. The journey that is life begins with the first notes of Kimball’s original Little Eve as the audience is introduced the miracle of birth. From family to childhood to the wonder that awaits us all The Tree Of Life reminds us of the joy, wonder and beauty of our lives. Richard Kimball has structured an evening of music that takes us from solo piano to a full consort of seven musicians. The program includes jazz rhythms, synthesized strings and choral arrangements that will stir the soul. Each section melds together seamlessly as the audience is able to reflect on the nature of life and the relationships that come and go. Listening to Samuel Barber/James Agee’s emotive orchestral song about childhood in Knoxville, the summer of 1915, sung by soprano Jody Weatherstone, reminds us of those times of comfort and ease at home with family. The finalnotes of Kimball’s own Paris 1911 draws us into the excitement and pleasures of being alive.

What began as an effort to eliminate another evening of boring TV eventually became a cult favorite in the Hudson Valley known as the Air Pirates Radio Theater. The Hudson Valley’s finest homegrown ensemble begins with four actors portraying all the characters in original radio scripts and audiences making all the sound effects, crowd noise and any other noise we need.  Prior to the performance the audience is auditioned and given all the necessary props and a review of what they are to do.  The Cue Card Girl lets the audience know when it’s time to slam a door, make the footsteps and even shoot the guns (props, thank you) during the shows. The audience also supplies sound effects for the commercials in the broadcast.A unique mash-up of old-time radio and stoner humor the Air Pirates have been called “A Prairie Home Companion with a bong”. The Air Pirates Radio Theater was voted the Best Theater Troupe in the Hudson Valley by the Times Herald Record Readers’ Poll for an unprecedented six years in a row.  The Air Pirates Radio Theater cast includes MaryLee Shorr, Brian Nieves, Alan Andrews, Kate Brannan,  & Lindsey Graham – and of course the audience.   This season the Air Pirates plan to stream their live performance as a web-series.  Mixing staged productions and using the audience as part of the show; the Air Pirates have developed a high-bred form of theater.   Watching an Air Pirate show the audience is experiencing a complete history of the communications/entertainment industry.  Starting with a live theater experiment which presents itself as radio drama that is now being captured on video and then broadcast over the internet the company has combined all the elements of communication in one evening of hilarious comedy. The plan is to record the shows on video and webcast them live via the Internet.  The funding is for purchasing  equipment, paying the performers and technicians, promotion and web time.  By bringing the shows to the web the Air Pirates can finally achieve the original goal of bringing live theater into peoples living rooms without police interference. Past performances have been broadcast live on local radio stations and now it’s time for the Air Pirates to go global.  The Air Pirates have scheduled eight performances of their popular Herb Marks Freelance comedy/mystery series for 2014 and plan to stream these shows live via U-Stream to Facebook and the Air Pirates own website. Herb Marks (the H is silent) Freelance is the story of a sarcastic and cynical detective, on the short side and his sidekick Smokestack El Ropo, a Jamaican street chemist and all around nice guy.  The irreverent, no holds barred comedy mysteries take on every avenue of High Intrigue from the World of Fine Art to the Adult Film Industry; from China Town to inside Secret Cults. Herb and Smokestack bring their own brand of crime solving skills and insight to the mean streets of the city. http://www.airpirateradio.com/radio-theater/",By taking the Air Pirates to a web series we will have to re-stage the plays for video.  We will also have to add costumes which means finding the right costumer. Some of these challenges require new staff and extra costs.  Time could be an element but we do have the shows already scheduled so the season is going forward.  The biggest obstacle is making sure the changes and additional rehearsals can be scheduled by the time the season opens.

The complete Adi Mantra, Hummee Hum Brahm Hum and Ek Ong Kar Sat Gur Prasaad are just a few mantras included. The name of the album is 'Householder' and is intended to serve as listening music in addition to a meditation tool foryoga teachers and students. I have already produced two songsand have assembled a recording plan for the remaining 6songs. It will be recorded between the last week of April and theend of May.Since it is just me and my guitar, we are hiring musicians to create the unique sounds of the album.

I play folk and r&b inspired arrangements to sanskrit and gurmukhi mantras. I am currently not with a record label, so the cost of recording my next album is up to me! I am inviting you to be part of the process! Here is a sample of music from my first album, ""Blissful Sadhana""(2010). The music playing during the video is also from that album.Sat Siri Siri Akal:A selection from ""Power in Peace"", released in Spring of 2011.Hummee Hum Brahm Hum:It all started with an intention. Wouldn’t it be nice to record an album with a producer, studio musicians and an actual graphic designer? Yes! The last couple projects, I performed all of these roles; and the results were good. But, imagine the possibilities with all of these tasks handled by professionals who devote their lives to awesomeness in their field! I could focus on what I like to do, play music! Y’all feel me?I make music out of love. When I play out and sing, it's an offering of who I am and what I do. The intention for this project is to record the spirit of all my experiences through song and share it! YOU can be a part of this incredible recording through supporting my kickstarter project!Albums cost money to make. Ten-thousand dollars is a large amount of money, yet studio albums cost upward of forty-thousand. Below is a breakdown of how the money will be distributed.

The music is what I am most excited about! These songs have bubbled up to the surface over the past two years. They’ve been played in churches and yoga studios alike. The music is different from anything I’ve done before and inspired by deep meditational experiences. I will be working with producers who have backgrounds in gospel music and you can expect to hear layering of many voices as well as the pure sound of just one voice. Here is some detailed info about a few of the tracks. The rest is a secret! I have to keep some tricks up my sleeve...don’t you guys like surprises?The Elders: An earthy track inspired by old-timey spirituals. It features steel-stringed guitar and the dobro (that guitar that has a big metal circle on it). What’s also cool about it is that it uses the elements of mantra, but in English. There will be a short and long version of this track.Paramaysareh: A track that you want to sip a warm cup of tea and snuggle in bed with. It just makes you feel cozy and supported. It features violin by Michelle Alany.The Long Time Sunshine Song: I sing my version of this folk song at the end of every yoga class. When I told a student about the upcoming album she asked, “Is the long time sunshine song going to be on there?” With a tone that suggested if it wasn’t going to be on the album, she didn’t want to have anything to do with it. “Yes”, I replied, which requited a Yipee!

It also includes anaphora such as binary number by Leibniz, astrological sign, and solar term. Actually I also wanted to describe anaphora with Buddhism, but since the size of the card is too large, I put priority on ease of use this time.なお集めた資金は、印刷所への依頼費と、あなたへの送料と、次の作品の製作費に使用させていただきます。The funds collected will be used for the request fee to the printing office, the shipping fee to you, and the production cost of the next work.次の作品は夜光タロットか、天使のシジルカードにでもしようと試作品を作成中です。I am preparing prototypes considering whether the next work is Luminous Tarot or Angel's Sigil cards.あなたのご協力に感謝します。I appreciate your cooperation.Rewards (English translation)supportNo Rewards Pledge ¥ 1000¥ 1,000 or more pledgeDDDL Plan (Digital data Download Plan)Digital data in AI format created in Illustrator CS2Delivery schedule December 2018¥ 2,000 or more pledgeSigil card planPlaying card separatelyDelivery schedule January 2019Shipping worldwide¥ 2,800 or more pledgeCard & data planSingle playing card and digital dataDelivery schedule January 2019Shipping worldwide¥ 3,800 or more pledgeDouble deck plan2 pairs of cardsDelivery schedule January 2019Shipping worldwide¥ 4,000 or more pledgeEMS plan (Express Mail Service Plan)1 cards setDelivery schedule January 2019Shipping worldwide¥ 5,500 or more pledgeTriple Deck Plan3 cards pairDelivery schedule January 2019Shipping worldwide¥ 10,000 pledge or moreSpecial plan5 cards and digital data※ Digital data can be downloaded during DecemberDelivery schedule January 2019Shipping worldwide※写真は試作品です、実際とは素材等異なります。","印刷所に依頼して完成まで3０日程度かかるので、お手元に届くのはプロジェクトの１ヶ月以上先になりますSince it took about 30 days to finish it by asking the printing laboratory, it will be one month or more ahead of the project to reach you早く欲しい、自身で印刷したい、送料がカードそのものより高くなる、様々な理由でデータのみ欲しいという方もいらっしゃるかと思います、デジタルデータのプランや国際郵便用のプランも用意することで、応援してくださる方が参加しやすくなればと思いますI want it quickly, I want to print with my handwriting, send me higher than the card, I think that I want only data for various reasons, By preparing a digital data plan or a platform for international mail, I think that they will participate具体的なスケジュールは以下の通りです１２月１７日プロジェクトの受付終了、あわせてデジタルデータのダウンロードを開始１２月１８日印刷所へ版下データ提出　１月１８日完成、発送開始The intelligent scheduling is as followsDecember 17 end of project reception, thank you download of digital data startedDecember 18 Submission of copy-down data to the printing officeCompleted January 18, start sending outコメントにて助言をいただき、調べなおした結果、リワードや送料の是正・動画の必要性などを理解できましたので、まず新しいプランを追加してみようと思います。As a result of receiving advice in the comments, as a result of investigating, I understood the correctness of rewards and shipping costs, necessity of animation, etc. I think that I will add a new plan first.",https://www.kickstarter.com/projects/1666141468/sigils-cards-type-qabbalah?ref=discovery_category_newest,1666141468/sigils-cards-type-qabbalah,"I want funds for the production of the work.And I want to further disseminate wisdom and love that continues from ancient times.Egypt, Babylonia, China, all civilizations, all wisdom comes to magic.Magic is not originally intended to call demons or to transfer.Wisdom of disaster relief born as a result of observing nature, the calendar.Love of anxiety relief born by mutual help, amulet.First of all, I have created a wonderful thing to use as a mobile wisdom book like ""amulet"" or ""fortune telling card"", as it is the most efficient way to get to know by many people.Also, even if you have it, it is also an effective amulet, but this tag contains various wisdom, history and secrets, I think that it is good to read it and leave it in future generations I will.I planned to put it out to the printing office last time, but this time I plan to make an upfront investment such as purchasing a printer, and I am going to try my best to reduce the cost.I want to solve misunderstandings about magic and deliver love to the people of the world.Therefore, I want you to separate your power.","Regarding budget, we have already purchased equipment and materials, so there is no riskBecause it takes time to create and mail, shipping may be delayed by one week depending on the number of supportersIn order not to do so, we plan to respond by starting printing in advance."

This is an all-or-nothing Kickstarter project –if we don't reach our goal within the 30 days, we don't receive any of your pledged funds! Please read on…While we in the Rae Gordon Band still love our award-winning CD Better Than I Was, it's been two years since it came out…and our fans say it's high time we unleashed some new music on the world! So that's exactly what we're going to do, with your help.We have a great collection of songs all written and ready to go – this CD will actually be the first Rae Gordon Band release to feature all original tunes and no covers. The songs range from lowdown blues to danceworthy soul to heart-wrenching ballad to horn-drenched funk and always, always back to the blues. We're having huge fun playing them and we are so excited to bring them to you.We'll be recording the CD at Jimi Bott's Roseleaf Recording, with our guitarist/vocalist Kivett Bednar producing. Besides being an award-winning drummer with a jaw-dropping list of credits (The Fabulous Thunderbirds, Rod Piazza & The Mighty Flyers, and most recently the blues supergroup The Proven Ones), Jimi Bott is also an accomplished engineer and producer, with names like Ben Rice, the Mannish Boys All-Stars, Kevin Selfe And The Tornadoes, Mark Hummel and Paul deLay having recorded at his facility. Projects recorded at Roseleaf have received Blues Music Award nominations from the Blues Foundation and Best Recording awards from the Cascade Blues Association. So we're confident our CD is in good hands!But of course, nothing of quality comes for free. Studio time, mixing, mastering, production, package design, photography, duplication, promotion, marketing – all of these are essential to the project's success, and they all come with a cost. Which is why we're coming to you and offering you a chance to participate in this process and help us get the job done.

Our coffee and beer programs will be designed to do just that. By providing Kansas City-made coffee and beer, we are showcasing the craftwork of our local community and supporting their contribution to our city. By also offering carefully selected beverages from roasters and brewers all over the world we can expand our understanding of the global community we live in. As the Heart of America, Kansas City has the opportunity to be a cultural crossroads and an example of what is means to live with a local and global perspective.The PlanYour contribution will go towards generating and maintaining our coffee and beer programs. Our hope is to curate a beverage menu that is simultaneously comfortable and challenging, providing you with flavors you know and love, while introducing you to the unique and creative approaches of premier roasters and brewers.","Our biggest challenge will be creating our beer program just the way we'd like.  To encourage fair opportunities for all bars, distributors have established systems for allocating seasonal and limited release beers based on a number of factors.  This means that it will be difficult at times, and especially at the beginning of our journey, to get our hands on many of the beers we would love to bring to you.  Because these beers are our passion, however, we will constantly be working on ways to receive those allocations.The challenge with our coffee program will be shipping costs.  We hope to tap into local markets from all over the world.  Many of these small roasting companies do not currently have distribution processes in place to deliver their products to Kansas City, meaning more traditional freight options will need to be employed.  These costs, at times, could limit our ability to provide you our desired global coffee selections, especially as market prices continue to increase.  When this challenge arises, we will put even more effort into selecting the best coffee we can find in our local and regional markets.",https://www.kickstarter.com/projects/colonykc/colony-handcrafted-ales?ref=discovery_category_newest,colonykc/colony-handcrafted-ales,"Colony Handcrafted Ales will be a unique brewery, creating local ales with a friendly taproom. Since the day Colony opened, it has made a name for itself throughout the city with a unique atmosphere, quality commercial beers, well-crafted cocktails and an excellent espresso bar. Once we opened, we knew it was only a matter of time before we wanted to join the other fantastic breweries in North Kansas City with our own beers. For the past 4 months, we've been able to serve our handcrafted ales at countless beer fests around the city with great reception.  We're excited to serve you by bringing great brews and a community-minded business to North Kansas City.Master Brewer: Rodney Beagle is our guy. We've never met someone so passionate about their craft. He's an award winning brewer with many accolades under his belt between multiple brewing events. Here's just a few of them.Best in Show (1st place out of 67 beers) - Peppercorn Whiskey SaisonGold Medal - Peppercorn Whiskey Saison in Belgian specialty ale category. Silver Medal - Royal Gose in the Belgian specialty ale category.  Bronze Medal - Cream Ale        Iron Brewer - 2015, 2016Our hope is to begin serving our own beer at Colony as early as Spring 2017. Once we meet our Kickstarter goal, we can purchase the rest of the brewing equipment and finish renovating our brewery space. Our brewery will be a 3 barrel brew system, capable of brewing 90 gallons of fresh, delicious beer at a time. This system will supply us with brewing kettles, fermentation vessels and kegging equipment to supply local bars and restaurants, as well as our loyal, thirsty, beer-loving customers. We're excited to share our dedication and passion for local beer, made right here in the Kansas City metro! Our facility is already an inviting, comfortable, friendly taproom with a full espresso bar featuring our North Summit Slow Brew and Kombucha on tap.With your help, we will be able to complete construction, order our brewing equipment, stock supplies, etc. Our community support has already been amazing since we opened and we hope to continue that even more once our beers are brewing.We've already been able to take our beers to many festivals in the Midwest with great reception. We hope to feature some of these ales when we start brewing in house.

Hablando de los temas que a nosotros nos interesan y creando obras que a nosotros nos gustan.Así surge nuestro proyecto para el 2017 que consiste en 3 obras: ""INEVITABLE"", ""¿POR QUÉ NO HABLAMOS DEL SOL?"" y ""PERFILES"".INEVITABLEEsta obra habla sobre esos pequeños momentos que desaprovechamos con las personas que más queremos. Fátima (Epy Vélez) y Rodrigo (Octavio Vega) ponen en tela de juicio el concepto moderno de que todo es ocasionado por una decisión para recordarnos que no, que hay cosas que simplemente suceden porque tienen que suceder. Este reencuentro los llevará una vez más al mismo lugar donde se amaron, donde fueron felices para después ser muy infelices.¿POR QUÉ NO HABLAMOS DEL SOL?¿Quien no tiene una historia de un amor no correspondido? Daniel (Ramiro Piñón Manini) y Gaby (Tamara Niño de Rivera)se conocen dentro de un nuevo proyecto y rápidamente surge entre ellos una relación laboral que juguetea entre la amistad y un algo más. Pronto una confesión amorosa amenazará el frágil equilibrio de esta relación. En el arduo proceso de balancear la amistad y el trabajo ambos aprenderán del otro, algo que, si bien no era lo que esperaban, atesorarán de por vida.PERFILESEstefania Cortina y Lucia Carrillo interpretan a mas de nueve personajes en esta comedia sobre apariencias. Dos directoras de casting inician una guerra para lograr que su actor predilecto obtenga el papel, y en su intento por lograrlo usarán toda su creatividad por lograr que su contrincante se vea mal.""¿Por qué no hablamos del sol?"" ya tuvo una primer temporada en el Teatro La Capilla en diciembre del 2016, e ""Inevitable"" ya tiene temporada confirmada para el 2017, del 18 de enero al 15 de marzo, también en el Teatro La Capilla.Actualmente estamos buscando fechas para volver a presentar ""¿Por qué no hablamos del sol?"" y para la temporada de estreno de ""Perfiles"". Lo que esto significa es que la producción de las 3 obras está cubierta casi en su totalidad. Ya tenemos escenografía, vestuario y todo lo necesario para dar funciones. ¿Entonces para qué vamos a utilizar sus donaciones?Sus donaciones se utilizarán para dos fines principales:1. La renta de los teatros. Lo más costoso de toda la producción es la renta de los teatros, que tienen un costo por día de función, y si consideramos que en suma las tres obras tendrán 25 funciones, entenderán porque necesitamos de su ayuda para lograr dar estas tres temporadas.2. Gastos de producción. Parte de sus donativos se irán a gastos de producción, tales como programas de mano, carteles de la obra, separadores y todos esos detalles que son necesarios para difundir nuestro trabajo y lograr que la gente se acerque a él.Por eso te invitamos a formar parte de este proyecto, para que nos ayudes a hacer realidad estas 3 obras que nacen del corazón.","El proyecto de Los Tradicionales para el 2017 enfrenta varios riesgos.El primero es encontrar los espacios que cubran nuestras necesidades, desde el precio de la renta, hasta las fechas en que estén disponibles los mismos. Por ello estamos procurando confirmar las tres temporadas antes de que finalice el 2017.Una vez confirmados los espacios para las tres temporadas podemos decir que el proyecto es seguro, daremos todas y cada una de las funciones. Pero sus donaciones siguen siendo cruciales para nosotros por que de ello dependerá la subsistencia de la compañía.La renta de los teatros por lo general se paga al finalizar la temporada, y es ahí donde sus donaciones entran en acción cubriendo las rentas de los teatros, y permitiéndonos re-invertir lo obtenido en taquilla en futuras puestas. De otra forma la taquilla tendría que cubrir los gastos del teatro y la compañía quedaría sin fondos para proyectos futuros.Por eso podemos decir que su contribución no es para 1 obra, sino para una compañía que hará muchas obras.",https://www.kickstarter.com/projects/538338292/perfiles?ref=discovery_category_newest,538338292/perfiles,"Una historia de apariencias.Lucrecia y Catalina, dos directoras de casting, inician una guerra para lograr darle un lugar en la telenovela a su actor predilecto. Esta pelea entre ambas expondrá todos los trapos sucios de un medio en el cual, en ocasiones, el talento y la preparación pueden jugar un papel insignificante al lado del perfil físico.Sí, el mundo del espectáculo puede parecer superficial y frívolo, pero “Perfiles” nos recuerda una cosa muy importante. Dicha frialdad es resultado de lo que la gente quiere ver.PERFILES El nuevo proyecto de la compañía teatral ""Los Tradicionales"".Estreno 5 de abril del 2017.Funciones: Miercoles del 5 de abril al 10 de mayo a las 08:30PM.Foro 37. Londres #37, Colonia Juarez.","El teatro en México siempre es un riesgo, y la producción de este proyecto no es la excepción. Una parte del costo de producción salio de las bolsas del mismo equipo.

But his dreams are put on hold when he resorts to dealing drugs in Hollywood to not only make ends meet, but also to seek that vital spark of inspiration. His clientele are none other than celebrities and movie stars who are not always the most trustworthy or benign customers. When his cartel boss decides to move him up the ranks, the proposition poses a whole new set of problems for him, his artist girlfriend and muse and all those he cares about. Finally, the hard truth comes crashing down on our hero and not everyone survives the fall.The hardest part of filmmaking is not simply whether a story has to be told. But if it really wants to be heard. Is there an audience eager and ready to listen? Peddler speaks to the times, of our media-driven culture and pill-popping society. This story pulses in the vein of such popular shows as Breaking Bad, Weeds and Entourage. Our endless fascination with the world of high-stakes crime, violence and drugs alongside the lure and glamor of Hollywood.A touching and exciting experience is in store, shedding light on the sparkle of tinsel town woven with the stark cruelty of the drug world as told through the eyes of a young man who loses his innocence along the way. Hopefully, we'll get the funding that we need to bring this comical and touching story to the small screen.Please contact me if you would like to read the script!","Having been raised around the industry & a working filmmaker for the last two decades on award-winning hit TV shows & feature films, I am fortunate enough to have the experience, skills and vital access to resources unavailable to most novice filmmakers. And I've had a passion for story-telling that spans back to the dinner table growing up! At it's heart, cinematic story-telling is a collaborative effort. The different and unique voices of many savvy and talented artists brought together are what make a project rich, memorable and successful. I will put together a talented, ensemble cast, seasoned crew and amazing artists and musicians whose work will be featured in the piece. The  popular New Orleans impressionist painter Megan Galiber & classical pianist Melany Bennett will lend their immense talents & work to this special project!The magical and simple tenet “write what you know” has never been truer than with this project. Having thrived in the entertainment industry and dealt firsthand with its darker fringe elements, I can gladly and sometimes sadly confess to being intimate with those kindred souls who call both these sordid worlds home.With the unprecedented growth of so many new and exciting media outlets, we plan on capitalizing on this unique opportunity to get our show into the hands of the many networks and providers in the market for quality original content.",https://www.kickstarter.com/projects/433679356/time2dance?ref=discovery_category_newest,433679356/time2dance,"Time-2-Dance is a half-hour single camera family show that teaches kids to love and learn dance. Our show features many fun and exciting things both parents and children will enjoy.Our program is hosted by LA dance instructor Keith Alan. We select children from the studio audience and teach them simple yet fun dance moves onstage. Then, celebrity judges each pick a partner and take them backstage to put together their very own dance number which they will perform onstage for the finale. Much like hit shows American Idol and Dancing With The Stars, we show their progress working with the dance expert judges backstage from time to time throughout the show.The show goes on to feature a special guest performance each episode. We invite dance groups from all over the world to share a dance from their country or culture.Then, the show plays home videos sent in by fans of children doing their own moves. It's a fun and sweet portion of the program that's sure to have everyone feeling good and laughing together.For the finale, the contestants return onstage to perform their dance before the audience. The winner is voted via social media like Twitter and Snapchat to name a few.Time-2-Dance is a project whose time has come in so many ways. There's simply nothing like this on TV or online today. Our host has been teaching children of all ages at his studio, schools across Los Angeles and at special events for nearly a decade. His electric talent and positive, nurturing charisma make for an ideal show host, and he works amazingly well with children.With the global reach of media, Time-2-Dance showcases the worldly nature and influence of entertainment today, allowing children to bring their culture and traditions to the screen for everyone to enjoy. By allowing our viewers to send in funny home videos, we provide a segment for cute comic relief, too.Dance is a fantastic way for kids to express themselves, be active and free.

The type of vibration and where it happens on the belt tells the user where to go without distracting visual  or audio cues. It all goes to make for a more pleasurable travel experience.Ubivade is a wearable device that can be used on any known means of transport.Its app lets you choose between on foot, by bus, bicycle, motorcycle and car setting. The guide signals are automatically adjusted changing the vibration intensity and the indication distance before turns.Ubivade finds the quickest and safest route to make your trip a stress-free experience. Enter your destination and means of transport on our app, tuck it safely into your pocket and just let Ubivade do the rest. Thanks to turn-by-turn navigation signals, Ubivade takes you to your destination by means of vibro-tactile signals.  Ubivade connects with our app on your smartphone via Bluetooth. Set up your destination and the mean of transport and Ubivade will take care of the rest.Ubivade lets you save battery life, keep your smartphone safe in your pocket and avoid distracting audiovisual cues.This project was inspired by a very important scientific concept called Umwelt and veered into its final goal; the expansion of reality perceived by humans.The term Umwelt is usually translated as ""self-centered world"" .Imagine Umwelt as an enormous sphere that surrounds our body, as large as our five senses will allow to be and capable of filtering and distorting our vision of the world, its result is different for every individual.The bigger the sphere, the bigger the dimensions of our world and our ability to interact with it.Our goal is to expand human sensorial perception using modern technology to enlarge the dimensions of our perceived world.We use GPS technology to calculate your route and the belt starts sending information straight to your brain.The direction signals are sent to the body through a structure composed of sixteen vibration motors, that give vibro-tactile feedback which is easily understood by the brain.In the beginning, this exchange of data is interpreted by our rational brain, which will associate a specific answer to each urge. After a short training period, this mechanism becomes internalized and automated, and is moved to our unconscious mind so we never have to think about it. Our bodies react automatically.With Ubivade you just have to enter your destination and let your body follow the route, while you can relax and even hold a conversation.Ubivade sends navigation information through its sixteen vibration motors located on the belt: depending on the upcoming turn, the four groups of motors, divided into right, left, straight and wrong-way, vibrate to guide you to your destination.  Ubivade vibrates into different frequencies to show what type of turn is coming up. Continuous vibration means a hard right, while an intermittent one stands for a slight turn.An upcoming roundabout is indicated by all the vibration motors vibrating for a number of times corresponding to the exit number. To recharge the battery, you just have to connect Ubivade to an USB socket and a green led will tell you when it's fully charged. The system is compatible both with iOS and with Android.Ubivade is the ideal partner for those who love travelling, offering a stressless experience and free hands. By choosing the walking mode, it automatically reduces the vibration power and tells you to turn fifty metres ahead of time.If the trip is too far to walk there are also bus maps incuded in our app. Ubivade tells you which stop to get off at by vibrating before. Keep your hands on the handlebars and your smartphone in your pocket, Ubivade will guide you to your destination. Poor screen visibility in bright light conditions will no longer be a problem, keeping the smartphone in your pocket and receiving tactile-feedback, distractions will be reduced to a minimum, and power consumption too.  The unexpected is just around the corner! Stay focused on the street to prevent car accidents.Ubivade is made by top Italian craftsmen, where innovation merges with tradition. You can combine your chosen colour, blue, brown or black, with your desired clasp, available in two models, Classic and Sport, available in two colours: metallized and matte black.The key-word that inspired our design process is simplicity. Ubivade is unisex and will be offered in a variety of styles to match both casual and formal outfits. Each belt is made individually and you can chose both colour and size.In the design process, the very first step was the choice of a shape which we chose from our many sketches. That way, the best model, in terms of aesthetical attractiveness and functionality, was conceived. Then the prototyping phase starts, first of all  a 3D model that goes beyond existing standards is finished and then created with the help of a 3D printer to obtain a model which is then ready for the testing phase.We designed Ubivade to be beautiful both inside and out and, thanks to the latest generation of Bluetooth technology, the system is compatible both with iOS and Android.Ubivade is made merging the work of the best italian craftsmen with the latest technologies in terms of production. Our goal is to merge tradition and innovation. We're planning the development of a navigation system for blind people, integrating an ""assistant"" mode into our app that gives more frequent tactile-feedback and a voice-activated configuration.

","After two years of hard work Ubivade is ready for a global market. We have made several prototypes to optimize the various functions of the product and to solve all the issues, finally obtaining a fully functioning concept. We created a strong network of suppliers to ensure the highest quality and production speed. You will be updated on the developments of Ubivade step by step; we want to create a perfect product from all points of view. Thanks to this campaign on kickstarter we hope to develop Ubivade for blind and deaf people too in order to improve their living conditions. We are confident that together we can do so much.Marco Zagaria",https://www.kickstarter.com/projects/1018374213/teti-architecture-city-ring?ref=discovery_category_newest,1018374213/teti-architecture-city-ring,"How many times have you wanted to enclose your favorite city and everything it represents within the space of a finger and always carry it with you? Teti makes all this possible… it’s a wearable sculpture that arises emotions, aspirations, and memories.Teti is a super detailed micro city-sculpture, modeled in the form of a wearable high jewelry ring, plated with precious materials and encased in lustrous and indestructible resin. The rings featuring significant geographic Icons from cities all over the world and give you the possibility to celebrate your favorite city by keeping it wrapped around your finger.Whether you “heart” New York City, love London, or firmly believe that all roads lead to Rome, you’ll never tire of gazing at your favorite city—especially when it can fit in the palm of your hand or the hand of someone you love...The idea came from our passion for art, design and above all travel. We all have memories related to particular places. We all were born somewhere, left home for studying or working, felt in love somewhere, got new friends, traveled with beloved, had remarkable events in beautiful places which became our favorites. And, with a Teti ring, you won’t stray far from these memories, no matter where your travels take you.We started from the certainty that anyone who has spent some time traveling knows the feeling of wanting to physically hold on to a favorite place. That's why we translated this feeling into beautiful jewelry in the image of some of the world’s most beloved cities: New York, Rome, and London. Teti shows a city in motion, a place where life is always active and the world is always on the go.The ring isn’t the only thing that is alluring but the packaging is also as charming as the ring. When you open the tiny box, you’ll find the elegant ring standing amidst the miniature figures of the city’s famous landmarks. No matter how much jewelry you own, chances are that you don't own anything quite like this.I greatly appreciate your support and I’m excited to get TETI to you! You will be able to make your size and city selections after the campaign ends, for now, you are welcome to choose your reward:We will charge shipping once the Kickstarter is over, based on the actual cost from our partners. We will collect the information via our Pledge Manager once the campaign ends. We assure you the lowest shipping rate possible and a price not exceeding € 10 per single shipment in the USA and € 15 International.Keep in mind that while we did our best to be as close to reality as possible, these are just estimates, and costs provided below may change based on the number of products you buy, or if we manage to secure better deals with our partners. We are super excited to get Teti into your hands. So you can be sure that we're going to continue to work day and night until the very last Teti has shipped.If you're unsure of your ring size, the best way to check it is going to local jewelry and get it checked. There are also many ways to check your ring size online. Many sites provide the knowledge of how to do it at home ( i recommend this website ).Once the project is funded, we’ll send out a survey to get your size.Dismayed with the lack of uniqueness in the ring market, we decided to create something different. We worked hard to create a ring more unique and of better quality than anything else on the market. Over the following three years, we spent time, effort and expense researching and then creating several prototypes, until we produced a ring we wanted ourselves. And not only that, friends of ours wanted it! We were on to something.The biggest challenge we faced was that there was nothing even remotely similar to the ring we wanted to make on the market. Soon we discovered that no one had yet invented the method to produce them, so we had to invent it ourselves !! Yes, you got it right, before us no one was able to make an ultra-detailed ring like Teti :)Furthermore, by following the production processes ourselves and eliminating waste, we can produce rings matching the premium brands in quality and craftsmanship, and yet offer them to customers at a fraction of the price.The ring was created by Art is Therapy / 3D Box, and more specifically Marco, Nicola, and Matteo - a small team of hungry designers and industrial & graphics creatives who like to challenge everything. Especially the basics. Especially the stuff that people don’t think is worth changing. Yep, that’s the stuff we like changing!We think this ring combines all the things we're best at creating, and we put together this Kickstarter campaign because we can't build this without you. So if you're into art or travel or design, please help us make this ring a reality. We think you'll love it as much as we do, thank you for your support,Marco, Nicola, and Matteo.Ask away! Shoot us a message or post a comment and we'll do our best to get back to you with an answer. For General Inquiry & Support you can also email us directly at teti@artistherapy.storeInterested in writing about us? Please feel free to download our press kit or reach us at art@artistherapy.storeTeti needs your help to fully come to life. Prototypes and pre-production units were financed by ourselves. But the time has come, now we have to face high upfront expenses regarding tooling, certification, machinery and minimum quantity purchases as well as labor help to bring our creations to more of you! That's why we're offering Teti to this awesome community before anyone else.Please back this project and help us build this amazing Ring.Know someone who would be just as stoked as you are about Teti? Share our campaign with them through the ""Share"" button. 30 seconds of your time could make the difference and Sharing is caring!","As with most projects like this, the main challenge is managing fulfillment. Because each ring is forged and finished by hand, a significant amount of time and care is put into everyone, which could take longer than our estimated timeframe for a large number of rings. However, our dedicated team has been perfecting this process for several months and we feel confident about our ability to deliver everything on time. If things don't go as planned, whether it's a delay in the manufacturing timeline, shipping date, or something else, we promise to communicate honestly with you and work around the clock until we correct the issue."

He began cooking at his great aunt's restaurant when he was only eight years old andspent time honing his craft at several other European restaurants. During World War II, Chef Edmond had to be resourceful by picking mushrooms, hunting game, and turning these into wonderful fresh food. Chef Edmond gained an intimate knowledge of seasonings, sauces, and culinary improvisation before coming to America at age 24. After arriving in California, Chef Edmond managed and cooked for several restaurants including Dean Martin's restaurant, the Beverly Hills Hilton, the Hyatt Newporter Inn, and the Windsor Hotel. While gaining prominence in the restaurant business, he also began working to open his own restaurant. After meeting his lovely wife, Joyce, and getting married in 1967, he realized his dream with Lafayette Café. After Lafayette Cafe opened in 1972, Chef Edmond began refining his recipes into an art form, while Joyce became head of customer relations. His dishes were beautiful and satisfied the rumbling bellies of many lovers of fine cuisine. He won restaurant of the year in 1985, and he won a Southern California Restaurant Writer's Gold Award every year that the award was given. Unfortunately, due to health concerns, Chef Edmond retired in 2002, forever shutting the doors of one of California's favorite restaurants.Since then, he has cooked recreationally at restaurants such as The White House in Anaheim and La Vie En Rose, which also had Joyce as an occasional Hostess. He has been unable to put the pans down, and he remains cooking for his friends and family while living out his retirement in Reno, Nevada. He was acknowledged as one of the top 20 chefs from around the world at a charity banquet in 2012, and lives up to his reputation every day. His grandson recently approached him with the 'Secret Recipes of Lafayette' Kickstarter project and he readily offered to hold onefinal public dinner party for the major sponsors.Remy VelardezRemy is an aspiring engineering student at Santa Ana Community College. Remy grew up very close to Chef Edmond and learned to appreciate the wonderful meals he prepared. After a decade of cooking and living without Chef Edmond nearby, he understood that not even the most expensive restaurants or well-conceived recipes match the 75 years of passion that Edmond's recipes hold. Remy graduated high school at 16 years old through an early exit exam and threw himself into the job market. After several years of rising through the ranks of a few companies, he returned to school to get his degree in mechanical engineering. Remy is the head designer of this project.

https://www.kickstarter.com/projects/michael-weiss/michael-weiss-soul-journey-analog-vinyl?ref=discovery_category_newest,michael-weiss/michael-weiss-soul-journey-analog-vinyl,"Soul Journey, my fourth album as a leader, is a collection of nine original compositions arranged for sextet, including the BMI/Monk Institute award-winning El Camino. After refining the arrangements over several years, I decided to go into the studio. I spared no expense, recording and mixing to analog tape. The CD was released in 2003 and received terrific reviews. With today's resurgent interest in analog sound, now is the time to reissue Soul Journey on vinyl as a double LP set and present the music sonically as it was originally conceived and recorded.Here are links to stream three songs transferred from the original analog tape:OptimismEl CaminoSoul JourneyYou can also stream and download them at 96/24 by clicking here. Look for the Download button on the upper right corner of the page.To bring this project to life I'm happy to bring on my good friend Jerome Sabbagh as vinyl project manager. With his own vinyl projects, Jerome has developed real expertise in every aspect of the mastering and pressing process, paying meticulous attention to every detail.BudgetFor the original CD release, the studio, engineer, tape and musician fees alone surpassed $22,000. Fortunately that's already paid for. Now we need to raise $12,000 to produce 500 limited edition double LPs (250 numbered). This will cover the cost of tape transfer, editing, assembly, mastering, pressing, sleeves, graphic design, photography, shipping, and the rigorous process of quality control of the master and test pressings.Your support will help us reach our goal. I hope you will enjoy listening to the music as much as I did composing and performing it. Michael WeissCreditsAll compositions and arrangements by Michael Weiss and published by Nepenthean Music Co. (BMI)Produced by Michael WeissRecorded to 2 inch 30 ips analog tape at Avatar Studios, NYC by Joe Ferla, mixed by Joe Ferla to 1/2 inch 30 ips analog tape.Press“Soul Journey is about as close to perfection as a recording can get. The production is superb. The recording and mixing are as good as you might hear from any major label and recording studio. This should be in everyone’s collection of good contemporary jazz, and if there is truly justice in our world, a Grammy nominee.” - Jazz Improv“This kind of balance between innovation and accessibility is unusual in jazz, and it makes for an extremely interesting and enjoyable listening experience. It is hard to imagine any serious jazz lover not being captivated by this album. Highly recommended.” – All Music Guide“It’s not often that you find jazz compositions of the caliber that Michael Weiss offers up on Soul Journey. This very special recording goes far beyond your typical mainstream fare. Weiss is a vital talent with something important to say...and you’d do well to listen.” – All About Jazz“Weiss’ Soul Journey reinforces why he is heralded as a front burner musician –a NYC elite pianist who exemplifies the union of style and substance, foraging and dissolving boundaries with missionary zeal and leadership.” –Herb Wong, Jazz Education Journal“Perfectly constructed music, well thought out from beginning to end. The nine originals show a maturity of writing, superbly executed by the musicians, as well as a perfect osmosis between the different styles that coexist in jazz, especially in New York.” – Jazz Hot“This music lives and breathes freshness and exhilarating originality” – Jazz JournalA word from Vinyl Project Manager Jerome SabbaghOver the last few years, as a musician and an audiophile, I’ve become more involved in the production of vinyl. I put out two albums of mine, The Turn and No Filter, on vinyl, both receiving positive reviews from audiophile publications and regular music lovers alike.All along, I’ve been thinking that I would like to use the expertise I’ve acquired to help someone else put their music on vinyl. Michael Weiss is a friend and a great pianist. When I realized that Soul Journey was tracked and mixed all analog by one of the great jazz engineers of all time, Joe Ferla, in New York’s legendary Avatar studio (formerly Power Station), I suspected that – as good as the record sounds on CD – the tape would likely sound a lot better cut to vinyl, staying analog all the way. Michael and I proceeded to listen to the original tape and were blown away by the sound quality. We transferred it without any processing to 96/24.Once mastered and cut by mastering legend Bernie Grundman, the record will sound incredible on double vinyl.It’s quite rare these days to have a jazz album – let alone one as good as this – recorded and mixed to analog tape. It would be unaffordable for most jazz artists or record companies. Between paying the musicians, engineer, studio, buying tape etc, Michael spent about $22,000 on the album. At the time he recorded, before streaming and downloads made it much harder for artists to recoup their costs, it made sense. Today, it would be unrealistic for most jazz artists. All that makes this recording all the more precious in my opinion. There won't be many more like it – if any – at this point!I am excited to be involved in bringing this fantastic analog recording, from the heyday of the medium, to AAA vinyl for the first time. I hope you will consider backing this endeavor.The Fine PrintWe plan to spread the music onto four sides, which will allow for the finest sound quality. We will press the LP at QRP, one of the best pressing plants in the world. My role as vinyl project manager will be to work with Bernie Grundman to oversee the mastering choices, to quality control test pressings, and to make sure the final product is as good as possible.

After refining the arrangements over several years, I decided to go into the studio. I spared no expense, recording and mixing to analog tape. The CD was released in 2003 and received terrific reviews. With today's resurgent interest in analog sound, now is the time to reissue Soul Journey on vinyl as a double LP set and present the music sonically as it was originally conceived and recorded.Here are links to stream three songs transferred from the original analog tape:OptimismEl CaminoSoul JourneyYou can also stream and download them at 96/24 by clicking here. Look for the Download button on the upper right corner of the page.To bring this project to life I'm happy to bring on my good friend Jerome Sabbagh as vinyl project manager. With his own vinyl projects, Jerome has developed real expertise in every aspect of the mastering and pressing process, paying meticulous attention to every detail.BudgetFor the original CD release, the studio, engineer, tape and musician fees alone surpassed $22,000. Fortunately that's already paid for. At this point, the cost to produce 500 limited edition double LPs (250numbered) is $12,000. This will cover the cost oftape transfer, editing, assembly, mastering, pressing, sleeves, graphic design, photography, shipping, and the rigorous process of quality control of the master and test pressings. To give us a greater chance of success on Kickstarter, I am setting our funding goal at $10,000 and will pay for the difference myself if need be.Your support will help us reach our goal. I hope you will enjoy listening to the music as much as I did composing and performing it.Michael WeissCreditsAll compositions and arrangements by Michael Weiss and published by Nepenthean Music Co. (BMI)Produced by Michael WeissRecorded to 2 inch 30 ips analog tape at Avatar Studios, NYC by Joe Ferla, mixed by Joe Ferla to 1/2 inch 30 ips analog tape.Press“Soul Journey is about as close to perfection as a recording can get. The production is superb. The recording and mixing are as good as you might hear from any major label and recording studio. This should be in everyone’s collection of good contemporary jazz, and if there is truly justice in our world, a Grammy nominee.” - Jazz Improv“This kind of balance between innovation and accessibility is unusual in jazz, and it makes for an extremely interesting and enjoyable listening experience. It is hard to imagine any serious jazz lover not being captivated by this album. Highly recommended.” – All Music Guide“It’s not often that you find jazz compositions of the caliber that Michael Weiss offers up on Soul Journey. This very special recording goes far beyond your typical mainstream fare. Weiss is a vital talent with something important to say...and you’d do well to listen.” – All About Jazz“Weiss’ Soul Journey reinforces why he is heralded as a front burner musician –a NYC elite pianist who exemplifies the union of style and substance, foraging and dissolving boundaries with missionary zeal and leadership.” –Herb Wong, Jazz Education Journal“Perfectly constructed music, well thought out from beginning to end. The nine originals show a maturity of writing, superbly executed by the musicians, as well as a perfect osmosis between the different styles that coexist in jazz, especially in New York.” – Jazz Hot“This music lives and breathes freshness and exhilarating originality” – Jazz JournalA word from Vinyl Project Manager Jerome SabbaghOver the last few years, as a musician and an audiophile, I’ve become more involved in the production of vinyl. I put out two albums of mine, The Turn and No Filter, on vinyl, both receiving positive reviews from audiophile publications and regular music lovers alike.All along, I’ve been thinking that I would like to use the expertise I’ve acquired to help someone else put their music on vinyl. Michael Weiss is a friend and a great pianist. When I realized that Soul Journey was tracked and mixed all analog by one of the great jazz engineers of all time, Joe Ferla,in New York’s legendary Avatar studio (formerly Power Station), I suspected that – as good as the record sounds on CD – the tape would likely sound a lot better cut to vinyl, staying analog all the way. Michael and I proceeded to listen to the original tape and were blown away by the sound quality. We transferred it without any processing to 96/24.Once mastered and cut by mastering legend Bernie Grundman, the record will sound incredible on double vinyl.It’s quite rare these days to have a jazz album – let alone one as good as this – recorded and mixed to analog tape. It would be unaffordable for most jazz artists or record companies. Between paying the musicians, engineer, studio, buying tape etc, Michael spent about $22,000 on the album. At the time he recorded, before streaming and downloads made it much harder for artists to recoup their costs, it made sense. Today, it would be unrealistic for most jazz artists. All that makes this recording all the more precious in my opinion. There won't be many more like it – if any – at this point!I am excited to be involved in bringing this fantastic analog recording, from the heyday of the medium, to AAA vinyl for the first time. I hope you will consider backing this endeavor.The Fine PrintWe plan to spread the music onto four sides, which will allow for the finest sound quality. We will press the LP at QRP, one of the best pressing plants in the world. My role as vinyl project manager will be to work with Bernie Grundman to oversee the mastering choices, to quality control test pressings, and to make sure the final product is as good as possible. The records will be pressed onto two 150g LPs, tucked into nice rice paper inner sleeves that won’t scuff them. The cardboard color jacket will be printed at Stoughton Printing. It should sound and look awesome.For those of you into reel-to-reel tapes and reference lacquers, we offer those as rewards. Please have a look!We hope to assemble the tape early in January 2020 and have the mastering and cutting done by the end of February. We will also deal with artworkthen.

We are a team of artists and writers Tengri Comics who create comics! We have been doing it for several years and many cool ideas have appeared in our minds about fantastic comics, based on the ancient legends and mythology of nomads. We are glad to present our first project called Ermek the Batyr.It is a dark fantasy with some elements of Kazakhstan`s history.  What is it about? The story tells about Ermek Batyr, a young hero, who lives in the 15th century in Central Asia. After 10 years of wandering around the world, he returns to his homeland. On his way, he has to find himself, accept his fate and remove the ancient curse from his family as he also finds his love and fights with different mythical monsters.  We are trying to make a high-quality product but, unfortunately, it takes a lot of effort and time. We cannot continue working relying on enthusiasm alone. So we applied to Kickstarter to raise money so that it would allow us to continue and pursue our favorite business. In our turn, we offer you the first volume of the comics for a symbolic sum.  We hope you will enjoy what we are doing. Ermek the Batyr is just the first comic book of many others we are going to do.

We used a leopard seal as the base and just added some extreme features, and it stuck.Plus it has arms!With YOUR generous donations, the effects for the film will have the financial backing to look the best they possibly can. We are opting for ALL practical effects and the cost for this type of artistry is high. We already have our camera equipment, and everything else we need (Actors,Locations,ETC.) Kickstarter will not only help us make this dream a reality BUT it can give us the chance to show the world that practical effects can NEVER be replaced...LETS MAKE THIS HAPPEN!","There's always the possibility that there could be some setbacks on any project. However, as stated above, most of the key ingredients to the production are already set in place.Setbacks during production can and will happen, but we will iron them out. That's the background we come from. We are all very driven and dedicated to seeing this project through regardless if this fundraiser is successful, we will be completing the film. If a major issue arises, our donors will be informed on our page and we will work tirelessly to correct it and get everything back on track because after all, if this is fully funded, you are all just as invested in seeing this become a reality as we are. Any pledge is a great generosity on your part and we certainly do not want to disappoint our supporters."

As soon as we get inventory we sell out within a month or two..(Our machinists can't keep up with the demand!)-- Don't worry we let them sleep a full night, and give them plenty of breaks (QA is very important to us!)Over the past 4 years we've launched multiple versions in different sizes, with an assortment of different improvements. (Some of which were recommendations from our very own backers!)We've taken all these recommendations, and what we've learned from our other toothpicks and we are putting together what we think is the best toothpick we've ever produced!After 4 years of refinement we are super excited to announce..The TiPick 2.0™ is precision CNC machined from solid billets of Grade 5 Titanium.Some of the key improvements with TiPick 2.0 VS 1.0The TiPick 2.0 isn’t just a toothpick. It's a multi-use pick that can be used for a truck-load more than just cleaning your teeth.This is what I mean (Not to be combined with cleaning your teeth unless otherwise sanitized first!):-Dental cleaning-Finger nail cleaning-letter opening-crevasse cleaning-package opening-sliver removal-....AND MANY MANY MORE!Now, before I talk about the Rewards for this project..I think it's important you understand the experience you will receive by supporting my Kickstarter campaign. Here are just a few messages and comments we have received over the years.Ok.. Let's talk about rewards...In order for me to get the TiPick 2.0 into your sweaty palms... is by ensuring I can get my minimum quantity produced.The actual cost for me to produce each toothpick is pretty high for these reasons:1. The Quality of Material I use (The Very Best)2. The time it takes to build each one of these little suckers (Very Time Intensive)3. Current lack of quality machinists available (I only hire the best of the best)But here's why it get's good for you:Me and the team have put together some EXCLUSIVE Kickstarter rewards.Take a look and decide which rewards work best for you.Once you've decided on the reward you want.. just scroll to the top of this page and click on the corresponding Reward you desire.This will ""lock in"" this EXCLUSIVE pricing, RIGHT NOW.One more thing I wanted to mention:Backing this project is the ONLY way you will be able to guarantee this exclusive pricing for the TiPick 2.0P.S. TiPick 2.0 will retail for $39.99. (After Kickstarter).To products that last a lifetime,KendellWe take pride in ALL the products that we create and sell. The TiPick 2.0 is no exception to that rule either.If you are not satisfied with the TiPick 2.0 for any reason, we have a 100% money back guarantee.The TiPick 2.0 also has a lifetime guarantee, if for any reason you break your toothpick, we will replace it no questions asked!(Like we've said before..just don't lose it..that's not covered!So who cares.. And why is this so great..Well for starters the process for any titanium based alloy product to be made is extremely detailed. The process starts with a process known as the Kroll Process. During this process the main ore is treated with a gas called chlorine gas in order to produce titanium tetrachloride. This is then taken through a process of purification, and is then reduced into a metallic titanium sponge which happens from a reaction with sodium. After this the alloying process takes place to the titanium sponge. This process is very labor intensive and this is why titanium products are always more expensive to the “lesser metals” like steel and aluminum.The TiPick 2.0 isn’t just a toothpick. It's a multi-use pick that can be used for a truck-load more than just cleaning your teeth.This is what I mean (Not to be combined with cleaning your teeth unless otherwise sanitized first!):-Dental cleaning-Finger nail cleaning-letter opening-crevasse cleaning-package opening-sliver removal-....AND MANY MANY MORE!April - May: CampaignMay: Receive Funds, Start ManufacturingEarly July: Start distribution of productsJuly: Backers Receive Rewards","Some of the biggest risks involved with this project are getting the product to our backers on time.

Here Is A Product Demo!Our smartphones have amazing photo and video quality, and are even starting to be waterproof right out of the factory. HANSNAP’s design allows for quick accessibility to your phone and all of its amazing features. A pivoting arm positioned between the case and the hand strap enable various angles for filming. Simply stated:NEVER DROP YOUR PHONE, ALWAYS GET STABLE FOOTAGE!HANSNAP was invented by Justis Earle, a Santa Cruz, California native who came up with the idea while crowd surfing at a metal concert.“I wanted to capture first-person footage so others could share in the amazing experience of floating on a sea of hands.”How does HANSNAP work? Simply strap HANSNAP to your hand and slip your smartphone in. The pivoting arm between the case and the hand strap enable various angles which stabilize the phone for photo or video capture. They also allow for quick accessibility, screen visibility, and voice control.Justis and friends have been using HANSNAP in a number of ways over the last couple months:Moshing / Crowd Surfing,Skateboarding,Mountain Biking,Concert Footage,Tree Scaling,Sailing,4 Wheeling,Bungee Jumping,Kayaking,Live Streaming Events,Extreme Selfies,Keynote PresentationsJustis built the first prototypes himself and then set out to find the appropriate teams to implement the design, manufacture, and logistics of launching a new product. We have found two great Bay Area design firms, received several manufacturing quotes, and have assembled an amazing team of seasoned professionals as business, marketing, and logistics advisors.We are only sourcing ethically managed production facilities, and would prefer to produce as much of the product in the U.S. as possible, but have also sourced manufacturing facilities overseas with high working environment standards as a backup. This dedication to a high quality and ethically made product increase our costs a bit, but is something we will not compromise. Thank you for helping us with this vision!","We have an amazing team to help us complete this project, but there are always unforeseen snags that we have to count on encountering.

But we also are the #1 state in the country of cat overpopulation and euthanasia rates! I always say I was born with the love of cats in my blood.  My dad was the local police chief in a small town in Illinois. He kept cat food in the back of his squad car and fed all the homeless and feral cats.  If they were friendly he would adopt them out, and not too many people could say no to the chief of police.  My dad was honored in the town for being a animal advocate for cats and dogs alike.  He told my step mom he liked cats better than people.  This is a picture of my dad and his favorite cat Callie.Well like father like daughter!  LaGattara started many years ago as a independent rescue.  I've rescued over 300 cats and kittens and gotten them spayed and/or neutered and found loving homes for them.  I've always wanted to do something bigger, and make a impact on cats and the community.  Last year I had weight loss surgery and there were major complications.  My surgeon told me this was my second chance at life and not to waste it!  So I will not, I'm going to do what I was meant to do! Change the life of cats one at a time! I want to be the voice for the cats!            Cat Cafes are becoming increasing popular all over the world!

Lauderdale. It was still early and we were officially on vacation so we opted for a Bloody Mary to start our journey. We went to the airport bar and ordered a Bloody Mary. What we got was a thick, red, sludgy, flavorless paste served on ice mixed with a shot of vodka. We couldn't do it. We didn't even drink it.This was not the first time this has happened. Ithappens all the time. When you get a Bloody Mary that tastes like ketchup and vodka, you know something has to be done. We had enough.That is why we started this project!A Bloody Mary should be robust and zesty, good ""hair of the dog"" to get you going or a flavorful compliment to your brunch. Spicy, savory flavor and just the right blend of seasonings is what we all want.From that point on we brainstormed a way to fix this problem.What if we could make the perfect Bloody Mary in a single serving? The key was combining all the right robust and savory flavors. Something that was easy and simple to use with great taste and consistent every time was our goal. It needed to be something that was not perishable and you could use at home or when you are out and about. What if it was so convenient you could carry it with you either to make a Bloody Mary on the go or to improve a crappy one? What if...When we first started Chet’s Anytime Bloody Mary Seasoning Mix, we spent many months perfecting the perfect blend of spices. This way each Bloody Mary would be consistent.We wanted to create a dry-blend of seasonings that would have the same robust taste as making a Bloody Mary by scratch and most importantly we wanted to keep it simple. It had to be easy to make and easy to use.We also knew that we wanted it to be convenient and something you could use at home or when you are out and about. When you're traveling, playing golf, boating, or staying at a hotel, we wanted it to be easy to use. Sometimes you just need something to spice up or improve a bad Bloody Mary.Taste, consistency, and convenience are all top priorities.Chet’s Anytime Bloody Mary Seasoning Mix uses only all natural ingredients in a convenient single serving packet.A great Bloody Mary is a perfect symphony of savory flavors. That is why we spent months perfecting just the right blend to bring out the robust, spicy taste you would expect in a Bloody Mary. We add worchestershire powder, horseradish powder, cayenne pepper, celery salt, garlic powder, smoked paprika, black pepper, red pepper flakes, soy sauce powder and sumac.Just the right amounts of each spice is blended perfectly to bring out a Bloody Mary seasoning mix bursting with flavor. Now you can get all the ingredients it takes to make a great Bloody Mary in a quick, convenient, individual serving packet.WithChet's Anytime Bloody Mary Seasoning Mix, it doesn't get any better or easier than this!At home preparing the perfect Bloody Mary can take a lot of time and having to get all the ingredients can be time consuming. As we all know,if you don’t have everything on hand to make your perfect Bloody Mary, and you want just one, that would suck!We have the solution: Chet's Anytime Bloody Mary Seasoning Mix.We did all the work for you by combining all the ingredients and blending them perfectly in a single serving packet.Now you have the easiest way to make a great Bloody Mary. Simply add Tomato Juice, V-8, or Clamato and your favorite vodka!Chet's Anytime Bloody Mary Seasoning Mixis so convenient you can take it with you no matter where you go. We designed these packets with convenience in mind. Each individual serving packet has the perfect measurement of all natural ingredients.These little packets are designed to fit almost anywhere. They are completely non-perishable and moisture proof so you can be assured they will last. You can put them in your pocket, your purse, or anywhere you want. Take them with you no matter where you go and have the convenience of making your own Bloody Mary or improving a crappy Bloody Mary any time.Right now we are currently making each and every Bloody Mary Seasoning Packet by hand. We mix up a batch of the all natural ingredients, blend, finely sift, and precisely measure the exact amount and pour them into the individual serving packet. One by one, we take each packet and heat seal them and it takes a lot of time.We desperately need to get to the next level and take this process to our co-packer we have secured. The co-packer will take our unique recipe and make the individual packets on their equipment. This process will speed up our production dramatically, maintain the quality, and produce the exact measurement for each packet so that we can get our product out on the market for everyone to enjoy!Remember these individual serving packets are non-perishable, so you can use them as you need them. There is no waste and Chet's Anytime Bloody Mary Seasoning Mix is ready when you are at home or on the go!","The wonderful part about our project is that the risks are very low. We have already secured a co-packer, sent them our unique measurement of flavors in order to produce just the right blend. We have also already secured the packet maker as well as our packaging maker, who have all the specs. Because these 2 companies although separate, currently work together. We thought that it is perfect, they both know each others capabilities. The only challenge will be production time. However based upon our initial run and the large quantities required, once our project is backed we can go right into production. We are confident we can meet our backer goal for shipping. Obviously, if we run into any delays, we will be the first to let our backers know.",https://www.kickstarter.com/projects/1803626109/chets-anytime-bloody-mary-seasoning-mix-ii?ref=discovery_category_newest,1803626109/chets-anytime-bloody-mary-seasoning-mix-ii,"What Makes a great tasting Bloody Mary?Preparing a great Bloody Mary can take a lot of time and having to get all the ingredients can be time consuming.

It doesn't get any better or easier than this!Right now, my wife Sherri and I are currently making each and every Bloody Mary Seasoning Packet by hand.  We mix up a batch of the all natural ingredients, blend, finely sift, and precisely measure the exact amount and pour them into the individual serving packet. One by one, we fill each packet and heat seal them. Trust me it takes a lot of time.We desperately need to get to the next level and take this process to our co-packer we have secured.  The co-packer will take our unique recipe and make the individual packets on their equipment.  This process will speed up our production dramatically, maintain the quality, and produce the exact measurement for each packet so that we can get our product out on the market for everyone to enjoy!Click here to visit our Facebook Page.","The wonderful part about our project is that the risks are very low. We have already secured a co-packer, sent them our unique measurement of flavors in order to produce just the right blend. We have also already secured the packet maker as well as our packaging maker, who have all the specs. Because these 2 companies although separate, currently work together. We thought that it is perfect, they both know each others capabilities. The only challenge will be production time. However based upon our initial run and the large quantities required, once our project is backed we can go right into production. We are confident we can meet our backer goal for shipping. Obviously, if we run into any delays, we will be the first to let our backers know."

Our goal is to bring you unique hand made artifacts at a fair price without compromising the craftsmanship normally found in fine jewelry.""The truest old school artisanal craftsmanship in jewelry to be found in NYC. All the pieces are simply miniature, wearable sculptures! -Masha Orlov The Know CultureWe do not involve the use of CAD Software or 3-D milling machineswhen creating our models, instead each artifact is born from a sketch and then carved by hand from start to finish and cast locally in the ancient lost wax method.The lost-wax method dates from the 3rd millennium bc and has sustained few changes since then.In Russia we were exposed to a diversity of cultures – from the pagan shamans of the Altai mountains to the Tatar muslims of Kazan, from Russian fables to Ukrainian folk songs. The iconography of these cultures has become an endless source of artistic inspiration for our designs, as have the styles of the tribal sub-cultures of New York city. Arriving on the Lower East Side of Manhattan in 1982 inevitably set an eclectic tone for our brewing design sensibility. Now, three decades later, we have come together as artists to create a family business – an atelier that produces professionally crafted and locally made wearable art inspired not only by our own history but also by that of the ever-flowing integral story that is New York City.It is our commitment to have all of our mold making and casting done in New York City by environmentally conscious foundries. Not only because we want to ensure full quality results but also to support local businesses and build strong ties with our community. From the first sketch to the creation of the master model we remain dedicated to the art of drawing, carving and sculpting to create jewelry worthy of being passed down for generations. We are asking for backing in this project with the intent to complete and produce our introductory collection which consists of variously themed collections: The Avant-Gard, Lower East Side, Tribes of New York, and the Mother Russia collections.With these completed works and professional assistance we will be able to put together a comprehensive LookBook to send to potential clients and produce enough pieces to fill client orders on demand. With your contributions we will be able to purchase the needed equipment and tools which will allow us to complete our master models in the studio, giving us full quality control and saving us money in the initial stages of production instead of our having to rely on outside sources. We will also be able to cover the fees associated with participating in New York's important design markets this fall in order to build our client list and invest in the Fascination Anxiety Atelier and showroom. Thanks to your generosity we will be able to turn our vision into a celebrated reality!It takes a village and every little drop counts in realizing our goal. In response to your generosity we are offering gifts from our fine art and jewelry collection.$5An original printed surprise thank you card by Alisa Minyukova.$255""x7"" Original signed artist print by Alisa Minyukova limited edition for Kickstarter.$1000A small hand made piece of jewelry designed especially for you on selected theme of your choice caste in Sterling Silver.$3500A hand made piece of jewelry designed especially for you on a selected theme of your choice caste in 18 Karat Gold.Don't leave without taking a look at the worst kicktarter never made!

","Fascination Anxiety is a budding operation. Each design is started and finished in house. Many days the three of us work around the clock to complete orders because we are committed to the vision of taking this project to it's ultimate success. We share powerful momentum as a three person team. Thirty years of experience in the jewelry industry have taught us that not every step of the production process is fool proof. Once we hand the finished wax model over to the foundry for casting it is out of our control. There are instances where master models that have taken us weeks to sculpt have been entirely destroyed during the casting process leaving us no options than to start from scratch. Equipment can malfunction causing delays and quality control issues. And on occasion unforeseen shifts in the price of metals can reek havoc in our ability make a profit, yet there has been no hurdle too large or unmanageable to stop us.

From caffè Americano to Lattè, Coke, Orange Juice and much more drinks can be distinguished.Prismcups records the nutrients (eg. sugar, caffeine) and calories you drink for a day. When you sign up, you will enter your personal body information (height, weight, etc.) then the application would recommend the amount of nutrition you need to consume throughout the day.You can search the drinks, and even define drinks made from your own recipe.It intuitively tells you what you drink for a month, and provides you with a detailed nutrition label for your drink.The beverage unique ID collected by the tumbler is sent to the server. It calculates the amount of nutrients you have consumed from the pre-defined beverage’s nutrition information. Then show it in the App.We have looked into how our body differentiates different drinks.The way we identify drinks in a cup is determined by visual information. Based on this principle, we developed a technology to distinguish beverages. RGB color codes are much more accurate than the visual acuity of human body; thus, the type of beverage that can not be distinguished by the naked eye can be discriminated by the RGB codesThe way Prismcups distinguishes drinks is unique.The basic process is as follows:- When the beverage is placed in an enclosed structure, the three primary colors of red(R) , green (G), and blue (B), or the infrared of a specific wavelength, are fired for extremely short periods of time.- By using light sensor, the r,g,b or infrared spectrum that the beverages reflects are measured.- Measure the amount of beverage by measuring the water level with our patented infrared or other way.- Send RGB codes and amount of drinks to your smartphone. - Determines whether there is a code that matches the RGB codes received from the RGB database of a drink that already exists in the smartphone.* The RGB database contains the RGB codes of beverages, and the calories, sugar, sodium, and caffeine data that are included in a specific reference quantity of beverage.- If a value exists, it is determined to be the beverage. When there is no data, the smartphone receives a certain drink, inputs the ingredient, and stores it in the database.- Record statistics on the components (sugars, calories, caffeine) consumed based on the quantity of beverages and drinks received.Consumer prices have been made reasonably.There are two main ways to determine drinks. Either analyzing the color of the drink as we developed or using molecular sensor to judge the material itself. However,molecular sensor are priced at between $30 and $40 per unit, resulting in excessive consumer prices of up to $200 when implemented as a product. Whereas, Prismcups uses RGB sensors to identify beverages and make them available for under $100.And Machine LearningThe way to distinguish drinks from RGB sensors is very effective. However, when we actually developed it, the accuracy was high only when it was guaranteed a definite condition. For example, if the RGB codes are changed by an external light, the drink could not be properly identified. Our team overcame this problem with machine learning. We used the K-Means clustering algorithm to study the range of RGB codes of beverages. This way, we were able to increase the accuracy a lot.The Example of Machine LearningHere is a data set tested 379 times and 5 kinds of beverages by using Prismcups.https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1UY3qzpmNA8PaTtP4YyL_p2KhEbnoNLYDzS_y3FyaTMg/edit?usp=sharingAs you can see below images, each color is gathered at some points meaning that we can distinguish beverages by this data.The way how to distinguish beverages is unique and practical. The accuracy was very high which is about 95% in a definite condition. However, if the conditions are changed, the result would be very different. That is why we need to study more about it. Hopefully, it will work.The Experiments with RGB SensorThese videos show usBio Hackers, Dieters, People with diabetes, obesity, and etc. And give it to your loved ones.If you are with Prismcups, You can be healthier.

In order to accurately distinguish beverages, it is necessary to precisely control the external environment. Even though Prismcups learns the color range of the beverage, we will try to improve the accuracy by creating a lid that does not allow any light to go into the tumbler. If these attempts do not make a big difference, we might 'limit' the range of beverage distinctions. For example, it is a form that only distinguishes two or three different kinds of coffee and water. 2. Also, the beverage database we have in the beginning is bound to be limited.

https://www.kickstarter.com/projects/dimideclamps/dimide-clamps-0?ref=discovery_category_newest,dimideclamps/dimide-clamps-0,"Designed to a Higher Standard.Through use of Finite Element Analysis (FEA) and Computer Aided Design (CAD) software the Dimide Clamp's geometry has been optimized for loads generated by impact wrenches.Superior Strength and Power.Thanks to the Dimide Clamps design it is strong enough to be driven with an impact wrench. This allows users to effortlessly achieve much higher clamp loads than competitor clamps. Driven with a 400 foot-pound impact wrench the Dimide Clamp easily achieves over 4,000 pounds of load while competitive clamps, which lack strength for impact wrench compatibility, struggles to be tightened to only 1,700 pounds with two hands.The picture above shows the Dimide Clamp tightened to 5087.90 pounds using a 400 foot-pound impact wrench and the competitor tightened to 1693.98 pounds.Use the Tool You Want.With Dimide Clamp's hex head, you can use the tool you want to use. Whether you want power with an impact wrench, control with a torque wrench, or the availability of a common ratchet. Control the Load You Apply.Thanks to Dimide Clamps compatibility with torque wrenches you can now have more control of the load you apply allowing you to be rest assured that fragile parts will be unharmed.Every Dimide Clamp will also come with a torque-to-load conversion sheet.100% Made in USAEvery Dimide Clamp is made in the United States by manufacturers that have a proven track record of consistently delivering high quality parts, timely and cost effectively. Every clamp is made using only high strength steels to ensure durability. To ensure longevity, screws and clamp shoes will be copper coated to prevent weld splatter from sticking, and the plates will be painted safety yellow to prevent corrosion and make the clamp easy to find.TestimonialRead about the Dimide Clamp on:Clamp SpecificationsMax Reach: 3.4 inchesMin Reach: 2.5 inchesImpact Wrench Max Rating: 400 foot-pounds (Not torque from a torque wrench)Clamp shoes will have a v-groove to allow clamping of pipes.Why Kickstarter?Crowdfunding allows for more flexibility in how we do business. Crowdfunding helps eliminate the need for deep pocketed investors looking to turn a quick profit which allows us to focus more on the customer and the product.The TeamMike and Emmet Costen, a Father and Son team of structural engineers. We have a passion for design, engineering and solving problems through innovation.Where are you in the process?After countless prototypes design changes such that every last detail has been considered, we have arrived at the final Dimide Clamp. We have many working units, but we need your help to place a substantial minimum order for the first production run of the Dimide Clamp.We have all of manufacturers lined up and are set to start shipping Dimide Clamps in July 2017 or earlier.DIMIDE's NameDimide is named after the Diimide molecule which is the molecule with the strongest calculated chemical bond. The Diimide molecule is also known as dication diazene or HNNH2+ and the relative bond strength order (RBSO) is 3.38.In order to only have two syllables, we then shortened Di-i-mide to Di-mide.Final ThoughtsWhile the Dimide Clamp is strong, it is not indestructible. Every Dimide Clamp will come with a max torque rating. For example, our 5-inch Dimide Clamp is rated for an impact wrench which is rated for 400 foot-pounds.The clamp shown is not the final product that will be shipped to backers. The final product will have copper coated shoes and screw to prevent weld splatter from sticking. The final product will also have v-grooves in the clamp shoes to allow clamping of pipes.Each clamp is not individual calibrated for load. The torque-to-load conversion sheet is based off design values. These values are to be used with caution and are only to be used to determine the estimated load and not the exact load.International BackersThis project isn't just for backers in the United States. We'll be shipping Dimide Clamps worldwide! That being said, there are unique processes that apply specifically to international backers that we'd like you to be aware of.

As opposed to struggling with a wrench or t-handle, impact drivers offer a great alternative to tightening screws and applying significant torque. That is why we engineered our screws and nuts to be able to handle the abuse of impact drivers without stripping or shearing. With the 1/4 Series Clamp, and your preferred impact driver, you'll be able to enjoy the benefits of pain free clamping that won't slip.*The production Dimide 1/4 Series Clamp will feature a grooved 1/4"" impact-rated hex to lock it into a 1/4"" impact driver chuck for easy use.*If you choose to use a 1/4"" socket instead of securing the clamp into the impact driver's chuck, use a deep throat socket to prevent shearing the hex above the groove.Maybe you don't have an impact driver handy or you're just looking for a workout. Either way the 1/4 Series Clamp is also compatible with ratchets and wrenches. Use the multi-use T-handle as a torque reaction bar for easy manual tightening.Sometimes you don't want to carry another tool with you, we get that. The 1/4 Series Clamp will include a multi-use T-handle that inserts into the safety-stop, to allow you to hand-tighten your clamp similar to any other (boring) clamp.The 1/4 Series Clamp is made for single-handed use with an impact driver. This allows for easy single-handed tightening to 1,700 lbs of clamp force, far more than any other single-handed clamp.The 1/4 Series Clamp is built with high-quality materials to withstand the test of time. As structural engineers we are obsessed with making products that last.*If you're worried about weld spatter, check out the copper-coated upgrade in the Tier 1 Peripherals section above.The 1/4 Series Clamp configuration has been optimized for clamping load. Keeping the screw in tension prevents buckling allowing for a smaller screw diameter to carry the high load our clamps experience. The clamp load is then carried from the screw and nuts to the side plates, which are configured for arching. Similar to arch bridges, this configuration is an optimal structural shape for compression. The smooth contour prevents stress concentrations from occurring, thus preventing fatigue cracks and other failure mechanisms.The clamp design has been relentlessly engineered with the use of ANSYS Finite Element Analysis (FEA). When Mike Costen, President and Principle Engineer, isn't working on perfecting clamps he is busy optimizing aerospace structures, including rocket valves and more. This has given him over 30 years of experience analyzing structures for performance, weight, and manufacturability.We wanted to provide as smooth of a tightening experience as possible. Achieving this required engineering ingenuity to prevent the nuts from pinching, due to bending under the high clamping loads. Offsetting the threads from the nut ears makes them far less effected by the nut bending which delivers a nice and smooth tightening experience!A clamp that delivers as much load as the Dimide Clamp requires significant stiffness, especially when detent pins are used for modularity. This is obtained by replacing the common rivet pins with a stiffer shear plate design. This design is similar to that of an I-Beam, where the shear plates act as the I-Beam's web and the side plates act as the flanges. The shear plates increase stability while the clamp is tightening by carrying the shear load delivered by the impact driver torque.The 1/4 Series Clamp has been designed to be highly customizable and compatible with an abundance of modular peripheral components. Part of our goal was to provide a high-quality and affordable clamp that could be used as the perfect solution for a large variety of projects.Work holding, or clamping, demands vary a lot from project to project and job to job. This has led to an abundance of unique clamps, each meant for a unique job or situation.After observing all these different clamps, we realized there is a lot of waste in the use of repeated clamp parts. This gave us the insight that instead of making an entirely new and unique clamp for every situation, we could make a modular clamp that would allow you to switch out individual components. You wouldn't need to buy an entirely new clamp for every situation. This is what allows us to deliver a high-quality clamp for any situation at an affordable price.The modular peripheral components will launch in the priority voted upon by you, our Backers.

The web series, a dramedy, explores the complicated, hilarious, and sometimes difficult things woke millennials of color go through on their path to self-actualization. The show’s major themes center around friendship, love, potential, and forgiveness.Blasians was created by Amie Darboe, a Black American writer and producer from Rhode Island, and is directed by Pongkarnda 'Kik' Udomprasert, a writer and director from Thailand. It's rare to see projects by women of color get the funding they need, but even rarer to see projects that are a result of partnerships between Black and Asian women creatives.Although progress is being made, Asian and Black communities lack representation in all aspects of media. Additionally, misconceptions about Black and Asian relationships continue to add strife to our communities. Blasians aims to show that not only do Asian and Black friendships exist, but that they're fun, raw, and hella beautiful.TOM is the resourceful, witty friend you wish you had. He has an impressive ability to attractevery hot guy who comes in his vicinity (gay, straight, it doesn’t matter) with his sense of humor.You can find him driving for Lyft to pay his bills.APRIL is out here living her best life on all the dating apps swiping for days, but you won’t catch her in a relationship (Drake said ‘Nice for What’ right?).

Expect her to serve you the tough love that you don’t want (but need) to hear.JUSTIN'spersonal philosophy these days is “hakuna matata” (it means “no worries”). He’s a science teacher and gamer and is married to Mayumi.BRENDAis the definition of extra. She’s also smarter than she lets on and sees the best in people, but don’t try her; she’s hella hood. She pays her bills by slaying as a Chief Revenue Officer for a major tech company.LIAMdescribes himself as a “woke male feminist” without any irony. He’s a huge people pleaser who works as a teacher for the fun of it.AMIE DARBOE (Creator, Writer, and Executive Producer)Amie has been writing since she was seven years old. She ismost passionate about telling stories that amplify the voices of marginalized groups, especially women of color. In addition to writing, she has produced and directed short films, short plays, and comedy sketches. She grew up in Providence, RI and lives in Austin, TX.PONGKARNDA 'KIK' UDOMPRASERT(Director and Producer)Born and raised in the warm and loving culture of Thailand, Kik possesses an extraordinary ability to connect with people and their emotions on a very deep level. This quality comes through in her work as a filmmaker, as her films communicate very strong emotions. As an Asian writer/director based in the US, she aims to tell stories that put more minority representation and experiences on screen, hoping for her work to spark the dialogue that helps reunite this country and bring back its true power of diversity.BRYANT MARCONTEL(Director of Photography)Bryant Marcontel has been telling stories through visual mediums since he was 16. He began to focus his craft towards production and cinematography during his college years. He has a decade of experience on set in multiple capacities in both the camera and lighting departments.ERIN LAU (1st Assistant Director)Having been raised in the quiet valley of Kahaluʻu on Oʻahu by her entrepreneurial grandparents, Native Hawaiian filmmaker Erin Lau has shaped her career around projects inspired by her heritage, the female perspective, and the Asian Pacific community. The Sundance Institute Native Lab fellow and University of Hawaii alum has written and directed multiple award-winning shorts, which have screened at festivals around the world, including New Zealand, France, Guam, Shanghai, and Canada.Despite venturing far from home, she continues to practice the values her culture and community instilled in her, in hopes that her films will empower voices and serve as bridges between communities.MLADAN JURKOVIC (Sound Mixer)Mladan was born in Croatia and grew up in Seattle, where he graduated from the University of Washington with a double degree in Biology and Spanish. After a period of time devoted to language translation and music performance, he completed his MFA in Film from Ohio University, with a focus in directing, video editing, and audio recording. Mladan has been a professional audio mixer since 2012, working in feature and short films and documentaries, commercial and experimental audio.KAT RODRIGUEZ(Production Designer)Kat Rodriguez has had a passion for film from a very young age. She firmly believes that films are a key factor in shaping culture and can be used as a force for change. It is important to her to prioritize working on projects that spotlight characters and stories that have been under or misrepresented – mainly stories about women, people of color, and the LGBT+ community as these are all facets of what make up her identity.We've shot a proof of concept, written the scripts, and found a dream team of collaborators to work with. We're ready to do the work. All we need is YOU. You're major in helping us finish out this project. The biggest costs for this project are:Cast & Crew:Creating content is expensive. We believe that creatives should get paid living wages so that the stress of having to figure out how they'll pay their bills won't affect their mental health to the point where they're unable to create.Craft Services:Feeding a cast and crew a couple of meals for each day of shooting to make sure that they're able to be productive isn't cheap. Help us buy them coffee, granola bars, and lunch. Their bellies will thank you.Locations: Location, insurance, and permit fees in LA County will make any producer without a high budget want to cry.Equipment: All the camera, lighting, and sound equipment used to make sure that we deliver a product that looks and sounds good cost a lot to rent.In addition to those items, we need funding to cover:Blasians is ultimately a story about friendship and love. We don't see too many stories about Asian and Black relationships or those that center Black, Asian, or queer people of color in media.This project can change that with your help.

We will use this money for:Cast & Crew:Creating content is expensive. We believe that creatives should get paid living wages so that they can live.

We want to deliver a beautiful final product and this is another place where we'll put in work to ensure that.In addition to those items, we need funding to cover:When I was growing up in the late 1990s and early 2000s, I found television to be an incredibly diverse medium that allowed me to not only see stories about people who looked like me and members of my community, but also stories about people who lived worlds away. As I got older, I saw fewer stories that I felt were authentic to not only my experiences, but also those of people of color so I began to write them because marginalized communities also need their voices to be heard. I created this project out of a desire to see more nuanced and authentic portrayals of Black, Asian, and queer people of color on screen. I love serialized television and find the digital landscape to be a perfect opportunity to tell stories that traditionally could only fit on television. Thus, even though I've written a number of pilots, I wrote Do Better in a way that allows the series to be told beautifully through a web series format.TOM is the resourceful, witty friend you wish you had.

I love learning about it and I love teaching it. I decided avery long time agothat I would really like to make an animated feature with graduates of the school I founded.We have a great story to tell and with your help, we are going to do something that nobody has everdone before! When alien thugs attack a deep space station, NAVY SEALS andNASA ASTRONAUTS are teamed together to rescue the survivors. While still being an outrageous actionadventure, our story celebrates the courage and heroism of our greatestexplorers and our bravest soldiers in a way that children and their parents can experience together. What started as a class project is now ready to become a feature length film. Animated features can cost tens of millions of dollarstoproduce. Without the resources to complete a finished work, filmmakers often choose to create shorts. We’ve done that. Twice! Onceas a live action short (2004), and later as an animated short (2008). Afteryears of development, several collaborators, mentors,and countless drafts we have a script! A really great one.Thismeans we intend to tell the entire 94 page screenplay in a highly creative yetminimally technical way. Every element (character, set, prop, vehicle, orcreature) will be constructed as a ""simple but cool"" approximation ofwhat would be needed for a finished film. An element that might take a studiolike DreamWorks or Pixar 30 people and a month to prepare, we will do in a day.Will it look as good? No way! but it will pull you into the storyand it will take you on our amazing adventure!Tellingstories like this with the amazing possibilities that computer animationprovides shouldn't be limited to a handful of corporately owned studios.

In the past few years low cost live action filmmaking tools have givenvoice to hundreds of directors who may have otherwise been overlooked. This is happening with animation as well. While we won’t be pushing the bleeding edgeof computer imagery,you willfollow the adventure of a17 year old boy whois going to try to save the earth toimpress a girl... and you’re going to cry!It'simportant to note that while the school played an important role in the originof this project, it’s not producing this film. Even with a successful campaignwe could not begin to quit our day jobs, build a studio, buy new equipment, or hirea full time staff. This money will beused to pay recent animation school graduatesto perform small but pivotal taskson the film. When we need a spaceship designed we will have something to paythe artist.

A fresh new way of enjoying the ""No Sock Look"" without discomfort and the problem of smelly feet!With VivaSox you can finally rock the no sock look without stink or foot pain experienced from actually bare-footing it.Let's first talk about how Vivasox work and then we'll talk about the different styles:We all know someone who would rather keep their shoes on when they come into our house because of their putrid smelling feet. Chances are though, if you like rocking the no sock look, you are that person.The only solution to stinky feet while still having the no sock look up until today are no show socks, which are hardly ever no show, fall off while you're wearing them, and lose elasticity pretty much the first time you wash them. Consequently one of the pair will undoubtedly end up in sock heaven when you wash and dry them.VivaSox puts a stop to stinky feet, but still gives you the no sock look. Using only synthetic materials, VivaSox naturally repels bacteria that causes your feet and shoes to stink. VivaSox are also machine washable and won't lose elasticity like your no show socks do.If you've ever rocked the no sock look you know how badly your feet can hurt after. Blisters and sore feet are common, but totally preventable by just slipping a pair of VivaSox in your shoes.VivaSox give you extra cushion in common blistering areas such as the toe box of your shoe. VivaSox also provide added cushion to the bottom of your foot making standing up and moving around all day a little more bearable.VivaSox have a user friendly and unique, patent pending device that holds up the sock part so you don't have to worry about your sock sliding to the bottom of your shoe.Our two in one solution solves both the stink problem and sore foot problem, but still gives you the fashionable no sock look everyone is looking for.We have taken the best parts of an insole and added the extra cushion of a sock to the top of your foot to help prevent blistering and sore feet.

For casual and sporty shoe wearers... the true no-sock look is finally here!VivaSox are made to insert into your shoe. A fresh new way of enjoying the ""No Sock Look"" without discomfort and the problem of smelly feet!With VivaSox you can finally rock the no sock look without stink or foot pain experienced from actually bare-footing it.Let's first talk about how Vivasox work and then we'll talk about the different styles:We all know someone who would rather keep their shoes on when they come into our house because of their putrid smelling feet. Chances are though, if you like rocking the no sock look, you are that person. The only solution to stinky feet while still having the no sock look up until today are no show socks, which are hardly ever no show, fall off while you're wearing them, and lose elasticity pretty much the first time you wash them. Consequently one of the pair will undoubtedly end up in sock heaven when you wash and dry them.VivaSox puts a stop to stinky feet, but still gives you the no sock look. Using only synthetic materials, VivaSox naturally repels bacteria that causes your feet and shoes to stink. VivaSox are also machine washable and won't lose elasticity like your no show socks do.If you've ever rocked the no sock look you know how badly your feet can hurt after. Blisters and sore feet are common, but totally preventable by just slipping a pair of VivaSox in your shoes. VivaSox give you extra cushion in common blistering areas such as the toe box of your shoe. VivaSox also provide added cushion to the bottom of your foot making standing up and moving around all day a little more bearable. VivaSox have a user friendly and unique, patent pending device that holds up the sock part so you don't have to worry about your sock sliding to the bottom of your shoe.Our two in one solution solves both the stink problem and sore foot problem, but still gives you the fashionable no sock look everyone is looking for. We have taken the best parts of an insole and added the extra cushion of a sock to the top of your foot to help prevent blistering and sore feet. Since VivaSox are made from synthetic polymers it is naturally anti-microbial and will save your shoes from stinking so badly that you won't want to wear them ever again.You will be able to choose types, colors, and sizes in the survey at the end of our campaign.Shipping will be calculated and charged during the post-campaign survey.

The album carries the listener through the events ofChrono Cross, retelling Masato Kato’s expansive story of adventure, deception, jealousy, and determination with music crafted to help you experienceChrono Crossin a whole new way.Inspired in part by the legendary film composer John Williams, Cross Symphonic'ssweeping melodic approach serves as a tribute to both Williams and Mitsuda who are both major inspirations to me personally.With your help, Cross Symphonic will be recorded by a 75-piece orchestra with choir in Nashville, Tennessee by some of the best studio musicians in the industry. They’re known for quickly understanding the music and producing a quality recording without wasting any time in the studio. Hiring a professional orchestra that specializes in recording is key to producing a world class product both efficiently and musically.In addition, I've commissioned two incredible artists to help bring Cross Symphonic to life. Felipe Cartín is responsible for the logo design, and Kickstarter assets, while Roger Creus Dorico is responsible for the album art and illustrating different cinematic scenes from Cross Symphonic to help bring a visual experience to the album. You can find out more about them at the bottom of the page.Cross Symphonic Poster 1:Cross Symphonic Poster 2: Production and licensing for Cross Symphonic has been officially approved by Septima Ley and Yasunori Mitsuda. Cross Symphonic is a fan made tribute produced at the professional level and has no direct affiliation with Square Enix, Septima Ley, or Yasunori Mitsuda. Cross Symphonic will be produced and distributed by Hayward Publishing and is scheduled for worldwide release on November 18th 2019 to celebrate the 20th anniversary release of Chrono Cross in Japan.Here are three mock-ups from the album to give you a taste of what's to come. These tracks will come to life with a live orchestra and transport you into the world of Chrono Cross like you've never heard it before.Track 01: Torn Between WorldsFollow Serge through his dream and onto Opassa Beach where he is abruptly pulled from one dimension to the next. He awakens to find himself in a world where he doesn't exist. This track ends with Serge's journey with a strange blonde thief to Termina in hopes of finding some answers.Track 02: Far From HomeThe journey continues through Fossil Valley. Now allowed to pass by the Acacia Dragoons, Serge and Kid travel to Termina where their story is just beginning. Rumor has it that a strange visitor is staying at Viper Manor. Perhaps he may hold the answers for Serge, but why is Kid so determined to break in?Track 06: The Hermit And The DragonIn pursuit of Lynx and General Viper to Fort Dragonia, the group visits a retired master swordsman turned hermit for instructions on how to infiltrate the impenetrable fort. The group arrives to find the hermit's hideaway burned to the ground. Worse yet, Lynx's subordinate Harle is waiting for Serge with orders to subdue him.When the Final Fantasy album Distant Worlds was released in 2007, I could only hope that a Chrono equivalent wouldn’t be far behind. Sadly, nothing ever materialized. I was inspired to begin work on Cross Symphonic shortly after hearing the amazing arrangements from Final Symphony by Masashi Hamauzu, Jonne Valtonen and Roger Wanamo. While deciding what exactly I wanted Cross Symphonic to be, I kept coming back to the question; “What if John Williams had written the soundtrack to Chrono Cross?”Yasunori Mitsuda and John Williams have both played an important role in my development as a musician. I couldn’t be more thrilled with how naturally Williams sweeping romantic style fits with Mitsuda’s memorably beautiful melodies. Cross Symphonic serves as a tribute not only to one of my favorite game franchises of all time, but to two incredible composers that continue to inspire me to this day. World class orchestral albums are extremely expensive, easily running upwards of $200,000.While I have devoted a lot of time and money both personally and through Hayward Publishing towards this project I have reached a point where I can no longer continue production without your help. I'm turning to Kickstarter with the invitation to take part in this journey with me to help create an unforgettable experience that will not only celebrate Chrono Cross and it's incredible music, but will set a new standard for video game albums to come. Let's use Cross Symphonic to show Square Enix that the Chrono community is alive, well, and still celebrating a franchise that continues to inspire art, music, and literature to this day.John Paul HaywardFelipe CartínRoger Creus Dorico (Rowey)","I’ve had the privilege to write for and work with several different professional orchestras and choirs around the United States for the past 10 years. I’ve also had the opportunity to record and produce 3 studio albums featuring everything from full orchestra and choir down to solo instruments. I possess a full understanding of what it takes to develop a project like this from start to finish. As with any project with many moving parts, careful planning and scheduling are key to completing a project on time and on budget. My team and I have been working on Cross Symphonic since December 2017 and have spent countless hours meticulously planning every step of the way.The goal is to record in May 2019 with a scheduled release date of November 18, 2019 to celebrate the 20th anniversary release of Chrono Cross in Japan.

I've set up a modular stretch campaign that will give us the opportunity to record different sections of the orchestra to replace their virtual counterparts with live players. Each goal will build a piece of the orchestra all the way through a live recording with an entire orchestra at $55,000.Track 01: Torn Between WorldsFollow Serge through his dream and onto Opassa Beach where he is abruptly pulled from one dimension to the next.

We are re-launching this as an e-mag-- if you supported us here you get first dibs at the deals there. Thank you!In 2009-'11, the Penn State blogosphere took its wit and snark to the glossy pages of the We Are Penn State preview magazines, published by Maple Street Press. It was a great three-year run, until MSP closed shop before the 2012 edition could be produced. All the better, since much of the world focused on the Penn State portrayed within the national media, and Penn State fans tried to focus on just about anything else.But now it's 2013. And despite the efforts of some, and the expectations of everybody, there are some people playing football--goodfootball--in Happy Valley. Let's go talk about that!We Are... back!At least that's the plan, but we need your help. In order to free us from the shackles of corporate overlords and give our readers the best Penn State content available, we are calling upon the awesome power of the PSU Web community--those of you who most appreciate and can best recognize original and quality content--to back our endeavor, and bring back your favorite annual publication.What We Are...The magazine will be 112 pages, the first half previewing the 2013 team and opponents. We willbreak down Penn State's schedule, its new high-power offense, its traditionally stout defense, and shockingly enough, a superb class of 2013.Then come the features, with a lineup of superstar authors like:Lou Prato, the renowned Penn State historian who will help us commemorate two decades of Big Ten membership by explaining how that all came about.Tim Tolley, recruiting guru of Fansided, VictoryBellRingsand State College's Centre County Gazette.Chase Stuart, author of the highly respected statistics blogFootball Perspective and a regular contributor to the New York Times.Ben Jones, program insider and Penn State beat writer forStateCollege.com...plus contributions from BSD editor emeritus Jeff Junstrom, internet legend/MGoBlog editor Brian Cook, and of course the top notch PSU blogging team from Black Shoe Diaries:Devon Edwards, Adam Collyer, Tim Hyland, Dan Vecellio, and Ben Scaff.Who We Are...Mike, Cari and Jared.

He later brought together some of the best Penn State bloggers to createLinebacker-U.com.He spent three seasons as a sideline photographer and managing editor of Black Shoe Diaries through the end of the 2012 football season, and also worked with Phil Steele. His writing has been cited by,among others, FOX Sports, Sports Illustrated OnCampus, Sporting News Today, The Baltimore Sun, and the Chicago Sun-Times. Mike is currently the Associate Digital News Editor for North Jersey Media Group.Editor Cari Greene(@NotCarlotta) is the Managing Editor forBlack Shoe Diaries. After graduating PSU in 2003 with a degree in film, she wallowed in the depths of retail management hell before getting a ""real job"" that allowed her to actually, you know, attend PSU football games. Cari lives in suburban Maryland, close enough to State College that she can make the trip every weekend but far enough away to not be all post-graduate creepy. She also really, really likes linebackers.Editor Jared Slanina(@BSDtweet) is the other Managing Editor forBlack Shoe Diaries. Despite being a lifelong Ohio resident, Jared has been a passionate and loyal Penn State fan throughout his life. He earned his master's degree in journalism from Kent State University and currently resides in Stow, Ohio, with his wife and two dogs. You can typically find Jared at Beaver Stadium most Saturdays in the fall, or in his ""man cave"" where he has three TVs set up to watch college football from noon until he drifts off watching a Pac-12 game late at night.This is kinda out of the blue but my upper torso feels chilly.You need a shirt, or better yet a hoodie. And exclusive to supporters of this kickstarter we have those available:You can get a t-shirt for a $15 contribution, or as part of the BLUE-WHITE combo with a copy of the magazine and a thanks on BSD. Contribute $100 and we'll send you the hoodie along with your mag, and thank you personally in the magazine itself.UPDATE: People have been asking how to put in their t-shirt sizes or if they can give these as gifts and whatnot. When the Kickstarter ends (and if it's successful) you'll get an email directing you to a web-form where you can put all of that information in, including your address to ship it to and if you're a top-level sponsor what message you'd like put in the book. If you'd like it to be in someone else's name, you can do it at that time.","Immediately after the project is funded, we have to give a sizeable downpayment to our printer to reserve our print deadline. And there are plenty more deadlines coming up quite soon after the end of this campaign.Fortunately we have an experienced editorial staff on board, including Seth Fisher from MGoBlog who was the driving force behind their successful launch and production of a similar project for Michigan fans last year. We also have engaged the services of Courtney Fathers, one of the best art directors in the business, who has designed thousands of magazine issues, official team programs, and posters for major touring bands.We still need to sort through, select, designate, and prep all the photos that our editors have accumulated from the Penn State sidelines, turn those and 200 pages worth of Word documents into finished pages, caption every cat in the book (internet rule: all cats require captions), and proof read, copy edit, title, paginate, zip, and ship every finished page.And then we have to, you know, get the books (and the t-shirts) to you, for which we have partnered with Underground Printing, a hip collegiate apparel company hopefully coming soon to a Happy Valley near you, that has a long history of supporting college blogs. UGP not only can put out a professional shirt, but they're very well equipped to handle all the warehousing, fulfillment and distribution. The cost to ship each book can go from the cost of making each book to five times that, fyi, so it helps to have an expert on our side here.",https://www.kickstarter.com/projects/1700046469/we-are-2013-a-penn-state-preview-emagazine?ref=discovery_category_newest,1700046469/we-are-2013-a-penn-state-preview-emagazine,"In 2009-'11, the Penn State blogosphere took its wit and snark to the pages of the We Are Penn State preview magazines, published by Maple Street Press.

But we spoke to the writers, and the designers, and the publisher, and rather than simply scrap the project, we all agreed we'd rather try again as an e-magazine so we can still get you all of the great content and establish ourselves for a print version next year. So long as we can raise enough to break even with the authors, the plan is to provide this as an e-book.Obviously it's a little different than mailing printed magazines. We looked at a lot of different options for delivery and decided to go with one that allows you to access your copy in whatever way you want to. No DRM-y stuff. You'll be able to print it or make a pdf of it to read on your tablet or your phone, or download it to that and read it on a plane. You'll be able to email it to people too but we ask that you not 'cause it's copyrighted and it was not-free for you and very not-free for us to produce it.

Now we're mailing no books with shirts, and that changes the math of the shirts.

If we do get funded it goes to a bank account started last February by our publisher expressly for this project. In the future we'll have a corp set up to handle these for multiple blogs.The Wolverine is our publisher, Seth Fisher (@Misopogon,facebook.com/Misopogon), who successfully put one of these together for MGoBlog last year,is doing that againon their site, and approached us about expanding the concept. Sadly there are people other than Penn State fans in this world whom we find useful enough to tolerate; rather than a building full of them at some publishing house, we have one, and this one is currently engaged in a long email chain with Ben Scaff over how he'd defeat Bill O'Brien's fullback ISO throwback play.","So guess what: we're not printing so we have a little more time, and it's a little less complicated.We are deciding still on the e-printing platform, between Joomag, Issuu, Calameo, Bluetoad, or maybe just individually emailing the PDFs. Right now we're trying those out, and should have a decision in a few weeks. We've ruled out iBooks and Amazon because of limited distribution, gross overhead requirements, and their DRM; we want this to be as user-friendly as possible, and give you access to your e-magazine from all of your devices. We are not considering any ad-based systems.Getting the editorial staff assembled wasn't much work and most of them have already submitted draft copies of their articles. Getting Cari to keep the linebackers preview under 8,000 words was a challenge. There are a lot of editor and publisher hours left sorting through thousands of photos, and all the design work yet remains before us.Fortunately we have an experienced editorial staff on board, including Seth Fisher from MGoBlog who was the driving force behind their successful launch and production of a similar project for Michigan fans last year. We also have engaged the services of Courtney Fathers, one of the best art directors in the business, who has designed thousands of magazine issues, official team programs, and posters for major touring bands.We still need to sort through, select, designate, and prep all the photos that our editors have accumulated from the Penn State sidelines, turn those and 200 pages worth of Word documents into finished pages, caption every cat in the book (internet rule: all cats require captions), and proof read, copy edit, title, paginate, zip, and ship every finished page.And then we have to, you know, get the books (and the t-shirts) to you. For the latter we have partnered with Underground Printing, a hip collegiate apparel company hopefully coming soon to a Happy Valley near you, that has a long history of supporting college blogs. UGP not only can put out a professional shirt, but they're very well equipped to handle all the warehousing, fulfillment and distribution."

Hughes was fourteen when the death sentence that was diabetes was lifted forever in 1921. She enjoyed a full and extraordinary life for another sixty years, and outlived all four scientists involved in isolating the drug that saved her life.Unspeakably Wonderful is a film about two men who hated each other but made one of the greatest medical breakthroughs of the 20th century - the discovery of insulinWe're asking for your support to help bring this story to life, at a time when diabetes threatens more people on the planet than ever before.We are trying to make a movie about one of the most astonishing stories in the history of medical science: the discovery of insulin. Unspeakably Wonderful tells the story of how a small-town Canadian doctor set out to find a treatment for diabetes against impossible odds. It’s a story about friendship and rivalry, despair and triumph. It’s about how discoveries are made – and the extraordinary impact such discoveries can have on peoples’ lives. And at a time when diabetes has once again become one of the single biggest threats to our health, we think it’s a story worth telling.We have a script, and we have a crew. What we don’t have is the top-flight actors we need to make the project a reality, or the funding to get the show on the road. That’s why we really need your helpIt’s 1920. The twelve-year-old daughter of the Governor of New York develops an uncontrollable thirst. The diagnosis is diabetes. There is no cure; the only “treatment” is a starvation diet that will simply delay her death.But one night, in the middle of a thunderstorm, a small-town Canadian doctor wakes with the conviction he can solve the riddle of how to treat diabetes. His name is Fred Banting.Fred has survived the Great War; he carries its wounds: mental and physical; but he’s also a determined son-of-a-bitch. Against the wishes of his fiancé he abandons his struggling medical practice and takes up a quest to find the elusive, magical elixir that will reverse the killer condition.The University of Toronto is deserted for the summer. In primitive conditions and baking heat, Fred struggles with his lack of research experience and clashes with the three other scientists who can see a glimmer of hope in the project.The researchers battle with the science, and personal dislike spills over into fierce competition, acrimony, and even violence, while the young patients around them suffer and die.When the breakthrough comes, the stories of the patients saved by the newly isolated insulin are “unspeakably wonderful.” But victory comes at huge personal cost to the researchers.Unspeakably Wonderful tells the astonishing and moving human story behind one of the greatest medical discoveries of the  20th century.www.unspeakablywonderful.comScreenwriters - Neil Fleming & MatthewLockyerNeil Fleming is a British playwright, screen-writer, and children’s fiction writer. He is the founder of UKtheaterproduction company Hydrocracker,http://www.hydrocracker.co.uk/chosen for the Guardian's 2007 ""Pick of the Year""Before becoming a full-time writer in 2002, he spent 17 years as an award-winning journalist,covering war,famine, wildlife, politics and business in Africa, the Middle East and Europe.  He is a steering committeemember of The Fence, the international network of theatre-makers. Much of Matthew Lockyer’s thirty-year career in medicine has involved the care of diabetic patients. Many of them depend for their lives on insulin, but very few would recognise the names of Banting and Best, let alone Macleod and Collip. It has always seemed strange to Matthew that the most dramatic of all the many stories of medical science remains one of the least known. He has cherished the ambition of dramatising the story for many years. Although he has always written, for science journals and for pleasure, it took the scriptwriting experience and talent of his friend Neil Fleming to breathe life into the dysfunctional quartet who worked through the baking Toronto summer of 1920 in search of a lifesaving cure. The stories of the researchers and patients who first received insulin are so full of dramatic incident that compressing the events into a screenplay was an exacting challenge. They wanted the finished script to work on several levels; to engage the audience with the medical puzzle, to explain clearly the scientific debate and the experimental science, to highlight the ethical concerns of vivisection, but most of all to tell the moving human stories of courage and determination.Producer & Director - Alex TweddleAlex is a producer and director at Angry Man Pictures he has been making films for over 20 years.

One of the main purposes of our funding request is to pay the fees of our international casting director. Once we have engaged our casting director we can then send the script to our preferred actors.  And once we have letters of intent from our actors we can then return to our potential backers with a credible cast, to secure full funding for the film. Without a credible cast we are likely to be seen as a risky investment for financiers – unfortunately, that’s the reality of movie-making today.Our casting director has worked on numerous international movies over the years and cast many Warner Brothers (US) films, working with directors such as Tony Scott, Al Pacino, Scott Hicks, Tim Roth, Bill Forsyth, John Landis, John Carpenter, Dan Aykroyd, Joel Schumacher and Peter Greenaway.We will also hold remote and face-to-face castings in the UK and Canada for the part of Elizabeth Hughes – the girl whose life was saved in 1922 by insulin, and whose words gave us the movie title. We want Elizabeth to be played by an unknown, because having a fresh face on the screen will add an additional element of excitement to the production.We are confident with such a well-established casting director and a fascinating, powerful and important script we will get the cast we want to make this film.2.	Preparation of the production package (production schedule, legal contracts, scheduling, artwork etc.) Preparation of the financial plan (including detailed budget, strategy etc.). Preparation of a marketing and distribution strategy.3.	Engaging our Executive Producer: he has dealt with numerous independent film-funders and some of the leading distribution companies on multi-million dollar productions.  He will advise on and present our film package to leading distributors.  This coupled with strong creative elements, an international cast, and a unique story that grips the audience throughout, we are confident that we will obtain an international contract with a reputable distributor and financiers.Matthew Lockyer writes:I can’t remember a time when I didn’t want to make a film about the discovery of insulin. It has been in my mind’s eye most of my working life. Indeed, I have been close to diabetes since school days, when my best friend developed the condition and astonished us by brandishing syringes, eating during lessons, and getting off sports.Neil Fleming writes:I’ve been fascinated by this story ever since Matthew first approached me to co-write it. “The Discovery of Insulin”, you say to yourself. “That sounds kind of dry” But it’s the opposite: it’s an astonishing parable about the human spirit, a story about rivalry and love which explores how we, as people, solve problems and learn to work together. It’s also a nail-biting human drama about a race against time: to find the elixir, the secret, that will save hundreds of thousands of lives.We would like to thank you for helping to progressing thisimportant andfascinatingfilm.For more information please visitwww.unspeakablywonderful.com","The risks and challenges that face this project are the ones that face any new creative team trying to gain a foothold in the feature film industry with a somewhat controversial script.Once we have the initial backing our team has the spread of expertise and track record, from the technical medical background, scriptwriting and the mechanics of filming to overcome a lot of the potential challenges to our project.We do not foresee particular risks with our project, but our film is about real people, and based on some of the definitive books about the events.

It aims to feature people who aren't heard of much or young ones in the design industry. It will talk to people who are taking risks to do what they're passionate about.The truth is, freelancing, starting your own company, or creating your own product can be terrifying. It's supposed to be. Things that are worth it are difficult to do and require a little bit of a gamble. These are the things we're passionate about and this magazine hopes to inspire anyone, no matter your age or follower count, to do what you love and love what you do.Confirmed interviews include: Janna Hagan, Vic Bell and Sam Soffes. Even though this is my brain child, I won't be working alone. I'm in talks with writers, designers, developers andentrepreneurs who will write great pieces for the magazine. Their response has been great!Why Me?I'm a Designer and I have a love for print. When I was in school, I loved the smell of ink and to this day the experience of having a book or magazine in my hands is one that I enjoy.I also know this industry well and have a passion for getting information out of amazing people. I host a podcast called The East Wing where that's all I do. It's been an amazing experience to get to know these people but, most of all, it's been great to see how people have reacted to the podcast and how it's helped them with their career. I hope the magazine can achieve something similar.To sum it up. I'm passionate about this project. I want it to succeed and I'mcommittedto creating a beautiful, educational and inspirational magazine. Thank you for reading this and I hope you'll consider backing the project.","Some of the risks include not having enough contributors. I have approximately 93 pages to fill and as much as people are excited about an idea at the beginning, sometimes unforeseen circumstances pop up. The other challenge is the printing and shipping. Choosing the appropriate method of distributing the publication will be an interesting decision and not one I take lightly. I want to do all I can so everyone receives their copy on time and in a pristine state. The other challenge is that this is the first time I ever design something of this magnitude. I'm accustomed to working on editorial frameworks for the web but, designing a magazine for print is a completely different challenge. The rules of typography, grids and more, are drastically different.",https://www.kickstarter.com/projects/timothybsmith/bokeh-private-independent-and-user-funded-photo-sh?ref=discovery_category_newest,timothybsmith/bokeh-private-independent-and-user-funded-photo-sh,"Howdy! My name is Tim Smith, and I'm building Bokeh. Bokeh will be a social network to share photos with friends and family privately.Social networks have been a fantastic tool to share the moments of our life and keep in touch with family and friends who live far away, but they've also let us down. Most social networks mine our data to sell us eerily accurate advertisements; these ads are so precise, some are convinced their phone is listening to them. Algorithms are used to try and guess what you want to see instead of showing you everything in chronological order. And as countless news stories have reported on, these networks have inconsistent, poorly implemented, and at times arbitrary policies on harassment, racism, sexism, and other hate speech.And this is only the tip of the iceberg. We haven’t even gotten into how negligence on the part of these social networks has contributed to the spreading of misinformation, how their apps are designed and engineered to keep you on their platforms, or their focus on meaningless likes and follower counts.I want to do things differently.Bokeh will be ad-free, have a chronological timeline, and will be private by default. That means that all accounts will start off as private. Public accounts will have an RSS feed, will have the option to cross-post to other social networks, and will support custom domains. All accounts will have an indie web compatible export so you can self-host if you want to.People won’t be able to find you by name, but will instead need to know your username to find you. Bokeh will never display publicly who follows you or who you follow. If someone has requested to follow you 3 times and you’ve declined, the app will prompt you to block them. In other words, these are your pictures and I want you to have precise control over who sees them.Being on a social network comes at a cost. That cost can either be foggy and opaque, or transparent and straightforward. Most of us don't know the data these companies have about us, nor who they share that data with.In contrast, Bokeh will never share or sell user data to advertisers because our business model depends on creating and keeping customer trust. We don't answer to advertisers or venture capitalists. We answer to you.Bokeh will have individual and family accounts. Individual accounts will cost $3/month or $30/year, and family accounts will cost $5/month or $50/year. You’ll be able to add up to 5 people to a family account, including the account admin. By backing this project now, you’ll get a discount and allow me to pay for the initial development.I care about privacy, but I don’t think it’s enough to just say that. That belief is built into the core of how this business will make money.I believe that your data shouldn't be mined to sell you targeted ads, that your timeline should be chronological and not based on some algorithm, that tech CEOs shouldn't allow hate groups to flourish on their platforms, and that we need more social networks that are privacy-focused and ethically sustained.I hope you'll back this project if you agree.","Sure, building the technology to create this will be a risk and challenge, but I think the biggest challenge will be designing Bokeh for real life. As we've seen, most social networks were built without any care or attention to the real world consequences of technological decisions. Creating a platform that doesn't contribute to misinformation and is intolerant to harassment and hate speech, is of vital importance to me. I will make sure to have a diverse group of people test the app so that many different perspectives are taken into account as we design and build.I don't have a large audience, so there's also the possibility that this project doesn't meet its funding goal and I'm not able to make Bokeh a reality. Unfortunately, I don't have the development skill to create Bokeh by myself which is why I'm using Kickstarter to raise funds."

THAT'S 61% LESS MONEY...DOES THAT MEAN THIS ANIMATION IS GOING TO BE 61% AS GOOD AS TH-Okay, okay, yes. Yes. I have relaunched the project for less money. In this section I will show you exactly how you get the same quality of animation for less. (The very short answer: it will take slightly more time.) The longer answer:The original budget was as follows:In short, I am removing the animation budget altogether. How is an animation produced with no animation budget, you ask? The $7,000 that would have gone to pay an animator to work full time 60+ hours a week for 2 to 3 months to get the lionshare of the drawings done is now gone. I will now draw every single frame myself, in addition to overseeing and keyframing. I will draw 20 frames everyday, 6 days a week for one year. This is only 9 months slower than the original timeline, and for a 5 to 6 minute animation with nearly 6 to 8 thousand drawings it's a pretty fast turnaround. I hope you agree! New Budget:-NOTE: Any amount over 11,000 collected will go to enhance the post-production facilities. This means more special effects, better sound and compositing, and more live musicians on the score!-","There are unknowns and fears involved in anything worth doing.

This team of abnormal sages is known throughoutand beyondtime and space asDark Energy Discoveries.We want to share with you an amazing album of music that you've never heard before and give it to you for only $1! But that's not all—you decide how long the album is! For every $500 pledged after the initial goal of $2,000, one song will be added to the album (three songs are already done and the first $2,000 goes towards the next four songs to make—at minimum—a 7-track album). This is a project with unlimited stretch-goal potential—the amount ofcontent each $1 pledge receives is directly based on the amount of backing (it could be a 7-track album or it could be a 30-track odyssey)!Also, you get the music IMMEDIATELY when it is completed. Rather than having to wait for the full album to be done to receive anything (however large it ends up being), you will be sent tracks as they are finished.To get you started, and to give you something you will hopefully want more of, here isThe Cosmic Light EP for free.Our music is electronic with heavy influences of synthpop/futurepop, dark-electro, and melodic death metal, residing somewhere in the realms of EBM—massive synth chords, haunting melodies, riveting bass, and chilling, powerful choruses. You may have your own opinion about the genre; we just hope you will give it a listen and give it your support if you like it.We teamed up with artist John Santagada (RadioactiveUppercut) to bring you a world of exceptional dark fantasy to match the theme and vision of our music. Every pledge will receive the album cover artwork, a unique piece of artwork for each track, and the portraits of the DED members!Each $500 increment will go to cover the following for each track:Meet Dark Energy Discoveries (DED):Thank you for joining us on our journey into the dark unknown.-SharkchildDED on Facebook","Music is a creative process and, like all creative manifestations, it cannot be forced.

Our mission is to highlight the hard working farmers who grow the coffee and our commitment is to use only organic, sustainably produced coffee, milk, and other consumables.Building a roastery cafe is a very expensive undertaking for a farm based business, but we have raised $100,000 already and construction has begun! We just need a little more to get to the finish line...Why the name Hidden Fortress? Because our little farm is tucked away in a hidden canyon in the foothills above Pajaro Valley. Also, the name is a nod to a movie by Akira Kurosawa that we happen to love.Our primary sales outlet has been our farmer's market coffee booth, which is also solar powered. Our coffee business has grown steadily over 3 years and we have outgrown the 2 pound solar and propane powered coffee roasting machine we use. We have been planning & designing our new roastery cafe in the nearby town of Watsonville California since November 2015. Our location is next to a business park where many large local work places such as Granite Construction, Nordic Naturals, the community hospital, and Foxx Racing Shox are located. It is a central location with easy freeway access, ideal for drop in visitors and is a great launching point for us to get to the farmer's markets we do.The plans include the installation of 2 small roasters, and a full food prep kitchen area so we can make fresh lemonade and syrups for our coffee bar. There is so much space that we are looking at partnering with a few other local food artisans who can do light food prep in our facility in exchange for some rent money. We see such partnerships as so much more than just extra income. We see them as building blocks to developing a local healthy food community. We'll have extra retail space in the front cafe to retail locally produced snacks and lunch items.Another use of our new facility will be to invite local coffee enthusiasts to join us for weekly coffee tastings and monthly coffee roasting classes. We will also make our small commercial roasters available to rent by the hour to aspiring coffee roasters who have completed a training first. We will conduct training sessions on the commercial roasters as demand arises.Our location also has a 700 square foot office upstairs. We plan to turn this office into a small co-working space equipped with a conference room & private office available to rent by the hour or day, plus individual workstations. The building is already wired with fiber optic cable, so we will have excellent wifi.So far we have raised $100,000 through an early crowd fund, some micro loans, and an SBA loan. This has paid for our rent during planning, the permits & architectural work, most of our needed equipment, and a down payment to start construction. We have (finally!) received all of the required agency permits. Our contractor is ready to start building the week of July 11. We will need an additional $120,000 to complete the construction, and are hoping to raise at least 25% of that amount through this kickstarter!We have lined up some fantastic rewards for you, who through your support are making this dream possible. Two of our rewards feature a beautiful personalized hand thrown pottery mug. Our prototype is pictured: If you choose this reward, the pottery artisan Jasper Marino of The Santa Cruz Pottery Mafia will craft one with your name hand lettered on it!","We have already encountered so many hurdles on our way to building this roastery cafe. It has taken 8 months so far, but we have managed to push on despite higher than expected costs, hangups with the health permit process, and all the little daily challenges that a small business like ours has to meet. Owner Amelia has over 20 years of small business management experience, which she uses every day to find creative solutions to whatever problem rears up that day. Frankly, it would be unusual to not encounter any more challenges during this build-out. Hidden Fortress fully expects to have more problems to solve before the doors open. Perhaps the biggest one will be time management as the business rapidly grows, especially as opening day draws near. Fortunately Hidden Fortress already has 2 excellent people assets. Currently both work other jobs part time and help out at the farmer's market booth part time. Both are ready to come on board full time as soon as the budget exists to pay them. Taylor and Darrell have proven themselves to be experienced in coffee service, hard working, and loyal team members.

Now we have outgrown the 2 pound solar and propane powered coffee roasting machine we use.  We have been planning & designing our new roastery cafe in the nearby town of Watsonville California since November 2015. Our location is next to a business park where many large local work places such as Granite Construction, Nordic Naturals, the community hospital, and Foxx Racing Shox are located. It is a central location with easy freeway access, ideal for drop in visitors and is a great launching point for us to get to the farmer's markets we do. The plans include the installation of 2 small roasters, and a full food prep kitchen area so we can make fresh lemonade and syrups for our coffee bar. There is so much space that we are looking at partnering with a few other local food artisans who can do light food prep in our facility in exchange for some rent money. We see such partnerships as so much more than just extra income. We see them as building blocks to developing a local healthy food community. We'll have extra retail space in the front cafe to retail locally produced snacks and lunch items.Another use of our new facility will be to invite local coffee enthusiasts to join us for weekly coffee tastings and monthly coffee roasting classes. We will also make our small commercial roasters available to rent by the hour to aspiring coffee roasters who have completed a training first. We will conduct training sessions on the commercial roasters as demand arises.Our location also has a 700 square foot office upstairs. We plan to turn this office into a small co-working space equipped with a conference room & private office available to rent by the hour or day, plus individual workstations. The building is already wired with fiber optic cable, so we will have excellent wifi.We have lined up some fantastic rewards for you, who through your support are making this dream possible. Several of our rewards feature a beautiful personalized hand thrown pottery mug. Our prototype is pictured: If you choose this reward, the pottery artisan Jasper Marino of The Santa Cruz Pottery Mafia will craft one with your name hand lettered on it! These mugs are ONLY available through our Kickstarter campaign. We want our valued early backers to have a keepsake that truly shows our gratitude for supporting & believing in us!Need more reasons to support our cafe building project? Here are our top 10. Become a backer and we'll be sending you regular updates and adding details to the story of Hidden Fortress over the next 2 weeks!","We have already encountered so many hurdles on our way to building this roastery cafe. It has taken 8 months so far, but we have managed to push on despite higher than expected costs, hangups with the health permit process, and all the little daily challenges that a small business like ours has to meet. Owner Amelia has over 20 years of small business management experience, which she uses every day to find creative solutions to whatever problem rears up that day. Frankly, it would be unusual to not encounter any more challenges during this build-out. Hidden Fortress fully expects to have more problems to solve before the doors open. Perhaps the biggest one will be time management as the business rapidly grows, especially as opening day draws near. Fortunately Hidden Fortress already has 2 excellent people assets. Currently both work other jobs part time and help out at the farmer's market booth part time. Both are ready to come on board full time as soon as the budget exists to pay them. Taylor and Darrell have proven themselves to be experienced in coffee service, hard working, and loyal team members. They are very excited to join Hidden Fortress as full time employees, which will happen when the cafe is about to open."

It tells a story of a nation of people enslaved by an evil entity for thousands of years. What they don't know is that freedom is theirs to be taken. All they need to do is hear and respond to the call. The album was released and heard all over the world, and that was before youtube. But I did not make much money from it. I broke even.In 2006, I release another project titled ""Freedom"". It continued the story how this nation of people still marching to its death being enslaved. Many have heard of the album, but this project didn't do so well. I ended up filing bankruptcy two years after.Now it is 8 years later. The message is not about the nation of people. It is about me. I discovered a great lesson that to free others I must free myself. I went through a great deal to learn that lesson. Now I have a story to tell, so please help me.Thank you for reading this, and I hope you will consider in giving me a chance to tell my story.","The toughest thing in recording a project is other recording artists. You have thousands of recording artists out there who are doing the same thing and you have to set yourself apart. You must ask yourself, why would listeners want to listen to your CD and not someone else. To me there are two things: lyrics and recording quality.The lyrics has to be unique and other people could relate to. You want to make the listeners listen to a song and say, ""that's what I want to say, but I just don't know how to say it that way"" or ""that's what exactly what I want to say it to my friend, my lover, or my son"". When I listen to a song, that's what I am looking for. I have written over 50 songs and gone through 4 years of training of how to write songs. When I play my songs to people, they asked if I have a recording of it, and unfortunately I have to tell them that I don't - opportunity missed.Secondly, quality is important in recording. You cannot dumb down listeners. The normal person can tell if you recorded with a $200 mic or a $20,000 mic. With nearly 15 years in the music business, I know some of the top musicians in the local area and have recorded with some of the top musicians in Nashville. In my first album, my guitarist who recorded for me have gone on to tour with Michael W. Smith, and then in my second album, my guitarist there is one of the top guitarist in Nashville who at the time was touring with Faith Hill. Aside from this, my producer is one of the top producer in town who have produced artists that now have become well known national artists.I have the people and the know how, but I just need the fund. Please help me.

Music Changing Lives Ministry is about helping Hmong artistes make an impact in the world.Hmong people are from regions of Southeast Asia. During the Vietnam War, US recruited the Hmong to fight the communist regime invading Laos. In 1975, when the US pulled out, thousands of Hmong refugees fled to Thailand seeking political asylum. Many resettled in the US since late 1970s.Although they became Christian in 1950s,Hmong Christian music were all hymnals translated by missionaries. Thirty years later, Hmong discovered different ways to express their faith throughwriting and recording their own music.Music Changing Lives Ministry created a model to help Hmong Christian artistes grow their ministry with meaningful messages and quality recorded music.The amount may seems a lot, but strength is in numbers. The possibility depends on how many people believe in the dream and not how much is the project.Here's how the money will be used:If more money are received then requested, we will be able to support more artistes. Everything is in place, all we need is your support to get started.","First of all, I think the biggest challenge for any recording artist will always be finding the right producer and connecting to the right musicians, the right studio, and the right sound engineer. But this step is in placed and ready to go.Next, building a fan base will always be a challenge after finishing the recording process. But this too was already established with 15 plus years of performing, promoting concerts, training, and being a singer/songwriter.Finally, the biggest challenge of all will always be funding to carry out the plan. This is where our backers come in. You will not be charged unless our goal is met, so please help us to make this project a reality.Thank you for supporting Music Changing Lives Ministry.

https://www.kickstarter.com/projects/priarobotics/hedgehog-educational-robotics-controller?ref=discovery_category_newest,priarobotics/hedgehog-educational-robotics-controller,"Our vision is to prepare and motivate next generations of researchers, engineers, and scientists using robotics.- Dr. Gottfried Koppensteiner, COO of PRIAWe developed Hedgehog to be simple, flexible and affordable. The Hedgehog Educational Robotics Controller is the centerpiece of this platform, that you combine with your smartphone or computer. Its simplicity makes it suitable for beginners, and Hedgehog is powerful enough to grow with your needs.We are the Practical Robotics Institute Austria (PRIA) located in Vienna, Austria. We are an independent non-profit organization with the aim to promote scientific and technical excellence in schools. To do so, we use robotics in education and various research projects, where we involve students with exciting scientific and engineering topics.Most robotics controllers on the market are „black boxes“: You can't see what's inside, and how the thing works. That's okay for beginners, but if you hit a limit, there's not much you can do. Hedgehog is not like that: from case to software, the controller is open for you to explore and tinker with. Another key differentiator to other robotics platforms is the closely integrated debugging functionality: from within the Hedgehog app, you are able to manually pause the execution of your program, set breakpoints and take a look at current variable values. Whether you want a controller that just works, or customize every last part, whether you’re a beginner or a pro: Hedgehog is for you! If you have a smartphone, you are in good company. Most people today have smartphones, so why not use them for new exciting stuff! We’ve set ourselves the goal to provide an intuitive and handy user experience for the Hedgehog Controller. Since robots tend to move a lot, we decided for a remote user interface – an app on the smartphone or similar devices – instead of an integrated display.Smartphones provide a rich user interface via touch screen, internet access as well as a variety of built-in sensors that can even be used as part of the robot or for remote controlling it. All these features open up a wide area of applications in and beyond education. These benefits make Hedgehog a worthwhile long term investment.Hardware ControllerSoftware ControllerMiscAt the moment, we have several working prototypes: We can deliver the controller as seen in the promotion video. The Hedgehog app will run on both Android and iOS platforms.","We have experience with getting the required parts and assembling them. The chosen delivery timeline is long enough to assemble several Hedgehog Controllers, but most likely it will be necessary to subcontract the assembly to a separate company. There are several companies in our vicinity that fit in price and quality for the possible quantities.The software to be delivered with each controller is mostly complete, and we expect to be finished mid-August, so even with major delays, this will be complete at shipping time.",https://www.kickstarter.com/projects/priarobotics/hedgehog-the-versatile-educational-robotics-contro?ref=discovery_category_newest,priarobotics/hedgehog-the-versatile-educational-robotics-contro,"Robots are great tools for learning – encompassing mechanics, electronics, programming and more. There are learning robots for many ages, but is there one for all ages? Hedgehog tries to come close to this ideal!Hedgehog is a robot controller: it connects to a robot’s motors, servos and sensors and executes the robot’s program. What makes Hedgehog stand out is its consistent white box approach, allowing you to tinker with every part.We worked hard to make Hedgehog what it is: simple enough for use by elementary schoolers, yet versatile enough to allow even university students to learn new things. The secret lies in our modular hardware and software design, together with open source technology throughout.Read on to see what we have to offer for beginners, or scroll down to ""Plug & Play"" to learn about the specs and your options as an advanced user. Look at ""classroomready"" if you're a teacher looking for a tool for your classes– but do check out the other sections as well.We use the Blockly visual programming editor to allow kids to start their first programming experiences. The programming blocks still use text, so it is appropriate for elementary school and up. Blockly is an open source project developed by Google, with great usability and reliability– a Must for software used by kids.Some day, you will grow out of visual programming, but don't worry– you can transition smoothly into textual programming. You can even convert your existing Blockly programs to Python code, and continue where you left off!We use a web-based integrated development environment (IDE): code on any operating system without installation, using your browser! The IDE's server runs on the controller itself, so an internet connection is not required. Connect to the controller either via WiFi or Ethernet.Apart from programming, the IDE lets youcontrol connected motors and servos, and displays analog and digital sensor values, making it easy to quickly test your creations.Hedgehog is compatible with standard RC servos and DC motors. Choose from a variety of sensors: from simple push buttons to infrared or sonar range sensors, different components can be connected to your robot. A standard webcam can be used to give your robot vision. And you can, of course, add any USB device that the Raspberry Pi supports!All software tools necessary for developing Hedgehog are installed on the controller: an STM32 microcontroller toolchain for the firmware, KiCAD for designing circuit boards, Python 3 and node.js for the server software, and of course Git for getting the sources and blueprints. Our standard case can be made with a laser cutter, just visit your closest fab lab and make your own. Hedgehog is a maker product through and through.You're an experienced programmer, and our beginner-friendly IDE is not enough for you? Or our default Raspbian install doesn't suit your taste? Or you're interested in microcontroller programming and need a simple development platform to get started? Or you don't like the programming languages we support? Or you're reading this in 2020 and the Raspberry Pi 3 has become an antiquity?There are so many things to do, and we try to support you in going your way. That's why we prioritized a modular design with clear interfaces, and easy access to all of Hedgehog's power:This gives you full control, but it also helps us extend Hedgehog's functionality. We use Hedgehog everyday in our workshops, so we want it to be the best controller it can be!Hedgehog is developed for the classroom as well: by default, controllers connect to an existing WiFi network, avoiding the overload that would result from a one-network-per-controller strategy. The large range of use cases makes Hedgehog a long-term investment: teach programming to elementary schoolers and undergrads, on the same device. Introduce computer vision and closed-loop control, with the same device. Explain closed-loop control and gear ratios, using Hedgehog.At the Practical Robotics Institute Austria, we already use Hedgehog in classes, workshops, robotics competitions and projects, and we know how well it works. It has already helped us engage dozens of kids with engineering subjects, and inspired multiple bachelor's and high school diploma thesis projects.We are certain that Hedgehog is the right tool for robotics beginners, enthusiasts and educators alike, but to get it out into the world, we need your help. With the money raised from this campaign, we want to fund a first larger production run. What you get in return is not just a product, but a product supported by a team that is invested in its success.Support us with a small amount to get listed as a supporter, or to get the Pac-Hog T-Shirt.Choose a ""Do it Yourself"" option if you have a Raspberry Pi and are not afraid of installing the Hedgehog SD card yourself. (We provide images, and instructions for starting with bare Raspbian)Choose the ""Hedgehog Controller"" or ""Hedgehog Robot Kit"" options to get a ready-to-run controller, fully assembled and installed. The robot kit includes all parts for building a driving robot.Choose between a one-day afternoon session for anyone, and a one-week robotics course for teenagers, both in August 2017 in Vienna, Austria. Workshops are held in German!Feel the satisfaction of making a big difference. Our sponsor packages include a Hedgehog controller and a t-shirt, plus the visibility you'd expect, on our website and in the Hedgehog IDE.Custom color and engraving for your controller's case are included (colors according to supplier availability). The Gold Sponsor reward also includes a robot kit.","Hardware revision:We are currently working on a new version of the Hedgehog shield that will make the controller even smaller. This hardware needs to be tested of course, but even if anything does not work out, the current version is ready to use; all the features we present on this page are ready.Certification:To sell Hedgehog as a ""ready for connection"" product, it needs to undergo certification for electromagnetic interference. We are already in contact with local certification authorities, but we also have a strategy for dealing with prohibitive delays: as certification is only required for ""ready for connection"" products, selling the controller as a kit for assembly will allows us to hold our timeline. This would affect the ""Hedgehog Controller"" and ""Hedgehog Robot Kit"" rewards.Software development:As with the hardware, we're always trying to improve our product, so chances are, you will get even more features than we advertised here. The only feature on this page that still needs work is the camera, and there is no reason why it shouldn't be ready on time. Still, if anything should happen, we will add support with a software update.Supply Chain:We have experience with handling the supply chain for electronics products, but this will be our largest order yet. Problems in acquiring certain components could lead to delays, but our timeline should allow for such occurrences."
https://www.kickstarter.com/projects/theworldofthought/the-real-kanji-world-learn-japanese-kanji-faster-a?ref=discovery_category_newest,theworldofthought/the-real-kanji-world-learn-japanese-kanji-faster-a,"The Real Kanji world is a book intended for all those students of Japanese who want to learn the 2136 Chinese characters necessary to have literacy in the Japanese language in a logical, systematic, concise and, why not, also entertaining way.Every Japanese language student eventually faces the time when he or she has to start learning kanji (Chinese characters used in Japan). Kanji is everywhere and unless you want to wander about without being able to read a simple text, you got to learn them. However, learning kanji is not an easy task, and many different approaches have been attempted, from root memorization up to creative mnemonics.In my own experience as a student of Japanese I tried myself to deal with those interesting characters called kanji in several ways. Using flashcards, not using flashcards and focusing only on vocabulary, writing the kanji down relentlessly… The problem with all those methods is that they require a lot of time and effort in order to just attempt to approach the seemingly unfathomable horizon set by the 2136 characters determined by the Japanese ministry of education to be indispensable for literacy. But the worst part was not to be clueless about which path to follow, but the very feeling of knowing that there was something missing that I could or could have taken advantage of.To this point, it is common knowledge among most scholars and many students that Chinese characters share a set of components that put each one of them in phonetic and semantic relation to the others. But many of those scholars, teachers and students do not know how those relationships actually work and as a result they overlook their usefulness. In summary, each component bears a meaning and is the evolution of an original pictographic depiction of a concept. Thanks to that one can learn groups of interrelated characters looking back to the original pictographic etymology. In this sense, by actually understanding the real composition of each kanji and the connection they have among each other, the student will be able to retain naturally the forms and meanings of the characters.The truth is that there are some kanji books out there that understand the concept of components and try to draw on them, however I consider that most of those attempts are quite unorganized. In some occasions, these books encourage the student to make up their own associations or provided some folk etymologies. This is a fine approach but I have found that, over time, those associations and stories tend to crumble, since they are not based on a solid, actual background. On other occasions kanjis are not arranged by order of actual frequency or, worse, they are not grouped into similar components, therefore they fail to acknowledge the advantage of learning in groups rather than randomly.The main purpose of the book that I am introducing here is to offer an innovative ultimate solution to make possible the learning of the 2136 kanji needed for Japanese literacy at once in a smooth and effective way, so to say, faster and better than you would do without it.Although the system and concepts used throughout the book is comprehensive and well thought, the student of Kanji will find the book a tool that will make his learning process quite easy and straightforward.The best way to demonstrate that in a way you can see it at a glance is through an example. Let’s suppose you are about to learn the kanji 花 (flower).First you would have learnt in the chapter 0 the 145 Radicals and identify in that character three of them.Then you learn that the combination of 亻 (人) and 匕 forms a new phono-semantic component:After that, you put together that component with the remaining radical and you get the new kanji:Now you’ve learnt forever the main meanings and sounds of 人, 化 and 花. This is a summarized version of the process you will go through with the Real Kanji World.We see that with each new kanji you are offered to learn not only about their core meanings and readings but also about to learn also about its formation, vocabulary and relation to other similar kanji. With the arrangement provided in The Real Kanji World you will be able to learn kanji faster and better than ever.The Real Kanji world is a book intended for all those students of Japanese that want to learn the 2136 Chinese characters needed for Japanese literacy in a logical, systematic, concise and, why not, also entertaining way. The method of The Real Kanji World is based on two main concepts: comprehension and association.With the book you will first learn 145 radicals that are paramount for recognizing and making semantic and phonetic associations between different kanji. Then you will learn each of the more than 2000 kanji in order of difficulty in regards to the Japanese school system, as well as in groups of characters sharing semantic and phonetic components divided into three themes: The human world, the Natural World and the Man-made World. These divisions and categorizations incite association in a remarkable way. Each entry for a kanji, in turn, has an explanation based on real etymologies to facilitate the comprehension that, at the end of the day, will make you perceive the kanji system as a logical and cohesive.Another concept that The Real Kanji World takes advantage of is that of the formative classification. That is, each character can belong to a different class of kanji in regard to its formation. The student, if guided in a reliable manner (as it is done by The Real Kanji World), can take advantage of these classifications to determine what kind of relationship one character has with the other.As for kanji classes, first we have the already mentioned radicals, then the semantic components, the phono-semantic components and finally the compound characters.In each chapter (or level of difficulty) you are presented a set of characters that derive from a semantic or phono semantic component, so you can learn characters in groups that share a logic relation.In the excerpt of the Chapter 1 shown above we can see the character classified as a Phono-semantic Component with the sound KOU and meaning of e exchanging. The following glyph, 効, is a Compound Character composed by 交 and the Radical 力. The last character, 校 is a compound of 交 and the radical 木.That is the basic system of relationships presented throughout the book.The learning system based on semantic components and original etymologies is not arbitrary. It is a system found after years of searching through thousands of characters studied with depth. After many years of testing various systems and trial-and error, I realized that the path to follow was real etymologies and logical associations between characters, since they are of immeasurable value on acquirement and memorization of kanji.The idea of making The Real Kanji world, thus, came to be as the culmination of years of self-study and research. Unsatisfied with the existing kanji learning methods, I gradually set up my own system based on relationships between kanji taken upon legitimate etymologies researched on several databases that have been made public on the web.Over time, however, I wanted to put all these collected knowledge into a good use not only beneficial for me but for any kanji student. That is how I came with the idea of putting together a system that teaches all the 2136 joyo kanji in a nutshell.Creating such a book requires a lot of time and dedication, but putting it into physical existence also requires capital. In order to complete the book in a polished and satisfactory manner I have no choice but to devote myself to it full time for a short space of time, but to make the book available for any enthusiastic Japanese student or researcher I need to spend a significant money to cover associated printing costs. and spend significant money. That is why I resort to Kickstarter and gentle contributors to make The Real Kanji World possible.","The product is almost finished and I have done enough research to make sure that the future printing process will be  nice and smooth.I will communicate regularly with the backers and make updates about the production, printing and shipping processes, so everybody can be aware of how this book becomes reality.",https://www.kickstarter.com/projects/theworldofthought/the-world-of-kanji?ref=discovery_category_newest,theworldofthought/the-world-of-kanji,"Chinese characters come to life in The World of KanjiA book that offers a logical, well-founded and entertaining solution to the problem of learning a large number of kanji.The World of Kanji is perfect for the new student of Japanese, it is great for the intermediate student who still struggles with kanji, and it's also excellentfor anyone who's curious about the origin of Chinese characters and the correlations that exist between them. You can enjoy TWOK even without being a student of Japanese!Acknowledging the problem of learning kanji and bringing a solutionHOW DID PEOPLE LEARN TO READ AND WRITE KANJI BEFORE THE WORLD OF KANJI?Traditional methods:Modern mnemonic systems:THE INNOVATIONS OF THE WORLD OF KANJIThe learning system of The World of Kanji is developed from the original etymological composition of the Chinese characters and in a cohesive and structured presentation of them.ETYMOLOGICAL COMPOSITION OF CHINESE CHARACTERSThe etymological composition of Chinese characters can be used to our benefit in order to memorize kanji faster and more efficiently, since thetotality of them can be reduced to a fix set of components.The primitive characters or components act as the base of The World of Kanji.If you know the components it's easy to deduceand retain the meaning and composition of each new kanji you encounter!CATEGORIZATION OF KANJI COMPONENTSMake a progressive and cohesive journey through the different ""realms"" of The World of Kanji.The core part of this book, which explains the primitive elements that form each one of the characters within the jōyō kanji list, is divided into four sections or ""realms"" grouped in different topics. This division greatly facilitates the cohesion of the whole system and, therefore, the natural and logical understanding of the constituent elements. In addition, the student will learn each character in a way that is not only associative but also progressive, that is, each new character encountered will be a simple or compound character formed by previously studied elements.	The student of kanji, thanks to this book, will be able to acquire a new representative and symbolic consciousness of the world around him, and he will be able to see in each new Chinese character he finds a scene that speaks directly to his consciousness. Once the reader finishes this book he will have acquired a new worldview of his own, and he will be able to maintain an unforeseen conceptual dialogue with the wonderful logographic system used within the Japanese writing. Having undertaken the journey through each “realm”, made up by interesting graphic icons, evocative of scenes of a time and culture that are distant but relatable at the same time, one will have acquired a vision and a deep and permanent understanding about the scope of the visual language used within the Japanese written language. Once the adventure of The World of Kanji is over, the Chinese characters will go from being a threat or an obstacle to being the most intimate ally of the student of Japanese.Entries on each character are laid out in the following manner:You can take a feel of how the book works by looking at the pdf version of the first section of the book (""people"") clicking in the image below:Over 500 pages, 6x9 inches (standard version)PreambleIntroduction to kanjiHow to use this bookFirst, I decided to use Kickstarter because I think it's a great tool to attract a significant audience that may be interested in this book.Also, this website can reliably make the publication of the book a reality, because a book more than 500 pages long needs a big print run in order to be published without losing lots of money.I have to clarify that this ambitious and academic book is written by just one person, and the economic and social stimulus that Kickstarter can bring to the project will be a great incentive for completing a book that I think will be liked and will be useful to many people with an interest in Japanese language and Chinese characters.","The product is very well planned already and I have done enough research to make sure that the future printing process will be nice and smooth.I will communicate regularly with the backers and make updates about the production, printing and shipping processes, so everybody can be aware of when and how this book becomes reality."

Which is odd, because I don't live in Virginia, and I'm not running for any office of any sort, anywhere. For anything.Turns out, the Virginian Secretary of State Office has been handing out my email address as that of a person running for some office or other in an upcoming election.This has been the source of a small bit of extremely fun chaos, which I've chronicled on my blog, here. The basic summary is, I told one of these robo-call solicitors that I might indeed be interested in using his services in order to further my campaign for King of Westeros against Stannis Baratheon and the Mother of Dragons.This conversation went on for hours.And sure, that was a lot of fun, but now it's time to take it to the next step. I've decided to actually take him up on his offer. I want to have his company blast out more than 10,000 phone calls to actual Virginian voters with a recorded message asking them to support me in my bid for King of Westeros of Virginia. I plan to woo the voters with my hardline stance against wildlings and white walkers. Ever since the Purple Wedding, there's been a power vacuum in King's Landing, and I need to convince the people of Virginia that I am the right politician to lord over the Iron Throne.I do so hope I can count on your support.","The biggest challenge will be to compile 10,000 active Virginia phone numbers into a spreadsheet for the robo-callers. I'm confident I can find a company to help me with that. And if I can't, I'll go through the phone book and type them all out by hand. Because this is going to happen.",https://www.kickstarter.com/projects/claytonsaurus/help-us-build-reconstruction-coffee-roasters?ref=discovery_category_newest,claytonsaurus/help-us-build-reconstruction-coffee-roasters,"Hi! We're Erin and Clayton Smith, a husband-and-wife team that's building a community-focused coffee roasting cooperative right here in the heart of Missouri! Together with Clayton's parents, Randy and Denise, and his sister Emily, we're opening Reconstruction Coffee Roasters in the small, rural town of Villa Ridge, where the Smith family made its home for almost three decades.We're transforming an old 1917 church building into a family-owned coffee roastery and shared workspace. Once the roastery is up and running, we'll be roasting our own Reconstruction Coffee Roasters-brand coffee to be sold at our location, on our website, and at farmers markets around Missouri, and we'll also make our green coffee beans and equipment available to others in our community; individuals who want to roast their own morning coffee, cafes that want to feature proprietary small-batch roasts, and entrepreneurs looking to build a coffee business will all be welcome at Reconstruction when we're up and running.Every dollar you give will help us create a complete and comfortable roasting space—and we have a ton of amazing exclusive perks to reward you for your help!In addition to rehabbing the building, we'll also be landscaping the surrounding rural space with a relaxing patio, and a garden where we'll grow local wildflowers to help encourage the natural ecosystem. Since the location isn't zoned for a cafe, the roastery won't include a full coffee shop, but our customers will be welcome to spend time at the facility, lounge on the patio, learn about coffee roasting, and enjoy a complimentary cup of coffee when they visit.Working in close collaboration with the folks at Cafe Imports, we'll be purchasing the highest quality green coffee beans from independent and small-crop farmers around the world, sourced and purchased both ethically and sustainably. We'll be a reliable, responsible partner in the global coffee market, helping coffee farmers earn living wages regardless of where the market sets the price.Then we'll roast that coffee to perfection with our own, custom-built Mill City roaster. We'll also be working closely with the trainers at Mill City, the Specialty Coffee Association, and the Coffee Roasters Guild to ensure that we're keeping current on the latest developments in the coffee trade.But the building needs a lot of work before we can purchase the roaster and move it into the space. That's why we need your help! We've put together a ton of great rewards, and we'll keep you updated on our progress as we move forward. You can also follow us on Facebook and Instagram for additional updates.We've got a long way to go, and we would be so grateful for your support. We hope you'll consider pitching in and being a foundational member of the Reconstruction family! ","The building we're rehabbing for this project is old, and hasn't been too well taken care of. There's a chance we might end up having to adjust our rehab plan as we move forward, but we've built our timeline and our construction strategy to be adaptable. Because we own the building and the land it sits on, we're able to adjust our plan and move forward as needed.Our projected reward fulfillment months are based in part on the timely construction and shipping of our roaster, but a delay on that front, or in the green coffee market, may delay our rewards. We don't anticipate a delay, and we expect any unforeseen issues would allow us to catch up after a few months at the absolute maximum."

My name is Cat Harris-White and I create, sing, perform and produce under the name SassyBlack. You may know my work from my (now defunct) group THEESatisfaction or my appearances on Black Up & Lese Majestyby Shabazz Palaces. Last year I released my first solo album and 5th release No More Weak Dates to a fantastically warm reception.Since then so much has happened including my first solo tour to Europe last fall, speaking at SXSW & Pop Kultur Berlin, performing at several festivals (Capitol Hill Block Party, Treefort Music Fest, Linecheck Music Festival (Milan), Barcelona Acciò Musical (Barcelona), Daytrotter Fest etc.) as well as my music being featured on the Adult Swim compilation LUXE.On June 23rd, I released my sophomore album ""New Black Swing"" independently. It's my 7th release in the past 3 years, can you believe it?! Like all my projects, this album was written, produced and performed by me. And so far this has been my most successful record yet gaining praise not only from major publications like i-d, NYLON & the FADER, but also from YOU, my family, friends & supporters!OH COOL, WHAT'S GOOD SASSY? WHAT'S THIS ALL ABOUT?As I mentioned, people have responded so well to New Black Swing that it is definitely time for a full fledge North American & European tour! I manage & book myself & have been in contact with promoters and venues all over the world preparing routing while strategizing how I can share my music through live performances. So far I have some great dates lined up including Seattle, Portland, Brooklyn, LA, London, Salt Lake City, Zürich and more to be announced.WHY ARE YOU DOING THIS KICKSTARTER?I rarely ask for help. This is something that I have been trying to work through. As a Black Queer woman, society and my own communities expect me to be strong while emotional and able to handle and figure out anything. While parts of that are true, there is no shame in asking for help and finding better ways to accomplish things.With that said, this is what I like to call a ""vulnerability moment"". It's an opportunity for me to share myself in a different way and admit that I don't have all the answers and that I do in fact need help at times. Going from being a DIY musician to a signed artist back to a DIY musician is quite the journey and I wouldn't change a thing! However I have learned a lot over this time and asking for help is an opportunity to better myself and learn more about my community and where that support resides. All in all I am very excited to get to know my supporters better and to continue to learn and share knowledge as a result.WHAT'S THE PLAN MA'AM?The tour kicks off August 31stand goes until mid November. Promoters and venues have been contacted and so far 15 dates have been confirmed with more confirming every day!- All Service Incentives will be scheduled in September and set in motion beginning in November when I return from tour.- Merchandise Delivery has a few more steps involved which is below:WHERE DOES THE MONEY GO?My expenses consist of travel by air or land or water (ferry), tour publicity & radio promotions, music videos, accommodations (need somewhere to sleep and practice!) & of course food (need to eat!). These are all things that are necessary to have a successful tour.WHY IS THIS IMPORTANT TO YOU SASS?It’s important to love yourself and try new things! My solo career is still a new thing for me and it is scary everyday, but that’s why I love it. I push myself further and learn more about myself and how I can help others and that is one of the best feelings in the world. Outside of making music!","My biggest risks are financial. My listeners have been requesting that I make my way to their city to perform live. With the support of you, radio & print publicists, I can make this a reality. I have allotted myself cushion in terms of the time it takes to get things done. If for for some reason the timeline changes I will notify you. The album is done. I have researched merchandise and publicity firms. I have directors, designers, promoters, actors and videographers ready to create magic. There will always be fear in my line of creativity, but I feel that nerves are healthy and proof that we are alive. It is also more important to me to try rather to give up before I give myself a chance to start.",https://www.kickstarter.com/projects/sassyblack/sassyblacks-third-album-ancient-mahogany-gold?ref=discovery_category_newest,sassyblack/sassyblacks-third-album-ancient-mahogany-gold,"Good day beautiful Kickstarter people! My name is SassyBlack and I am a multi-dimensional musician. I have been studying and honing in on my musical skills for over 15 years, having toured nationally and internationally for the last 8. You may know me from my work as half of THEESatisfaction or my appearances on the first two Shabazz Palaces albums released on Sub Pop Records. Since starting my solo career as SassyBlack in 2014, I have released 12 projects (2 albums, 4 EPs and several beat tapes) all of which I wrote, produced and performed and available here.I am very excited to share my new work on my third album, Ancient Mahogany Gold. This record dissects my journey into my current state of self as well as how I’m moving in the world. It deals with complex and relatable experiences through my lens as a Black Queer woman. I will be producing, writing, singing, rapping, and speaking on all the songs. I'll be taking a big step in a new direction by having special guest appearances from several talented instrumentalists. These artists will present their take on my production and experience, bringing another perspective to the story.WHAT'S THE PLAN MA'AM? WHERE DOES THE MONEY GO?In an effort to demystify the successful musician and what that looks like, I am interested in redefining the relationship between artists and fans, making it so you can directly support me and my efforts without the middle person. I am campaigning to raise $12,000 to record, mix, master and promote this album. We know the importance of music, art and storytelling in all cultures. It is also widely understood that these stories can be erased from history.All funds go towards the production & release of my album:Grand Total = $12,000REWARDS! I like receiving things, what kind of goodies do you have?I am elated to share with you a few awesome rewards for your pledge to my campaign. There are fun musical themed goodie packs (named after some of my releases), buttons, tickets to one of my shows and of course a sweet digital download and signed CD for Ancient Mahogany Gold.","My biggest risk is not reaching my financial goal. Kickstarter is an all or nothing platform, so if I don’t reach $12,000, I will not receive any of the funds that have been pledged and may be unable to release my album.

https://www.kickstarter.com/projects/rumur/the-meadow-a-photo-book?ref=discovery_category_newest,rumur/the-meadow-a-photo-book,"I'm raising funds to print a book of photos shot in the meadow behind my house. Over the past 4 years I made thousands of images. The book will contain at least 50 of these,The project began at the request of a friend who wanted images for her mother, but quickly grew as I used the process as a kind of mindful meditation practice. Each day, I tried to notice things that I had not before and I paid attention to the rhythm and flow of the seasons.  I embraced the challenge of shooting and processing the images solely on my phone.The following images are ones that are part of a show that took place at the Brink Gallery in Missoula MT and at the North Carolina Botanical Gardens. You can choose as reward prints. In addition for a slightly higher fee I can get almost any other meadow image printed (most can be found here . Prints are made byWojtek Wojdynski. They are inkjet printed on archival paper and look fabulous. A show of this work (printed on canvas) will be up at the North Carolina Botanical Gardens in Chapel Hill for the duration of the Kickstarter. Here is a look at the show as well.","The images are shot, and a printer has been found. I have set a goal of 12,000 which will cover the cost of printing, shipping the books, and paying for a designer to help me lay it out.  If the project is funded it should take 4-6 months to print and ship the books. Prints will be shipped by the end of January.",https://www.kickstarter.com/projects/rumur/the-decline-of-mall-civilization-by-michael-galinsky?ref=discovery_category_newest,rumur/the-decline-of-mall-civilization-by-michael-galinsky,"In 2010, I borrowed a scanner from a friend to digitize some old negatives and I came across ancient images capturing life inside shopping malls, a consumer culture that had been decimated by the Internet. I put the images online and they went viral. So I kickstarted a book, ""Malls Across America"", and they went more viral. In a crazy twist of fate, that book ended up getting released by the publisher Steidl who printed the work that inspired those photos - books by William Eggleston and Robert Frank. Unfortunately, Steidl didn't print nearly enough of the books, so the Kickstarter backers of that project, ""Malls Across America"", were some of the few people who were able to get it.It has been out of print for 6 years now, and currently trades for upwards of $1000. At some point I want to re-publish that book, but for the time being it remains out of print and out of reach. At first I thought I would use some of the classic images in the new book, ""The Decline of Mall Civilization"", but I found hundreds of other powerful images that deserved to be seen so we decided to keep it completely separate. The two books have very different feels as well. ""Malls Across America"", which was designed by the incomparable Peter Miles, is all single images over double page spreads.This time we spent a lot of time and effort pairing the images into diptychs that play off of each other in interesting ways.We are incredibly excited to make ""Decline of Mall Civilization"" available. We hope you might consider pre-ordering it via this Kickstarter - don't miss out.In 1989, I was a sophomore at NYU when I took my first photo class, ""Color Printing"". My teacher was awesome and our first assignment was to watch the film ""River's Edge"". At the time, I was dating a girl who went to Stony Brook and I'd take the Long Island Railroad out to see her every other weekend. One weekend, shortly after I had started the class and had to find a subject for my class project, I happened to go to the Smith Haven Mall with her and immediately knew I'd found a place to shoot. I was a Religious Studies major who took a lot of anthropology and sociology courses, which helped me to think of the the mall in complex ways. I was especially interested in considering the mall as something of a privatized public square. While I focused on the people, I thought about the way that they interacted with each other and the space. The teacher loved the work and encouraged me to continue it that summer. So my friend Sebastian and I packed ourselves in his Corolla station wagon and we hit the road without any real plan at all.Our first stop was Columbus Ohio. We stayed with my aunt but we didn't find a mall. We then hightailed it to Detroit where we hit the jackpot with the Woodfield Mall. It's a beauty and there are probably a dozen in the book from that one. Next stop was Chicago- then South Dakota, and on and on. All in all, we hit about 15 malls. We got some great images but it wasn't really their time. By 1989,the ""Pictures Generation"" - with its focus on more constructed and deconstructed images - had pushed street photography out of the galleries. They were doubling down on big ideas and conceptual work. I went on to take a couple other photo classes, but turned my attention to making music and making films. I shot a lot of images, but my main outlets for them were fanzines and album covers.I moved on to making films. In 2010, I re-discovered these slides and the rest is history.Once you back the project you'll be able to see more of the images in the book via the updates. Below are the 10 images that will be available as artist proofs as part of the Kickstarter.","We have the book designed and ready to print, the printer picked out, schedule set, and a package shipper arranged to get the books out in a timely manner. If the Kickstarter is successful we'll have the money to print the books and have them back by November at the latest.  Backers outside the US will receive their books a bit later as shipping takes a while- but we will make every effort to do so efficiently.  We are exploring shipping cartons of book to Europe directly from the printing plant to streamline the process."

Emerging Toronto Artists)In 2017, Emerging Toronto Artists successfully funded and published the first ever, ETA TAROT deck. It was a wonderfully creative experience for all involved and also inspired many artists to learn more about tarot themselves, & many tarot readers to learn more about supporting local artists! :)Keep in mind, part of your pledge to this campaign, does help to support all 32 artists financially + gives them the opportunity to have their artwork shared and seen by people like you, from locations all around the world! (In 2017 with ETA Tarot, we reached over 200 people in nearly 40 countries!)...except there is no particular structures/card names associated with Oracle decks. There is so much room for creative interpretation in the artist design, as well as in the way you do readings with it! But since ETA Oracle is also a collaborative deck, we chose a theme for the artwork creations, to create more cohesion between the cards. With our chosen theme of ""The Crown ♛"", we hope to encourage a more semiological approach to navigate your subconscious by way of readings, as well as inspiring new perspectives with the guidance of our diverse interpretations of crown imagery & symbolism.Oracle readings are fun for everyone and easy to do! We will also be including 3 example spreads, like 'The Compass' + reading instructions in each deck, so anyone can use them! You can also choose to back the project, simply to admire all the beautiful artworks & artists - as your own mini gallery!Let's talk about crowns, because there is a lot going on in this theme! On a basic level, they are often known as being worn by royalty or someone in a position of authority or power. They come in many shapes and sizes, have been made with metals, jewels, flowers or even thorns. They have been worn with honour and with shame. So what impact does wearing a crown or seeing someone wearing a crown have on the way we process feelings about love, power, righteousness, honour, tradition, wealth, family or even death? And what happens to their significance if we are all wearing a crown? Is it the crown that makes us view the person differently, or does the person wearing it change the meaning of the crown? Is a crown more of a blessing or burden, freedom or prison? And upon reflection, what crowns have you worn, or are wearing in your life?What will these cards stir up from your subconscious, as you navigate through the compositions of their illustrations? The 56 artworks of this deck, have all been infused with unique perspective & creative energy, from one of our 32 diverse Toronto artists.In addition to the 56 illustrated cards, are 4 blank cards. We have included these to encourage you to create your own artworks and titles, one for each of the 4 elements. We hope these artworks inspire the artist within you!We have also included stretch goals, which represent the funding needed to print more decks and add on extra features to the deck specs, such as stock upgrades & gold gilding, bonus cards and more! We will keep our stretch goals updated as the campaign progresses.Please keep in mind, ETA ORACLE, is limited edition! We will not be printing additional runs in the future.

As an international backer, it will be your responsibility to find out what those rates are and factor them into expenses.","In 2017, ETA Tarot was successfully funded, published and rewards were all fulfilled. This time around, the production of ETA Oracle will be following a very similar process since there were minimal issues encountered in our first campaign!We received many great reviews about our first deck, and watched all the 'unboxing' videos posted online (thank you for them!). With that, we learned where there was room for improvement, so we will be addressing the suggestions from our previous backers.In efforts to make our campaign equally accessible to everyone in all parts of the world, will be shipping rewards to all overseas backers first, to allow for longer transit times, followed by USA & Canada backers...with the hope that everyone receives them at the same time! :) If you have any questions or can think of possible oversights in this campaign, please feel free to send me a message, would love to chat to you about any thoughts/questions/suggestions you may have!Thank you, Alexa."

https://www.kickstarter.com/projects/tommurray/smartihat-raspberry-pi-a-hat-mount?ref=discovery_category_newest,tommurray/smartihat-raspberry-pi-a-hat-mount,"My name is Tom Murray. I am an Industrial Designer who successfully funded the SmartiPi Raspberry Pi B+/2 case here on Kickstarter last year. I had a blast on that campaign and learned quite a bit.Since that campaign, the Raspberry Pi A+ and Raspberry Pi HATs have been introduced to the public. We listened to the needs of SmartiPI users and have combined them into a new product called the SmartiHat. The SmartiHat is a simple device that enables you to mount any Raspberry Pi A+ or Raspberry Pi HAT. The only constraint is the clearance underneath (5mm), which should not be a problem for most HATs.The images below are 3D printed prototypes. I have created numerous iterations of the design and 3D printed them to refine the design. Once the project is successfully funded, we can pay for injection molds to build the plastic parts.Snap and screw your HAT or A+ to the SmartiHat. Once it is secure, connect the included rainbow ribbon cable. The HAT is now secure and can be mounted or positioned with the screw holes or LEGO compatible bottom.The ribbon cable connector connects onto the HAT header between the snap features that hold the edges of the HAT. You can also buy longer ribbon cable to use with the connectors I will supply. The connectors and the cable will come unassembled to allow you to customize your ribbon cable length.You now have the ability to mount and position your HAT in all sorts of ways. The ribbon cable can also be routed under he SmartiHat as shown below. You will have to raise the SmartiHat with a few LEGO pieces. Connecting two SmartiHats together enables you to connect your A+ to a HAT.Then, build a great LEGO A+ enclosure around them.There are a few reward levels. We are also including the Pimoroni Unicorn HAT in some of the reward levels. The Unicorn HAT is one of the best HATs available.If you would like to create your own custom reward that is not shown, please contact me and I will tell you how much to pledge.You can use the LEGO compatible bottom of the SmartiHat to build a custom and secure A+ LEGO case or enclosure.The design below is just one example of a LEGO enclosure. Let your creative beast free. Because of the thickness of the LEGO bricks, the connectors are set back from the edge. You will have to leave openings for your size connectors, or you can partially cover up the ones you don't need. The micro USB, HDMI, and audio connectors on the side overhang the LEGO studs as shown in the picture below.The money raised will pay for the injection molds. It will also be used to pay to manufacture the parts molded from the injection molds. Finally, it will pay for the shipping. International shipping is very expensive and I have worked very hard to lower this cost as much as I can for the project.The rewards will ship via United States Postal Service First Class Mail. US backers should receive their reward in 3-5 days after shipment.To addresses outside of the U.S, it will take 10 -14 days after shipment.Most rewards will have a tracking number. The exception will be International backers receiving Reward #1 or #2.International tracking will work in most countries. For a full list click here.If the project is successful, we will immediately start building the injection molds with our Chinese vendor. This process is estimated to take 7 weeks. After that, the parts will be produced and shipped to me. Upon receipt of the product, I will package and prepare the shipments. I estimate delivery of rewards to be mid-September 2015.LEGO® is a registered trademark of the LEGO® Group and does not sponsor or endorse this site and contents. Raspberry Pi is a trademark of the Raspberry Pi Foundation. ","After the project is successful, we will build the injection molds. It is a rather simple design. Because of this, I do not suspect there too many issues arising. I encountered a few delays in my last Kickstarter campaign,  from which I have learned. I eliminated those risks in this project.",https://www.kickstarter.com/projects/tommurray/smartipi-touch-a-raspberry-pi-touch-stand?ref=discovery_category_newest,tommurray/smartipi-touch-a-raspberry-pi-touch-stand,"My name is Tom Murray. I am an Industrial Designer with 10 years of experience. To date, I have designed dozens of products and now I am looking to design my own. In October 2014 Isuccessfully funded the SmartiPi case for the Raspberry Pi. I enjoy working with the Pi community and want to continue to create innovative Raspberry Pi accessories.I am seeking $12,000 for the the SmartiPi Touch stand for the Official Raspberry Pi touch display(display not included). The design is complete and the final 3D printed prototypes are shown in the photos. Now, I need backers like you to pledge your support for the project.The SmartiPi touch is a case and stand for the Official Raspberry Pi touch display. (display not included) The display is secured into the case with four screws. A Raspberry Pi 2, B+ or A+ is then enclosed in the compartment on the back of the case. A simple door covers the the Pi when it is in the compartment. The ribbon cable that comes with the display connects into the Raspberry Pi DSI port. The stand has a pivot that allows you to adjust the angle of the screen.The included Raspberry Pi camera case adds tons of versatility and utility to the case. This is a very unique feature and I am excited to see what users do with the camera case.The case is compatible with the OfficialRaspberry Pi 7"" Touchscreen Display from the Raspberry Pi foundation. The display is not included, but it can be purchased at various locations throughout the globe starting at $60. I will compile a list of locations to buy the display in the FAQ at the bottom of the page.All you need is the display kit (pictured below), a Raspberry Pi A+, B+, or 2 and a SmartiPi Touch.Basic specsSome users like the idea of not having LEGO like studs on the case. You will be able to specify whether or not you want LEGO studs on the front or back of the case after the campaign. This will allow you to use the case for more professional uses. You will still have a small groove around the area, but no studs will be present.There are two rewards.Reward 1: SmartiPi Touch stand and Camera Case for the Raspberry Pi camera. Using taller HAT boards? Check out Reward 2.Reward 2: SmartiPi Touch stand, Camera Case for the Raspberry Pi camera AND the small footprint mounts. When mounted on the wall, the small footprint mounts can allow for additional clearance for HAT boards.The second reward includes the metal small footprint screw-in mounts. If you want the most flexibility in mounting the case, you should get Reward 2. The screw in mounts will allow you to mount the case to a wall while having HATS attached.The small footprint mounts below are actually GoPro compatible mounts, so you could replace them with any others that you can find.It's easy. You will just have to add up the reward totals and pledge that amount.For example , if you want 2 of ""Reward 1"" and 1 of ""Reward 2"". Just pledge $63 in either reward box. Don't worry. A survey will be sent out afterwards to confirm your pledge details.Shipping to locations outside the U.S.A is a flat $7 for any quantity up to 5. It will be added automatically (if applicable).Please contact me before pledging for more than 5.There are two methods to power the display using our case.The first method is using two jumper wires from the Raspberry PI GPIO. This method will conflict with HATS.The second method is to use amicro USB Y-cable ortwo micro USB cables. This method enables you to use HATS. Like the micro USB Y-cable shown below? You will will have the opportunity to add-on a Micro USB Y-cable after the campaign.The USB port on the display control board is not accessible with this design. So you will not be able to power the Pi with that method.A large portion of the money raised will go towards building the injection molds for the plastic parts. The balance of monies raised will be used to order the first round of parts from the manufacturer. The parts will be manufactured in China to reduce costs.As a full time product designer, I understand the design process. The only way to design great products is to prototype and iterate until you find something that works. The SmartiPi Touch is no exception. I believe I have found the right balance between form and function. I have been through many prototypes in my design process.I learned many lessons from my last successful Kickstarter.Building enough time into the schedule for unanticipated issues is important. I plan on shipping to the first round backers by the end of April 2016. Second round will ship May 2016.Music credit -Pure Oxygen (Part 1) (Mike BFort) / CC BY 4.0","The biggest risk in the project is ensuring the injection molder sticks to the timeline. During our first campaign I encountered small delays with my injection molder and thus I have built extra time into the schedule for anticipated delays. With one successful Kickstarter campaign under my belt, I fully understand the challenges of shipping to hundreds of backers."

Here's an approximate sketch at what our White/Blue colored MacBook Air 13"" cases will end up like:And here's a rendered image of what the MacBook Air case should look like after production:Laptop CompatibilityThe DropTech MacBook Air 13"" case currently in production will be compatible with 13"" MacBook Airs manufactured between 2013 and 2016.Let us guess: you've never dropped a computer before. Just because it's never happened to you before, doesn't mean it never will. Once you drop a MacBook, it's too late to try and protect it!You don't have to be a klutz or walking disaster to worry about your computer hitting the ground or getting scratched up from regular use. You could simply be:Whatever the situation, if you're a mobile, on-the-go Mac user you should protect your computer with a case! And, if you are a bit of a klutz, then you shouldn't need any further convincing to protect a computer that cost you $1000 or more.Case protection is incredibly important for keeping a device within warranty, and saves customers from spending a considerable amount of money on repair (or even full replacement cost!).You can settle for a hard shell case, or a sleeve of some kind, but those may only help protect from scratches and splashes. Zippered sleeves can get left behind. Clip-on shells pop-off off at the first hint of trouble and don't always offer adequate protection. Any decent drop can crack the screen or casing, or damage the insides (including the battery) - even with your MacBook covered in a hard shell or sleeve!FYI: Apple’s warranty DOES NOT cover damage caused by accidents! If they see any damage on the outside, it will most likely void your warranty and you will have to pay for repair or replacement.In fact, just a single 1-foot drop can dent the casing, as shown in a drop test video we took a year ago with two 11"" MacBook Airs; one protected by our SoftShell case and one completely unprotected:You might be surprised to know that Apple technicians and Geniuses have even used aDent Inspection Tool to check for visual damage that will help them determine if your MacBook can still be covered under their warranty. This was reported by Cult of Mac.Read more about the Dent Inspection Tool here!The DropTech case not only protects from scratches and splashes, but also from disastrous, damaging drops. It's our most rugged case design yet!The DropTech's unique design strategically employs a combination of rugged and high impact materials that have no problem protecting the edges and corners of the MacBook from normal use and repeated abuse. The bumpers in each corner are made from 10mm of silicone to maximize protection without added bulkiness:Beneath the protective bumpers is a clear Polycarbonate inner top shell. The shell is tough, and lightweight, allowing for lasting protection from general wear-and-tear. Plus, it's easy to clean!You bought an expensive Apple computer. Now show off a bit! The window on the top of the case allows instant recognition of the world's most recognizable brands. It's made of clear Polycarbonate and can be wiped down quickly to keep it clean and pristine.Plus, it's a great way to show off personalization decals. Or evenasset tags and school logos, if you are an educational institution that wants to protect MacBook deployments while easily managing your hardware inventory.No tools, no sweat. Just slip it into the case, and give it a simple snap and click! It will stay on when you open and close your MacBook, allow access to all ports, and provide proper ventilation so your MacBook doesn't overheat!A lot of time goes into designing a Gumdrop case! Turning a concept into a workable design requires a lot of CAD-work and a bit of sketchiness. Here are a couple of CAD drawings for the Blue/White colored MacBook Air 13"" case we are currently in production with:We want to make sure you know where we are in the process, each step of the way, as we bring the MacBook Air 13"" case to market!UPDATE - OCTOBER 11: We received our first White/Blue prototype for the MacBook Air 13"" case, and you can see this in the main image of our Kickstarter project. We are sending back our changes, including altering the blue color of the Polycarbonate shell, before moving forward with production.UPDATE - OCTOBER 5: We have already worked through the design process for the MacBook Air 13"" and are now messing around with a black colored tooled sample to work out any kinks with the manufacturing process. Gumdrop Cases has been around for about 7 years, and we've manufactured a bunch of cases for tablets, phones, Chromebooks and more. We haven't focused on the MacBook market much, but have dabbled in it a bit.With the excitement building from Apple's rumored announcement of new MacBooks, we think it's the right time to sell MacBook users on protecting one of the more expensive computers on the market. Investing in a new market can be tough when we have so many other case designs already in the hopper, so we are hoping a successful campaign on Kickstarter will help us continue to meet demand for new hardware hitting the market.We have already begun production on a special Blue/White color combination case for the MacBook Air 13"".Raising money on Kickstarter will help pay for the tooling, packaging, engineers, and the first order of 13"" MacBook Air cases. We have also added some pledge options to help fund the production of MacBook Pro 13"" cases for the new 2017 model, as soon as Apple makes the announcement. If the demand is there for our Blue/White color combination (if we go way over our funding goals!), we would love to even add some new colors in the future!We claim no ownership of trademark on products that are not made by Gumdrop Cases. All other trademarks are the property of their respective owners.All international duties, taxes, or clearing fees are not included in the prices. We highly recommend you consult your local tax authorities first. Different countries have different tax policies. If you must pay the duties/taxes, but you refuse to, your package will be abandoned. If that happens, we can neither ship another package nor issue a refund.","Gumdrop Cases promises to do its best to deliver the new DropTech MacBook cases on time and on spec. We've been in the case business a long time and have extensive experience in design and engineering, manufacturing, and keeping the overall customer experience the same for small or large orders. This means that we know how to take a case design project to market, including one funded through Kickstarter.We hope to have the current White/Blue colored MacBook Air 13"" cases completed within the next 30 days. So, yes, this is happening whether we are funded or not! We will keep you updated on the progress with the 2017 MacBook Pro 13"" cases as we wait for Apple's announcement.Help us meet our funding goals and reap the benefits of being an early adopter of our new MacBook cases.

A baseball hat...often the most worn and possibly overlooked item in our closet. Look around you. So many people are wearing baseball hats for the comfort, sun protection, and style.We decided a premium lightweight baseball hat is the perfect component to ensure that a large percentage of the population has protection and comfort at their fingertips.The Hide-a-Mask baseball hat gives anyone who likes to wear a hat an immediate way to deploy a very protective face mask when they walk into a crowded grocery market, busy workplace or drug store.Our mission is to keep people safe and protected in our current climate. Our hope is that Hide-a-Mask can get more people wearing masks and being comfortable doing it. We think statistically if we can encourage people who are forgetful or reluctant to actually wear a mask, we will be making a big impact in the world we all call home.Choose a Hat or Visor for $26( you will choose the color at the end of the campaign via survey)Or Choose a Premium Flag Hat for $29( you will choose which one at the end of the campaign via survey)The Hide-a-Mask hat comes in 5 colors; Jet Black, Midnight Navy, Wolf Grey, Snow Camo and Army Green. We now also have Visors and Premium flag hats.Once we have fulfilled all the rewards, we will be working with corporations and promotional marketing firms to allow branded Hide-a-Mask hats. What better way is there to spread your brand and let them know you care.Accessible - Easy to grab tab to pull into place. Lift up and it snaps back into the brim.Comfortable - We’ve spent a lot of design time making sure this mask is also comfortable to wear for long periods of time.Breathable - You'll be done dealing with face masks that lay flat against your face, our adjustable fit design creates space between your face and the mask.Maximum Face Coverage Our unique folding design assures full face protection without mask touching your mouth.Remove to Wash or Replace – The face mask easily clips in and out of the baseball hat so that you can hand wash and reuse. The Hide A Mask comes with one mask and extras will be available in the future.NOTE ON THE VIDEO: The Hat and masks you see in the Video are prototypes. The magnets in the hat will be concealed in the brim and you will not be able to see them.We have filed our international patent application and have sourced our factories. We have worked with our main factory for many years in a previous business. We have several prototypes in hand and we are on round four. We are adjusting the fit and tension. We will be starting production late June with product arriving for the early bird folks a few weeks after that.Want to protect your customers and employees? We will be offering customized branded hats (orders > 500 qty) starting late summer. Just drop us a note.",We are on our 5th prototype and we are getting this dialed in. One potential risk is unexpected import complications. We are not a medical grade mask so we should be able to import without FDA certification.
https://www.kickstarter.com/projects/chvz/ecodrive-upload-a-file-and-plant-a-tree?ref=discovery_category_newest,chvz/ecodrive-upload-a-file-and-plant-a-tree,"Deforestation has gone faster and faster and with it; all its consequences determining the destruction of many natural ecosystems; specifically of forests and their members such as the different species of flora and fauna; that depend on the type of ecosystem, as well as the human population.The biggest cause of deforestation is due to human activities such as: agriculture, commercial exploitation, population increase, construction of dams, overgrazing, among others. However, there are also natural causes such as forest fires in hot weather, sunamis, earthquakes and cyclones, which despite not being constant when they occur, destroy a large part of green areas.But we can end this problem, that's why we decided to create EcoDrive the only application for cloud storage that plants trees. Keep photos, stories, designs, drawings, recordings, videos, and more. Your first 3 GB of storage are free. You can quickly invite others to view, download, and collaborate on all the files you want. If something happens to your device, you don't have to worry about losing your files or photos they're in your EcoDrive.

https://www.kickstarter.com/projects/tvplustv/tv-plus-the-new-tv-service-for-switzerland?ref=discovery_category_newest,tvplustv/tv-plus-the-new-tv-service-for-switzerland,"AVIQ Systems, a Swiss technology company is developing a new television box and a TV service designed in Switzerland, for Switzerland. AVIQ will be marketing it to consumers under the name ""TV PLUS"".We all watch TV in some form. We also all want to watch what we want and we don't want to pay too much for the experience. In Switzerland, the TV market has been dominated by large providers who want you to buy everything from them - your TV subscription, your Internet access and your telephone service. Well, we plan to change that!TV PLUS is the first TV service in Switzerland that is independent of major providers. You can now cancel your expensive bundled subscription and choose TV PLUS together with a smaller independent Internet provider, saving up to 50% on cost. We do not lock you in for extended periods of time - TV PLUS is low risk because it can be canceled at any time. Also, you are free to use your TV PLUS box anywhere in Switzerland, and you can have up to 5 boxes in the same TV PLUS subscription for the same subscription price. Have one in the living room, one in the bedroom and one in your weekend home in the mountains - they will work anywhere in Switzerland. Please do take a look at all the benefits on the TV PLUS website for much more detail.But these are only the main advantages. Of course we provide a super cool TV box with all the mainstream TV channels, live pause, 7-day replay, cloud recording, Youtube, Netflix and some other goodies, as well as specialized language packages and a lot of On-Demand content.All this is possible because we use the Over the Top (OTT) technology which allows much more efficient video streaming and lower infrastructure costs compared to our competitors. You will hear us talk a lot about OTT in the videos here.We are ready to start shipping the first TV PLUS packages in in November 2018 as soon as we get funded and finish some specific software development needed for the TV PLUS service.You bet! We have been developing similar products and selling them to providers for several years now, so we have a lot of experience with this. Now we are turning the leaf and selling the TV box and the TV PLUS service directly to you, the consumer.You get a very small, noiseless TV Box with a low energy footprint and a simple to use remote control which can even be programmed to control your TV set, so you will only need one remote control for everything! Learn moreabout the TV box and its features.The TV PLUS subscription is how you access your >200 TV channels and all the live TV features. You pay a low monthly fee to use the TV features (or you don't if you pick the lifetime reward on your right...). Here is how it is all put together.People often ask us how easy it is to use the TV box. Well, it starts with the unboxing and the first steps to connect it. It is so easy to connect the TV PLUS Box! Even I can do it. Actually, in the video you see my hands doing the connecting ....In use, the TV PLUS box is very simple too. It comes to your home already activated, so you never have to enter any codes or passwords. The remote control is logically laid out and you get a dedicated button to go directly to your live TV, your recordings, the electronic program guide or Youtube. Although it has many features, it is easy to use!Take a look at this video which will take you through all the main features and also demonstrate the User Interface.Check out some more information about AVIQ and a few more samples of features in this next video.Note: You will notice us mentioning the ""TIPc7"" in the video. That is our generic name for the hardware used for the TV box, and for the TV PLUS project, we will simply rename it the ""TV PLUS Box"".In the videos above you see several TV boxes with logos other than TV PLUS - those are the predecessor boxes for the TV PLUS box. We are planning to use the same hardware, but what really distinguishes the TV PLUS box is its software.We will use the funding to finish developing the box software itself, do some software modifications needed for the TV PLUS service and to kick start the sales process including marketing and promotion. You can help us immensely by choosing one of the Early Bird Subscription rewards: you back our project with cash and we reward you by sending you a TV PLUS box and one of the free subscriptions so you can be on your way to watch TV for free!We invite you to do a deep dive on the TV PLUS websitein English or German for more information. We are happy to answer any questions and are looking forward to sharing this exciting journey with you.Thank you!","The TV PLUS product is comparatively risk-free on the technical side. The hardware for the TV PLUS box has been already produced under other brands and tested with thousands of users and the technical side of the TV service (TV streaming) has been in operation for some time now and is very reliable. We do not need approval or premarket review from an outside company or agency before we can distribute your rewards.Nevertheless, we see the following risks:- legislation changes: some features like 7-day replay are legal in Switzerland. If the legislation should change, some features may have to be discontinued.- cost of the TV distribution rights: in Switzerland the cost is affordable and supports a business model like ours. If the costs should go up, the prices of the monthly subscriptions may need to be increased.- competition: we face a decent amount of competition. Although we feel that we have an excellent unique selling point, the competitors might match our prices making it harder to compete.We will continue to update our product and are frequently issuing software updates with new features in order to stay competitive.",https://www.kickstarter.com/projects/tvplustv/tv-plus-tv-fur-dich-und-mich-tv-for-you-and-me?ref=discovery_category_newest,tvplustv/tv-plus-tv-fur-dich-und-mich-tv-for-you-and-me,"TV PLUS nimmt Dich mit auf ein völlig neues Fernseherlebnis.

Now we have a special opportunity to make Anchorage and Alaska EVEN BETTER!Last year, our favorite South Anchorage Firehouse upgraded their facilities and moved to13915 Lake Otis Pkwy, Anchorage, AK 99516 leaving behind a fine piece of Real Estate and a vacancy in the community town center. After a public silent bid, the property was eventually purchased by Chain Reaction Cycles Alaska and is now building the space out into a World Class Community Bike Shop, Fitness, and Event Studio. Beach Tribe Soda Works has been offered to lease the space that was the Firehouse Kitchen with hopes to round out this property as a landmark destination, launching Alaska's 1st Craft Soda Tap Room and Cold Pressed Juice Bar to compliment the vision.As a Craft Soda and Juice Bar retail outlet, we will offer 3 Styles of Ginger Beer from kegs on a revolving tap basis; always JGB original, along with complimentary flavors such as Captains Choice, Pomegranate, Anise, Coconut, Pineapple, and Cucumber.  We will also offer 2 styles of ‘Seltzer’ water; mixing cold pressed juice and Sparkling Water to provide refreshing alternatives. We will sell 3 of our original Recipes of Raw Cold Pressed Juice, along with 3 Flavors of Wellness Shots, and 3 kinds of Smoothies. We will also offer a small menu of 'grab n go' food items to fuel your adventures and look forward to surprising you with some exceptional choices!As a Craft Soda and Juice Wholesale outlet, we will begin producing Ginger Beer in 5 Gallon Kegs for local Growler Bars, Restaurants, and Bars and scaling the operation to include canning. We know that Keeping it Simple is most important. Starting with Ginger Beer: Alaska water is gold and this glacier fed life force has few rivals anywhere in the United States for taste or purity. Creating our fresh artisanal ginger beer combines water, fresh cold pressed ginger juice, a non-carbonated citrus blend, raw & unfiltered honey, and a medley of herbs and spices. Not only is our Ginger Beer delicious, but it is also refreshing, invigorating, fresh, and arguably medicinal:)Kicking off with Ginger Beer, we will produce our craft soda and juice by renting commercial kitchen/brew space to assist with volume and timeline as we are become fully operational at the 'old firehouse'.  Creating the buildout to work in harmony with CRC, we will begin by paralleling our focus on the retail outlet and the kitchen space.And as a kitchen space, starting with a blank canvas, our Architect and build out team are helping us create the space at the firehouse so we can ‘open our doors’ as a 'Nano Pub' Craft Soda Taproom and Juice Bar, brewing and juicing on-site with a 3 barrel system as well as being able to keep scaling our business off site, continuing to lease space from a local brewery.The Brew Recipes have grown from small batch 5 Gallon Kegs.The Commercial Scalability will start with an In-House 3 Barrel Nano-System for JGB and Small Batch Craft Sodas and Sparkling Waters.From Cold Pressed Juice for Soda to Cold Pressed Juice Bar. Our all-natural premium sodas start by cold pressing fruit and vegetables, so the 'natural progression' is to offer the fresh cold pressed juice to you without bubbles and with different flavor and health profiles.Purchasing the Good Nature Counter Top CT7 Commercial Juice Press will scale production while offering a very small footprint.Cold Pressed Juice and Smoothies can be produced in a small commercial kitchen.Cold Pressed Juice is a Premium Product!Beach Tribe Soda Works will produce juice that is organic whenever possible, natural, cold pressed and raw (unpasteurized).  Our cold pressed blends taste incredible and contain 3-5 times the nourishing vitamins, minerals and amino acids when compared to other extraction methods.Cold pressed juice is exposed to minimum oxidation, so you can enjoy it up to 96 hours after pressing.  Other methods of extraction oxidize the juice, beginning to destroy the vital nutrients immediately.All raw cold pressed juice is not equal.  Health food stores line their shelves with raw cold pressed juice, however, if you read carefully they are pasteurized raw cold pressed juice.  Pasteurization (HPP is the popular method as the product can be labeled raw even though pasteurized) is required for all wholesale juices to kill the micro bacteria.  Pasteurizing also kills beneficial enzymes, vitamins and microflora that play essential roles in our ability to thrive.  Never HPP'd, our juice retains all of the goodness.Beach Tribe Soda Works will be an Economic Driver: There IS A THIRST in Anchorage and Alaska!A quality product draws quality customers and quality partners. Our team will continue to support local events with Premium Craft Beverages. We aim to create more good jobs and are committed to health and education.What is the $100K for?We thought you'd never ask! hahaHere are some of the factors that go into the costs that we are facing with the buildout. We know that these are not all of the costs, but this will give you an idea of the challenges.Architect, Engineers, Designer/Consultants, Licensing, Permitting, Contractor, Plumbing, Electrical, HVAC, Flooring, Refrigeration. The Kitchen is on a cement slab with no floor drains, and after that is completed the floor needs to be completed with Commercial Flooring.  There is only 'HVAC' for a residential stove, the plumbing and electrical needs to be upgraded to code and be able to support a Commercial Kitchen. There are lighting, doors, and window upgrades necessary. We are building out a 'Pass Through Window' to the Main Bay to better service on-site events. There are refrigeration needs... Yep, that all adds up to big $ and a quick feasibility study doesn't prove appropriate for the bank.Our Community will be inspired with healthy fuel for premium Adventures!CONCLUSION:  Thank you for your time, effort, and generous contribution to the project! We appreciate your choice to help us continue to develop Anchorage and Alaska into an EVEN MORE AMAZING place to BE:)Please let us know if you have any questions or concerns. And we'd love it if you share this project with other friends or family members who you think might like to be a part of this.CHEERS!","Yep!  I get it.  This is a big project, but I wouldn't be here if I wasn't all in.This is an ALL OR NOTHING CAMPAIGN.  If we do not reach our goal, we will continue to work with what we have and search for what we need.With Health Codes and Permits, we are not naive enough to think that this project will go without it's hurdles and challenges.  We plan to be diligent and persistent while we do everything in our power to grow this facility into a healthy addition to our Alaskan Permaculture.It is our goal to continue our project with even more vigor as this injection of cashflow into the project will be perfect timing.  Things seem to be coming together, and with your help... as we knock this Kickstarter Project 'out of the park', we will be able to showcase the community excitement and bring in any outside investment should costs go over budget.We will use this investment energy to get Craft Soda, Cold Pressed Juice, Natural Seltzers, and 'Grab n Go's' out to you as soon as possible.  2018 is going to be a GOOD YEAR!Thank you for your trust and encouragement.

I flew down to Pasadena and was certified in Juice HACCP, as the class is not offered in AK. We have also set up procurement with both Di Tomaso, Charlies Produce, and Alaska Organics. We invested in a Commercial Juicer, bought more kegs, and even found a usedbrite tank to be able to carbonate bigger batches. We would love to buy it and that would be one way for you to help:)Beach Tribe Soda Works is now available in several locations in Anchorage and also on tap in Indian, Alaska! Initially starting off with Jipping Ginger Beer, Beach Tribe is available on tap at Cynosure Brewing off Potter Drive, Marco T's Pizzeria on Fireweed, and Froth and Forage in Indian. In the bottle, JGB is available at Black Cup-Cafe Del Mundo, Fire Island Bakery Airport Heights, and South Anchorage Wine House. Most recently, we are proud to offer JGB in a can from Alaska Rock Gym and Chain Reaction Cycles.As you can see we've been busy this winter. We've been buying more equipment and perfecting the craft. We've brewed up more than 40 kegs since we were permitted and now, as we go into the summer, we're asking for your help to grow this into a sustainable business. Our plan is to buy bulk ASAP and hit the summer ground running.We have signed up for the Fire Island Airports Heights Wednesday Night Market and South Anchorage Saturday Market to be able to better visit one on one with our clientele as we continue to expand production, distribution, and events. We also have been offered to grow into Kaladi Bros locations and other local breweries as one of their Non Alcoholic offerings.Your support will help us with supplies, packaging, inventory, equipment, and merchandise. We plan to order bulk cans, bottles, and 'Togo' cups, along with more equipment and market supplies, along with some merch to rock it this summer.Beach Tribe Soda Works mission is to be Alaska's Premium Craft Soda Brand and our vision is 'Pallets to the People'! We are working hard to develop Beach Tribe Soda Works into a profitable business for our Alaskan community, created most definitely to make the world a better place.Our goals for the markets this summer is to invest in them as our main Craft Soda and 'Juice Bar' retail outlets; we are working to offer 3 Styles of Ginger Beer from kegs on a revolving tap basis; always JGB original, along with complimentary flavors such as Captains Choice, Pomegranate, Anise, Pineapple, Peach, and Seasonal Berries. We will also work hard to offer various styles of ‘Seltzer’ water; mixing cold-pressed juice and Sparkling Water to provide refreshing alternatives. We also plan to sell a variety of our original Recipes of Raw Cold Pressed Juice, and hopefully 3 flavors of Wellness Shots from the market too. We're excited to develop more relationships with local farmers and see where they take us!K.I.S.S. We know that Keeping it Simple is most important.Starting with Ginger Beer: Alaska water is gold and this glacier fed life force has few rivals anywhere in the United States for taste or purity. Creating our fresh artisanal ginger beer combines water, fresh cold pressed ginger juice, a non-carbonated citrus blend, raw & unfiltered honey, and a medley of herbs and spices. Not only is our Ginger Beer delicious, but it is also refreshing, invigorating, fresh, and arguably medicinal:)From Home Brew Recipes to Scalability: Our Goal is a 3 Barrel Nano-Brewing System. Kicking off with Ginger Beer, we will produce our craft soda and juice in small batches as we grow into our demand.Our all-natural premium sodas start by cold pressing fruit and vegetables, so the 'natural progression' is to offer the fresh cold-pressed juice to you at the market without bubbles and with a different flavor and health profile.The purchase of the Good Nature Counter Top CT7 Commercial Juice Press was huge and will continue to help us scale production while offering a very small footprint.Cold Pressed Juice is a Premium Product!Beach Tribe Soda Works will produce juice that is organic whenever possible, local as often as possible, natural, cold pressed, and raw (unpasteurized) whenever possible. Our cold-pressed blends taste incredible and contain 3-5 times the nourishing vitamins, minerals, and amino acids when compared to other extraction methods.Cold-pressed juice is exposed to minimum oxidation, so you can enjoy it up to 96 hours after pressing. Other methods of extraction oxidize the juice, beginning to destroy the vital nutrients immediately.All raw cold pressed juice is not equal. Health food stores line their shelves with raw cold pressed juice, however, if you read carefully they have pasteurized the raw cold pressed juice. Pasteurization (HPP is a popular method as the product can be labeled raw even though pasteurized) is required for all wholesale juices to kill the micro bacteria. Pasteurizing also kills beneficial enzymes, vitamins, and microflora that play essential roles in our ability to thrive. Never HPP'd, our juice will retain all of the goodness.Beach Tribe Soda Works is working to be an Economic Driver:There IS A THIRST in Anchorage and Alaska!A quality product draws quality customers and quality partners. Our team will continue to support local events with Premium Craft Beverages. We aim to create more good jobs and are committed to health and education.What is the $12K for?We thought you'd never ask! hahaEquipment: Kegs, Brite Tank, Clamps/Hoses,Refrigeration, CO2, Pallets of Cups, Bottles, Cans, Bulk Labels and design, Merch, Market Supplies, Produce and some working capital.With your help, our Community will be inspired with healthy fuel for premium Adventures!CONCLUSION: Thank you for your time, effort, and generous contribution to the project! We appreciate your choice to help us continue to develop Anchorage and Alaska into an EVEN MORE AMAZING place to BE:)Please let us know if you have any questions or concerns. And we'd love it if you share this project with other friends or family members who you think might like to be a part of this.CHEERS!","Risks and challenges.This is an ALL OR NOTHING CAMPAIGN. If we do not reach our goal, we will continue to work with what we have and search for what we need.With Health Codes and Permits, we are not naive enough to think that this project will go without its hurdles and challenges. Food Safety First!We plan to be diligent and persistent while we do everything in our power to grow this business into a healthy addition to our Alaskan Permaculture.It is our goal to continue our project with even more vigor as this injection of cash flow into the project will be perfect timing. Things are coming together, and with your help... as we knock this Kickstarter Project 'out of the park', we will be able to showcase the community excitement and bring in any outside investment should costs go over budget.We will use this investment energy to get more Craft Soda out to you as soon as possible. Thank you for your trust and encouragement.Cheers, Mike Jipping Founder: Beach Tribe Alaska LLC dba Beach Tribe Soda Works"

Ignoring the old campfire ghost stories from his childhood, Kyle’s curious nature draws him in to see what is left of the camp since it was closed after the infamous 1980 Friday the 13th murders.  However, Kyle’s innocent search of the camp turns deadly when he is attacked by Camp Crystal Lake's last remaining resident, JASON VOORHEES. Stranded alone in the middle of the wilderness, with no equipment, and a legendary mass murderer on his heels, Kyle’s survival skills will be put to the test like never before. Will he make it out of the woods alive or become another victim of the infamous cursed camp? The story of Never Hike Alone is one of man vs nature in the most extreme way. Taking inspiration from films such as 127 Hours, The Martian, and The Descent, this film takes a tale as old as time and shines it through a lens of the Friday the 13th universe.Development for Never Hike Alone began in early 2016 and on Friday, May 13th, the first teaser trailer was released, receiving overwhelmingly positive responses from the film community.Here is a sampling of some feedback we received from across the web.Womp Stomp Film's original intention was to complete production in late Summer of 2016, but decided to put the project on hold when they were informed of a potential game-changing location discovery.Following up on a lead from a pair of South Fork locals, the team found an actual abandoned camp out in the middle of the San Bernardino National Forest. After many hours of research, it was discovered that the rundown camp had been shut down since the mid to late 80's making it the perfect spot for Camp Crystal Lake. However, gaining access to the location required the team to step back and analyze the proper measures needed to film at the camp. They needed to assess technical and creative challenges.Flashing forward to present day, the team has completed its due diligence of re-writing the script, scouting the set, researching permit and insurance requirements, as well as collaborating with several industry professionals in order to bring the project to life.We at Womp Stomp Films truly believe that if we are given this opportunity, Never Hike Alone will be a Friday the 13th Fan Film like never seen before. Our team has devoted this year to crafting story, characters, action, and a film style that will look high budget and keep you on the edge of your seat.Our fundraising goal of $40,000 is to support the individuals recruited to make this film look great and keep the cast and crew safe while filming in remote locations, executing complicated and dangerous stunts.To help you better understand where your contribution will be going, here is a general breakdown of where campaign funds will be invested: Production: These are items such as camera and equipment rentals, sound and lightning crew. Also included are things like the cost of insurance and permits required for the location.Kickstarter: This portion of the budget will go towardsKickstarter fees and the purchase of rewards for backers.Stunt Department: Womp Stomp Films is excited to team up with the crew at Iron Relic Entertainment to handle our stunts.VFX / Post: This is where we make the pretty pictures look a whole lot more pretty.Props / Wardrobe: Production Designer Brittney Porter can't wait to fill up Camp Crystal Lake with all sorts of interesting things.Make Up / FX: This would not be a true Friday the 13th without a little blood or, rather, a whole lot of blood.Music:Over everything, the score may be the most important element in creating an impactful horror film. Good thing we have a talented composer / all around musician Trevor Vaughn to help set the mood.Volunteers: This project would not be where it is today without a dedicated team of volunteers who have donated their time at no cost to the project. Made up of friends, family, and colleagues, this group also includes the core Womp Stomp Films team who are taking no payment for their services.Posters, Beanies, T-shirts, Pins, Blankets, Bags, and more! We've got plenty of Never Hike Alone swag to choose from and with lots of savings in our CAMPER PACKS!Vincente DiSanti moved to Los Angeles in 2008 and has since worked in several aspects of the film industry including live-action, feature animation, story development, voice acting,Visual FX, commercials, and much more.

He began his acting career at Santa Barbara City College in the Theatre Arts program while playing 3rd base on the Santa Barbara City College baseball team.

He’s been featured on television shows, as well as worked on national commercials, however he may be known best for his many cover images on romance novels.Like most children of the 80’s, Fridays were always a special day for our family as it marked the weekly after-school trip to Silver Screen Video. From the start, I became a big fan of horror movies with the first experiences coming form of films like Night of the Living Dead, Pet Semetary, An American Werewolf in London, and The Shining. Eventually, I was introduced to Friday the 13th when I happen to lay eyes on the cover for Friday the 13th Part IV: The Final Chapter. There  theiconic hockey masksat in a pool of blood with a buck knife jammed into the eye-hole. When I returned home with the tape, I watched the film on repeat until I was ripped out of my hands to be returned on Monday morning.   Needless to say, I was hooked. In the weeks, months, and years that followed, every Friday I would return to the horror aisle working my way through the franchise, which was up to film 8 at the time, only to start back at the original all over again when I reached the end.Growing up by a lake, Jason was basically my worst nightmare. After watching Part VI: Jason Lives, I was convinced that Crystal Lake’s resident mass murdered was chained to the bottom of our lake just off our dock. You would think that all that sense of fear would keep me away from the films, but the more afraid I became, the more I watched. As my views of each entry increased over the years, I began to notice all of the discrepancies and continuity errors laced through out the series. Timelines didn’t match, logic didn’t make sense, and where the hell did Jason’s hair go? Didn’t the people making the films notice? Around the time the internet became available to the masses, I began a dial-up speed search to figure out why Friday the 13th was so all over the place. During those late nights, I found the answers to all my burning questions, but more importantly I discovered so much more about the people and teams that brought the films to life. Seeing all the behind the scenes photos and featurettes opened me up to an even more fascinating world and it was in those moments I realized how badly I wanted to become a filmmaker. My pursuit of a film career lead me out to Los Angeles where I have been working in the film Industry for the past nine years. In that time, I have had the opportunity to meet and work alongside countless numbers of producers, directors, actors, and many more who have taught me so much about film than I ever thought possible. After all these years, my dream has still remained to one-day make a Friday the 13th film of my own. Never Hike Alone is the chance for me to make that dream come true. This project is the result of many late nights and long weekends preparing to do something special and memorable for all fans. After all it is you, the fans, who will ultimately decide whether or not this project will become a reality. To those of you who do decide to back this project, I will be forever humbled by your generosity and grateful for this opportunity. Cheers,Vincente DiSantiThank you again for your continued support of independent films.Please donate and share this page with any friends or family you believe will enjoy this film. We hope to welcome you as a part of this campaign and are greatly appreciative for any support you can give us.See you on the trails!- WSFWe at Womp Stomp Films love getting feedback from the fans. Reach out to us on our website or any of the various social media platforms listed below.","PHYSICAL PRODUCTIONOur biggest challenge will be executing a demanding film shoot in a remote location with limited resources and time. Dates will be scheduled, permits will be filed, but anything can happen on set. Technical glitches, injuries, weather, and even wildfires are only a handful of factors that could potentially delay production. With that said, Womp Stomp Films has dedicated countless hours to addressing and preparing for those concerns. Scouting locations, speaking to county officials, testing equipment, walk–through rehearsals, reviewing test footage, and much more have all been apart of our extensive pre-production process. The last thing we want to do is ask for your support and then find ourselves unprepared.  In addition, we have sought out some of Los Angeles County's best and brightest independent film talent to fill out our crew. They are there to keep us safe and help achieve the vision we are looking to bring to the screen. In any case, this production will be insured which will financially protect Womp Stomp Films and its Campaign Backers in the unlikely event of an emergency. No matter what happens, all rewards will be fulfilled. FILM RIGHTS vs FAN FILM: a NON-PROFIT HORROR VENTUREOn the subject of the rights to Friday the 13th, we would again like to formally acknowledge that Womp Stomp Films is in no way affiliated with Paramount Pictures, New Line Cinema, or anyone one else associated with the Original Friday the 13th Franchise. If anyone from those entities takes issue with what we are trying to accomplish, we will happily comply with whatever is asked of us by those parties. The budget for this project is to cover expenses needed to complete the film. We are in no way trying to profit or compete with the actual franchise. The final product will be made available to everyone in the world via various web outlets while backers will receive an EXCLUSIVE FIRST LOOK at the completed film and BONUS BEHIND THE SCENES updates over the course of production. To remain non-profit, any and all funds left over upon completion of the project will be donated to the Penny Pines Reforestation Program. Every year, wildfires destroy large sections of the forest we are shooting in. We are lucky enough to filming in a safer zone, but if you have been keeping up with the news, you can see there are fires burning at this very moment. If we are fortunate enough to exceed our campaign goal of $40,000, Womp Stomp Films will invest in more effects, time, and action for the film as well as additional campaign rewards for our backers. WHY MAKE A FRIDAY THE 13TH FAN FILM? Why not? Friday the 13th is one of the most beloved and celebrated horror franchises in the history of motion pictures. As kids, films like Friday the 13th and countless others inspired us to get involved in the industry and pursue our own film making dreams. This project, more than anything, is a thank you for inspiring us as artists.",https://www.kickstarter.com/projects/neverhikealone/never-hike-alone-a-friday-the-13th-fan-film-finish?ref=discovery_category_newest,neverhikealone/never-hike-alone-a-friday-the-13th-fan-film-finish,"Hello Horror Fans!Womp Stomp Films is excited to welcome you to the Finishing Fundfor our Friday the 13th Fan FilmNEVER HIKE ALONE!

Since then, Christian has worked as our volunteer production assistant and become an essential member of our crew. If you want to be like Christian, you can reach us at contact@wompstompfilms.com Being that Never Hike Alone is a product of Fan Fiction, we cannot make or use this project to create any sort of revenue for profit and that's just fine with us. This project has always been about our passion for Friday the 13th, but we also thought we should find a way to do some added good as well. So, at the completion of production, Womp Stomp Films will donate all leftover funding to the Penny Pines Reforestation Program.The national forests in California cover some 20 million acres, or about 1/5 the state. These areas of great beauty and majestic stature are plagued by divesting problems, such as natural and man-caused fire, pests, and disease. This causes vast depletion and destruction of the national forests in California. It takes hundreds of pieces of specialized equipment and thousands of firefighters working long hours to control these blazing infernos. Fires like these leave total destruction in their wake.Over the years, groups have contributed more than a million dollars to the Penny Pines Reforestation Program. Through these donations, more than 27 million seedlings have been planted, renewing 88,000 acres of national forest land in California -- truly an outstanding achievement.If you would like to donate directly to Penny Pines, you can do so by following this link. Thank you again for your continued support of independent films.Please donate and share this page with any friends or family you believe will enjoy this film. We hope to welcome you as a part of this campaign and are greatly appreciative for any support you can give.See you on the trails!-WSFWe at Womp Stomp Films love engaging with fans. Reach out to us on our website or any of the various social media platforms listed below.website: www.wompstompfilms.come-mail: contact@wompstompfilms.comtwitter: @wompstompfilmsfacebook: @wompstompfilmsinstagram: @wompstompfilmssnapchat: @wompstompfilms","FILM RIGHTS vs FAN FILM: a NON-PROFIT HORROR VENTUREOn the subject of the rights to Friday the 13th, we would again like to formally acknowledge that Womp Stomp Films is in no way affiliated with Paramount Pictures, New Line Cinema, or anyone one else associated with the Original Friday the 13th Franchise. If anyone from those entities takes issue with what we are trying to accomplish, we will happily comply with whatever is asked of us by those parties.That being said, we know for a fact that studios love fan films and most often support them. That is why there are so many Friday Fan films currently floating around the web. As long as one does not try to profit or compete, studios usually see them as a free marketing tool. However, in a case like with Axanar: A Star Trek Fan Film, which you may have read about, it was only when the filmmakers raised 1.13 million dollars on Kickstarter before Paramount stepped in and shut the production down. The budget for this project is astronomically lower and is only meant to cover the unavoidable expenses needed to complete the film. A majority of our staff volunteering their time for free. We are also in no way trying to profit or compete with the actual franchise. The final product will be made available to everyone in the world via various web outlets while backers will receive a FIRST LOOK at the completed film and BONUS BEHIND THE SCENES updates over the course of production.To remain non-profit, any and all funds left over upon completion of the project will be donated to the Penny Pines Reforestation Program. Every year, wildfires destroy large sections of the forest we are shooting in. We are lucky enough to filming in a safer zone, but if you have been keeping up with the news, you can see there are fires burning at this very moment.If we are fortunate enough to exceed our campaign goal of $13,000, Womp Stomp Films will invest in more action, time in post-production, as well as additional campaign rewards for our backers.WHY MAKE A FRIDAY THE 13TH FAN FILM?Why not?Friday the 13th is one of the most beloved and celebrated horror franchises in the history of motion pictures. As kids, films like Friday the 13th and countless others inspired us to get involved in the industry and pursue our own film making dreams. This project, more than anything, is a thank you for inspiring us as artists.PRODUCTIONAnyone who has ever been a part of making a film knows that it is a labor intensive and stressful venture. Never Hike Alone is certainly no different. Throughout this production we have been faced with tremendous adversity. Weather, scheduling, equipment failure, and even trips to the emergency room at 1 in the morning.  No matter what has stood in our way, our team has faced our challenges head on and will continue to do so until this film is finally made available to all. We don't do this because it's easy, because it is far from that. We continue to pursue this venture because we love making films and Friday the 13th. For us, this is a chance we never thought we would have and we are grateful to have found each other in order to make something we are passionate about. It's that passion, and your support, that continues to push us forward on this project and hopefully for the many that come after it."
https://www.kickstarter.com/projects/dondyuk/photobook-culture-of-the-confrontation?ref=discovery_category_newest,dondyuk/photobook-culture-of-the-confrontation,"Hi! My name is Maxim Dondyuk. I'm a documentary photographer from Ukraine.I’d like to talk to you about my first photo book called ‘Culture of the Confrontation’.The StoryThe book ‘Culture of the Confrontation’is about the revolution in Ukraine 2013-2014, known as Euromaidan. It started as a completely peaceful demonstration on Kiev’s Independence Square (in Ukrainian 'Maidan Nezalezhnosti')against the decision of the former President of Ukraine to suspend an integration deal with the European Union. Afew dozen of people, a fewtents and banners.No one expected it would grow into much more.When I came to Maidan for the fist time on December 1, 2013, I was sure that everything would be over by the next morning.I didn’t have the slightest idea where it would lead and that I would spend the next three months there - threemonths of bloody clashes, tears, fear, Molotov cocktails, burning car tires and deaths.At Maidan my subconscious didn’t stop playing games with me. While taking the photographs,the line between reality and fiction sometimes became blurred. I forgot the place where I was and what century it was.Confrontation between protesters and police reminded me of the awful battles of past wars.On the revolutionary canvas creepy, bloody scenes interwove with views that were incredibly beautiful, from a visual side.I felt as if I had been transported to some phantasmagoric place.I looked at Maidan with the help of associative images. I wasn't trying to show what was happening only as a photojournalist—I wanted to awaken people's strongest associations and emotions, wanted them to see how I saw. Photography isn't just a way to tell stories, but a means of conveying visual images that hold deep emotions. Photographs don't just show reality but allow the viewer to interpret reality and confront important life questions.The BookFor already one year I've been working on the book together witha designer from Germany, Yevgeny Anfavov. Together, we want to create not an ordinary book with a set of pictures, we want to immerse you in the events of 2013-2014,and to awaken your strongest associations and emotions.We recreate a map of Maidan, collect artifacts, wrote texts telling about the events and the causes that preceded them, pay a great attention to the tactual sensation while choosing paper and cover materials. I wantthis book to be of interest not only to those who are familiar with the revolution, but also to those of you who know very little or even nothing about it.PublisherAfter searching for over a year, we were fortunate to meet an agreement with a German publisher Kehrer Verlag that will publish and distribute the book. So,if this Kickstarter campaign is successful, the photo book ‘Culture of the Confrontation’ will be available in fall 2016.So, this is where you come in. With your help I need to raise the money to cover the cost of a high quality production and design of the book, including the elaborate choices of special materials that will turn this book into a very special object.  So have a look at the variety of ways to participate in the project. Do what you can afford. Through you and your support I will be able to present this book to the world.And from the bottom of my heart Thank You!Book DetailsHow will the funds be usedExhibitionsPhotos from the project ‘Culture of the Confrontation’were exhibited in solo and group exhibitions around the world: Musée d’Art Moderne (Paris), Somerset House (London), MAXXI, National Museum of XXI Century Arts (Rome), CAB Art Center (Brussels), International Red Cross and Red Crescent Museum (Geneva), Voices Off Festival (Arles), Visa pour l’Image (Perpignan), Checkpoint Charlie Museum (Berlin), FOTOISTANBUL (Istanbul),and others.Selected AwardsPressPrintPhotos from the project have been published in Rolling Stone, TIME, Newsweek, Der Spiegel, STERN, Paris Match, Russian Reporter,Le Monde, 6Mois,PDN, Bloomberg Businessweek, Polka, and others.OnlineThe PrintsHow can You helpBACK THE PROJECT.

If this campaign is a success, there is no question that the book will be published in fall 2016.",https://www.kickstarter.com/projects/dondyuk/photobook-culture-of-confrontation?ref=discovery_category_newest,dondyuk/photobook-culture-of-confrontation,"Hi! My name is Maxim Dondyuk. I'm a documentary photographer from Ukraine. I’d like to talk to you about my first photo book called ‘Culture of Confrontation’.THE STORYThe book ‘Culture of Confrontation’is about the revolution in Ukraine 2013-2014, known as the Revolution of Dignity or Euromaidan. It started as a completely peaceful demonstration on Kiev’s Independence Square (in Ukrainian 'Maidan Nezalezhnosti')against the decision of the former President of Ukraine to suspend an integration deal with the European Union.When I came to Maidan for the fist time on December 1, 2013, I was sure that everything would be over by the next morning. But it didn’t. Peaceful demonstration turned into three months of bloody clashes, tears, fear, Molotov cocktails, burning car tires and deaths.This revolution changed not only myself, but also my photography and visual language. On the Maidan, at some point, the emotions for me took on an almost abstract, or universal character. The battles on the streets appeared almost unreal, as though occurring in some medieval tale or legend. So visually my photos broke away from the specific context that this was all happening in Ukraine, in my hometown. What I tried to capture was the more abstract, universal conflict that was playing out, between light and shadow, between the thick black smoke and whiteness of the February snow, and in some sense between good and evil, though it was often impossible to tell which side was which.From the beginning the revolution felt like a performance, with scenes of carnage interweaving with incredible beauty. In that sense I think I did manage to remain objective, to remain impartial, while still feeling and expressing all the powerful emotions that were playing out. Through my photos I tried to show the scale of all that was happening, and in the process the line between reality and fiction sometimes became blurred. I would forget the place, time and the cause of what was happening, and felt myself transported to some phantasmagoric place that resembled the awful battles of past wars. In that sense, what happened on the Maidan became a symbol to me of opposites colliding, and in the process, the details of the city I knew so well, of carefree Kyiv, melted away.THE BOOKThis book is the result of a three years’ work. Together with a designer from Germany, Yevgeny Anfavov, and writer Simon Shuster, a good friend of mine, who covered the Ukrainian revolution for the TIME Magazine, we did our best to create not an ordinary book with a set of pictures, but to immerse you in the events of 2013-2014. The goal of the book is to remind, to explain, to make people think.The book ‘Culture of Confrontation’ consists of photos, artifacts, texts sharing the problematic discussions, essays and thought of both my and Simon Shuster. It is also supplemented with a map and an events timeline to which are linked all the toponyms in the book. Together with a designer we payed special attention to paper and cover. Via tactual sensation we want you to feel the spirit of the Maidan.In my project I had my own position as a human who supported protesters, but in my photography project as well as in this book I decided not to accent attention on it. I tried to created such photos and situations where viewers would be not obliged to choose good or bad side. I tried to show and tell only the confrontation of two different world views.BOOK DETAILSGuys, this is our second time with this project on Kickstarter, unfortunately, the first one wasn’t successful. But we didn’t give up, and hope that you are with us and will support us! Since our first Kickstarter we finished the work on the design of the book, coved designer’s work and production of dummies out of our own pockets. Now we need your help. Publishing a book isn’t a cheap thing and without you, friends, we won’t be able to publish and present this book to the world. This is our last chance to make the book ‘Culture of Confrontation’ come true!FUNDING GOALSFriends, most in the world we want to publish this book and to present it to the world. That’s why we set up a minimum sum needed to produce this book.We’ve already talked with publishers and received a confirmation from one of them that they are ready to print the book and to present it on the festivals worldwide.This is how much we want the book to come the reality.

Music Videos are expensive, and require a lot of help and hands. But before we get too far into this, have a listen to the track:Did you enjoy it? Great! Quasar wants to take this track and turn it into a futuristic story about the pain felt when falling for someone who can't love you back.The main story is about one person falling in love with another person, but they can't love them back. This story resonates with Quasar on a personal level, and is the reason they wrote the song.This story will be told from a futuristic perspective, and how technology plays into the interactions with the people involved. SciFi, Sophisticated Futurism, and maybe even some Magcial Realism, will all be called upon to create the aesthetics, story, vibe, and mood of the video.The script has been written, and the cast has been chosen.Work has been done to solidify certain aspects of the video already, such as cast, equipment, and some crew. But other aspects are more difficult to find, such as materials for costuming and locations.Your money will not go to Quasar directly, at all. All the money will pass through and go directly towards things needed for this video. The money will be spread among the costs for materials, use of space and equipment, and those involved in the production.Daniel Quasar, the director, has a background in film and video, as well as special f/x editing and motion graphics.

I am a designer and I wanted to make a change where I saw there was an opportunity. A positive change, in my mind at least.We still have movement forward to make. There still is work to be done. I wanted to highlight that.The 6 stripe LGBTQ flag should be separated from the newer stripes because of their difference in meaning, as well as to shift focus and emphasis to what is important in our current community climate.The main section of the flag (background) includes the traditional 6 stripe LGBTQ flag as seen in its widely adopted form so as not to take away from its original meaning.The trans flag and marginalized community stripes were shifted to the Hoist of the flag and given a new arrow shape. The arrow points to the right to show forward movement, while being along the left edge shows that progress still needs to be made.Background: LGBTQ 6 full sized color stripes representing life (red), healing (orange), sunlight (yellow), nature (green), harmony/peace (blue), and spirit (purple/violet)Hoist: 5 half sized stripes representing trans individuals (light blue, light pink, white), marginalized POC communities (brown, black), as well as those living with AIDS, those no longer living, and the stigma surrounding them (black).Where do we go from here? When I read the comments, a lot of people were asking for more options. Some of the most asked for items were pins and t-shirts, so I've added stretch goals for both of those!$20k Enamel Pins: I have gotten quotes to have high quality enamel pins made out of the design. They will feature a silver backing, a pink rubber clasp, and all 11 colors of the ""Progress"" Pride flag design.Who gets an Enamel Pin? Every backer who donates at the $40 tier or higher will receive an enamel pin along with their other rewards. If your tier gives you multiple of something, you'll get multiple pins.$35k T-Shirt Options: I'm working on an exclusive t-shirt and tank top for this stretch goal, that will feature the design of the new flag. I'd like to offer an assortment for different sizes and body types, and you will get to choose your options in the post survey. The design will be revealed if we reach the stretch goal!Who gets a t-shirt/tank top? Similar to the enamel pins, every backer who donates at the $80 tier and above will get to choose a shirt. However, these shirts will be more limited edition and so only one per backer/tier will be available.Let's see how far this can go!Build & MaterialsI ultimately went with a company that uses a printing process known as single-sided reverse:""This option is digitally printed on 200 Denier Nylon. The ink penetrates through the fabric to create a mirror image on the back side of the flag. The bleed through to the back side of the flag is about 90%-98% depending on the color."" - company descriptionJune 2018: Campaign Begins!June 22nd, 2018: Campaign is funded!!July 6 - 13, 2018: Funds are released from the campaignJuly 16th, 2018: Production BeginsAugust 6th, 2018: Production ends; Product shipped to CampaignerAugust 13th, 2018: Backers rewards begin shipping!!!","One of the challenges I could face in this project is issues during the manufacturing process. The build quality could be terrible, or a mistake in printing could occur.  As a designer, I have had to face these issues many times in the past, and I believe my experience will help guide me through them again, should they arise.If a delay occurs during any point of this project, I will be as transparent and fair with my backers as possible so that they know where the project stands, what will happen next, and options for changing perimeters. I have your trust as a backer, and I want to make sure I fully respect that.One of the main concerns I have with this project is the Production Timeline. It is currently Pride season and people will want to have these flags to have out there with them at the festivals. I want to make that happen as quickly as I possibly can, but can only work within the constraints of production.Any and all problems will be faced and readily prepared for as best I can, so that the project can complete without issue."
https://www.kickstarter.com/projects/sacks10/dawg-dayz?ref=discovery_category_newest,sacks10/dawg-dayz,"Dawg Dayz is an animated web seriesthat explores the life, mind and adventures of Jamal as he struggles to make it big as a comedian inHollywood while slinging hotdogs from a food truck to pay the bills. The show unfolds in front of thebackdrop of Los Angeles and provides a gritty, relevant and comedic exploration into the challengesof moving to the City of Angels to find success. The series pays homage to animation greats like RalphBakshi while incorporating nuances of 21stcentury society and life in Los Angeles.STORY ENGINES FOR THE SHOW:  there are three main engines that run the story…ENGINE 1 --  JAMAL, wants to become a big time comedian, he just needs that one break that will get him discovered.  Jamal will use any means necessary to get discovered, even if it means testing his friendships, neglecting his family and abusing his “benefits” of his job.  Jamal parks the truck in front of studios, film shoots and local, Hollywood “hot spots”, house parties, movie premieres, etc. telling jokes and hoping to get discovered.   ENGINE 2 -- JAMAL is struggling with living broke in LA where getting ahead is all about image.   Jamal doesn’t book a lot of shows and his income is solely from what he can hustle through the hot dog truck which means he’s constantly balancing being seen as a hot dog vendor with being recognized as a legit comedian all with the backdrop of LA’s Hollywood (and Venice)  neighborhoods.ENGINE 3 -- Underlying both engines 1 & 2 is the fact that Jamal gets himself into outlandish predicaments, only to be saved by some miracle (most of the time).  These predicaments will be centered around Jamal pretending he has a “I don’t give a **** ” mentality and gradually realizing, he really doesn't have to give a **** to be happy!Our minimum goal is to produce the 1st episode, ""Is everything Kosher"". The more funds we raise, the more cartoons we make. The series will be overseen by the director, Saxton Moore. Production will begin immediately, the 1st episode will be released the Summer of 2015.- PRODUCTION OF A TV QUALITY ANIMATION- WRITING- VOICE ACTORS- SOUND RECORDING & SND FX- ANIMATORS- MUSIC SCORING- FINAL COMPOSITING & EDITING- MORE FUNDS MORE EPISODES=====================THE PROCESS=======================Dawg Dayz will be ""traditionally animated,"" in Flash & After Effects which means that each element is drawn by hand. It is time - and labor - intensive.Pre-production stage: will consist of writing, storyboarding, casting and recording (in a top-of-the-line audio production facility), creating an animatic (shooting the storyboard with the final recorded dialogue), designing (backgrounds, characters, props, effects), coloring (of those models, effects, backgrounds, props, etc), and timing (which requires the director to go frame by frame creating exposure sheets).Animation stage: where our artists will draw every element for every frame, layout, key pose, animate, in-between, ink and paint, and, finally, composite.Post-production stage: the animation is edited; sound effects, including foley, are recorded and added; and the composer creates the score. The sounds effects, music, and dialog are finally blended together with the animation in the last step of production, the final mix.Pixel Pirate Studio is an independent production company, which means we self fund our entertainment and reach out to others for outside funding.Pitching and seeking financial support takes years (it's like jumping through circus hoops)Reaching out to backers here on Kickstarter is the quickest way to get our show to the fans while preserving the artistic vision we've developed.Kickstarter also allows us to connect and interact with our fans directly and by Working with you we can crush the Naysayers and show the world that we can make dreams come true.If we exceed our goal, we'll produce more episodes while continuing to reward you for your support.These are goals that are beyond the main goal of the project, but if reached will add some really cool things!

A little over two years ago while sitting in a local brewery my creative mind started to run wild.  Maybe it was the amazing craft beer I was drinking, maybe it was my love for photography, either way, I had to take photos of this brewery. I loved all of the stainless steel, I loved the reclaimed beetle kill wood, and train-car base boards serving as a bar top. But mostly, I loved how all of this flowed so nicely together. So warm and welcoming, yet very much a manufacturing facility. After frequenting this brewery for a while and becoming friends with the employees, I mustered up the nerve and asked to take photos and they didn't hesitate to say yes. I had a blast taking photos that night.I started visiting more and more craft breweries in this awesome state with camera in tow, but shortly after starting this project I really noticed something special about this industry. Sure, the metal is gorgeous, the taprooms are beautiful, and the beer is amazing. But, it was the people that worked the long hours and the passion they had for what they did that I fell in love with.

Ruby Scoops came to fruition October 2014, when Rabia-aka Ruby- noticed the increasing rarity of high quality local desserts. She decided it was time to help change that, and pursue her entrepreneurial endeavors.Ruby Scoops focuses on using and highlighting local dairy and produce to help spotlight and support our local economy. We use Kreider Farms dairy and eggs from Pennsylvania, and purchase fruit for ice cream and sorbets at the farmer's markets we participate in, ensuring the fruit we use is from Pennsylvania, Maryland, and Virginia. We also use vanilla from Madagascar by way of Mauritius Island, where part of Rabia’s family is from. Ruby Scoops has really allowed Rabia to utilize and share the best of both of her worlds, African and American, as well as share the thing she loves most with her customers and the world--food--and they love it! She puts her heart into every pint, and people can tell.We currently sell Ruby Scoops goods at local farmer's markets and online through our website, and have built a small base of loyal repeat customers (and we thank each one of you!) We are hoping the Kickstarter community will help us raise money so we can have and do the following:More Employees!- Most of our production is done by Ruby herself and some very dedicated loved ones who want to see Ruby Scoops grow! We need to hire at least one additional part-time employee to help us meet our demand!Packaging/Labeling for Distribution!- We're working on getting ready for distribution within the DC/MD/VA area by this fall, and need help to get our pint containers and labels ready for lovely people like you folks to purchase!More Space!- We proudly produce out of Union Kitchen DC and as our business is quickly expanding, and we need to rent more space!More Equipment & Supplies!- We believe it's never too early to start getting your ducks in a row for next year! We're looking to invest in a new ice cream machine, as well as a portable cart or small van to convert into an ice cream truck for us to vend next spring and summer when we're busy! The more avenues we have to bring Ruby Scoops to the world, the better!","Ruby Scoops is the basket where we've put all our eggs. We are 100% committed to growing this brand and providing people with high quality sweets made with local and seasonal ingredients. We really believe that in order to build your community you have to give to it, and we're really hoping to find some like minded-individuals that want to see DC, Maryland, and Ruby Scoops grow as much as we do! We're fully focused on this project and on growing this business. We believe our sweet treats are great,  and it's reaffirmed whenever a guest tries a sample and their eyes light up or a smile bursts on to their face-- but we can admit that our packaging could absolutely use help--and that's just part of where you all come to play. Farmer's markets have been great exposure and a great way to meet our community, but as fall and winter quickly approach we want to put Ruby Scoops on your grocer's shelves sooner than later! We greatly believe it will help grow our business and brand. If we can achieve our goals for this year, we can work on bring Ruby Scoops to the rest of the continental U.S. by next year! Even after you all grace us with your help we may run into some issues--mostly finding the right employees. We hope to avoid this through careful interviewing and selection, and with the help of our Union Kitchen community.

I sat in the dining room of the restaurant I was working at and watched two sisters squabble over who stole a spoon of ice cream. It took me back to my childhood when I competed with my siblings for sweets.When it felt like I was ready to open a shop, I snuck down to Richmond from time to time over the course of a year to explore potential spaces. During those trips I met the perfect person, Emmett Wright, to join me in this new chapter as a co-owner. Now we were looking for a space together. Finally, we found one!Five years later, I’ve returned to the place that inspired me to attend culinary school, Richmond, Virginia, to open the first brick and mortar location of Ruby Scoops! We signed a lease, fleshed out plans, and once our permits were filed we hoped to be open by this summer.I moved down and two weeks later, COVID-19 hit. Almost immediately, our landlord became unresponsive when we asked about important details like build-out costs and the delivery date of the space. We expected regular updates and got very little in return. From the time we signed the lease in January to June, we met our landlord at the site three times—the last being April 22. They walked back what we’d agreed on and the lack of communication persisted.After lots of discussion and anguish on our end, we started looking for light at the end of the tunnel. We hired a lawyer to help us get out of the contract.⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀The good news is we’ve shaken free of the contract and can find a more suitable space where we can open this year. It makes more sense in the present retail climate and is in the same neighborhood we desired.Unfortunately, we lost all the money we invested into the initial space and legal fees to boot. These losses cut into our savings for equipment, contractors, and staffing. We need your help raising it back! I want to be transparent about what’s happening because you all are our people; our priority is serving you—and we need your help to open.","When we decided to pursue our first location, we had no idea a global pandemic was going to upend the economy. Being in a limbo of not being able to open has kept us mostly out of production and out of profitability. We’ve been able to make some money through virtual cooking classes and wholesale orders for clients who are pivoting and finding ways to stay open during the pandemic. We decided to move forward with a newer, smaller space that is more manageable and suited to the current climate of hospitality in the pandemic. We will follow strict protocols and operate in a ‘soft opening’ capacity for the remainder of the year and will limit the amount of guests allowed in and what offerings we have to minimize contact and reinforce social distancing guidelines. Everyone deserves a treat at this time, and we want to be the ones to provide it!"

We “GP International” is ahead of manufacturing and production in sunglasses.","Time is limited to everyone and people can only do so much at once. Our company also faced many problems to set up the facilities and Our team spent the valuable and quality time to be accustomed our work in the meantime.While we’re working in this field, our first priority is credibility.  This motto never changed since then.Please allow us to show you our Challenges.Final design  Our design team is committed to creating magnificent results for this new market. To make it real, they need full commitment and self-confidence to this mission. The most difficult part of the 3D design was combining our basis experiences with new technology. As a result of the consistent modifications, our designer finally achieves the perfect fit for new tech and beauty.  Lens   We should always strict to the basics when we make products. Users see the world through the lens. You may rest assured that we know what we make. Moreover, we have facilities, expert and experience dealing with “EN, ANSI and AS/NZS” standard lens.  Mould  On the basis of the final 3D modeling, we already made final RP samples to check the compatibility. Before a mold is built, we’re also checking whether it’ll be optimized for our injection molding requirement or not. Now, we’re just about to making mold now as the final RP samples had no problem at all.  Electronic part  Not like the other electronic devices, there are the size and part position confinements as the device have to be adjusted comfortably ensconced on our face. It was a difficult part to locate the electronic parts (PCB, Battery, Bone Conduction Speakers, Buttons, etc) by keeping the function and style. We couldn’t build the parts and everything at once. After several tries and the test samples, the parts and everything could meet the expectation. In this process, we got very valuable advice from the experts working in University. They helped us about this electronic parts as much as we do. Without their support, we couldn’t finish it yet. We only want to say “Thanks”.",https://www.kickstarter.com/projects/ironpeak/ironpeak-bone-conduction-sport-sunglasses-with-nxt?ref=discovery_category_newest,ironpeak/ironpeak-bone-conduction-sport-sunglasses-with-nxt,"IRONPEAK COASTis thesunglasses with built-in bone conduction speakers.Bone conduction speaker transmits sound waves to the skull via vibrations.COAST's Bone conduction speakers*Please refer to the revised sizeThe bone-conduction speaker company has more than 20 years experience in this field.

There were also lots of challenges establishing these systems. However, one thing never changed. It’s the credibility to our customers and we can call it dignity at our side. This motto has never been changed since then. 1. Sun Lens & Prescription Lens You can trust the quality of our sun lenses and prescription lenses as we’re partnered with the leading company in the optical industry.  Essilor® Sun Solution™ lenses with high protection against sun glare. They are made from some of the best materials in the world. And our lenses offer the best combination of optical clarity and high resistance.2. Certification & Testing Efforts and passion can prove nothing. All the related parts and the products need to get through some tests and passed by “Official Organizations”. Some are finished and some are proceeding now. It shows where we are and when we can ship!3. Manufacturing  Manufacturing can always face unexpected circumstances. 10 years of manufacturing experience in the optical industry give us great confidence and guidelines.4. Supply Chain Risk What have we done and doing till now is manufacturing sports sunglasses in Korea. And we feel really assured when producing in domestic. Sometimes it’s inefficient and unmanageable when producing aboard.  Most of the new parts for this project is also controlled by domestic companies and already finished assessment.5. Replaceable Battery Packs One of the hardest challenges were building battery packs and connection parts. All the related parts for connection should be customized as it should be slim. We took countless tests and simulation for this and finally found the solution. It wasn’t easy but worth it."

This will be an environmentally friendly and consciousness raising greenhouse in the center of campus. The social cohesion understandings gained here will propel this trailblazing facility to inspire similar nature-enhanced engagement centers across the country.This project will have innumerable benefits for a variety of groups. For the community it provides a cozy, informal gathering place with fun evening events in a nature immersed activity venue. For individuals there is quiet personal time during the day on the winding paths of sun and green all year.  Children can have inspiring early nature exposure with parents or on school field trips.  For students it will provide stress relief, recovery from the rigors of the school year, and combat the higher rates of depression in the winter improving educational outcomes.  For the elderly it can be utilized for medical recovery and health strolls while providing more social interaction and vertical integration of age groups.  The social and health sciences will benefit from a high-density nature and interpersonal interaction study area for research projects.  The green revolution and advanced tech companies will have a demonstration showcase for their newest innovations, like our BIPV transparent solar panels in the top of the dome.

We have a designated site on the 2020 Vision Master Plan Campus Map. We have selected Geometrica for construction and engineering.  Our proposal has been submitted and approved and we are working with Infrastructure, Facilities and Planning for thoroughly vetted construction cost numbers, presently.The money raised on Kickstarter will be spent on full engineering analysis and blueprinting. We are working to locate additional sources of funding and maintain continued community support. We are moving through the process to receive final approval to begin construction. ","Our primary site choice is Michigan State University in East Lansing. We have been working with the administration a number of years. There are a series of authorizations required and navigating these to final approval by the Board of Trustees is an ongoing process. Concurrently, we have had inquiries and offers from local municipalities. Presently we believe that the MSU campus provides the largest user base as a proving ground for the social engagement features we are developing. Challenges:--- Maintaining political capital with changing MSU administrators’ priorities.--- Maintaining awareness and engagement with the continuously renewing student body.--- Growing the outreach campaign.--- Time frames -- because of the size of the project and the size and conservative nature of the university leadership very long time frames for construction projects happen on campus. ---- Double-sided coin-- The unique design and purposes of the facility make inseparable pluses and minuses. State building codes in Michigan have not caught up with Green Building designs. Our large interior public garden complex is an A3 designation, requiring $400,000 dollars of fire suppression equipment to be up to code. This, in spite of being over 70% tropical garden that is watered from above twice a day. The rainwater harvesting system also outstrips regulatory comprehension, Another such system on campus is off-line due to these constraints. Our projected system is a “rain barrel” plant watering system, so we have an advantage in navigating state oversight. Everything about an advanced new type of facility comes with laudable enthusiasm from prospective users and the design team but with hesitations and concerns from regulators and permitting agencies. Capabilities: --- Strong concept grounded in unequivocal research into the positive benefits and utilization outcomes of a highly accessible community green space.--- Inspiring design configured and detailed from environmental psychology, social science and landscape architecture principles.--- Enduring student and community enthusiasm coupled with evolving organizational skills, backed up by demonstrated perseverance and constancy of vision.--- Broad support base in the community.--- Diversity in the internal membership of the organization i.e. both students, older university staff and long term residents working together to further the project.Special thanks to our first media supporters:Ecogreenlove: https://ecogreenlove.com UrbanMeisters: http://www.urbanmeisters.com Video Music: Corporate Software by Scott Holmes",https://www.kickstarter.com/projects/1170231101/build-the-biodome?ref=discovery_category_newest,1170231101/build-the-biodome,"By integrating a natural ecosystem with modern engineering principles and cutting-edge technologies, we created the Biodome:We care about building a brighter future.

https://www.kickstarter.com/projects/werdnus/xylaria-of-the-cloud-forests-of-ecuador?ref=discovery_category_newest,werdnus/xylaria-of-the-cloud-forests-of-ecuador,"The Xylaria of the Cloud Forests of Ecuador will be a beautiful hardcover guide to the identification and classification of the fungal genus Xylaria from the Ecuadorian cloud forests, one of the most biodiverse places on earth. It will include nearly 50 species of Xylaria and be fully illustrated with gorgeous, traditional botanical illustrations showing these fungi in their true glory. This will be the most significant taxonomic work on this group of fungi in almost a quarter of century, and the first ever such work to be fully illustrated. It will be essential to anyone interested in tropical fungi, and anyone that loves traditional illustration. Xylaria are wood decay fungi—they eat dead and decomposing wood—and are incredibly diverse. In North America and Europe, the most familiar species is probably the Candlesnuff Fungus (Xylaria hypoxylon), or Dead Man's Fingers (Xylaria polymorpha). In the tropics, the diversity of these fungi is staggering: there are more than 400 species of Xylaria known, and most of them occur in the tropics. And there are certainly many species unknown to science—this book will describe at least one of them for the first time ever.These are some of the most common wood decay fungi in the tropics, which makes them very important to global carbon cycling, and thus climate change. When I started my dissertation, I wanted to study their ecology, how they live in the world and interact with the rest of the organisms in their ecosystems. To do that, I had to be able to identify them to species. And that was a problem: there is no guide to the species of Xylaria in the world. Taxonomy, the branch of science that orders and classifies organisms, has not really gotten to Xylaria yet. To figure out who these beautiful little fungi were, I had to dig back into a literature that sprawls over literally centuries, is often incomplete or contradictory—including more than 800 named species, of which more than half are incorrect for some reason. Now, I know how to identify the Xylaria that grow in the Cloud Forests of Ecuador, and I want to share that knowledge by writing and illustrating a guide book. I bring not only my unique knowledge of Xylaria to this book, but my life-long love of traditional botanical illustration. I have been an artist all my life, and doing technical illustration for nearly a decade. My scientific illustrations have been published in the journals Biological Invasions and Biotropica, and my graphic-narrative adaptation of Mary Miller’s story “A blind dog named Killer and a colony of bees” was published last year in the Nashville Review.There are only a handful of people in the world that have the expertise and training to identify fungi like this, and that number is shrinking. Funding for basic science has been decreasing for decades, and as the budgets shrink, the first things that get cut are basic, less “sexy” branches of science (such as taxonomy). The thing is, this brick-and-mortar science is necessary for the more complex scientific disciplines. To study evolution in important crop pollinators, you need to know which insects are which. So you send the insects to a taxonomist. To hunt for cancer treatments in tropical rainforest plants you need to know which plants are which. So you send them to a taxonomist. To study the impact that wood decay fungi have on global carbon cycles, and thus climate change, you need to know which fungi are which. So you send them to me—or you use a copy of the book that results from Kickstarters like this one to identify them. In addition to my own expertise, I'll be drawing upon the expertise of many older, wiser heads than mine. I've been in communication with leading taxonomists about this project, including Dr. Yu-Ming Ju in Taiwan, Dr. Jack D. Rogers in Washington, and Dr. Thomas Læssøe, in Denmark. The science in this book will be up-to-date, accurate, and reviewed by leading experts in the field before publication.Without funding for basic science, the existing taxonomists are nearing retirement, and training no replacements. Soon, no one will write these books, no one will illustrate them. I believe that we, as advocates for science and lovers of the beauty of nature, can help to solve this problem. Projects like this one don’t just breathe a little life into the study of a particular group of organisms, like the Xylaria, they send a strong message about the importance of basic scientific research, and the need for taxonomy and natural history. So please, click the green button and back this project.This project will fund the remainder of the taxonomic research necessary, to be completed here at the University of Oregon, in collaboration with the Ecuadorian National Herbarium in Quito, as well the actual writing of the book, the production of the highest-quality illustrations of Xylaria available anywhere—which I am in the process of drawing—and the production of all the rewards.Planning this has been a great education to me on what things cost: I've been involved in writing many scientific grants in the past decade, but I have not spent much time thinking about manufacturing and shipping costs. The large breakdown in the pie chart above splits the funding goal into broad classes: The ""science"" wedge of the pie is mostly personnel costs for the taxonomic and illustration work over the next year, as well as some supplies for microscopy. ""Manufacturing"" covers costs of actually producing all of the rewards, including the books. ""Fulfillment"" is the warehousing, distribution, and other services rendered by MakeThatThing, who are managing the logistics of the campaign. The size of the ""shipping and handling"" wedge of the pie surprised me a bit; it costs more to get all of these things out to people than it does to actually make them in some cases! Lastly, ""taxes & fees"" covers taxes assessed on all of this by the IRS and percentage fees that Kickstarter takes for itself and payment processing fees.We’ve been working on some excellent rewards for you! The primary reward is, of course, a fully illustrated guidebook to the Xylaria of the Cloud Forests of Ecuador: I am creating clear and elegant line drawings to illustrate nearly fifty species of these strange and beautiful fungi, and including complete keys for identification, and information on collecting, preserving, and examining these fungi, as well a chapter on their fascinating ecology.Additionally, there is a gorgeous full-color photographic supplement including as many of the species as possible, with field photography from Ecuador by Danny Newman, a mycologist and photographer of global renown.We’re also offering Xylaria-themed t-shirts, stickers, postcards, posters, and a custom-designed bandana featuring a Xylaria-themed paisley designed exclusively for this Kickstarter. See some sample images and mock-ups below, and check the sidebar for pricing.Any two reward tiers can be combined by simply pledging the full amount for both! We'll use a survey system for add-ons at the end of the campaign. If you're worried about your request getting lost because you can only select one tier, you can also email me with what you want the additional pledge money to go towards (CloudForestXylaria@gmail.com). You'll still have to fill out the survey at the end, though.Also, all of the original drawings will be available as a special reward tier!Lastly, this book will describe at least one new species for the first time ever. If someone believes in this book enough to financially support a substantial portion of it, I will immortalize them in the mycological literature by naming a new species after them!And everyone that contributes, however much, will have a spot in the acknowledgements of the book, and a special place in my heart. Thank you all!","Most of the ancillary rewards are almost ready to go: we have completed design files for the handkerchief, the t-shirt, and most of the postcards. We are working with the inestimable team at MakeThatThing to make all the things, warehouse and ship all the things, and generally make sure that fulfillment goes smoothly.The challenge, and the risk, is in the science. This is a big project; there's no doubt about that. This will be one of the most significant taxonomic works on Xylaria this century, and the first to include comprehensive illustrations. I've worked with these fungi for years as part of my dissertation, and have preliminary lists of species to include, drafts of several species descriptions, and completed illustrations for a handful of taxa. This gives me a pretty good idea of how much work is left: I estimate about a year of full-time work is needed to complete the book. That's not small, and lots of things can go wrong in the interim, but I have dedicated collaborators, more knowledge of this particular group of species than almost anyone else alive, more than 600 collections currently in my possession, agreements in place with the Ecuadorian National Herbarium in Quito and good working relationships with the head curator there, and all the equipment needed to make this taxonomic study possible. There is some risk of the taxonomic work and illustration taking longer than anticipated, but I am committed to project, and even if this Kickstarter does not successfully fund, I will continue to work on Xylaria taxonomy on my own time; there is no chance that this will not eventually happen. To address concerns about scientific rigor: the final taxonomic scheme for the book, and all descriptions and keys, will be vetted by Dr. Yu-Ming Ju, the recognized world expert in the genus. He has, personally, examined the type specimens of nearly all described Xylaria, and trained with xylariologist Dr. Jack D. Rogers, who will also review the book if he is able. I will also be seeking review by Dr. Thomas Læssøe, who has done more work with neotropical cloud forest Xylaria than anyone else alive, and several other scientists who work on the group. Publishing outside of a traditional academic publishing house makes the cost much more reasonable, which should increase the ability for libraries to acquire the volume, and make it accessible to amateur mycologists around the world; it will not impact the quality of the book.",https://www.kickstarter.com/projects/werdnus/marrow-of-the-mountain?ref=discovery_category_newest,werdnus/marrow-of-the-mountain,"Okay everyone, we've only got a few short days left, and a LOT of momentum, so let's keep it going! If we can make it to $20,000 (ambitious, I know!) we'll produce a short ""making of"" video to accompany the film — do you want to see how we captured some of this amazing footage? What the main characters are like when the cameras aren't rolling? YOU TOTALLY CAN IF WE MAKE IT TO 20K! Everyone who pledged anything at all will get access to this, so if you want it, tell your friends and let's keep this ball rolling! Mega-mining has come to Ecuador. In 2017, multinational mining companies bought the rights to huge swaths of the country, leaving Ecuador’s most sensitive and biodiverse habitats at the mercy of international mining interests. This happened suddenly, and without public knowledge or consent; most of these sales are in the mineral-rich and endangered Chocó Rainforest. Told in the voices of three women, we witness the deep impact of extractive industry on Ecuadorian lives, as they struggle to protect their families and communities whilst the land is being sold out from under their feet.All donations made to our Kickstarter campaign are TAX-DEDUCTIBLE through Eclectic Reel, a 501(c)3 non-profit dedicated to grass-roots documentary film!This is a documentary with a social focus; we see the impact on local communities of expanding mining in northwest Ecuador. It is also a documentary about the effects of mining on nature, focusing specifically on the unique Chocó Rainforest, exploring its significance, beauty, and importance alongside the crew of a National Geographic expedition into the heart of the forest.We begin in the Intag Valley, where huge chunks of land encompassing whole townships have been sold in mining concessions. Isabel Anagono, a 70 year old Afro-Ecuadorian writer and activist, was born in the Intag; she gave birth to 6 children, and buried 2 in the fertile valley soil where she and her husband farm. Isabel and her husband have watched the rainy season become dry, and the Intag river become polluted from the towns upstream. From there, we travel to the Los Cedros Biological Reserve in a neighboring valley, where concessions cover two-thirds of this 17,000 acre protected forest. Forests like Los Cedros, known as ‘Bosques Protectores’, are wildlands that have been protected by the Ecuadorian government, but in 2017 the government decided that these forests were not protected from mining. Here on the reserve, we are introduced to Elisa Levy, an Ecuadorian biologist in her mid-30s, along with the crew of the ‘Richer Than Gold’ expedition, a multinational group of scientists from the United States and Ecuador, who are working together to explore the endangered Chocó Cloud Forest habitat of Los Cedros before it is lost. Finally, we travel north with Elisa to the border between Ecuador and Colombia, to the indigenous Awá community of El Baboso, the geographically closest indigenous community to Los Cedros,where we meet Filomena Rosero, a female elder in the Awá community. Her words are heart-wrenching and poetic as she talks about the difficult future of the Awá.All three narratives collide in the ongoing legal battle for the future of Los Cedros, which has far-reaching implications for all protected forests in Ecuador. The representative for the Ministry of Environment has said that “protected forests are not protected”,a point of view that radically re-interprets the role that protected forests play in the future of conservation in Ecuador. It also undermines the investment that many communities have made in creating protected forests on their lands to stave off contamination of their rivers and degradation of their forests.We need this film. The exploitation of Latin America by extractive industry is a current — and difficult — issue affecting many indigenous and rural Andean communities. Conflict around extractive industry is silencing the voices of environmental defenders. In Ecuador, the Shuar indigenous leader José Isidro Tendetza Antún was murdered in 2014. Globally, 207 environmental activists were killed in 2017 alone, 60% of them in Latin American countries. Adding political complexity to the situation, Ecuador is the first country to include in its constitution explicit recognition of the Rights of Nature. In the quest for wealth, the Ecuador and the multinational mining companies working there have endangered the country’s most precious resource, its biodiversity. Ecuador’s rainforests protect more species per acre than anywhere else in the world, and yet more than 30% of the country's protected forests (bosques protectores) are now threatened by mining.This film serves as an important step in creating accountability for multinational extractive industry. Folks from industrialized nations, particularly North Americans and Australians, are connected to the drama unfolding in Ecuador through their consumer choices. The demand for the metals produced by these mines is primarily driven by consumer electronics — cell phones, tablets, and laptops — and the corporations primarily responsible for environmental and human rights abuses we are seeing across Latin America are located in these countries. We are deeply invested in future of all the individuals we met filming this winter,and very much hope to impact their struggle in the best way we know how, by creating awareness with this film. Our goal is to help educate people about the real life struggles and threats many communities are facing, and how North Americans are connected to this struggle by what they consume. We hope that this exposure will put pressure on the Ecuadorian government and the mining industry to more clearly weigh the impacts of their decisions. This documentary will have a huge impact on the future of Ecuador and Latin America, and how international extractive industry chooses to do business in the future.You support for this project is vital to brining this film into existence. Your tax-deductible pledge will help fund the a second shoot in Ecuador, which necessary to complete the project, as well as providing vital income for several of our Ecuadorian colleagues, including our editor Antonella Carrasco.We're super happy to be working with Eclectic Reel, a 501(c)3 non-profit organization that specializes in bringing impactful, grass-roots documentaries like ours to light. The upshot of that relationship for you is: your donations are tax deductible in the USA.With the National Geographic Richer Than Gold expedition providing a hard date for our initial shoot, this project moved from initial conception to shooting quite rapidly. Through a combination of volunteer labor, University-loaned equipment, and initial investment by the production team and the expedition itself, we managed to have an incredibly successful initial exploratory shoot. While some staff (directors and producer) are able to provide significant volunteer labor, others are not: our Ecuadorian colleagues do not have the ability to spend periods of time without income. The North Americans involved with this film are committed to using the privilege afforded by our status as United States citizens, to support our colleagues Ecuador, with its more tenuous economy and reduced access to global resource pools.To get into specifics, we need roughly $9,000 to pay for editing by Antonella, and about $5,000 for our second shoot, which will cover at least four locations in Ecuador over the course of about 50 days, and include a crew of four (both co-directors, cinematographer, and producer, who doubles as sound). The balance of the goal is for Kickstarter fees and production of physical rewards.This film is a co-production between Ecuadorian and American filmmakers, and is being co-directed by Solange Yepez and Dylan Stirewalt. We believe we are the best team to take on this project, not only because of the substantial footage we have already collected, but because the international nature of our team and the connections we have already built give us the ability to return and capture more in a way that no one else could. Dylan took on this project through the invitation of a longtime friend, producer Dr. Roo Vandegrift, one of the key scientists and the principal investigator for the National Geographic expedition. Roo has traveled to Ecuador multiple times and is deeply embedded in the environmental activist community there. These connections granted us access to communities and individuals that otherwise would be overlooked and difficult to access, such as the Los Cedros Biological Reserve and the Indigenous Awá Community.However, what gives us the most unique perspective on this story is having both a female and a non-binary femme director; through this lens, we focus on female characters that have been consistently overlooked by other filmmakers. Utilizing a cinematic style of poetry to soften the scientific nature of this story, we seek to evoke beauty and emotion in the viewer, to make them fall in love with nature as deeply as all the characters — and we — have.We’ve been working on some excellent rewards for you! The primary reward is, of course, a digital copy of movie Marrow of the Mountain! In addition to that, we've got the coolest art, drawn specifically for this Kickstarter by producer Roo Vandegrift, which we'll be making into t-shirts and patches as rewards. We're also offering thanks in the credits, shout-outs on social media, and Executive Producer credit.We're happy to be sponsored by some really excellent organizations, including notable support from the Rainforest Information Centre and MiningWatch Canada, in addition to our relationship with Eclectic Reel.","All of the major participants in the project (co-directors Dylan and Solange, producer Roo, and editor Antonella) are extremely committed to the project; all of the primary subjects of our documentary (Isabel, Elisa, Filomena) are also super committed to brining this movie to fruition. The American members of the team are generally able to donate substantial time and resources to the project, but we are struggling to raise the funds to complete this film at the quality that it truly deserves: movies are expensive! That's why we're reaching out to all of you — we can't make this film without you! We have finished our initial shoot, and have 30 interviews, totaling over 20 hours of footage; we also have footage from 11 different sites in Ecuador, including the El Corazón mine in Magdalena, the research station and field camp at Los Cedros, and the Awá indigenous community of El Baboso. We have continuing access to people and locations. The producer is also the organizing scientist behind the National Geographic expedition, providing continuing access to the scientific community around Los Cedros. The producer and director are both directly involved in the environmental activism movement surrounding mining in northern Ecuador, providing continuing access to legal and community resistance in the region. Our Co-Director Solange Yepez and Editor Antonella Carrasco are both Ecuadorian and live in Quito, and are able to film important protests and court cases as needed."

NOTE: Don't change your reward level when you increase your pledge.1: [ Early 1000 animation by Shawna Mills ]2: [ Tommy Boy Sketches and Pencil Test ]3: [ Meggan Pencil Test & Comic Con Insanity! ]1000 is a world where aliens, warlocks, zombies, warlords, ancient beasts, and all manner of entities exist. These entities have each carved out territories around the world that they call their own. A cold war stands between them and casts the rest of the world into chaos.Dragon Son, a supreme entity banished and sentenced to 1000 acts of repentance, is left to wade through the chaos.Every act brings him closer to one day returning to his true Dragon-form.Dragon Son is joined by six other Agents charged with secretly policing the world.They are all that stand in the way of keeping the cold war from obliterating the last remnants of civilization.We have eight 90-second animated episodes planned. A micro-series that introduces you to the main characters of the ""1000"" universe.Seven of these episodes will feature a single Agent from our main lineup. The eighth and final short will give you a taste of the entire team workingtogether! Here's a list of concepts we have in the works for the episodes:Just to whet your appetite, here's a very small taste of Dragon Son doing his thing:UPDATE: A rough pencil test of Tommy Boy:UPDATE #2: A pencil test of Meggan:Secret Sauce is a freshly formed animation studio with one goal in mind: to produce quality action animation.We're a group of action freaks at heart. We're fans (and students) of high quality animation.With 1000 we have the groundwork to deliver. We plan to start things off right and do just that.Here's a quick glimpse of some of the people behind Secret Sauce Studio:If we told you that then we'd have to silence you. Moving on to the next question.That's a better question.In traditional big studio projects budgets, even thirty minutes of quality animation cost hundreds of thousands of dollars. In comparison our budget is extremely modest. Here's the breakdown from our $60K base goal:With 66% percent our $60K goal money going to animation we're left with roughly $39K. That further breaks down to about $4.9K per animated short. That's $4,950 spread out to cover a-minute-and-a-half of full-blown action for each short. A budget that goes to a background artist, key animators, and clean-up artists. Not to mention the work that goes into finalizing the animation. This includes compositing, color correction, editing, and final mixdown. That kind of budget disappears fast when these necessities are factored in.Here's a small comparison of what we're asking for compared to typical studio budgets for the same quality animation:We're literally working at 1/4th the cost of what bigger studios budget for similar outings.$60,000 is the PASSION-PROJECT MINIMUM that we can accept to make these animations happen. Anything less and we wouldn't even be able to cover the cost of electricity for the course of the project.Our pipeline is efficient and lean, yet we still have production needs that the base goal doesn't cover.Exceeding our base goal can only help us make stronger animation (and keep us healthy).The more money we raise the more resources we'll have to blow the lid off of your expectations.Even $80K would allow us to start making phonecalls and bring on more smoking hot talent.Names that you're already familiar with, too. All we have to do is make the call and say that we have the budget.Here's a quick breakdown of all the incentives we have to offer in the campaign so far:Sanford Greene's latest artbook, Deadlines VOL. 4. This is a first-run copy available in both softcover and slipcase editions.A custom-modeled figurine of Tommy Boy with fine detail.

But he also had a few issues. Suspended by the ATP for brawling with an opponent, his life has taken a turn for the worse. During a particularly dark period, he encounters Dwayne, an intense and charismatic zealot, who recruits Aaron for Gentlemen’s Fury, an underground tennis league that just might not be strictly about tennis.As Aaron soon finds out, all of the players in Gentlemen’s Fury are former ATP players who, for one reason or another, have been excused from the tour. While the pay is nice, the rules turn out to be ambiguous and increasingly deadly. As the film unfolds, Dwayne transforms from savior to pariah while Aaron struggles at first to keep up, then just to stay alive.Who we areBen Sharples (Writer, Director, Producer, Aaron Faust)Ben can most recently be seen in Takashi Shimizu’s horror film,7500.

But he also had a few issues. Suspended by the ATP for brawling with an opponent, his life has taken a turn for the worse. During a particularly dark period, he encounters Dwayne, an intense and charismatic zealot, who recruits Aaron for Gentlemen’s Fury, an underground tennis league that just might not be strictly about tennis.As Aaron soon finds out, all of the players in Gentlemen’s Fury are former ATP players who, for one reason or another, have been excused from the tour. While the pay is nice, the rules turn out to be ambiguous and increasingly deadly. As the film unfolds, Dwayne transforms from savior to pariah while Aaron struggles at first to keep up, then just to stay alive.Who we areBen Sharples (Writer, Director, Producer, Aaron Faust) Ben can most recently be seen in Takashi Shimizu’s horror film, 7500.

My current project, a NEW Five-Part Installation Series titled OUT ME IN ME OUT © includes an extensive group of 16 cast-Lucite figures which will be the components of several site-specific installations. All of the figures will be animals, 8 of them human, and 8 of them not.This Kickstarter Campaign is to raise the funds for Part One, that will include 4 out of the 16 figures and will take approximately one year to complete from the time the fundraiser ends.The sole purpose of OUT ME IN ME OUT© is toaddress concerns about where humans as a species are headed, especially with respect to the increasingly isolated and insulated position of the individual within “the pack.” When I say ""pack"", I am referring to pack animals, like humans, wolves, and any other species that need its members in order to hunt with, live with, and survive.Each part of this Five-Part Series builds upon the next to tell a story that explores my personal experience in ""the pack"" and its poignant connection between alienation, the body and the self. This subject matter is not only a deep concern of mine, but seems to be a topic of concern among many different people from many different walks of life for many different reasons. It is profound enough, that I am dedicating an entire body of work to it.I think it will be incredibly helpful to give you some detailed information - in addition to what you may have learned from my video - about how this installation is taking shape. Something that is very important to me is that I am hand-sculpting every single life-size figure in clay for all Five-Parts of this Series. From these clay figures the molds will be made and the finals will be cast in the solid clear Lucite. The figure of me, that you see below, is the first of the 16 clay figures that I have already completed.The next image you see, a life-size Lucite prototype of my head, is an example of what the figures will look like once they have been translated into the solid clear Lucite.When these Lucite figures are finished, floating inside each of their clear bodies will be embedded sub-sculptures of thevascular system and some of the bone (as seen in the following image).These sub-sculptures are meant to connect receptors of the body like the eyes, ears, and mouth, with other internal parts of the body. The passageways or pathways that I am forming, are metaphors for how information comes into our body, and is then interpreted and transformed into messages, emotions and finally reactions.Another connecting element of this installation, which links together one living creature to another, will be milk in the form of white Lucite puddles and suspended Lucite clouds. Similar to the vascular system embedments, the milk will also delineate a different but equally important type of passageway or pathway. Below is an photo montage of a mouse, a fly, connected by milk.The reason I have chosen Lucite as the material for all of the components in OUT ME IN ME OUT© is because there is no other material that conveys the ideas and sentiment of this piece with such poignancy. The transparency or lack there of, the reflections within the solid material - broken and intact, and its dense physical strength in contrast to its varying properties of light, are the conflicting elements that when combined together make Lucite so totally unique. These conflicts, like those in humans, are what can draw you in and push you away at the same time. What can seduceyou and seconds later repel you. When used with intent and vision, this everyday and often miss-used material can transcend its original meaning and take on a new identity, becoming a necessary element in what I feel is a very important dialog about humanity.It is of course then, no surprise that the largest portion of funds raised will pay for the production of the figures when they are translated from clay into the beautiful solid clear Lucite. The materials and process are complicated and need very controlled conditions to produce a product that is archival and free of imperfections.The fabrication team at Meisner Acrylic Casting in Long Island, N.Y. has been the top of their game for decades. Mitch Meisner, the owner, is not only on board with this project, he believes in it, and is waiting for my green light.The first clay figure is at his facility and we are ready to go!With your potential donation, I can pay the production costs needed to work with Meisner Acrylic Casting, andpay for my in-studio production materials for the next three figures, and the milk puddles and clouds. The costs include welding materials, along with rebar and wood to build the armatures. Oil-based clay, and mold-making materials like rubber and plaster to form the figures and construct the mold. Plus various costs for shipping supplies and heating and cooling within my studio's (paper thin!) walls. Since my studio is on my property, there is minimal overhead.You might be wondering why the Kickstarter route rather than the Grant Funding route. While my past installations were created with the generous help and support from ThePollock-KrasnerFoundation, TheEbenDemarestTrustFund, and TheMemorialFoundationForJewishCultureFoundation, this project in its beginning stage, is better suited for a platform such as Kickstarter due to its large size and scope.I've been pondering OUT ME IN ME OUT © for the last decade, and this subject matter for a lifetime. This piece deals directly with the detrimental aspects of alienation within society, within the self, and how this tears us away from what it is to be human. Conversely, it illuminates the profound importance of human connectivity. For all of us who are trying to stay connected to ourselves, to other fellow humans, fellow animals, and nature, in the age of instantaneous gratification and sublime distraction, I believe a dialog about this subject matter is not only highly relevant, but imperative. It is my wish that this installation provide a vital platform for discussion among people of all ages now, and maybe even in the future.With your help, I can keep this Five-Part Series alive. I am confident, based upon my past experiences of producing large-scale pieces, that once I have the funds needed for Part One, I can generate the funds for Parts Two, Three, Four, and Five through other venues.With my warmest regards and profound thanks for your time,BethP.S.Don't forget to check out my Donor Rewards- details to the right, images down below!P.P.S.To hear an exclusive 50 min radio interview aboutOUT ME IN ME OUT, tune into THE RIGHT SPACE Podcast by clicking here.

I love you so very much in every way shape and form. Thank you!The NYC Crew at 72nd & West End- There are no words to describe what you have done for me. I cherish you all.","OUT ME IN ME OUT ©, at face value, is a huge undertaking. There's no other way to describe it. But like all of my work, I think it through. I plot it out, and I DO IT. I love huge undertakings! Strategically, this new work has been broken up into a Five-Part Series. This approach will not only enable me to methodically tell a very personal and somewhat global story, but will also insure that I accomplish my goal of creating the final installation of all 16 figures with efficiency. Since I have already surpassed the challenges of finishing the first life-size clay figure and mold (as seen in my video and above images), the major technical bumps regarding the other 3 figures for this first installation of Part One have already been ironed out. Because of the nature of the pose, this first figure was by far the most complicated of the16 figures that I plan to build. I learned invaluable lessons by taking on this more difficult component right out of the gate. The confidence that enables me to attempt, and successfully complete such large projects with such unbridled passion comes from the fact that I have been working with industrial materials for my entire life and I believe in what I do. I have always anticipated and confronted any challenges and limitations that have come my way and have never had a problem switching gears, or finding new avenues to make what I want to happen, HAPPEN. Without sacrificing the meaning or integrity my work, I have been able to allow my original ideas to evolve as the parameters of the process take shape. Of equal importance, my time frame, goals, and use of allocated funds from institutions, and especially individuals, are treated with the upmost respect, consideration, and gratitude. Making work on a large scale is a group effort, and for me an act of love.  It is my hope that I can inspire your confidence in OUT ME IN ME OUT © in the same way I have gained the trust of institutions like The Pollock-Krasner Foundation, The Eben Demarest Trust Fund, The Memorial Foundation for Jewish Culture and now Meisner Acrylic Casting. It would be a dream come true (literally) if I could have the opportunity to bring this new and relevant series of installations to life. These installations actually come from specific dreams!Again, thank you for your time and interest in my campaign.

Feel free to read the update about Iliad House's next step, and then followthe linkaboveto the next campaign when it launches early September 2013!*******************************************************************************************************To supportIliad House, just click the GREEN button to the right of the screen. All you need is an Amazon account, and you will only be charged if we meet our goal by August 31!For the latest news and information, follow us on Facebook and Twitter! And if you'd like Iliad House to happen, be sure to SHARE and TWEET us out to your friends!Iliad House will be an ongoing, independent audio drama, clocking in at about half an hour per episode. For you folk unfamiliar with the term “audio drama,” it’s like a talking book but better because instead of one narrator it’s an entire world come alive with characters, sounds, and music. There is no visual stimulation, so it fully engages a listener’s imagination. Our target demographic is 8–14-year-olds and anyone who enjoys great stories well told. Wonder, excitement, adventure—it’s all here in Iliad House. With this campaign, we're going to fund the show's pilot mini-series followed by the first full season of 12 episodes!Why call it Iliad House? Well, we’ll just leave with you with this: The Iliad by Homer is an ancient, epic poem about a war among gods and kings. Iliad House is also about a war, but instead of flesh and blood it is against the principalities of this present darkness. We’re going to explore some rather intense subject matter and stories, but in a fun, funny, and engaging way that offers real answers and hope. Fourteen-year-old orphan Jesse Davidson lives with his emotionally-distant and peculiar uncle Christopher Portalis in the Iliad House, a mysterious old mansion on an island off the east coast of the United States.Just when Jesse is finally getting used to living on the island, he discovers that the old abandoned train he and his friends have been using as a clubhouse for the past year can actually move—through time!They get caught up in a series of adventures fraught with temporal distortions, political intrigue, secret societies, and supernatural battles, all as they try to cope with the daily pressures and craziness of adolescence.While traveling through the future and the past, they learn hard truths and secrets about themselves, and that there is forgiveness and redemption available to all who desire it. And, as Jesse and his uncle come to understand each other, Jesse begins to see that there is much more to Iliad House, and to why he and his uncle are there, than anyone realizes.Jesse Davidson—14Orphaned, redheaded, lanky, a bit clumsy, he is always going where people tell him not to go, and doing what people warn him against, and attempting things he has no business attempting. He does these things for fun, and adventure, and to escape boredom, and to prove his mettle and worth. But mostly he does them to, as he puts it, “find an answer.” An answer to what, he is not certain. He only knows that all of his life, he has felt as though something was missing, something important, and he needs to find out what it is.Christopher Portalis—mid-30sJesse’s genius uncle. If not exactly a recluse, he’s the closest thing to it. Tall, lean, a good looker, Portalis holds PhDs in philosophy, history, and theoretical physics, and taught those subjects along with natural and revealed religions at the Patriot Heritage University. But then came a higher calling—a life’s mission, if you will—that brought him to Iliad House.Stu Martin—14Jesse’s good friend. He’s a brain-trust physics wiz who wins all the science awards and rides around on his own self-built, electronic-computerized scooter. But Jesse soon realizes that there’s more to Stu than just gadgets and tech.Cassandra Wilson—14Another of Jesse’s friends. Pretty, wild-eyed, disheveled, she claims to see the future. Jesse finds her equally annoying and amusing. (And she kinda scares Stu, but that’s nothing new.) Her attitude is mostly a cover, though, because, like Jesse, she’s looking for something important, but she doesn’t know where to start.Mrs. McKenzie Emily Delanie aka ""Mrs. McEd""—mid-50sThe housekeeper for Iliad House. Widowed, Scottish, stout, sheis a cross between Mrs. Doubtfire and Marilla Cuthbert from Anne of GreenGables, which is to say, she is stern, strong, kindhearted, or loving as theoccasion warrants, and sometimes all four at the same time. She’s the closestthing to a mother Jesse has ever known.""The Butler""—?A robot created by Professor Portalis. It helps him with quick answers and analysis, as well as providing him with his cloak, his pipe, and a nice strong cup of Earl Grey. The Butler is a combination of Iron Man/Tony Stark’s Jarvis, and Marvin the manic-depressive paranoid android from The Hitchhiker’s Guide to the Galaxy. He is Spock to Mrs. McEd’s McCoy, which is to say, most of the time they don’t get along. (His name has yet to be determined, but one fantastic person will get to name it by choosing the Name the Butler reward level!).If you’re familiar with Phil’s work in previous shows (*cough*Adventures in Odyssey*cough*Jungle Jam and Friends*cough*), you’ll recognize a lot of the cast of Iliad House. For example, the famous and wonderful Katie Leigh, who plays Connie in Adventures in Odyssey!And, well, Phil Lollar!We'll be announcing more cast members throughout the campaign!The adventure takes place on a small island off the eastern coast of the US not terribly far from the landing place of John Smith and his colonial adventurers. Originally inhabited by Native Americans, Verity Island is now a sleepy place of wooded trails generally looked down on by the inhabitants of Verity City just across the Prudence River Bridge. The city folk think that the people of Verity Village are too strange and ""the wrong sort."" Some say that the oddness of those who live on the island dates back to the building of the train depot in the woods while others say it goes back even further to the glory days of Fort Verity whose ruins still guard the island's north shore. The funny thing is, the strange folks in Verity Village are normal compared to the even more unusual Professor who has taken up residence down past the rock formation on the southern tip of the island in a mysterious place called Iliad House. Quick version: This all started in late 2012 at a conference where many of us, including Phil, were teaching audio drama production to middle and high schoolers. After a few days, we found that we really respected each other and decided to create a new audio drama together. Thus, Iliad House and our partnership, Guess What LLC, were born. We’ll share more about the rest of the Guess What team as the campaign progresses, but we'll start with Phil Lollar, the creative director, showrunner, head writer, and overall audio drama maestro. He has co-created, written, and worked on a ton of stuff. Adventures in Odyssey, Jungle Jam and Friends, Little Dogs on the Prairie—read his bio for more!Did we say that we are excited about some of the awesome talent that we have?First, our concept artist is Cliff Cramp (check out his sweet website). One of our favorite ways to tell our friends about Cliff is to grab a Star Wars Blu-ray set and hand it to them. ""Cliff did all that cover art, and he is doing the art for Iliad House."" We love having him involved.Our musician is a cool guy too. Justin R. Durban (also has a sweet website) is best known for his work scoring music for film trailers for movies like James Cameron's Avatar, Pixar's Brave, and Harry Potter and the Order of the Phoenix. He did the Iliad House theme music, and we can't stop playing it in our heads.So, what exactly does this project fund? The answer is a pilot mini-series and then the first season (12 glorious half-hour episodes) of Iliad House, to be distributed by CD and online! To do that, we need to pay for at least five key things:1. Excellent actors who will play Jesse, Cassandra, Stu, and, of course, Professor Christopher Portalis. 2. Custom music to help build the tension, mystery, and whimsy. 3. Vibrant sound design to bring the story to life. 4. A website so you can download the newest episodes. 5. Replicating CDs for distribution. (They make great stocking stuffers, hint hint.) We want to deliver an incredible experience to all of you who support us, and we plan to be the best stewards we can be of that support. We decided to use Kickstarter because we want a directconnection with you, our audience. We want to give audio drama fans a chanceto decide if they would like to hear a story about a boy with a crazy mysteriousuncle. Of course you do, but Kickstarter lets us (and you) be sure. Iliad Houseis an independent project by Phil Lollar and a small team—there is no sea ofmiddlemen—it’s just us telling great stories and giving them directly to you.Without you, what's the point?When we say, 'independent project,' we mean REALLY independent. Iliad House is a completely new, original show, unaffiliated with Focus on the Family or Adventures in Odyssey, or anybody else except me (Phil) and my team at Guess What, LLC.As you may have noticed, we have put some serious thought into the rewards that come with the different backing tiers for this Kickstarter. You can get get downloads, CDs, digital art, music, autographed stuff, limited edition numbering, the ability to name characters, and even a chance to party with Phil at Disneyland. (Most of us have been to a Disney park with Phil, and it is a blast, except Phil is constantly hearing a voice in a ride and saying, ""I know that voice actor. I think he owes me a lunch . . ."")Regardless, we put a lot of thought into the prizes, and they are awesome, so check them out. Once we have successfully completed the campaign, we plan to have the last of the rewards delivered to you by February 2014! (Of course you will start receiving the rewards as fast as we make them and get them out, so keep your eyes peeled!)But here is some really cool stuff. If we reach some of our stretch goals (goals past our minimum Kickstarter funding requirement) EVERYONE benefits.This is how stretch goals work: We reach a benchmark and we throw a party! For example, let's see what happens if we raise $150,000 on Kickstarter. After we complete the pilot mini-series and the first season, we will make a special prequel of the professor's awesome back story and sell it on the Iliad House website (all the fans win!). Even better, anyone who gives $20 or more to the Kickstarter campaign will get a free digital copy of this prequel because we know that we will only achieve these stretch goals if you help spread the word. So tell your friends!Here are our official stretch goals:$150,000—Three-episode prequel for the Professor Portalis's backstory! Everyone who pledges at $20 or above gets a digital copy!$200,000—The second season of Iliad House. Everyone who pledges at $20 and above will receive a digital copy!$250,000—Everyone who pledges at $20 or above will receive a deluxe digital map of the mysterious island! $45 or above will receive a deluxe physical map of the island!$300,000—The third season of Iliad House. Everyone who pledges at $20 or above will receive a digital copy!$350,000—Phil Lollar and the cast will do a live recording of a very special episode! The event will be in LA at a to be determined date and will be live broadcast online around the world!$400,000—Yes, we’ll totally do a fourth season if we reach this stretch goal. But if we get to $400,000, we’ll also unveil part of our master plan hinting at a huge development to come after the end of the third season. Get the campaign up to this level, and we’ll tell you what that is. Otherwise, we’re keeping our lips sealed on this one.Check out the coverage Iliad House has received so far!PressCrossMapChristian NewsWireChristian PostChristian TodaySmashing Interviews MagazineSEK VoiceWNDPodcastsAudio Theatre CentralBlimey CowVoxy LadiesBlogsAdventures in Odyssey BlogAIO UpdateCranachEncounter Gospel NewsGeneration Joshua (part I, II, and III)Odyssey ScoopPreschoolers and PeaceRaven's Landing","The good news is that that we have an awesome team! Phil clearly is the creative genius who has inspired millions of kids with his previous work. But the rest of the core team is pretty fantastic. We have two people who run large budgets, a radio producer, three members who have worked extensively on feature films, and someone who has coordinated projects of up to 2,000 volunteers/staff in 15 different states all crammed into five days. This team is impressive because of their broad experience. Between them they are marketers, actors, bloggers, published authors, carry extensive social media experience, and distribute products all over the country. While the audio drama business is new to some of us, and all creative projects face unforeseen challenges throughout the course of production, we have a team that excels at problem solving. We have also already begun to write the scripts and have access to a great studio, which will help minimize risks due to cost and cut down delay in the delivery of the final product—which is key to the success of a creative project. We are convinced that with your help, we can do this if you fund this project and spread the word to your friends.

Yes). The two started working on Red Origins as a hobby two years ago before they realized they had written a fun and exciting story that retold African Oral Folklore and introduced Juju to the world. Onyi and Obi then created Kolanut Productions, an independent production company, in order to bring their characters to life. Now with your help Kolanut Productions can bring this original series to life.We are raising funds to pay animators, writers, and editors to put out a top quality pilot episode for Red Origins. We currently have several artist on standby waiting for us reach our financial goals. After we finish the pilot we will use our access to various networks to get Red Origins aired. If the network route isn't to our advantage then the Red Origins team will put out a web based series. We are determined to share this story with the world at all costs (that we can afford).WE WILL STILL PUT OUT THE PILOT WHEN WE REACH OUR GOAL                        BUT...","To complete this project two more writers and an editor will have to be added to the team, along with two concept artist, animation director, storyboarder, and three more animators. Finding artists that can work with a strict budget is also a challenge that the team will have to face. That being said the Red Origins team knows that they are well equipped to handle these tasks, because for the past two years we've been funding Red Origins with limited funds. In fact most people do not know that both the creators, Obi and Onyi Udeh, had to fund the project from their own checks every two weeks for the two years. Creator of Red Origins Onyi would literally take out the cover of rent and the allowance of one hundred and fifty dollars for food and the rest of the fund for the month would go directly to Red Origins. Creator Obi went as far as to go back to living with his parents, pick up three jobs, and ignore loan payments to keep the project moving. If two individuals are willing to sacrifice their hard earnings for two year and produce great work with a mediocre budget then it is safe to assume they are qualified to see this project completed through any adversity.",https://www.kickstarter.com/projects/redorigins/red-origins-an-original-animated-series?ref=discovery_category_newest,redorigins/red-origins-an-original-animated-series,"RED ORIGINS is an African animated series created by Kolanut Productions, an up and coming independentanimation, comic, and game productions company. Kolanut Productions focuses on providing diverse media that is predominantly centered on, but not exclusive to the untapped and emerging market of African Magical Futurism. We need your help to tell the GREATEST STORY NEVER TOLD!Onyi and Obi collaborated on Red Origins two years ago, at first as an extracurricular project, but eventually they realized they had potentially written an exciting story that would explore African Oral Folklore and introduce the fascinating concept of Juju to the world. Ambitiously enough the Udeh brothers then established Kolanut Productions, an independent production company, in hopes of bringing their characters and various ideas to life. With your help and generosity that hope can become a reality! Currently our production company is working diligently to raise funds in order to pay animators, writers, and editors and also to ensure a top quality pilot episode for fans and contributors. Kolanut has several artists on standby waiting for us reach our financial goals and after we’re successful in finishing the pilot we will collaborate with the various networks we have access to and finally get Red Origins aired! If we are unsuccessful going down this route that will not be the end of our efforts. The Red Origins team will then shift focus to creating web based series instead. As you see we are determined to share this story with the world because of how appreciative we know anime fans as well as cartoon fans will be to see something completely new and intriguing.Red Origins is a show that follows Obi, Temi and John as they mystically get transported to Neo Africa in 2070. Upon arrival they mistakenly break a bronze taboo and are forced to join a Peacekeeping Magical Juju Force. In order to return home they must help stop a brewing war between Ancestral Africa and Neo Technological Africa. It is spell casting magical juju daggers versus energy wave cannons; which side will you take? Whatever side you take get ready for a clash that will surely shake the entire world, on Red Origins!OBIObi at first glance seems like a very timid and unsure of himself 10 year old. However, when a situation occurs, Obi will jump into action, even if the initiative does not meet with the  needed action. He is very protective of people he cares for and their belongings. All of this is due to him having the mindset of anything that he would want others to do for him, he will do for them.Originally hailing from a village Abuja, Nigeria, Obi has had to move several times around America due to his father’s work as a scientist/ eco-engineer that has been developing new and exciting machines, finally stopping in a small suburb in Southern California. Obi, being quite skilled in soccer, caught the attention of John and Temi due to his spectacular skills after practically single-handedly winning a game against high schoolers.After joining the Juju Corps, Obi finds himself with several abilities, his most prominent being his keloid hand, which can increase in size and turn into rock, useful for absorbing attacks as well as dishing them out. Obi is also a practitioner of kisu-juju, magic using a juju knife to cut magical symbols into the air to change reality. Obi also has an innate ability to move into other peoples dreams and have glimpses of the future in his own when he goes to sleep. However, he has little control of when he uses this ability.JOHNJohn Guzman is an 11 year old that lives in the same neighborhood as Obi. Living with his archaeologist father, John, the trouble making jokester, was known to be an active friend of many of the bullies that populated his school. It was not until he befriended Temi and Obi when he finally changed his ways and developed into his natural amicable personality. Temi was the first person to see John for being much more than a clown in addition to the fact that he enjoys soccer just as much as Temi and Obi. In addition to the overall general adventure of the group John will be on his own personal adventure seeking answers about his own heritage and background. John has the ability to put on the different masks of African masquerades and take on the appearance and abilities of that masquerade. John has a knack for befriending people, and many along the way will join our heroes’ cause due to it.TEMITemi Edwards, 10, is an orphan living in America, Temi is a skilled acrobat as well as tech savvy whiz kid and martial arts expert. Before befriending Obi and John, Temi kept to herself, dedicating most of her time to computer programs and toying around with hardware. Temi lends the skills she learned to the team by gathering information on locations they travel to as well as having incredible Juju power. Temi in this journey will find out more about her heritage and have a purpose in life she could never imagine.

What's more, I have personally funded every single expense associated with EV's production.As you've probably guessed, EV Mag is like a child to me and I’m extremely proud of how far we’ve come together.But like all children must, it's now time for EV Mag to ""grow up.""My Vision:My vision for EV Mag is to grow it into the most professional and most highly respected source of visionary inspiration for the outdoor photographer.What does this entail?In short...• I want to bring you the absolute crème de la crème of landscape, nature, wildlife, astro, marine, street, action and adventure photographers from around the world to share their artistic insights and visionary workflows.• I want to further develop and refine the app platform to make it even more intuitive, interactive and engaging.• I want to employ a top-notch production team to give EV Mag an even more highly polished look and feel.• I want to publish a full-length, content-rich magazine every fortnight rather than monthly.• I want toselectivelymarket EV Mag to actively grow its readership.And I want to do all of this without having to flood the magazine with advertising.Now in order to finance this growth while preserving my founding vision of keeping EV Mag free of advertising clutter, I have no choice other than to start charging for future issues of EV Mag.So as of January 1, 2016, all future issues of EV Mag will be sold through iTunes and Google Play for US$6.99 per issue.Which brings us to this KickStarter project. Funding Goal:In order achieve this vision, I first need to raise sufficient funds that will enable me to employ a crack publishing team as well as pay for world-class photographers worthy of the cover price.So how much do I need to transform EV Mag into a truly professional publication?Just USD $38,000 which on today’s exchange rate with the kiwi dollar works out to around NZD $57,000.IMPORTANT: All figures in this KickStarter project are in New Zealand dollars. As a ball-park guide, NZD$1.00 converts to roughly USD$0.66 or £0.47Next Steps:As soon as we reach our funding goal, I will immediately get to work securing a production team as well as top-shelf content with a view of releasing the first ""Pro"" issue of EV Mag by January 1, 2016.Again, if you haven't already done so, I encourage you to freely download Issue #32 of EV Mag to get a taste of the current calibre of EV Mag. And if you love what you see now, just imagine how much more inspirational our Pro issues are going to be.Bonus Rewards:In addition to the Rewards detailed in the right hand column of this page, as soon as you back this project, you will automatically go into the draw to win your choice of either...-> A brand new 128Gb 4G iPad Procomplete with Apple Pencil (valued at $1,178.00)OR-> A top-of-the-line Really Right Stuff tripod kit (Valued at $1,340.00).Now there are not one, not two but three of these prizes to be won.Just to be clear, should you be one of the three lucky backers randomly selected as a winner, you will get to choose which one of these two prizes you receive.

And I should also mention that of course, if you're a winner, your pledge must first be honoured before you'll receive your prize.Again, as soon as you back this project you will automatically go into the draw to win one of these three amazing prizes.","There is minimal risk for everyone involved. I have been publishing EV Mag each and every month for the past three years entirely at my own expense - so clearly, this is nothing new for me. On the proviso that this project reaches its goal, I am 100% committed to making EV Mag even more spectacular and inspirational for years to come.My heart-felt thanks to you for taking EV Mag to new heights .",https://www.kickstarter.com/projects/494646698/extraordinary-vision-mag-your-source-of-photo-insp?ref=discovery_category_newest,494646698/extraordinary-vision-mag-your-source-of-photo-insp,"Humble Beginnings:When I first started taking photos 22 years ago, I was young and free. With no commitments outside of work, my weekends, holidays and summer twilight hours would almost invariably be spent in wild places taking photos.At the time, nothing gave me greater joy than being immersed in nature, mesmerized by the changing light, attempting to capture on film what I had envisioned in my mind. Those care-free days, however, were short lived. As any parent can appreciate, my decision to get married and start a family brought with it responsibilities and time restraints which combined, put my outdoor photography on hold.Fast forward 12 years, with my children more independent and my free time more flexible, in 2012, I was overjoyed to once again get behind my camera.My Dilema:Problem was, during my hiatus, photography had undergone a massive transformation. Having learned photography shooting slide film, I was faced with the daunting prospect of having to scale digital photography's steep learning curve.In an effort to bring myself up to speed, I devoured every digital photography article, magazine and online video I could find.To my dismay though, rather than be inspired, the insidious message I received was that to create great images, one had to spend tens of thousands of dollars on the latest equipment; spend more time in front of a screen editing than behind a camera shooting; and travel to exotic locations seeking stunning subjects to shoot. Creativity-Crushing Lie:At first, I thought I was the only one who felt this way. However, on speaking with friends and fellow photo-enthusiasts, the vast majority admitted that they too believed they could never take beautiful photos on the grounds they did not have the necessary time nor money to invest in equipment, editing or travel.Disempowered by this lie, millions understandably label themselves as average or even below-average photographers. In turn, this creativity-killing self-imagestops them from experiencing the incredible joy derived from consistently creating emotionally evocative images.Liberating Truth:In search of encouragement, I re-read the classic that inspired me to take up photography in the first pace: the late Galen Rowell’s phenomenal best-seller, Mountain Light.What sets this masterpiece apart from virtually all other contemporary photographic literature is its conviction that the ultimate source of photographic power is creative vision: i.e. your ability to see the extraordinary in the ordinary. In short, by simply tapping in to your inner creative vision, you too can create stunning images that captivate audiences regardless of what camera you own, what software you use or what subject you shoot.Inspired Decision:Tired of mainstream outdoor photography magazines largely overlooking this source of evocative power in favour of more formulaic articles about shooting techniques, editing tricks and equipment reviews - - all buried under a mountain of ads - - I decided to create a stunning digital magazine dedicated to helping you discover and refine your inner creative genius.Unexpected Success:What began as a part-time hobby-on-the-side rapidly took on a life of its own, exploding in popularity to become the number one outdoor photography magazine in iTunes. To date, EV Mag has been read by over 88,000 photographers from around the world and has received 1,052 five-star reviews from 18 different countries.If you've never experienced the quality and joy of EV Mag, I encourage you to download Issue #32 for free right now from iTunes or Google Play. While I am very proud of how well EV Mag has been received to date, I am driven to take EV Mag to greater heights through a commitment tothree guiding principles:1. Aspiration: Everything EV publishes must first and foremostenhance your desire to, andelevate your self-belief that you can create stunning images. Our over-riding goal is to facilitate a deeper level of joy you experience from your photography - regardless of what camera you own, what software you use or what location you live.2. Inspiration: To facilitate your ability to create stunning images, everything EV publishes must focus on expanding your creative vision. EV will accomplish this in a number of ways, including sharing the visionary insights of the world's most talented photographers; ""look-over-my-shoulder"" styled in-the-field instructional videos; creativity-critiques; artistic exploration; and technical education, to name but a few.3. Contribution: Creative expression possesses the power to not only nurture our own spirits, but to also uplift the spirits of others. In this way, EV hopes to serve as a shining light that brightens your creative flame so that, in turn, you can spread your light onto others.In line with this, EV will engage in activities and share stories that demonstrate how photography is helping to make our social and physical world a better place for all to live.As an example, I plan to organise a number of eco-photo tours designed to fulfil three primary goals:• Support worthy social and environmental projects through the donation of our photography to these causes as well as the promotion of their efforts through EV's social channels;• Facilitate personal, emotional and spiritual growth of participants through connection, compassion and contribution;• Provide participants with a uniquely rich source of photo-inspiration and education.As a natural extension of this desire to effect positive change through photography, 10% of EV's profits will be donated to amazing charities such Virgin Unite and Kiva.This third guiding principle of contribution is a very personal aspiration that I'm extremely passionate about and I'm confident that once you get a taste of this vision, you too will draw inspiration and expand the boundaries of what you believe is possible through photography.Funding Growth:As you may or may not know, all 32 regular issues of EV Mag to date have been published completely at my own expense (costing me approx. $1,500 per month) and at no stage have I ever charged a single penny for a regular issue.As you can imagine,taking EV to the next level requires an injection of significant time, money and energy... much more than I can provide on my own. So to bring my expanded vision to life, I clearly need help.Of course, one way to raise capital would be to load EV Mag with a bunch of ads. However, this would go completely against the core philosophy of EV Mag - namely, that the true source of joy and emotional power of photography comes from your creative vision. By having a bunch of ads encouraging you to buy gear I would be sending a false and disempowering message that gear is more important than vision. So getting advertisers to fund our growth is philosophically incongruent.That then leaves charging a cover price for each issue as the only other alternative. This, I believe, is the fairest way to deliver value to those who genuinely seek and appreciate quality.As such, EV is about to transition from a free to a paid publication.Funding Goals:However, this creates a catch-22. To generate revenue from a paid magazine, I need top-shelf content. But to get top-shelf photographers to contribute to a paid magazine, I need revenue to pay them.Hence, the purpose of the KickStarter campaign: to fund the initial transition from free to paid publication which will in turn enable EV to manifest its vision in a sustainable and professional manner.So how much do I need to fund the publication and marketing of three new issues, after which subscription revenue will fund further growth?Just $15,000 New Zealand dollars, which on today’s exchange rateequates to roughly US$10,000.Budgetary Breakdown:Here's a budgetary breakdown of how I intend to invest these funds (in US dollars):• $4,500 - Contributor fees (i.e. to remunerate contributing authors for their time, knowledge and content)• $1,500 - Wages and outsourcing fees• $1,000 -Marketing to attract new subscribers• $1,000 - KickStarter Fee• $1,000 - App + web + social media re-development• $1,000 - Audio-visual equipment for in-the-field video tutorialsIMPORTANT: All figures in this KickStarter project are in New Zealand dollars. As a ball-park guide, NZD$1.00 converts to roughly USD$0.66 or £0.47Next Steps:As soon as we reach our funding goal, I will immediately get to work securing a production team as well as top-shelf content with a view of releasing the first ""Pro"" issue of  EV Mag by May 1, 2016. Again, if you haven't already done so, I encourage you to freely download Issue #32 of EV Mag to get a taste of the current calibre of EV Mag. And if you love what you see now, just imagine how much more inspirational our Pro-issues are going to be.Finally, should we raise funds over and above our target, these will be invested in the production of future issues as well as bring forward the organisation of our first eco photo-tour.  ","There is minimal risk for everyone involved. I have been publishing EV Mag each and every month for the past three years entirely at my own expense - so clearly, this is nothing new for me.Regardless of the outcome of this project, I am 100% committed to making EV Mag even more spectacular and inspirational for years to come. However, this journey will be made easier and faster should this campaign reach its goal:)My heart-felt thanks to you for helping lift EV Mag to new heights."
https://www.kickstarter.com/projects/bigwalloncityhall/bolde-burlesque?ref=discovery_category_newest,bigwalloncityhall/bolde-burlesque,"Hi, I'm Ray Harvey. My story begins a few years ago when I watched a program about actor Jeff Bridges. It showed his love affair with panoramic photography using this odd camera called a Panon Widelux. The cool thing about this camera is that the lens doesn't point out the front. Its actually gear driven so it moves. The lens swings from left to right. This allows it to capture a true panoramic view much like you see when you move your head from side to side. This camera can shoot both ends of a street at the same time, both ends of the playing field at the same time and the audience and performer at the same time. I never dreamed I could ever find one of these cameras let alone own one, but a gift from my wife changed that! I have been shooting my own panoramic photos for several years now.The IdeaTheres something special about how this ""Old School"" camera sees a subject. So I wanted to do a series of a vintage genre. And then I wanted to bring the photos to the public showing what this fabulous camera can do. Fortunately for me, a few months earlier I was introduced to someone special, Danielle Colby, the tattooed beauty of ""American Pickers."" This History Channel's show has made her a household personality every week for lovers of vintage stuff. But many aren't aware that she has her own dance troupe named Burlesque Le' Moustache. Burlesque is a very important element of her life. I pitched the idea to her of doing for Burlesque what Degas had done for ballet. The performance art of Burlesque began in the nineteenth century and remains strong today. I imagined dark theaters, a raucous audience, flamboyant costumes and one old camera. I wanted to photograph this vintage art form in all it's beauty using a 1940's designed, low-tech, manual film camera. Sometimes crazy makes sense and this time it did! She loved the idea and not only invited me to one of her troupe's shows but gave me an all-access pass to the Iowa Burlesque Festival. The door was open and all I had to do was walk through. This is how my photo series Bold'e Burlesqu'e began!The Big NightI walked into that theater with my Widelux and a pile of film and came out with images of an art form not usually viewed by mainstream America. I was in the audience, I was in the green room, I was in the dressing room and I was onstage when Danielle and the other dancers wowed the crowd. I compiled not only the expected pictures of dancers but the essence of ""behind the curtain"" Burlesque. As I've said there is something special about how this particular camera tells a story.With it's almost 180 degree view, it saw backstage, the dancer and the crowds response all at once. No other camera does this. It saw girls preparing on both sides of the dressing room at once. It saw in front of the curtain and behind the curtain in one shot.The photos have been developed but it's time to take it to the public. It's time to bring Burlesque back to the forefront as the popular and stylish art form as it has always been.Where does the money go? How it works:First, at Kickstarter it's a little different. Unless 100 percent of my funding goal is reached, NONE of the funding is received and you don't pay a cent. So, if you feel strongly about sponsoring this project and really desire the gifts, please help promote it to your friends by sharing the link!The money will fund the printing, matting, framing of the photo collection as well as advertising and logistics for the exhibit. Any unused or additional money will be put toward future shows.ChallengeNow I want to bring to you what my camera saw that evening. What I hope to be the first exhibit of many, Gallery Zeke has invited me to exhibit this collection of photographs beginning May 1st. I want this to be a kick-off to other shows in other cities like Davenport where the show played and in Chicago where many of the dancers are from. For the exhibit I need a minimum of twelve images printed and framed for display. Panoramic photos are best viewed large and some of these images will be printed up to five feet wide. I also need printed inventory for purchase during the show and on-line. The photos are developed and scanned but, your commitment to this project will continue the progress of my series.RewardsThere is absolutely no way this exhibit will be a reality without you. I am very proud of what I've completed and I'm offering some very collectable gifts.After pledging your support, please feel free to share this link with anyone and everyone whom you think would enjoy the project.Thank you for your support.","The first show opens very soon. It is a ""GO."" All images will need to be re-scanned for quality and size. Prints need to be made, matted and then framed. Promotion of the May 1st show will need to be planned in conjunction with art production. This is quite a challenge for me but I am confident it will succeed. With the success of this first show I will need to use it as a springboard for exhibits at other galleries. That usually takes much time and a lot of convincing. I can imagine Bold'e Burlesqu'e going on to be  viewed by thousands in galleries across the midwest. What was old is now new again!",https://www.kickstarter.com/projects/bigwalloncityhall/the-big-wall-on-city-hall-painting-americas-hometown?ref=discovery_category_newest,bigwalloncityhall/the-big-wall-on-city-hall-painting-americas-hometown,"The Big Idea!As a muralist I’m always on the hunt for a good wall canvas. This time, it found me! I was contacted by Mayor Hark of Hannibal, Missouri. A bicentennial year only happens once and he had a vision of a large scale mural welcoming the city’s visitors on none other than City Hall. The big wall measures around seventy feet wide by forty feet tall. Adjacent to the city hall once stood another building which has since been removed. This has left a less than attractive brick facade that isn’t very impressive for the towns most public building.I have the vision to cover the entire east wall with a full color Hannibal themed art mural. The scene was designed to be a visual logo of the city for visitors and residents alike. The art will not be political, or agenda based in any way. It will simply be a beautiful painting that can be used as a photo-op location, town promotion and a place of pride for all in the area. The design isn’t 100% final but it will include Hannibal’s most famous son, Samuel Clemens, Molly Brown and river themes such as a steamboat, eagle and a Huckleberry-looking boy. As the initial artist’ rendering is made more public there may be alterations in layout or content. The wall is on Broadway downtown and can be seen from many directions.Help paint the wall!The campaign goal is $15,000. A lot of money, but necessary to create a very important image on a very big wall that will become the destination point for the beautiful city of Hannibal. A very large hydraulic lift will be rented to reach the heights of the wall. I will be using very expensive silicate paint as the primary material. This paint is made with the same ingredients as cement so it becomes one with the brick wall. It allows the surface to breath so as not to damage the brick surface over time. The paint will not fade, peel or blister as typical latex paints. This requires no scheduled maintenance over the decades the mural will last. Travel, lodging and reward gifts all are included in the goal. Your contributions will help paint this wall!One additional beauty of this project is that it will not be financed by government funds but rather a grassroots fundraising approach using “Kickstarter.” This platform helps individuals kickstart an idea through the raising of money with rewards. The site has been operating for over ten years and has helped raise millions of dollars for individuals with good ideas.It’s simple for you to help by using Kickstarter. Just go to the “ Back this project” tab and it will direct you to the different donation levels. Each level comes with its own rewards so look them all over and decide how you would like to help. One of the gifts is a collectible bicentennial poster. This is the most desired item and you can now have the art for the big wall, on your wall. This is only offered every two hundred years, you know! This shows the artist’ initial study but may change slightly as the project develops.Once you pledge to donate, no funds are transferred until the campaign gets to the success amount. It’s all or nothing, so one dollar short and there will be no donations, no rewards and unfortunately no wall mural. So please don’t wait, pledge now and pay later.With successful funding, I plan on starting around October 1st. There will be lots of interest, press and conversation about the process. Come visit me and watch it grow!","There is no government budget with which to pay for this type of art project. In this time of tight budgets and government accountability, pensions, infrastructure and general funding take precedence. We are going to take advantage of the large network of citizens, art organizations and private businesses to secure all necessary funding. But, without the involvement of the general population it will not happen and the wall will remain an eyesore. As a seasoned muralist of over thirty years I never have difficulty selling the idea of a mural. Everyone wants public art like this. But, where can the funding come from? This approach of getting the public directly involved can be the answer."

The work invites involvement. By adding a name, date, or tiny doodles to the stars and stripes on the 24 X 6-foot canvas, visitors have an opportunity to commemorate the life of their hero. Not every hero wears a uniform or a red cape. Sometimes a  small act of kindness goes unnoticed. This interactive exploration invites individuals to honor their heroes. Let’s salute our hometown heroes—ordinary people who display extraordinary commitment, love, and selflessness.NOTE - Hometown Hero will be exhibiting at the Amway Grand Plaza Hotel for ArtPrize from September 23 through October 11, 2015. Two additional works have been created. Following ArtPrize, one of the paintings will be donated to the Reflection of Generosity collection--a traveling exhibit that focuses on healing for veterans and their families.","This is my seventh year participating in ArtPrize. Every year some unexpected challenge arises like running out of note cards when I planned for 1,500 visitor responses with my ArtPrize 2011 Healing Tree. But 20,000 visitors responded! With each challenge, I assess what needs to happen and execute a plan accordingly. For example, when we ran out of the 1,500 note cards within ArtPrize’s first few days, I scrambled every day to stay ahead of the demand for more note cards. Approximately, a thousand people were participating in the interactive installation per day. So we were purchasing additional cards every few days.

A thorough market analysis identified an opportunity segment for investment and growth, and it’s the community bar/social lounge. Connect Lounge plans to take advantage of this underserved segment, and will create a space and place that feels like home. It will be a warm and safe place, inviting you to connect with your community, sharing stories with friends, family, colleagues and new connections.From a design perspective, the community concept will be reinforced. Communal tables, comfortable furnishings, displayed “conversation starters” and an occasional “phone free happy hour” will encourage making real life connections. At Connect Lounge, we will take care of the icebreaker! Connect Lounge will quickly become the go-to networking hotspot for business and social gatherings, cementing the importance of its Belltown location.

https://www.kickstarter.com/projects/1777925564/vivi-music-led-controller?ref=discovery_category_newest,1777925564/vivi-music-led-controller,"The Kickstarter missed the funding goal, but ViVi's development will still continue. Updates will be sent to backers, sent out in the email newsletter fromthe Visual Vibes website, and posted onsocial media.A new campaign may be launched in 2 - 3 months or ViVi may go directly into retail sales if it receives private investment. Follow to stay updated:ViVi Music LED Controller will not be available for purchase until it's in production and passed FCC/CE certification. No prototypes will be sold. I thank all my backers for their support, but I cannot put the future of Visual Vibes at risk by selling non-certified units. I'm working to make ViVi available as soon as possible, but I'm also making sure I can continue to develop more great products in the future and grow Visual Vibes into an innovative company that is around for years to come.ViVi is the only music reactive LED controller that offers these stunning visuals with no programming required and with easy plug-in connectors.ViVi is changing the future of live lighting control. Complex lightshows are instantly created from any music, setup is quick with easy plug-in connectors, and its tiny size and self-contained processing allow ViVi to be used anywhere, by anyone.ViVi can liven up any party, impress your friends, or wow a crowd all for a fraction of the cost of existing products and without the endless hours of setup and programming.You have to see it to believe it. A single ViVi controller created the entire light show in this video. You'll look like a lighting professional and all you have to do is plug in a few connectors.ViVi has 3 separate outputs for bass, mids, and treble which plug into any WS2812B lights.  Audio is input to a 3.5mm jack using an aux connection or microphone.  Add 5 Volt power and let the show begin.  Set up in less than 30 seconds!  Connect via Bluetooth and adjust the show with the app.Autonomous cars can drive safely through traffic, but LED controllers still blink erratically to music. ViVi takes a revolutionary step forward from existing automatic controllers by usinga custom algorithm to think about the music and produce coordinated lightshows. Enjoy elaborate shows as great as those that are human controlled or pre-programmed.ViVi's visuals grab attentionas much as a car with no driver. If you want to stand out from the crowd or put on a memorable performance ViVi will do it. Blinking lights get people to look, but a complex coordinated light show perfectly synced with music draws people in, literally; at ViVi's public demos everyone was coming up for a closer look.Automation doesn't only make for great lightshows, it also makes ViVi easy to use. With zero programming and plugs for all electrical connections, anyone can setup ViVi. By using a static lighting mode ViVi can replace any existing lighting installation and only bring the fun out when it's appropriate. ViVi's compact size and 5V (USB power) operation allow it to be used anywhere; you can make an LED outfit, control lights in your car, install it in your house, strap it to your bike, add excitement to your bar, or include it in your DJ light setup.Increase the pledge amount by $50 on any ViVi Controller Unit reward to add 5 meters (16.4 feet)  of lights (30 LEDs/m) and a 5V 5A power supply.  An easy way to ensure you will have everything you need to get a lightshow started as soon as your ViVi arrives.  You can always add more later.This new option and the existing BUNDLE Rewards also include mounting brackets, extra extension cables, and splitters as needed to make sure you get everything you need to install and run the lights.Autonomous Music Lightshow CreationViVi uses a custom made algorithm that has been developed over the past 5 years to interpret the audio it receives and output that interpretation as various lighting effects.Automatic Volume TrackingViVi constantly adjusts for volume changes to optimize the show,no need to manually turn a knob. You can change songs or change the volume and ViVi will keep up. This is very useful if your wearing ViVi and using a mic so you don't need to keep adjusting as you move closer to stage.Portable and WearableViVi is compact and lightweight so it can go anywhere. All the connectors are on one side to allow ViVi to easily fit in a pocket to control an LED outfit. ViVi weighs2.1oz (61grams) and measures 3.1"" x 2.2"" x 0.8"" (78.5 x 57.3 x 21.6 mm)No Soldering or Wire Stripping requiredAll connections for ViVi are plug in. Most WS2812B LED lights come with a JST-SM 3-pin connector, which ViVi plugs right into. No need to deal with bare wires or a soldering iron to get an awesome light show!5 Volt PowerViVi has a standard DC Barrel Jack for 5V power input and comes with a USB adapter cable. This makes it easy to power ViVi anywhere using wall adapters, USB battery packs, or a USB car charger adapter.App ControlSo many LED controllers come with little plastic remotes, but not ViVi. ViVi has a custom controller app to make it quick and easy to adjust your lights. The app connects via Bluetooth.Persistent MemoryAfter disconnecting power ViVi still remembers all of its settings and will continue whenever it is powered back on. If your battery dies just plug in another one to keep the party going without missing a beat.Non-Proprietary LightsViVi's output works with any WS2812B LED lights. These lights are available in a wide variety of styles from many suppliers. Control up to 450 unique LEDs and split the outputs to duplicate the same animations on 1000's of LEDs.Optional PWM OutputAny of the outputs can be switched to a 5V PWM signal that can be used to control your custom creations whether they are mechanical or light based. DanceBot demo video using ViVi PWM.Static LightingViVi can settle down and handle your standard lighting needs.  With the ""Constant On"" mode you can set the color and brightness and it will never change.  There are other constant modes that offer fixed animations that are great for decorations.Independent OperationViVi does all of it's processing internally. You don't have to play music through an app on your phone or run a program on a computer. Just feed ViVi power and music and it does the rest.Dimensions: 3.1"" x 2.2"" x 0.8"" (78.5 x 57.3 x 21.6 mm)Weight:2.1 oz (61 grams)Voltage: 5 Volts (input and output)Power Draw: 0.15 – 5.0 Amps (depends on # of LEDs)Audio Input:3.5mm jack; mic-level, instrument-level, or line-level# of LEDs:control up to 450 unique; 1000's if output is splitSupported LED Types: WS2811, WS2812, WS2812BViVi can control any WS2812B LED lights. ViVi can also control WS2812 and WS2811 lights, but I recommend using WS2812B because they are more reliable with the fewest soldered connections per LED; all connect to ViVi with the same 3 wire plug.WS2812B lights are widely available from multiple retailers online. The lights come in so many different styles that it would be difficult to offer rewards tailored to every persons desires, so for this Kickstarter I'm focusing on the controller and suggest purchasing the lights separately. Visual Vibes will eventually start selling lights and other accessories through a webstore during the summer of 2016, so you could wait until then.WS2812B lights come in form factors such as LED strip lighting, string lights, and loose individual LEDs; with multiple varieties of each.Example LED Strip Lights on Amazon.Example LED String Lights on Amazon.All connections easily plug in and you can instantly get a lightshow started. You can then use the app to make adjustments or put ViVi into a static mode for ambient lighting. The prototype and app used in this video are not the most recent, but the steps are still the same. I'll be making an updated in-depth ""app and setup"" video soon.There are various way to setup ViVi. You can use a battery, wall adapter, or any USB port to provide 5V power. For audio input you can use the provided microphone or a 3.5mm jack directly from the source. You can connect one string of lights or all three, you can even split the output of one to have multiple strips show the same animations.For long runs of lights (over 100 LEDs) you may notice discoloration at the far end of the strip; this is because the voltage drops as it powers all the LEDs and eventually gets too low to properly power the LEDs at the far end of a connection. To fix this you need to attach power to the far end of the strip, the data signal will make it there just fine. This is more of a concern for static lighting uses because all the LEDs are lit, with most animations not all LEDs are lit and longer runs will work before the voltage drop starts to show.Easily adjust the color, animation, max brightness, and more with the free ViVi Controller app. There are millions of possible configurations to fine tune the lights to match your tastes, or choose dynamic modes and let ViVi continually change the show for you.The pictures of ViVi from breadboarding to production prototype .Going from prototype to production product is an expensive step. Your support on Kickstarter will allow ViVi to get the necessary certifications and have the order quantity needed to start using mass production manufacturing techniques.You might be wondering how it's possible to pay for extra costs (FCC and app development) while delivering a product for less than its expected retail value; The answer is low overhead costs. Currently Visual Vibes is just me, working from home, living off savings, so the overhead cost is $0. I can fulfill a couple hundred orders like this, but eventually I'll need to hire employees and pay them, start paying myself, and rent office space; This will significantly increase overhead costs and result in a final retail price of $199-$299 for ViVi.Additionally, I'll be completing the first ~200 ViVi's by hand, placing the PCBs in the enclosures, testing each one, and placing it and the additional cables and accessories into the packaging. Eventually these steps will need to be done at the factory (or by even more employees), so the per unit cost will actually be increasing after Kickstarter even if quantity increases.","Production - All of the components for ViVi have been sourced from suppliers who have more than enough parts in stock to fulfill all early delivery needs and who have additional order lead times short enough to meet the longer delivery windows.  A through-hole production model has already been made using all of these components and all the components have SMD equivalents for which the stock and lead times have been checked, so there is very little risk that any problems will arise in this area.If ViVi far exceeds it's goal then a more complete manufacturing process would be implemented for units beyond the first 100.  Since the new process would need to be quality checked it could add a one month delay to non-early-bird orders, though the test batch would allow some of the orders to be delivered on time.  This new method will begin being developed as soon as orders get high enough and be worked on simultaneously during production of the first 100 units; this will help to reduce or eliminate any delay.FCC Certification - ViVi will use a pre-certified Bluetooth module to avoid the more extensive and more costly intentional radiator FCC testing.  Because ViVi operates above 9 kHz it still has to undergo unintentional radiator testing.  ViVi is designed to reduce EMI, but has not been tested.  The time needed for testing is included in the estimated delivery schedule. There is a small risk that ViVi could fail FCC testing and need to be modified to pass the test.  This could cause a delay of about one month.CE Marking - The CE Marking requires minimal testing in addition to what is required for FCC certification (in the case of ViVi).  However, there are many requirements that ViVi must be verified to meet and lots of paperwork to read, fill out, and sign.  ViVi's final production version is being designed with all these requirements in mind and there are no expected difficulties in meeting them.If any unforeseen challenges arise I'm confident I will be able to overcome them because of my broad technical experience, my education as a Mechanical Engineer, my work experience in emergency management, and my determination to see ViVi succeed.",https://www.kickstarter.com/projects/1777925564/vivi-music-led-controller-0?ref=discovery_category_newest,1777925564/vivi-music-led-controller-0,"Thank you to all of our amazing backers who helped make the ViVi Music LED Kickstarter project a great success! If you missed the Kickstarter you're still in luck, we have opened additional pre-orders on Indiegogo InDemand!  Once ViVi is delivered to all backers and we have units in stock we will then open an online shop on the Visual Vibes website and begin direct sales.You can keep up-to-date on ViVi by signing up for our email newsletter, or by following us on social media, Facebook, Twitter, Instagram, or YouTube.ViVi instantly creates complex lightshows from any music, setup is easy with quick plug-in connections, and its tiny size allows ViVi to be used anywhere. ViVi is also 3 times as powerful as standard LED controllers with its 3 unique outputs which can represent different frequencies and be independently customized via the app.We’re a team of music lovers who appreciate the visual sensations of a concert, club, or festival. We’ve seen firsthand how lighting can set the mood and complement the rhythms of music to make it a special experience. We want this power of lighting to be available to everyone who wants their next music experience to be something to be remembered. This desire led us to create a revolutionary music synchronizing light show controller, ViVi.ViVi is the World's First music reactive LED controller that produces elaborate, well synchronized visuals without the need to manually program them yourself and with easy plug-in connectors for quick setup.ViVi can liven up any party, impress your friends, or wow a crowd all for a fraction of the cost of existing products and without the endless hours of setup and programming.Autonomous cars drive through traffic, robots vacuum your floor, but LED controllers still blink erratically to music. ViVi combines advanced hardware and software to make setup easy and display amazing shows instantly. Currently to create high-quality light shows you need to program then run software on a computer, connect that to at least one DMX controller, and connect that controller to light fixtures. ViVi eliminates programming and minimizes setup with everything being automated by our exclusiveVibeSync Technology.With ViVi's 3 independent outputs that can be split to control up to 12 LED strips the only limit is your creativity. In the video below ViVi used all 3 outputs for different frequencies and split the treble to two different strips to control 4 strips (the second treble strip was GRB instead of RGB so the color is different, but the animation is the same):ViVi isn’t limited to only creating amazing light shows. You can use it for all your basic lighting needs too. Our free Bluetooth App can easily switch ViVi to static color modes with all the settings of basic LED strip controller plus special animations that take advantage of the Addressable RGB LED strips. ViVi can overhaul any existing lighting installation and gives you the control to bring the fun out when it's time to party.ViVi can control WS2813, WS2812B, WS2812, and WS2811 LED lights. Theselights are all widely available from retailers online in various form factors (such as LED strips, string lights, and individual LED pads). It would be difficult to offer rewards tailored to every persons specific desire, so for this Kickstarter we will be providing WS2812B LEDs in a silicone sleeve; these lights are IP67 rated and the silicon sleeve helps prevent sharp bending when being set up and handled. Visual Vibes will start selling LED lights and other accessories through our website before the first ViVis start shipping, so you could wait to purchase your lights until then. If you already own lights or choose to purchase lights separately we will be happy to answer your questions to ensure your lights work with ViVi.In 3 easy steps ViVi will start the show:ViVi instantly starts the show with it's default settings. You can then open the Bluetooth app and adjust the options and strip length to match your setup and mood perfectly. All these settings are saved automatically, so you don't need to reset the strip length or other options every time you use ViVi.ViVi is versatile and easily expandable so you can “Bring Your Music to Light” any way you want. You can make an LED outfit, control lights in your car, install it in your house, strap it to your bike, add excitement to your bar, or use it in your DJ light setup. You only need one ViVi controller to manage up to 12 LED strips.The LED strips can be cut between any two LEDs for an exact fit and the App can easily adjust the display to match so all the animations look their best regardless of strip length.In the video below ViVi uses all three outputs and one output is split to two different light sets. The treble is going to both the light strip on top of the bar and the string light in the plant in the corner (the string light was WS2811 and the color data was GRB instead of RGB, so it shows different colors but the same effect).Easily adjust the color, animation, max brightness, and more with the free ViVi Controller app. There are millions of possible configurations to fine tune ViVi to match your exact preferences, or you can choose dynamic modes that let ViVi continuously change the show for you.The app will also provide OTA firmware updates, so as we create new animations and features you can update your ViVi with ease. One thing the app won't do is drain your phone battery. ViVi does all of the processing internally, your phone is not required for ViVi to function. You don't have to play music through a specific app or leave your phone connected to ViVi all the time.ViVi was developed over the past 6 years. The majority of time was spent on the software while the changing hardware remained on a breadboard. In 2015 we decided on Addressable RGB LEDs as the output and finalized the hardware. We now have a production prototype with a PCB and enclosure. The final production version being manufactured soon will have an upgraded MCU and newer Bluetooth, but otherwise will be the same.$15,000 is the minimum amount needed to increase our production capacity and lower costs. We have been and will continue using the last of our own savings to finalize the production design and get it FCC tested, but we need your help to make our first 100+ unit production run. We need the larger run before we start selling ViVi because the component and manufacturing costs are too high in small quantities. We also value the feedback from our early supports which will help us make any final improvements before shipping.Dimensions: 3.1"" x 2.2"" x 0.8"" (78.5 x 57.3 x 21.6 mm)Weight: 2.1 oz (61 grams)Voltage: 5 Volts (input and output)Max Output Current: 5 AmpsAudio Input: 3.5mm jack; mic-level, instrument-level, or line-level# of LEDs: control up to 500* unique; 1000's if output is splitSupported LED Types: WS2811, WS2812, WS2812B, WS2813*500 is the current soft limit because further optimization is needed to increase the frame-rate at higher numbers; ViVi can currently control up to 2,000 unique LEDs, but the performance isn't up to our standards so we are still listing it at 500.","Production - All of the components for ViVi have been sourced from suppliers who have more than enough parts in stock to fulfill all early delivery needs and who have additional order lead times short enough to meet the longer delivery windows. A set of through-hole production models were made and thoroughly tested using these components and all the components have SMD equivalents that will be used to produce the final production model.A small test batch of the final production model will be produced shortly after the Kickstarter begins and there is enough time for at least one round of modifications while still meeting the expected delivery dates.FCC Certification - ViVi will use a pre-certified Bluetooth module to avoid the longer and more strict intentional radiator FCC testing. Because ViVi operates above 9 kHz it still has to undergo unintentional radiator testing.  The time needed for testing is included in the estimated delivery schedule.

https://www.kickstarter.com/projects/studiotreasure/alice-is-back?ref=discovery_category_newest,studiotreasure/alice-is-back,"Lewis Carroll's masterpiece 'Through the Looking Glass and What Alice Found There' is the sequel to his 'Alice's Adventures in Wonderland'. So, why our fundraising campaign is not for the publishing of the first book? Well, that's because it ('Alice's Adventures in Wonderland') was already published in 2008, then in 2009. This work received a lot of favorable reviews and I was awarded by IBBY for illustrations. Of course, I wasn’t going to stop there, and continued to work on the second story about Alice — ‘The Looking Glass’. There was a lot of sketching, composing, character development, etc.Time after time the 'Looking-Glass' was put aside for other projects, one of which was the illustrating and publishing of 'The Hunting of the Snark' by Lewis Carroll. Nevertheless, despite several breaks and intermissions, the work continued up to this day, and now we are very close to the end. We would much appreciate your support in bringing this book to life.""What’s unique about this edition? When we published the first book ‘Alice in Wonderland’, our aim was to make illustrations, as well as the publication in every detail at the highest level, that is, to design, prepare for print, print and bind the book as the classic edition. And we succeeded. The Limited Edition of 'Alice's Adventures in Wonderland' was following the traditions of the best printers to produce unique and meticulously prepared books. The book is printed on expensive creamy paper, bound in genuine leather, has gilded edges, and gold stamping.Now, with the ‘Looking-Glass’ we're going to achieve the same goal. We have found a highly-skilled printing house and bindery that can carry out this project at the same high level as the first book was.This will be the Limited (to 200 copies) Edition. Each copy is numbered and signed. Copies from #1 to #10 and #200 in addition to signature will have a hand-drawn character of your choice, therefore they'll cost more than the others.Copy #1 assigned to the most substantial pledge of $10000, along with copy #1 of Limited Edition of 'Alice's Adventures in Wonderland' and copy #1 of Limited Edition of 'Hunting of the Snark', both with my illustrations. The name of the person made this pledge will be printed on the Copyright page of the book with the title 'Co-Producer'.A long-long time ago when I read Alice first time I was charmed by Carroll's world. Naturally, I began drawing, sketching, doodling - visualizing Alice my own way, ""cause I'm a damn artist"".In the beginning, there were no plans to publish my drawings. My obsession with Alice's visualization had a form of an endless and unpredictable game with characters, situations, adventures, and nonsense. Each time I reread the book I found new details, new aspects of the conversations or circumstances, which I had missed before. It doesn't matter whether you are an observant, meticulous reader or not — Carroll is a magician, his literary techniques are often similar to an illusionist's craft. A single passage can be read seven times, but suddenly, on the eighth time, you notice an obvious detail and think to yourself: ""how in the world could I have missed this before?""I drew characters, composed scenes, invented costumes and surroundings, everything was getting “curiouser and curiouser”. I just could not stop, it became an obsessive occupation, a kind of hobby, a favorite pastime. And at some point, I realized that all this madness must be turned into something, into a book. So, I collected all the graphic works and began to collate them into a series of illustrations with a coherent style for a book.While reading ""Alice"", sometimes it is hard to understand what unites some parts of the book. Each chapter looks like an isolated event that isn't related to any other; different characters, locations, and events can be easily changed, can be rearranged, without losing the coherence of the story.English is my second language, so some of the finer words and nuances elude me to this day, but at some point, I stumbled upon the word ""scene"" and thought it a perfect fit to describe each chapter. Yes, these chapters really look like acts in a theatrical play.Carroll starts the chapter like this:“There was a table set out under a tree in front of the house, and the March Hare and the Hatter were having tea at it: a Dormouse was sitting between them…”Doesn't this remind you of the mise-en-scene (arrangement of the stage) in a play?Lewis Carroll (Charles Lutwidge Dodgson) was very fond of theater, theatricality, and stage performance, and this love helped him to write and construct the story about Alice.Based on this idea, I built myself a peculiar image of the curtain, so the illustration as a whole consists of:1) The main part of the drawing executed in brown color.2) Frame or a kind of curtain, drawn in black and white with graphite pencil.This curtain not only frames the illustration, but also tells “its own” story, explains to us some details of conversations, verses, thoughts, and/or various literary, cultural and historical reminiscences.My interview about illustrating ""Alice in Wonderland"" and ""Looking-Glass"", January 2019.Thank you for supporting the project for no reward! Every little donation helps us towards our goal!Let us thank you and sending a set of 4 postcards with illustrations to “Looking Glass” and our appreciation! You can greet anybody with these cards in any of 364 days of a year because they are Unbirthday Cards!There are 3 pledges here:Pledge CA$ 25 or more — Playing Cards 1 deck, Pledge CA$ 40 or more — Playing Cards 2 decks, and Pledge CA$ 55 or more — Playing Cards 3 decks.We send you 1 or 2 or 3 decks (depending on the pledge) of playing cards illustrated with characters from Looking Glass and Alice and express our appreciation!

The quantity of remaining copies of ""Alice's Adventures in Wonderland"" is very limited (a couple of dozens is still available). Both books numbered and signed by the artist.Lewis Carroll's masterpiece 'Through the Looking Glass and What Alice Found There' is the sequel to his 'Alice's Adventures in Wonderland'. So, all this is not about the first book? Well, that's because it, 'Alice's Adventures in Wonderland' was already published in 2008, then in 2009. This work received a lot of favorable reviews and I was awarded by IBBY for illustrations.Of course, I wasn’t going to stop there, and continued to work on the second story about Alice — ‘Looking Glass’. There was a lot of sketching, composing, character development, etc. Time after time the 'Looking-Glass' was put aside for other projects, one of which was the illustrating and publishing of 'The Hunting of the Snark' by Lewis Carroll. Nevertheless, despite several breaks and intermissions, the work continued up to this day, and now we are very close to the end. We would much appreciate your support in bringing this book to life.A long-long time ago when I read Alice first time I was charmed by Carroll's world. Naturally, I began drawing, sketching, doodling - visualizing Alice my own way, ""cause I'm a damn artist"".In the beginning, there were no plans to publish my drawings. My obsession with Alice's visualization had a form of an endless and unpredictable game with characters, situations, adventures, and nonsense. Each time I reread the book I found new details, new aspects of the conversations or circumstances, which I had missed before. It doesn't matter whether you are an observant, meticulous reader or not — Carroll is a magician, his literary techniques are often similar to an illusionist's craft. A single passage can be read seven times, but suddenly, on the eighth time, you notice an obvious detail and think to yourself: ""how in the world could I have missed this before?""I drew characters, composed scenes, invented costumes and surroundings, everything was getting “curiouser and curiouser”. I just could not stop, it became an obsessive occupation, a kind of hobby, a favorite pastime. And at some point, I realized that all this madness must be turned into something, into a book. So, I collected all the graphic works and began to collate them into a series of illustrations with a coherent style for a book.While reading ""Alice"", sometimes it is hard to understand what unites some parts of the book. Each chapter looks like an isolated event that isn't related to any other; different characters, locations, and events can be easily changed, can be rearranged, without losing the coherence of the story.English is my second language, so some of the finer words and nuances elude me to this day, but at some point, I stumbled upon the word ""scene"" and thought it a perfect fit to describe each chapter. Yes, these chapters really look like theatrical acts.Carroll starts the chapter like this:“There was a table set out under a tree in front of the house, and the March Hare and the Hatter were having tea at it: a Dormouse was sitting between them…”Doesn't this remind you of the mise-en-scene (arrangement of the stage) in a play? Lewis Carroll (Charles Lutwidge Dodgson) was very fond of theater, theatricality, and stage performance, and this love helped him to write and construct the story about Alice. Based on this idea, I built myself a peculiar image of the curtain, so the illustration as a whole consists of:1) The main part of the drawing executed in brown color.2) Frame or a kind of curtain, drawn in black and white with graphite pencil.This curtain not only frames the illustration, but also tells “its own” story, explains to us some details of conversations, verses, thoughts, and/or various literary, cultural and historical reminiscences.","We have met certain difficulty with printing — the printer which had completed our request with 'AIW"" doesn't produce books anymore, so we had to search for another one with equal capabilities and ability to match the quality of the first book. We are lucky to have found one.The possibility of delays during the pre-press and printing process has been considered, so our deadlines are set with a fair margin."

After the accident, his body was never found and the factory became a shuttered tomb. Years later, a demolition crew arrives to implode the building with explosives and awakens KLAGGER from the dead.The film will be a serious, horror/drama combining a plot driven story with strong performances and lots of bloody, monster-type action.

First, it will assist us in securing our principal location which is a decommissioned power plant owned by American Electric Power. You saw it in the concept trailer.

We are an all-volunteer non-profit organization founded in 2014, and we exist to help people make things.We've successfully operated our current 3,000 sq ft makerspace in Leesburg for over a year now, hosting over 100 public classes, events for organizations, and providing many members of the Loudoun County area with regular access to tools, space, knowledge and resources to learn and make things. A makerspace is a community shop, much like many of us had back in high school, but unlike a high school facility, ours is open and available to the community. The makerspace tools are both ""old school"" like wood working, metal working, and crafts, but also ""new school"" platforms like CAD design, CNC manufacturing, new electronics platforms such as Raspberry Pi and Arduino, laser cutting, and other emerging fabrication techniques. You can make a quilt in makerspace, but you can also create your very own carbon fiber drone, complete with all of the electronics, from scratch. And lots of other stuff.But we've outgrown our current space.

Ideally, we'd have that happen in downtown Leesburg, too, rather than be relegated out into industrial space like Cochran Mill Rd.    A downtown space allows us to be a part of the fabric of local life, and it gives people new and interesting reasons to come downtown.But finding that kind of property is hard.  We believe we've got the perfect building picked out, but nothing is guaranteed until we raise the funds and secure the lease.We continue to work closely with the town, residents and all impacted parties to pave the way for this new use of downtown space, and if we raise the funds, we feel confident in our ability to launch the space, subject to the sale of the building, the execution of the lease, and the town's approval.

Our Festival is named in honor of Prince Lot Kapuāiwa, who became King Kamehameha V in 1863. It is traditional for Hawaiians to hold events in honor of one of their aliʻi. Our Festival originated at his summer home in Moanalua. On our 40th anniversary, we moved to Iolani Palace, Prince Lotʻs official residence in Honolulu. Originally called Hale Aliʻi, it was replaced by the Iolani Palace built by King David Kalākaua. Now with COVID-19, a live in-person celebration is not possible. After the world recovers from this pandemic we fully expect to hold our Festival in front of a live audience again at Iolani Palace.Queen Emma Kalanikaumakaʻamano Kaleleonālani Naʻea Rooke was the widow of Kamehameha IV, brother of Prince Lot, who then became King Kamehameha V. The palace in Nuʻuanu Valley was her favorite and visited frequently by her brother -in-law, King Kamehameha V. It is one of the palaces operated by the Daughters of Hawaiʻi, also a 501-C-3 non-profit organization and a supporter of our Virtual Festival. After reviewing numerous locations to film our Festival this seemed to be the most appropriate.I ULU NŌ KA LĀLĀ I KE KUMU - Youth blossoms from a strong foundationUlu - is to grow, growing, poetically - to blossomLālā - are the branches of a tree, especially the younger onesKumu - is the same word for tree, teacher, and original sourceMEDIA PRODUCERD.H.

https://www.kickstarter.com/projects/truthandbeauty/truth-and-beauty-a-breathtaking-modern-sculpture?ref=discovery_category_newest,truthandbeauty/truth-and-beauty-a-breathtaking-modern-sculpture,"Truth & Beauty will be an unabashedly breathtaking modern sculpture in structure and balance. Standing on her tiptoes, arms outstretched and head thrown back, Truth & Beauty expresses a moment of radical self-acceptance and love, the essence of a woman when she is safe and welcome to express herself fully. Conveying this notion has been the focus of my work as a sculptor for the past 25 years. My name is Marco Cochrane, and I am fully committed to breaking the pattern in which men (and women alike) often appear blind to the true, magnificent nature of women. My models and I collaborate to capture a moment in which they are truly expressing themselves. Standing 55 feet tall and weighing 7,000 pounds, Truth & Beauty will be constructed using: • 25,000 feet of steel rod and pipe; • 6,500 steel ball connection points; • 1,500 square feet of stainless steel mesh; and • 55,000 single welds. One thousand individual multi-colored LED lights will be distributed throughout her body. These lights will be controlled by a custom iPad application to create a spectacular light show that will enhance and expand the visual experience. Please follow our build on Facebook: http://www.facebook.com/truthandbeautysculpture We Need Your Help! Truth & Beauty needs a large community of support to help us fund her. Through Kickstarter we can achieve our goals of: 1. Expressing appreciation and respect for feminine energy and power that results when women feel free and safe. 2. Creating a magnificent sculpture, as strong as the steel from which she is constructed, yet appearing human, alive and beautiful. 3. Generating an environment where people can participate in a community, supporting and creating art together. Your generous donation will help us purchase the steel, mesh,lighting, consumables,as well as renting the equipment needed for her first assembly and transportation.If we go above our goal, we will be able to support the people that have dedicated themselves to bringing this project to life. They have alreadyput in months of work to get her to this phase of the build! We appreciate our donors so much and have some great rewards to show our gratitude including Truth & Beauty shwag and invitations to special events! See full descriptions to the right. More About the Artist and Project Until recently, I created a woman’s natural, expressive pose in clay and then cast that form in bronzes of varying size. Many of those sculptures are featured on my website: www.marcocochrane.com. Take a look! In 2010, I created something radically new and different. With generous donations from friends and the help of a volunteer crew, I used all of my life experience to create Bliss Dance, the first in a series of extraordinarily large sculptures combining classical techniques with cutting edge design that have a profound effect on how people experience art, others, and themselves. Bliss Dance, a 40-foot-tall sculpture of model Deja Solis, dancing with her eyes closed, debuted at Burning Man 2010 and is now headed out on tour. To see her photos, check out: www.blissdance.us. Now what? My crew and I have begun large-scale construction on the next sculpture in the series – Truth & Beauty. Using a pantograph — a medieval-era enlargement tool — the sculpture will be built by hand using classical sculpting techniques from my life-size original, first to an 18’ clay version, which I have completed, and then to her final 55’ steel form. Thank you to everyone for the incredible support I have received in the past, and to everyone who is considering supporting Truth & Beauty. Please follow our build on Facebook: http://www.facebook.com/truthandbeautysculpture",,https://www.kickstarter.com/projects/truthandbeauty/bliss-dance-restoration-and-renewal?ref=discovery_category_newest,truthandbeauty/bliss-dance-restoration-and-renewal,"Remember when you first saw Bliss Dance on the Playa?  Or on Treasure Island in San Francisco?  Or have you heard about her and are still meaning to get out there to see her someday?  Either way, in a world where it seems like nothing is new and there isn’t much that is surprising and inspiring, she was just that for so many of us, even those of us who helped build her.   Well now she needs our help!The good news is that we have reached an agreement with the Treasure Island Development Authority (which approved the installation) and the Black Rock Arts Foundation (who provided the funding for installation in the first place) to extend Bliss’ placement for another year to November 2013.   But, there are still two things in the way… rust and a lighting system that needs replacement!  Bliss Dance, standing 40 feet tall, is constructed out of steel rods and balls and covered by stainless steel mesh.  As you can see from the video, the steel interior structure is rusting, and the elements have damaged her lighting system! We can’t let this happen!  She needs tender loving care and a whole ‘lotta treatment. Luckily, we have found a way to accomplish this without having to take her down.  We plan to coat Bliss in a rust-stopping product that is environmentally friendly – it is water-based, non-toxic and emits no harmful fumes.   We will also replace her electrial system.  Most of the work can be done from the inside, in-place.  Only the arms will need to be removed for a few days. Now, we just need to come up with the funds to cover the costs! Bliss is constructed of small pieces, welded together, and in these connections she is far stronger than any of her pieces individually.  Wouldn’t it be great if we could join together as a community, contribute in small pieces, whatever we can afford, and make ourselves stronger in our connections too?If Bliss moved you, please give, even just a little so that she can continue to do so for all of us. Marco and the Bliss Dance Crewp.s. for more images of Bliss Dance go to www.blissdance.usor just google her! ; )PPS. Any funds raised above our goal will be used to help feed the hungry volunteers who will be helping us with this work, paying our monthly permit fees of $210 or maybe evenbetter lighting, all depending on how much we receive!",This project has already been given the green-light by the Treasure Island Development Authority (the product and process has been approved).  The only real challenge is scheduling and the weather!

I'm an artist with a lifetime passion for pictorial images. I've collected and archived images my whole life. I'm in the process of developing an online periodical with a mission to share these images and explore intriguing ideas.I'm seeking your support to fully developthis journal/magazine, with the intent of sharing an opportunity to experience the rarified excitement of journalism from an artist's point of view, whether the articles and essays are about the arts, or utilize the arts to tell stories about our world.It's called Pictorial Arts Journal (or PĀJ, pronounced 'page', for short).For several years I have blogged profusely about pictorial arts (gallery arts, illustrative arts, photographic arts, cartooning arts, graphic arts, design arts, cinema arts, video arts, etc), with tons of beautiful images. The blog has attracted over 1200 registered followers who also value the pictorial arts. That was and is fun—but limited in scope. I treasure all kinds of pictorial material and have loved sharing it, but now's the time for a bigger and better way to show the work. That blog can be seen athttp://mydelineatedlife.blogspot.com.I’ve always been intrigued by the artful juxtaposition of text and images, as in books and magazines. When I saw contemporary illustrator Larry MacDougall’s enchanting artwork on his blog, I was inspired to put together a pictorial essay of his work in the form of an online journal. I then went on to create several more about Frank Frazetta, Avard Fairbanks, and Eric Papé.Last year, I also published, online, a loving tribute to the celebrated cartoonist Walt Kelly on what would have been his 100th birthday:And then I was hooked! I enjoyed producing those pieces so much and others enjoyed the results so much, that I decided to create a journal to promote images, both contemporary and golden age, and use images to promote ideas. The online version will be free, with hard copies available for purchase.""Flight of imagination across time and space"" is not just poetic rhetoric—it's a literal plan. We will have creative people from the past and present partnering to create something new from the old — such as a modern artist illustrating a Walt Whitman poem. Or a graphic novelist interpreting a biography of Lewis Carroll. Or a photographer bringing life to an ancient philosopher's musings. Or a fiction writer's short story based on an Alphonse Mucha painting, or a cartoonist deconstructing the Kinsey Sex Report. Creative people collaborating across time and space.And of course we'll have contemporary creative collaboration. We might have a quirky scientist collaborating with a quirky artist to investigate quirky developments in technology.Last summer I published a full-sized online prototype of PĀJ as a themed issue called 'Spirit of the Renaissance'.Much of the content of the prototype was mine, to test the waters before asking anyone else to jump in. It afforded me the opportunity to work out the kinks in developing an online journal and now I'm ready to create the first official issue.Be sure to link to the prototype to get an idea of the editorial style and page-turning format:www.PictorialArtsJournal.comIn the premiere issue and beyond, I plan to have an entire spectrum of image-makers as collaborators showcasing their pictorial art, as well as making it a venue for my portrait-type illustration. I'm also lining up writers to share imaginative fiction, non-fiction and poetry. And that art and those words will be brought together in a way that blends modern journalistic design with golden age aesthetics. I have enough ideas on the docket to fill a dozen more issues. There are no boundaries to prevent the journal from where it might wander.And now, ta da ta daa and voilá! I can show you the cover, the actual cover, of the premiere issue, with the gracious permission of Craft Partners, a gorgeous painting by Kinuko Craft! The issue will have a pictorial essay examining the enchantment of Kinuko Craft's art.Also on the agenda for this issue, we have a heavily illustrated article on the ""Mad King of Bavaria""; an essay detailing a collaborative mission for 21st century artists and scientists; a gallery of graphics from the wildly imaginative artist Hermann Vogel; and other gemstones that I'll share with you as they develop. I'll also create a pictorial account of the KickStarter experience, complete with art from some of the earned rewards.PĀJwill also promote books and blogsand websites that celebrate and showcase thepictorial arts, as well as professional and student portfolio sites, and sites that arts enthusiasts would be, well, enthusiastic about — such as bookpublishers, art auctions, art tutorials, art travelexcursions, art galleries and other art related stuff.The backing that we receive will pay for the first issue's editorial content (art, photography, writing, graphic design and layout); the tools and technology to make it state of the art—with an online digital page-turning interactive version viewable on any device; and the special rewards we want to share with you!What else is planned? Lots. And lots! But PĀJ really needs you and your friends and associates to make this happen! All levels of support are appreciated, but it has to be raised in just 28 days! If you know someone who shares the passion for pictorial art and could help support this project, please tell them. Please spread the word via the social media or word of mouth. To succeed, we will need to reach friends of friends of friends and their friends and maybe a few more friends. As they say here at Kickstarter: The funding goal is all, or nothing at all.Just so you know, all images in this presentation are used either with permission of the copyright holders, or are public domain.You can keep up to date on developments, and see new graphic rewards that become available by linking to my blog that is dedicated just to the Journal:http://pictorialartsjournal.blogspot.comMy limited edition print, visualizing the Muse of Imagination (from an article in the premiere issue), signed, numbered and personalized to you, is available at the $750 support level:This is the line-up of posters available as rewards for the $250 level (close-ups available upon request):The 3 prints shown below are from a spread in the Journal and are the reward for the $150 level.For a $135 fulfilled pledge is a print of this amazing photo of a dolphin 'flying' through water—another flight of imagination.This is the signed print for the $100 level:And a t-shirt for the $75 pledge level. I know, t-shirts shouldn't cost this much, but we're not selling them, we're rewarding them for your generous and virtuous support:Please join with me in documenting the flight of imagination across time and space! THANK YOU for ANY involvement!!!","The challenge is to generate and design editorial content in a timely and pleasing manner. With 40 years of meeting hundreds of successful deadlines, I feel more than confident that I can meet that challenge, though now it could get complicated dealing with other contributor deadlines, My plan is to always have backup content developed and ready to fill any voids. I created a prototype journal last summer that was more than a hundred pages of content and learned the ins and outs of my tools and tasks, though I do plan to have a learning curve on new software that will need to be utilized.Another challenge is the competition of a myriad of enthusiasts posting millions of similar images on their blogs. My use of the images will be in high resolution, lovingly edited, and placed into contexts of beautiful layouts and words, to be a permanent source of contemplation. Risks are technological failures (aaaugh! my computer!), society failures (the night the lights went out in Georgia!) and acts of God (I once worked at a printing plant that suffered under 5 feet of water). I face risks with every project I've ever had and have always come out on top (especially when I had to climb up to the top of that flooded press to escape out the skylight).",https://www.kickstarter.com/projects/1126292849/facesfiguresfantasies-the-art-of-thomas-haller-buc?ref=discovery_category_newest,1126292849/facesfiguresfantasies-the-art-of-thomas-haller-buc,"My name is Thomas Buchanan. I'm a commissioned artist. I've drawn and painted for a living for over 40 years now and I'm still going strong.People are my favorite subjects to draw and paint. My studio partner calls them 'people skills', as I've been passionately creating portrait studies for many years.My work has been published many times over the years, but never have I had a published collection of my best work.Over the past couple of years I've thrown myself into creating a body of work—studies of remarkable people who have caught my fancy, and I want to share them in the form of a beautiful book. The book would also include some of my thoughts about art and people, the challenges and fun of working from old photos and movies, and demonstrate some of the process I use to capture the essence of what I love about people. In all my art studies, I try to emphasize the visual aspect of humanism.Faces. Figures. Fantasies. That's what I want this book to be about. I include 'fantasies' because I like to elevate people above the mundane, to portray them in ways that transcend the ordinary day-to-day of our lives. Many of the works have a fantasy element with unique and lovely background art in collaboration with my studio partner, Willa Haller. There will be a section that elaborates on that process.The book's contents are mostly finished and storyboarded for page layouts. The funds that are raised would pay for printing and shipping costs and associated fees (and all that adds up to a lot of money).Right now the book is planned for 96 pages, 12"" X 9"", both softcover and hardcover. If stretch goals become possible, I would like to add 16 or 32 pages, as I have so many more drawings that I would love to include.And just so you won't be taken by surprise,I'm letting you know that, in the tradition of 500 years of art, there is some nudity artistically portrayed in the book.I will post ongoing updates of the project (and more artwork) on this FaceBook link: The Art of Thomas Haller Buchanan.Below are just a few sample images intended for the book:Much of my work has been shared via the internet, but there have been a lot of requests to see the work in a quality printed form. A digital image of art is to be filed in a folder. A book of art is to be treasured on a shelf.This book is not meant to be a wrap-up of my career, but rather a launch of better and better work yet to come.Thank you for whatever pledge you may make, and I hope this book will soon be part of your art library!","With printing projects, there are always risks of deadlines not being met, quality standards not being met, shipping going out of control. But with project organization and decades of experience I have with printing projects, those risks are at a minimum. The biggest risk in a printing project (in my view), is trying to cut corners because of working with too small of a budget. That's why this campaign needs as much as it's asking for, to make sure of a quality product."

Full of vitamins, nutrients and natural enzymes; Naughty Fruit is a snack we are proud of and want to share “Eating Naughty” across the US. We use only the highest quality, ripest fruit and unique spice blends to bring an unforgettable experience to your mouth and body.INTRODUCING SUPER SPICES/HERBS TO NAUGHTY FRUIT: Turmeric, Rosemary, Sage to name a few. Increasing health benefits tremendously. More to come...In 2013 my father had undergone his 3rd back operation, replacing protruding and worn down lower back disks. 3 months prior, my mother left her job because of unfair wages. With the reality of medical bills and only having my mother’s limited income to rely on, the road ahead was looking pretty tough. I decided to come home and try to find a way to lessen their load and seek out my own peace of mind in the process. Giving back to my parents who had sacrificed and given me so much is one of the things that continues to motivate me.We had begun to create a local following, selling Tamales in the farmers market in Jackson Wyoming and shaved ice at the Jackson Hole High School soccer fields. We had created our own opportunities and found hope once again. I began to play with the notion of dehydrating my own snacks since we had agreed on keeping a tight budget.After doing a lot of online research and playing around with fruit and a bunch of different SPICES & HERBS, Naughty Fruit was born. With all of its health benefits, Naughty Fruit will assist in the battle over the high obesity rate which plagues the US by providing a healthy snack alternative.Health Benefits of Dried FruitDried fruits offers some advantages over fresh fruits: a longer shelf life and portability. Dried Fruit is also highly nutritious. One piece of dried fruit contains about the same amount of nutrients as the fresh fruit, but condensed in a much smaller package. By weight, dried fruit contains up to 3.5 times the fiber, vitamins and minerals of fresh fruit. Therefore, one serving can provide a large percentage of the daily recommended intake of many vitamins and minerals, such as folate. 1. Dried fruits also contains more fiber than the same-sized serving of their fresh counterparts. Fiber helps keep your digestive system running smoothly. Dried apricots, for example, contain 6.5 grams per cup, while fresh apricots contain just 3.1 grams. According to the Harvard School of Public Health, it helps prevent obesity, heart disease and some forms of cancer.2. Some dried fruits are a good source of certain antioxidants, according to a 2005 study in the ""Journal of the American College of Nutrition."" Phenols, a type of antioxidant, are more abundant in dried fruits than in some fresh fruits, leading researchers to advise that more dried fruits be included in the American diet. Plant polyphenols have been found to fight heart disease, cancer, osteoporosis, diabetes, cancer and degenerative diseases of the brain, according to the November-December 2009 issue of ""Oxidative Medicine and Cellular Longevity."" They also are associated with health benefits such as improved blood flow, better digestive health, decreased oxidative damage and reduced risk of many diseases.3. Because most of the water is extracted from dried fruits, their nutrients are condensed into a small package. Dried fruits like apricots, raisins, prunes and figs contain high amounts of beta carotene, vitamin E, niacin, iron, magnesium, potassium and calcium, reports the European Food Information Council.4. Several studies have shown that people who eat dried fruit tend to weigh less and ingest more nutrients compared to individuals not eating dried fruit. Not all dried fruit is created equally though. Added sugars, and problematic preservatives & processing practices can quickly offset any nutritional benefits dried fruits provide. It is important to avoid dried fruits with added sugars and preservatives. In conclusion, dried fruit have many health benefits. They are delicious and sweet and can be a substitute for candy for both children and adults.We have a few different blends to choose from:The Naughty Mix,Pineapple,Bad AppleANDTropic Teasethis is only the beginning; we want to continue to develop more Naughty Fruit blends and share them with the world.

https://www.kickstarter.com/projects/1861496135/6-lp-craw-box-setreissue-of-3-lost-post-hardcore-c?ref=discovery_category_newest,1861496135/6-lp-craw-box-setreissue-of-3-lost-post-hardcore-c,"Video: Dan ScofieldLive photography: Karen Novak/////The early-’90s post-hardcore movement has been dissected, cataloged and preserved. The Jesus Lizard and Slint have embarked on successful reunion tours, and now have their own coffee-table book and box set, respectively; you can purchase hundreds of live Fugazi recordings directly from the band; and lesser-known groups such as Bitch Magnet, Floor and Rodan have all seen their work handsomely reissued. As a passionate fan of underground rock growing up during these years, I discovered another band, a Cleveland group called Craw, whose records meant more to me than any others. In the two decades since, during which I've launched a career as a professional music journalist, I've never stopped obsessing over this body of work.  At the same time, I've always been baffled that even in the blog age, Craw remains so little-known. In an effort to remedy this, and with the full approval of the ex-members, I'm raising money to produce a limited-edition LP box-set reissue of the first three Craw full-lengths—1993's Craw, 1994's Lost Nation Road and 1997's Map, Monitor, Surge—all out of print since the late ’90s. Simply put, these are my favorite albums of all time. They contain some the most explosive, eerie and downright riveting music I've ever heard—music that combines the visceral rush of metallic post-hardcore, the compositional majesty of progressive rock and the purposeful abstraction of experimental improv, while at the same time achieving a rare, insular coherence all its own. These records aren't special merely because they're obscure; they're not second best to everything you've already heard from their era. I truly believe that these three LPs—each recorded or co-recorded by Steve Albini—stand alongside acknowledged masterworks such as Spiderland, Goat and Repeater. Anyone interested in dark, heavy, complex rock/metal—everything from Tool, Meshuggah and King Crimson to Neurosis, Kayo Dot, Don Caballero, Today Is the Day, Isis, Dazzling Killmen and Gorguts—needs to know this music. Each of Craw's first three full-lengths is an endlessly involving labyrinth in which elegiac beauty presses up against nightmarish ugliness. These albums feature air-tight, ingeniously off-kilter riffs; intoxicating guitar textures; vocals that range from a faint whine to a horrifying shriek; an immense dynamic range; epic, multichapter song structures; and esoteric lyrical themes. The songs don't follow conventional patterns, but their internal logic is uncannily sound; they're scientific in their microdetail, yet at the same time, bracingly emotional. I've been listening to these records for two decades, and their urgency and mad brilliance haven't diminished in the slightest.If this Kickstarter campaign is successful, I will reissue these records as a six-LP box set, with each of Craw's first three albums spread across two 180-gram vinyl records, pressed in Craw's hometown of Cleveland by Gotta Groove Records. This will be the first vinyl release for the self-titled debut and Map, Monitor, Surge, and the first proper vinyl release for Lost Nation Road, which originally came out on a poor-quality limited-edition LP that was missing one album track. All three albums will be newly remastered—for both the vinyl box set and a concurrent digital release—by Bonati Mastering. The records will come packaged in a custom slipcase manufactured by Stoughton Printing Co., and the set will feature a clean, elegant new design that complements rather than upstages the gorgeous layouts of the original CD releases. The package will also include a booklet featuring excerpts of new and recent interviews with members of Craw, shedding light on this severely underdocumented musical endeavor; full lyrics for all three albums, newly proofed by vocalist Joe McTighe; and vintage Craw photographs courtesy of Karen Novak and others.Here's a preliminary sketch for the cover of the outer slipcase, with a motif that may be repeated on the individual album sleeves:Donors to this campaign will receive various exciting rewards, including a set of previously unissued Craw bootlegs in MP3 form; posters by famed Cleveland artist and longtime Craw supporter Derek Hess; CD copies of the third and fourth Craw albums, Map, Monitor, Surge and Bodies for Strontium 90; original T-shirts and set lists; and, of course, copies of the finished six-LP set, which is limited to 100 copies and will only be available directly through this Kickstarter campaign.If you donate to this project, you will be helping to rescue from obscurity some of the greatest and most enduring sonic art the American underground has produced. More importantly, you'll get to experience this magical music for yourself. You won't be disappointed.Write crawtheband [at] gmail [dot] com with any questions about this project./////Various rewards://///For those interested in a more specific cost breakdown, here is what all funds raised will cover: *180-gram vinyl pressing (Gotta Groove)*Double-pocket record jackets (Gotta Groove)*20-page insert booklet (Gotta Groove)*Outer slip cases (Stoughton)*Mastering (Bonati)*Shipping (USPS Standard Post - U.S.-only)*Video editing / design—friends of mine are donating their time and expertise up front, and I've budgeted in modest fees for each of them.*Kickstarter/Amazon fees","*I've worked hard to calculate a comprehensive cost estimate, but it's always possible that I'll require extra funding in order to produce and ship the box sets. Shipping costs are especially tricky, since there's no way to know how many sets I'll be shipping to which locations until the fund-raiser is complete. (I've decided to charge a flat additional fee for each non-U.S. order, since international shipping costs are too steep and unpredictable to calculate on a hypothetical basis.) Additionally, my figures are current as of the Kickstarter launch, but each printing/manufacturing company's price quote is subject to change.*I'll be working on producing/shipping this box set around the demands of a full-time job and a busy freelance schedule. I'm determined to deliver the sets by the January 2015 fulfillment date, but it's hard to know exactly how long this process will take before I embark on it.*It's not financially feasible to produce a properly bound book to showcase the liner notes, so I've had to opt for a cheaper booklet style. The only affordable option is a 20-page booklet, which doesn't give me as much space as I'd like. It's going to be a challenge to both work up a compelling visual layout and tell a respectable amount of the Craw story in this space. *Layout/design is also a challenge. The original Craw CDs were illustrated with beautiful original paintings and photographs by a number of renowned artists. Due to rights issues and limited printable space, it's not feasible to reproduce this artwork as part of 'Craw: 1993–1997.' Therefore, a friend and I are attempting to work out a clean, elegant layout with a minimum of new graphic information. It's a real balancing act to produce something that complements the original artwork, and the music itself, while at the same time standing on its own merits.",https://www.kickstarter.com/projects/1861496135/craw-box-set3-lost-post-hardcore-classics-reissued?ref=discovery_category_newest,1861496135/craw-box-set3-lost-post-hardcore-classics-reissued,"In 2014, I launched a Kickstarter campaign to fund a vinyl box-set reissue of some of my favorite albums ever made: the first three full-lengths by the Cleveland post-hardcore band Craw, all out of print for roughly two decades. Each of these records—1993's Craw, 1994's Lost Nation Road and 1997's Map, Monitor, Surge—is a masterpiece of aggressive, unsettling, forward-thinking underground rock. (Check out this five-song Bandcamp sampler to hear for yourself.) Of these three, only Lost Nation Road has ever been issued on vinyl previously, in a subpar limited-edition pressing. Now, in 2015, we're resurrecting this effort with a more manageable funding goal and a sturdier team of experts committed to making this project a success.On behalf of all seven ex-members of Craw, who have lent their full support to this reissue effort, I'm relaunching the campaign with the help of esteemed Brooklyn indie label Northern Spy, which for the past decade has issued a steady stream of vital, challenging releases in the fields of avant-rock, free jazz and experimental music. Their aesthetic is a perfect fit for Craw's brilliant and unclassifiable work. If we meet the fund-raising goal, Northern Spy will issue the 6-LP box—featuring newly remastered versions of all three albums—as originally planned, at a much lower price, with several key improvements outlined below. (Each of the three albums are too long to fit on a single high-quality LP, hence our 6-LP model.) Also on board, designing the packaging for the box and a custom 100-page liner-notes book, is Aqualamb, a one-of-a-kind, visually driven Brooklyn record label with deep roots in the same ’90s-era Cleveland scene that nurtured Craw.Here are the improvements we've made upon the 2014 version of this campaign:* If we hit the target, Northern Spy will bring all of its manufacturing expertise, distribution savvy and PR clout to the table. Not only will we provide deluxe, 6-LP box sets to backers; Northern Spy will distribute any remaining copies of the 300-box run to record stores and mail-order houses worldwide, while also reissuing the contents of the box digitally through all conventional channels (iTunes, Amazon, etc.), and promoting these releases to web and print outlets worldwide. In other words, if you support this campaign, you're not just purchasing Craw's music for yourself; you're helping to rescue it from obscurity.*Since we're working with a 300-copy model, the per-unit cost is much cheaper. Our base price for the box set is more than 50% less than the 2014 asking price. The current prices will only be offered through this Kickstarter preorder campaign.*Those in or around Brooklyn, NY, will be able to pick up the box in-person at the Northern Spy office and avoid shipping costs altogether. We will also arrange a pick-up site in Craw's hometown of Cleveland.*Thanks to Aqualamb, the box will include a 100-page bound paperback book featuring complete lyrics for all three albums, previously unpublished band photos, previously unpublished interview excerpts with Craw members and new, original artwork. See below for samples.*T-shirts! With the help of Seattle's Broken Press, we've printed new Craw logo shirts in both black-on-white and white-on-black designs—just 50 of each. These shirts are exclusive to this campaign and are available to those who pledge at or above the box-set level. We will sell any extras after the campaign ends, but for now, the only way to get a T-shirt is to preorder the box.*The following items will be included with all box-set orders while supplies last: Craw logo stickers (white-on-black; brand new and exclusive to this campaign); Craw ""Baboon head"" posters (mid-’90s vintage; exclusive to this campaign, unless you happen to own an original); original wrapped CD copies of Map, Monitor, Surge (Craw's third album; a remastered version will be included in vinyl box); and original wrapped CD copies of Bodies for Strontium 90 (Craw's fourth album, courtesy of Hydra Head Records; contents not included in vinyl box).Read on for complete details on this effort.

But if it appears that we can't hit our December 2015 target, we will notify all backers immediately and provide them with total transparency.The unclassifiable nature of Craw's music is what makes this band extremely special, but it's also what makes their music extremely hard to market.

We want to inspire and educate our fellow Cambodians about space, and we need your help to make it happen.To build capacity for space interests and create a path for future space missions in Cambodia.To build and launch a 1U CubeSat that will inspire secondary and undergrad students to learn more about space education by implementing their own mini-ground station to communicate with our CubeSatWe are LigerSat, a team of 5 high school students pioneering the way for space projects in Cambodia. We’re starting small - a 1U CubeSat (more on this soon!) that will capture images of Earth - but it has the potential to inspire a nation. Through our education project, youth all across Cambodia will learn about space, and download pictures from an object that students just like them had designed and put up there. We hope that this project will motivate our generation to innovate and pursue higher education, in both aerospace technology and beyond. Not too far from now, the first Cambodian astronaut could be sitting in a classroom tracking our satellite. All it takes is that spark.CubeSats are a standardized nanosatellite that has performed several functions: space and communications research, technological demonstrations, educational projects, and commercial projects. The standard measurement of a CubeSat is in “Units” or “U’s”; for example, a 1U CubeSat refers to a 10x10x10 cm cube that weighs about 1.3 Kg. These cubes can be stacked together to form 2U or 3U CubeSats. The main components in a CubeSat are the antenna, structure, solar panels, power supply, transceiver, control computer, and payloads. Once the CubeSat is launched into space, it will orbit the Earth in Low Earth Orbit (LEO), which has an altitude between 160 - 2000 Km.CubeSats provide students worldwide the opportunity to create a satellite with minimal labor and technical knowledge. Consequently, a fully functional CubeSat could be completed and ready to launch into orbit within two years. Additionally, the cost of a CubeSat is much lower than industrial satellites (that cost millions of dollars), which makes fundraising for this project much more achievable. When a CubeSat is in orbit, its life cycle will terminate upon re-entering Earth’s atmosphere leaving no space debris; with this absence, the spatial integrity of Low Earth Orbit will be restored for future CubeSat deployments.The role of our CubeSat is to take pictures of the Earth and transmit those pictures back to the ground. The camera that we will use is ArduCam which is somewhat limited in image quality compared to other satellites. This is like a picture from an iPhone on a very high mountain (with a height of about 400 Km) and all you might see is just continents and oceans. Once it takes the images, the CubeSat will send back to Earth.While neighboring nations (such as Thailand, Vietnam, and Laos) already have satellites operating in LEO, Cambodia currently lacks an industry in space engineering. Therefore, designing and building a CubeSat here in Cambodia would be a significant technological achievement and a strategic political move for our country. Our government does have tentative and long-term plans to deploy its own satellite to improve the nation’s security and communication systems (as mentioned in a 2011 article by the Phnom Penh Post). The 250-400 million dollar communications satellite was intended to be launched by 2021, but according to a February 2019 article, the project is “still under study.”The Education ProjectOur mission is to develop future engineers and create positive impacts on students, schools, communities, and Cambodia’s reputation while introducing new technology. In Cambodia “only 3 percent of students choose to study the so-called STEM subjects at university"" [VOA, Reaksmey 2016]. The Minister of Education aims to incorporate more STEM-based learning.as the nation moves forward into a technological future, and we believe our project will greatly contribute towards that goal. The kits we will introduce into government schools will provide a platform for collaborating to implement STEM curricula in these schools:We plan to have 10 radio kits available for students to borrow while our satellite is in orbit, rotating them to reach at least 50 secondary schools and universities throughout Cambodia. Through workshops at each of these schools, we will teach students about space, and show them how to use the kits to download pictures from our satellite!In those kits, there will be an antenna, an Software Defined Radio, a computer, necessary software, and a module. Through basic parts such as PVC pipes and tape measures, students will also be able to build their own more powerful antennas. These will vastly improve communication with our satellite, and solidify students’ understanding of physics and math in the process.Kit antennas can be made from simple parts like PVC and tape measure!Secondary school, in particular, is a stage where students discover their passion for university and career. We will place our focus here, and cover as many schools in a remote region or outside of cities as possible, so that they have similar opportunities to schools in the cities. We also aim to have equal numbers of female students and woman mentors participate in using the kits, to ensure that this push towards STEM is not filtered by traditional gender stereotypes.By providing teaching methods for mentors to work with schools, and providing full access to the images we obtain, we hope to start a wave of “space fever” across Cambodia.This mission will motivate students all around the country to learn about space technologies. By establishing this project, we will also help the reputation of Cambodia, a country that has never launched its own satellite, by launching its first high school nanosatellite in the year 2020. Moreover, our satellite project will prepare Cambodian ministries for future satellite missions. Our CubeSat developers and the students using our kits will be taking a journey to satisfy their dreams and become the next generation of astronauts and aerospace engineers.Our SchoolWe are a group of students from the Liger Leadership Academy in Phnom Penh, Cambodia. The academy consists of 110 students, 50 for senior cohort (age from 15 to 18) and 60 junior cohorts (age from 12 to 14). This is a project-based-learning academy where students learn different hard and soft skills (such as leadership, collaboration, innovation, technical skills) from involving in projects. Visit the school’s website: http://www.ligeracademy.org/.LigerSatThe Liger CubeSat is a group of senior students from the Liger Leadership Academy who are devoted to developing the first Cambodia satellite. Our CubeSat developers are high school students who collectively offer diverse experiences: electrical engineering, mechanical engineering, 3D designs, programming, app development, environmental awareness, and more. These students have worked on several high-impact engineering and technology projects: they have constructed 15 Kg robots that competed with other Asian countries in a competition called VEX robotics; developed a digital currency, called Pedro, that is used at our Academy; and implemented a computer lab in a rural government school that runs on solar energy. The Liger CubeSat team has five members: Rithy Hong, Sreyneang Oun, Seyha Khom, Visal Saosuo, and Vuthy Vey. Every single person on this team is extremely passionate about this project and is prepared and excited to turn this project into reality. Visit us to learn more at http://ligerCubeSat.org. Our mentorsThis project additionally has six mentors who have experience in spacecraft communication, CubeSat development, satellite developments, fundraising, chemical engineering, and biology.Liger Mentor's profileThis project started in October 2018. We spend eight to ten hours per week individually. Even though we are novices in this field, we will attempt to launch within 2 years with the support of our mentors and Liger facilitators.There are three main phases in our timeline:The launch date is not set as we are still looking for a launch provider. We are applying for the KiboCUBE competition (launch in 2021), and looking for potential sponsors. In the event that we are unsuccessful in obtaining a free launch, we have also developed further fundraising plans, and would aim to secure a spot in a launch vehicle for the end of 2020.Financial PlanFinance is one of the major possible causes that can delay this project. The total cost is 100,000 USD. Our school cannot support this cost, therefore, we must fundraise. To break down the cost, we see that the actual cost for the CubeSat is 42,000 USD (which is 42 % of the total cost); the ground station is 2,527 USD; assembly, integration, and verification is 18,500 USD; and launch at JAXA is roughly 30,000 USD.There are a few ways we can reduce the total cost of this project: the most promising is by winning the KiboCUBE competition. KibuCube is a yearly competition run by UNOOSA collaborate with the Japanese Aerospace Exploration Agency (JAXA) to give the opportunity to many developing countries that have never launched a CubeSat into space. The prize in this competition is to have a free launch into space. We will submit our application for the fifth round of KiboCUBE on 30 September 2019. If we win this competition, our total cost will be reduced to 70,000 USD (taking out the launch cost) and the launch date will delay to 2021.Our fundraising team has tried to spread the word for this project to more people in Cambodia using Facebook, our website, and presentations to others. We believe that there are people out there who are willing to support our project. To do that we need to do some public outreach. We would sincerely appreciate it if you helped share our story!If you’ve read this far, thank you. And feel free to reach out to us with any questions at cubesat@ligercambodia.org We are so proud to build the first satellite for Cambodia, and pave the way for future contributions to space exploration. This is by far the largest and most challenging undertaking that any one of us has faced. We bravely embark on this journey, but we cannot do it alone. Your participation in this project will not only make our spacecraft a reality, but spark dreams in thousands of students in Cambodia and beyond.","We are so proud to build the first satellite for Cambodia because Cambodia so far has has made so little contribution in space exploration. A group of five high school students from the Liger Leadership Academy bravely started the journey of becoming the pioneers to build Cambodian first satellite. Furthermore, we are under the pressure of time to launch the CubeSat due to our graduation in 2020. Another challenge is introducing satellite projects to the government; this means government procedures and paperwork will be required from us, which takes more time. The third challenge is finance; this project requires up to 100,000 USD, and this is challenging to raise. With all of these challenges, a major risk is that we will end up passing this project to our next cohorts.",https://www.kickstarter.com/projects/ligersat/liger-cubesat-empowerment-through-education?ref=discovery_category_newest,ligersat/liger-cubesat-empowerment-through-education,"TL;DR: We’re launching a satellite - Cambodia’s first!

Qblinks allows you to choose the wireless functions you would like to have at the touch of a button, and to define which notifications you would like to receive.Remotely control your phone: You can remotely activate Siri, remotely control your phone camera’s shutter to take photos, remotely search for your phone if misplaced, andremotely start, stop, and switch between songs on your phone with built-in music app, Spotify, or Google Play Music.Customize your notifications: Qblinks uses a multicolored flashing light mechanism to notify you of incoming calls, messages, emails, and various social media notifications, so that when your phone is in your pocket or purse, you are still able to know precisely what notifications you have received. Through the Qblinks cloud, you can share your Qblinks status with your friends, and allow them to share their status to your Qblinks device as well.Ambient temperature sensor: Qblinks has a sensor which can detect ambient room temperature. You can use a smartphone app to remotely display the temperature detected by Qblinks on your mobile phone, recording that temperature and sharing it to the Qblinks Map, where it can be shared with the entire world.A great new way to control your phone.Press the Qblinks button to prompt your phone to ring even in silent mode.You can customize the color and flashing pattern of the Qblinks RGB LED light in order to set up different flashing notifications for incoming calls and messages. You can also use the Qblinks Cloud to set up notifications for Facebook, Gmail, and other social network events. Through the flashing light signals, even in a noisy environment or when your phone is elsewhere, the LED can remind you of the start of important events.On the Qblinks Cloud, you can use different “formulae” to tell your Qblinks device how to interact with your cloud services. Each formula is an event-action combination. An event is a condition from a channel which you select. For example, you can set Gmail as a channel, and when Gmail receives an email, this is an event. An action is whatever designated activity you set to happen when the event is triggered. For example, when the email event happens, you can set the flashing blue notification on your Qblinks.The Qblinks Cloud can allow multiple Qblinks devices to work together. You can even share your Qblinks functions with your family and friends. For instance, set your Qblinks to notify you when your child’s Qblinks connects to your wife’s phone.Here are some examples of what the Qblinks Cloud enables you to do:Nearly unlimited interesting combinations are possible, just waiting in the Qblinks Cloud for you to bring them about!You can use Qblinks to read the ambient temperature. Qblinks can report the temperature to the Qblinks Map every 15 minutes. By accessing the Map, you can see temperature readings being shared from all around the world.You can request the Qblinks Cloud to ""send a tweet when the temperature reaches a specific degree"" or ""record temperature in Google Spreadsheet every 15 minutes.""Qblinks uses Bluetooth Low Energy 4.0 to connect to your phone. Pairing up with your phone through the Qblinks app is secure and easy. Qblinks uses two changeable coin cell lithium batteries as its main power source. We estimate that under regular usage conditions, you won’t have to replace the battery for many months, even up to a year.Through the Qblinks app, you can easily change the settings on several Qblinks devices and connect to the Qblinks Cloud.

It’s designed to allow everyone of all ages to capture and share up to 6K, 4K, 360° video, 24 megapixel 360° photos and live stream to Facebook and YouTube with the ability to broadcast endlessly.We have built two mounting accessories, a Livestreaming Mount Adapter that gains access to the USB-C port for continuous power, and a Universal Action Camera Mount that allows the camera to be connected to a wide variety of small, action camera accessories.Have you ever tried taking a family photo but never seem to get everybody in the picture? How about asking a stranger to take your picture for you, only to discover afterward they still cut you out of the picture? Maybe you want to capture a beautiful landscape but can’t fit everything into the scene because your lens is not wide enough. The 360Penguin ensures that you’ll never run into these issues again because, when you hold it out in front of you, it takes a fully spherical 360° shot that captures everything that’s “All Around You™”.The 360Penguin is a revolutionary 360° camera made by 360Rize™ that’s fun for the whole family. No other camera can compete in quality or price. It’s easy to use, compact, light-weight (2.6 oz), and SUPER SIMPLE to share 360° content and anybody can do it! It's the most convenient 360° camera you’ll ever own. Not only is it affordable, its sleek design is packed with the latest and greatest 360° tools yet small enough to fit into a pocket or purse.Don’t let the 360Penguin’s size and price fool you!We spared NO EXPENSE in providing the BEST 360 VR TECH! With the push of a button, shoot 6K, 4K, 360°video and 24-megapixel 360°photos in a fully spherical360° shot. The 360Penguin is the most consumer-friendly, high-quality 360 camera on the planet. The 360Penguin has 210° wide-angle lenses on opposite sides of the camera.  The overlapping of the lens allows the camera to assemble these two views into one 360 view in real-time. As it stitches/seams the two lens images into one 360 view it stores the data on the micro SD card in the camera.   I know, it sounds complicated however we made it so easy you don’t have to understand the complexity inside other than it just works! Mobile users can connect to the camera via WIFI by pressing the WIFI button on the right side of the camera.  Once connected, viewers can see in real time 360, everything that’s all around the camera.  Users can pan, tilt, zoom in/out, or rotate to any angle.   The mobile app viewer has 4 different options to create 360 content.  360°VR video, 360° photo, 360° time-lapse or 360° live streaming to Facebook or YouTube. The 360Penguin interface works just like any traditional camera except you don’t have to worry about pointing the camera at your subject. Users don’t have to use their smartphone to control the camera. One button on the front of the camera serves multiple purposes.   It turns the camera on/off, start/stop 360video or take a 360 photo. To take a 360°VR video, place your camera in the middle of all your action, turn on the camera via the front button (side green light is solid) .  Press it again to start recording 360 video (side green light flashes) press it again to stop recording video (side green light is solid).To take a 360° photo, double-click the front button, to switch to 360 photo mode.  (side green light turns off)  Press the front button once, wait two seconds and it takes a 360 photo (side green light flashes and beeps)To view the 360° content, remove the micro SD card from the camera, insert into your computer to view, edit and share with your friends.   You can also connect the camera via WIFI to see all the 360 content on the camera’s micro SD card or transfer to your mobile phone.The mobile app is called 360Penguin. IOS Mobile App: https://itunes.apple.com/us/app/360penguin/id1434651896?mt=8 Android Mobile App:https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.rize360.penguin360The app lets users control the various settings inside the 360Penguin camera. You can switch between 4 different modes;  360°VR Video, 360° Photo, 360° Time-Lapse, and 360° Live Streaming. Active users can see in real-time everything around the camera and control a wide range of settings such as image quality, frame rates, time-lapse settings, adjust time intervals, resolution, control exposure, sharpness, ISO, color, white balance and more.For editing 360 videos, users can adjust start and stop endpoints, add logo’s, adjust different angles and views that can easily be shared to social media outlets. The 360Penguin is truly a user, family-friendly camera for all ages. Especially since it only takes a few clicks to live stream directly to Facebook or YouTube.  If you have VR headsets like the Oculus Go, Rift or Vive, you can easily stream directly to those devices, or view 360 content from the cameras micro SD card.There are three different modes to power your 360Penguin camera.The 360Penguin camera has a 1000 mAh battery which provides about 60 minutes of usage when using only the front camera button like a traditional camera. Using the optional Live stream adapter connected to the cameras USB-C port and an external power bank 5,000 mAh battery you can get up to 5 to 6 hours of usage. Using the optional Live Stream adapter and the power outlet user can get an endless supply of power.The 360Penguin includes; 360Penguin camera, a light-weight flexible tripod, microfiber bag, USB-C charging cable, lens cloth, user guide, and a FREE iOS/Android mobile app that lets users control the camera remotely and share its content.  We have built two mounting accessories. One holds the camera for live streaming to allow access to the USB-C port for continuous power. The other is a Universal Action Camera Mount that allows the camera to connect to wide variety of small action camera accessories. Our design and experience starts with the family perspective.Our testers have been asking for a underwater solution. So, in July of 2018 we started working on and testing multiple underwater housings that will dive to sport diver depths of 130 feet.   Depending upon the success of this campaign, we should have the funds to complete the design and release in first quarter on 2019.Working with partners in all areas of product development, we found the right players to bring the amazing 360Penguin camera to life.No other 360 camera can compare to the 360Penguin’s ease of use and high-quality production. That’s why we are excited to keep the price to an amazingly low cost of $298.88!Don’t let this low price fool you into thinking that we sacrificed quality for affordability. The 360Penguin can shoot 6K, 4K, 360°VRvideo and take 24MP360° photos with just a click of a button.Now, when 360Penguin pledgers want to broadcast a family birthday party, wedding, or reunion in 360, it’s no problem! Sharing everything is as easy as sitting the camera in the middle of all the action, unlike traditional cameras that are required to the pointed in the right direction.We kept our promise and reached our goal of making 360 easy with the 360Penguin. We hope YOU can help us take the next step in getting the 360Penguin closer to home. We launched our 360Penguin on October 13th, National Penguin Day.When you purchase a camera, not only do you get the 360Penguin but we also take a small portion and donate to the Detroit Zoo’s Polk Penguin Conservation Center, because we love the Penguins.We’re no stranger to the 360° industry. We've been around since 2012.We started in 2012 as 360Heros and re-branded in late 2016 to 360Rize (Reality Inside Zero Edges) to grow and adapt towards new options and solutions.Over the last 6 years, we learned one key thing, ""It is vital to train others on how 360 works and how easily it is to enjoy!"" Our early projects took weeks, sometimes months, to capture high-quality 360 content using our patented multi-camera arrays that are still used worldwide.  We developed these camera rigs, wrote software, and re-purposed small action cameras to create stunning 360 photos and video with resolutions as high as 24,000 by 12,000 pixels at 240 frames per second.We noticed our ideas were moving quickly in the tech world, and many companies in the industry wanted to get in on the fun. People wanted a camera with professional quality that’s affordable and easy to use. Seeing the need, we took a fresh look at our strategy and focused on creating new solutions for Reality Inside Zero Edges for all ages to enjoy!360Rize™ owns patents on more than 24 styles of multiple-camera 360 rigs. Our high-definition, 360-degree multi-camera arrays contain six to 24 cameras for both Land, Sea and Air use. Our camera rigs are used in more than 106 countries by clients such as NASA, the US Navy, and hundreds of production companies. Michael Kintner, the owner of 360Rize, is a 20-year veteran of 360 development and creation. He’s even in the 2015 Guinness Book World Records for shooting the first HD 360 video on top of Mt. Everest. We’ve listened to our friends in the industry and all our customers. The 360Penguin is the camera that will change the way consumers feel about this exciting new way to shoot and share 360 content. We’re looking for your support to ship our first order and continue to make the 360Penguin better!","Before launching here on Kickstarter, we made sure our products are going to be built exactly the way we want them.   We have gone back and forth between numerous functions and parts in the camera to ensure the highest quality at the best consumer-friendly cost for the final product. That being said, we have working prototypes of the product and we will strive to improve until the ship date of the cameras. Users will be able to use the 360Penguin app, or a variety of different 360 editing software tools like Adobe Premiere™ and more. If there are any concerns or questions, you are more than welcome to reach out to us at support (@) 360rize.com.   We strive to be transparent with our customers.

https://www.kickstarter.com/projects/bobfine/the-social-media-monthly-issue-2-print?ref=discovery_category_newest,bobfine/the-social-media-monthly-issue-2-print,"I came up with the idea to do a printed, yes printed, social media magazine while at SXSW this past March. My cohorts and I went from concept to print in just 53 days, and the launch issue has been making a great splash after debuting on May 20th, 2011. The launch issue has a September 2011 cover date and will actually be distributed in retail stores starting in mid-August. The cover was designed by Yiying Lu, the same artist that designed the now famous Twitter ""Fail Whale"". To make it extra special, the cover also features a special reusable wall graphic(in 5 different colors) designed by Yiying that can be applied practically anywhere and reused up to 100 times. And the cherry on top is a funded redeemable card in each copy by myself andCherryCard.org to allocate to the cause of your choice.I have completely self-funded the publishing and distribution of the launch issue out of my own pocket and with some help from my close friends: Visa, Mastercard, Discover and American Express. Unfortunately, as i'm learning in the retail distribution game, it will be 6 months before we'll see any money for the sale of the launch issue. So, i'm doing everything I can to keep going until some steady revenue comes in, and that includes appealing to you.The initial print run of the launch issue was 15,000 copies and we expect to be doing at least that many for the second issue (October 2011 cover date). I'm asking for your help to contribute toward the actual printing costs of the second issue. We're now in the middle of doing the layout and editing of the second issue and it has to go to print in early August.For every single person that backs this project, even if it's only $1.00, your name and the city and country you are from, will be printed in the second issue, as a project funder.

My cohorts and I went from concept to print in just 53 days, and the launch issue has been making a great splash after debuting on May 20th, 2011 at BlogWorld in New York. Three weeks later we secured national distribution for the magazine with Barnes and Noble.The launch issue of the magazine went on sale nationally in Barnes and Noble across the country on August 16th, 2011 as well as 9 countries.          December 6th, 2011: The Social Media Monthly magazine was recently namedone of the hottest magazine launches of 2011.With our fifth issue going on sale January 3rd, our retail circulation is now 23,000 including distribution in Barnes and Noble, Walmart Canada, the Indigo/Chapters bookstore chain in Canada and 12 other countries including: Australia, New Zealand, UK, Germany, Sweden, Norway, Finland, Denmark, Canada, Spain, Portugal and Singapore.In addition, we print 7,000 extra copies every month for distribution at trade shows and promotional events, for a total of 30,000 copies every month.We invite you to read the digital flash version of the December issue of the magazine.

https://www.kickstarter.com/projects/carlabrahamsson/sub-umbra-alarum-luna?ref=discovery_category_newest,carlabrahamsson/sub-umbra-alarum-luna,"Derek Jarman's super-8 film IN THE SHADOW OF THE SUN (1975, with music by Throbbing Gristle 1980) blew my mind when I first saw it. It has been one of the most influential films ever for me. During 2014 and 2015 I have shot and accumulated new super-8 material and am about to make a tribute to this peculiar cinematic gem. My film will be called SUB UMBRA ALARUM LUNA (""In the Shadow of the Moon"") and will contain new music by Swedish experimentalists Cotton Ferox (It should be noted though that the music used in this clip comes from the project Syster Tjära/Broder Djärv and is not the music that will be used eventually. But it will contain the same emotional tonality.). The goal is to make something as influential and poetic as Jarman's film. That will be hard of course but I never give up! The money needed is for super-8 transfers, editing time and general post production costs. Almost all of the material already exists, so it's a matter of assembling it in the best possible way. In the end, it should be approximately 40 mins, and a feast for eye and mind alike. Please help make it happen! Many thanks!For more information about my other films, please visit www.trapartfilm.com",There are no major risks or challenges involved in this film. When it's finished it will be screened and distributed.,https://www.kickstarter.com/projects/carlabrahamsson/lunacy?ref=discovery_category_newest,carlabrahamsson/lunacy,"My film Sub Umbra Alarum Luna (2016) was dedicated to Derek Jarman’s influential work, specifically In the Shadow of the Sun (1975, with music by Throbbing Gristle 1980). The film has been screened in Stockholm, Copenhagen, London, New York, Porto and other places, and is available on DVD and Vimeo On Demand. My new project, LUNACY, will be the “follow-up” film to Sub Umbra, and is based around recorded cut-up texts about the moon by Vanessa Sinclair, with music by me. The film will be a miasmic, mind-expanding trip into the psycho-lunar orbit. Mixing new material with older super 8 footage and a truly cosmic soundtrack, I will aim to see what’s on the dark side of the moon – and hopefully come back. Please join me for a wild yet mellow space ride.

After a warm reception from the Austin community and receiving countless awards as a trendsetter in the home design sphere, we decided to introduce another particular passion of ours into the business: a wine bar to complement the atmosphere of the space. With the addition of wine, Aviary has evolved, redirected, rebranded and ultimately grown, and so with it have the demands and needs of both our patrons and the business. We’re excited that it has finally come time to redevelop Aviary as a full wine bar and kitchen.Our RootsOver the course of the past ten years, Aviary has brought affordable and accessible wines to South Austin following a “wine is for everyone” philosophy. We’ve never adhered to the school of thought that wine is too complex or too elevated to be understood by the average Austinite. Our knowledgeable and approachable staff, our weekly offering of Wine School classes, and our deep dedication to creating an inviting space and personalizing the customer experience exhibit our commitment to making the world of wine not only accessible, but also fun and engaging.Does that feel a little too punchy? Here’s some real-life, unadulterated evaluations of who we are from our community:“Every time I’ve gone, the atmosphere is just so relaxed and almost familial.” –James H., 8/23/2015 (Yelp)“What a cool spot! It’s small, but they have great wines, an awesome cheese plate, cool furniture, and lovely music!” –Valerie N., 6/29/2016 (Yelp)“One of the main reasons I love this place is the service. They are more than just friendly there.” –C.L., 5/8/2011 (Yelp)To fully realize Aviary’s evolution, the team will be renovating the existing space to maximize service abilities. The renovation will include a new bar and full kitchen to support expanding wine and food menus. The rendering pictured below is a small taste of what the interior of the space will look like when construction is complete. After the renovation, Aviary will be opening for lunch hours and extending service to Mondays.","Through our dedication to service, quality and community, Aviary has already established itself as a mainstay of South Austin. With a new iteration of the business comes the risk of losing what has allowed Aviary to become what it is today, namely a “hidden gem” neighborhood wine bar with a homey, boutique feel, familiar faces and consistent menu offerings. Though we’re reinventing the space and expanding to a full service kitchen in order to enhance the customer experience through a larger offering of wine and food options, with such expansion also comes an increase in the breadth of patronage (good for us!), but also the possibility of Aviary evolving beyond its original sense of community (a potential drawback for our existing clientele and the composition of the business). At Aviary, we prioritize quality of cultivation and production, demonstrated in our wine list with varietals and vintages found nowhere else in Central Texas, to provide a unique-to-Austin experience: the same goes for our hopes and expectations of the atmosphere of the space.

Considering the space we’re in (1200 square feet of retail space without a commercial kitchen…that’s right, we cook on hot plates and in toaster ovens), we’ve done a lot with very little.

It is a community-gathering place, a sanctuary, and true nest for all that is weird and brilliant about Austin. Spontaneous swing dancing breaks out to weekly live music sets, loud, raucous laughter is not uncommon during trivia nights, and we’ve even watched as awkward flirtations across the bar have turned into marriages years later. Aviary wears many hats, but one of our favorites is that we have truly become a place to meet friends old and new.","Through our dedication to service, quality and community, Aviary has already established itself as a mainstay of South Austin.

Lovecraft's Cthulhu, designed and sculpted by Stephen Hickman. Kickstarter price: $250. Free shipping worldwide!ABOUT STEPHEN HICKMANI have an all new, completely reworked version of my iconic Cthulhu statue for which I would appreciate your support, so I can get it into production immediately. (I plan on having it in yours hands no later than December 2020.)Much of my award-winning 45-year career in illustration has been involved in painting book covers for fantasy and science fiction titles, so it's fitting that my new iteration of Cthulhu grew out of a book cover assignment for Baen Books—Cthulhu: The Mythos and Kindred Horrors, edited by David Drake.I'M ALSO A SCULPTORIn the past, when I needed to have a realistic idea of lighting a complex subject for book cover assignments, I've made clay models called maquettes, of various alien and fantasy characters. For the aforementioned Baen Book , I took it a step further and took an actual photo of the sculpture of Cthulhu for the cover itself, and then ended up doing a painting of it. That painting appeared in The Fantasy Art of Stephen Hickman (Donning Company, 1988). Soon after its publication, Randy Bowen (of Bowen Designs) saw it, and we used it as the basis for a statue.THE FIRST CTHULHU STATUE SOLD OUTIssued over two decades ago, the Cthulhu statue sold out, all 2000 pieces.And although I was satisfied with the sales, I was never quite satisfied with the statue itself which looked unfinished to me--especially when compared to its companion piece, a bust of H.P. Lovecraft, also from Bowen Designs as a follow-up project.Repeated requests from fans over the years, along with the high prices the Cthulhu statue commanded online on eBay and other sites, convinced me that there would be a market for a more finished version. So after two years of intensive planning and numerous sketches, I am finally able to offer the second iteration of the statue. It is available to collectors worldwide for $250. And because we are eliminating the middleman, you get free shipping anywhere in the world. (Otherwise, US customers would have to pay up to $45, and international customers would have to pay up to $75 for shipping.)THE STATUE ITSELFThe piece is approximately eight inches tall. It comes in an eye-catching, full color collector's box. It will be shipped in a form-fitting corrugated box for protection. The statue features an out-of-this world black-green/violet color-shift finish, a special blend of paints evoking the otherworldly ""stone never seen on earth,"" as Lovecraft himself described it in his short story, ""Call of Cthulhu.""WE ARE READY TO GO INTO PRODUCTION IMMEDIATELYAs soon as we are funded, manufacturing will commence. The masters for casting and paint matching are currently in preproduction, in Hong Kong, by a company well known worldwide for their work: In fact, they are the gold standard in the field. There is no better company that manufactures hand-painted statues and other high-end collectibles for discriminating fans of comic books, science fiction, and fantasy books and movies. The production of statues is, understandably, time-consuming, painstaking work: each sculpture is hand-finished, hand-painted, and then carefully boxed and shipped to the United States.When you hold the finished piece in your hands, I hope you'll agree with me that it was well worth the wait. (Obviously, manufacturing a collectible statue takes many months, from preproduction to postproduction.)WHEN THE FUNDING GOAL IS REACHED, YOU WILL BE REWARDEDTo keep things simple, when we reach our funding goal of $38,000, we will be giving all of our supporters a limited edition book with never-before-published material: sketches, drawings, photos, and other material that takes you behind the scenes on the history of my Cthulhu statue, along with an in-depth, lengthy print interview with me conducted by a NY Times bestselling author in the fantasy/horror/sf field. The working title is Sculpting Cthulhu: A Statue Inspired by H.P. Lovecraft, by Stephen Hickman.In addition to the book itself, because you are an essential and valued part of this project, we will be printing your name in the book as a backer. This limited edition collector's book is an exclusive to this Kickstarter project, and will never be available elsewhere. (We are currently determining the trim size of the book, its page count, and other specifics. We have already hired one of the best book printers in the U.S. The book will ship to you along with the statue itself, in one package.)SO WHEN WILL YOU GET IT?Barring unforeseen circumstances, like a flu epidemic, the statue and book should be in your hands in December 2020.PACKING DETAILSPackaging: The statue itself is protected with a two-piece, form-fitting styrofoam enclosure. Drop-tested for durability, the statue is also protected by two boxes: the collector's box, and a corrugated cardboard container.KEEPING YOU INFORMEDWe will keep you informed, of course, and keep in mind that you (like all of us) are deluged with information. So we'll keep things simple, short, and to-the-point. We will issue progress reports as we hit major milestones in production and shipping, and as soon as we will begin shipping, we will provide an update on when you can expect to receive it. Right now, we're planning to use Federal Express Ground for U.S., and an international courier service for overseas orders. In the U.S., expect delivery in 10 days; outside the U.S., expect delivery in 17 days, barring any Customs delays. (We will NOT be using the U.S. Postal Service, because they take twice as long to deliver to overseas destinations.) Also, if there is a problem with your order, we will respond quickly to let you know we're on it, and we'll take care of it immediately.CUSTOMS/IMPORT FEESRegarding Customs, we must put down the full amount you paid ($250), for any so any custom/import fees can be properly assessed. You will be responsible for any additional fees/tariffs/taxes as it applies to your country. Also, we cannot mark the item as a GIFT because it's obviously not: we play by the rules to avoid any entanglements with the Customs officials in your country.MY FINANCIAL INVESTMENT IN THIS PROJECTIn addition to the time and effort I've put into making this a distinctive piece of eldritch fantasy work, I have already invested $3000 of my own money into the project.We are sparing no expense to give you a collectible statue manufactured to my exacting standards.I'm asking for your support to make this unique project a reality, and I thank you all in advance for being an integral part of this special project.BIOGRAPHYI have been illustrating science fiction and fantasy for 4 decades.Among other publications, my work has appeared in 20 of the 24 Spectrum annual art books, the premiere showcase of curated art from artists worldwide.I have published two collections of my work: The Fantasy Art of Stephen Hickman (Donning Company, 1988) and Empyrean: The Fantasy Art of Stephen Hickman (Titan Books, 2015).Bowen Designs has issued two of my Lovecraft-themed statues: ""Stephen Hickman's Cthulhu Statue (1997),"" and a bust of HPL himself, ""Stephen Hickman's Lovecraft (1999).""I have had my paintings shown in numerous exhibits in the U.S., including the Smithsonian Air and Space Museum in Washington, D.C.My major awards include a Hugo Award (World Science Fiction Convention), seven Chesley Awards from ASFA (Association of Science Fiction and Fantasy Artists), and two SPECTRUM Gold Awards.COMMENTS FROM ARTISTS:Concept artist and sculptor, Jordu Schell: ""The masterpiece against which all other Cthulhu designs must be compared.""Artist and Disney Imagineer Tim Kirk: ""I've been a lifelong fan of fantastic literature, and one of my favorite authors (and one I discovered very early) is H.P. Lovecraft. Steve Hickman, in addition to being a superb illustrator, is a very accomplished sculptor. His three-dimensional vision of Lovecraft's cosmic entity Cthulhu is, to me, by far the best I've seen: bizarre and otherworldly, with an ancient, ominous and haunting presence; as if no human hand had fashioned it!""Artist Donald Giancola: ""Stephen Hickman is brilliant in his sensitivity to textures, convincing anatomy, and dynamic design, breathing life into this new surreal sculpt from the Cthulhu Mythos.""Artist Michael Whelan: ""Stephen Hickman needs no introduction to fantasy art lovers, as he is one of the most highly individual and accomplished contemporary purveyors of that challenging genre. His depiction of Cthulhu is a modern day masterwork, uncannily alive and fascinating in his coiled and timeless menace, a perfect melding of the haunted stories of H.P. Lovecraft and the stylistic realism of Stephen Hickman. Bravo! With humble appreciation, Michael Whelan.""","We committed to this project three years ago, when I began work sketching and designing this new sculpture. I've already invested countless hours and $3,000 of my own money to get the piece into pre-production, and have hired a Hong Kong manufacturer whose experience in producing high-end collectibles for the marketplace worldwide in unsurpassed: they are the gold standard in the field of high-end sculpture and related collectibles.I have also consulted with numerous friends who have years of experience in manufacturing, design, and shipping, to take advantage of their collective wisdom, including those who have run successful Kickstarter campaigns. I am grateful for their assistance.We are now ready to get the statues into production as soon as we are funded. And that's where YOU come in and become a part of my extended team.Finally, if we have any delays, we will let you know, and we'll work hard to overcome any issues that may arise during this project. And, of course, if there's any problem with your order, we will respond quickly and professionally to resolve any issues.",https://www.kickstarter.com/projects/lovecraft-hickman/lovecrafts-cthulhu-a-statue-sculpted-by-stephen-hickman?ref=discovery_category_newest,lovecraft-hickman/lovecrafts-cthulhu-a-statue-sculpted-by-stephen-hickman,"Note: The video above is from the original Kickstarter campaign, and reflects the previous price of $250, which is outdated.

And it looks great, showing all the extra detail I added to the master cast before I sent it off — this is close to perfect, the work is beautiful... how’s this for progress!? This has got to be great newsto all who have supported my project (many of you twice!)over the past eight weeks — many thanks to you all...!— Stephen HickmanApril 22 update: I’m excited to announce my SECOND STRETCH GOAL for the CTHULHU STATUETTE Kickstarter campaign! For a premium, everyone will get a hand-signed giclee print of my “Cthulhu Rising” painting, in addition to the 48-page booklet — and we only need 7 more backers to do this!To commemorate this second stretch goal, I’ve taken more shots of the statuette to show how different the unique color-shift paint looks in different lights — you can experiment with your own statuette when it arrives! Hint: try one of those pinkish Gro-lights for a really unearthly effect!BACKSTORYI am relaunching my previously posted Kickstarter campaign for my Cthulhu statue, meticulously crafted as closely as possible to H.P. Lovecraft's description of his fictional Elder God.We came very close to the finish line, and we've gone back to the drawing board to maximize the odds of meeting our funding goal. I deeply appreciate, and am grateful for, the kind words some of you have shared with me online, in e-mails, and on the comments for the previous campaign. The show of support reinforced my thinking that there would be a market for my new version of Cthulhu: $29,508 was pledged for the previous campaign, for which I thank you. Now, after going back to the drawing board, I have made necessary changes to reach our recalibrated funding goal of $20,000.The statue is now $199 plus shipping. For U.S. backers, the shipping cost is $25. And for overseas backers, the shipping cost is a flat rate of $50, no matter where you live in the world. (We were planning on using the US Postal Service, but we will now be using a worldwide courier service that, while more expensive than the USPS, is also more reliable and faster. As with the last campaign, we are subsidizing the high cost of overseas shipping, and able to offer it at no increase in price.)About Stephen HickmanI have an all new, completely reworked version of my iconic Cthulhu statue for which I would appreciate your support, so I can get it into production immediately. As I have already begun pre-production (tooling and set-up costs for the paint master), I am confident we will be able to ship it to you no later than sometime in December 2020.Much of my award-winning 45-year career in fantasy and science fiction illustration has been involved in painting book covers, so it's fitting that my new iteration of my previously released Cthulhu statue from Bowen Designs over two decades ago grew out of a book cover assignment for Baen Books--Cthulhu: The Mythos and Kindred Horrors, edited by David Drake.I'm Also a SculptorIn the past, when I needed to have a realistic idea of lighting a complex subject for cover assignments, I made clay models (maquettes) of various alien and fantasy characters. For the Baen book, I took it a step further: I took an actual photo of the sculpture of Cthulhu and used that for the cover itself, and then ended up rendering a painting of it, which appeared in The Fantasy Art of Stephen Hickman (Donning Company, 1988). Soon after its publication, Randy Bowen (of Bowen Designs) saw it, and it was the basis for a statue he brought to market.The First Cthulhu Statue Sold OutTwo thousand pieces of my first Cthulhu statue, issued over two decades ago, sold out; and although I was satisfied with the sales, I was never quite satisfied with the statue itself, which looked unfinished to me--especially when compared to its companion piece, a bust of H.P. Lovecraft, which Bowen Designs issued as a follow-up project.Repeated requests from fans over the years, along with the high prices the Cthulhu statue commanded online over the years, convinced me that there was a need for an updated, affordable, and more finished version of the original statue from Bowen Designs. So I got to work, and after two years of intensive planning and countless sketches, I am finally pleased with the end result: a reworked, high-quality, updated Cthulhu statue that's affordably priced--$199 (plus shipping).The Statue ItselfThe piece is a little over eight inches tall, cast in polyresin, and encased in full color collector's box measuring 8 inches in length, 8 inches in width, and 13 inches in height: a form-fitting corrugated box with molded styrofoam for protection. The statue itself features an out-of-this-world black-green/violet color-shift finish, a special blend of paints evoking the otherworldly ""stone never seen on earth,"" as H.P. Lovecraft himself described it in his short story, ""Call of Cthulhu.""We have already begun productionIn order to be able to get you the statue as soon as possible, I have been diligently working during the last year to accomplish the necessary, time-consuming preproduction work. The result is that, as soon as we get funded, we can immediately begin production of the statue itself. In other words, we are wasting no time in getting this piece manufactured: the masters for casting and paint matching are now completed. Each hand-painted, hand-finished piece is then carefully boxed in a form-fitting clamshell-like enclosure, and then shipped to our warehouse in the United States.The production is being handled by a company in Hong Kong that is considered to be the gold standard in the field of producing high-end collectibles for discerning collectors. They are, simply, the best in the field. Discriminating fans of comic books, science fiction, and fantasy movies and books know this company's productions well: from affordable busts to towering six-feet-tall sculptures, this company was our first, and only, choice for what we hope will be the first in a line of sculptures I am designing for discerning collectors. When you hold the finished piece, you'll agree (I hope) that it was well worth the wait. (As the movie TOY STORY reminds us, you can't rush art.)So when will you get it?Barring another coronavirus, which shut down the manufacturing plant for several weeks, we expect to have the statue in your hands sometime in December 2020. (We have built in some time for inevitable, unforeseen delays, and feel confident that our date is realistic. Of course, we will keep all supporters updated by postings on Kickstarter, and through e-mails sent only to supporters.)Packing detailsLong experience has proven that in order to survive shipment anywhere in the world, the statue must be carefully protected with a two-piece, styrofoam enclosure that will survive a four to five-foot drop test for durability, and that is what we have done: we've had the manufacturer custom-design the styrofoam enclosure, which will be placed in a full-color collector's box, which is then form-fitted into a corrugated shipping box that will be appropriately labeled: FRAGILE SCULPTURE INSIDE. HANDLE WITH CARE.We will keep you informedWe will keep you informed, but not with too much information. We will post on the Kickstarter page, and use private emails to supporters only, with information you need to know. We'll keep it short, simple, and direct. We will send short progress reports on the major steps as we begin production, to keep you informed.Important shipping informationWe will now be using Federal Express Ground for shipping within the U.S. We will provide each of you with a tracking number at the time of shipment. As we are on the east coast of the U.S., shipping time will vary, depending on your location. But going cross-country, to California, expect 7 business days.For overseas customers, we are using an expensive courier service that will get you the sculpture in half the time that we have experienced when shipping by the US Postal Service. Even with customs, we expect delivery in two weeks, three at most, which includes clearing customs in your country. As you can imagine, shipping from the U.S. to overseas destinations is expensive, and trying to determine the exact shipping cost for every major country is problematic, so we have a flat rate of $50 that covers most, but not all, of the shipping cost. We will be subsidizing the difference, to keep the statue as affordable in price as possible.We have consulted with experienced shipping companies who handle domestic and foreign shipping, and also consulted small press publishers who have significant experience in shipping issues worldwide: We have taken advantage of their expertise.Customs/duties/import taxes: These are the responsibility of the buyer. For obvious reasons, we cannot mark it as a GIFT to keep the costs down for you, because we can be held liable as shippers for any misstatements on the customs forms, and the possible penalties are prohibitive and punitive. So: we abide by the rules.My financial investment in this projectI've spent years doing countless designs to derive the final, detailed drawings that are the basis for my second iteration of Cthulhu as a statue. I have already invested $3,700 of my own money to get the project to the current milestone: a statue ready to go into production as soon as funding is achieved.Above all else, the quality of the finished piece is my principal concern. I have spared no expense in hiring the best company of its kind in the world to insure that my new Cthulhu sculpture will be produced to my exacting standards.I'm asking for your renewed support to make this unique project a reality, and I thank you all in advance for being an integral part of this project: a team effort from start to finish, your support and my investment in time, money, and effort combine to bring to the world a collectible you will be proud to own.My biographyBooks: I have been illustrating science fiction and fantasy books for over four decades.

He returns to his hometown to live with his eccentric Aunt Patty and takes a job as a psych professor at his Alma Mater - a small Christian college.The school has plans for expansion, but the building they need has been willed to an LGBT support group. They just have to raise the funds to cover the taxes. In an effort to discover their progress, Dave inadvertently and awkwardly becomes part of the group.For the first time in his life, he is face-to-face with the people he has been counseling against his whole adult life, as well as the unintended victims of such counseling. Through humor and turmoil, Dave realizes that often things aren't as black and white as he'd like them to be.40% of homeless youth identify as LGBT. This is largely disproportionate to the 6-8% of the population in general.Most of the stories from these youth share one point: their parents reject them once they come out. Many of these families blame their religion or beliefs - they have been taught or believe that accepting the sexual or gender ""otherness"" of their child.Once these kids are on the street - they are open to a whole world of dangers.Just in time for our final week, we've released a new reward level: The LGBT Dedication at $200. Who has been that special person within the LGBT community who loved you when it felt like no one else did? Who could you count on to give you a hug? A kind word? A knowing glance? Maybe it's your son or daughter who came out. Maybe it's your sibling who transitioned. Maybe it's your parent who risked losing friends.For a $200 pledge (or higher), you can add their name to our final credits under a special ""LGBT Hero Dedication"" category. Once the kickstarter is complete, we'll get the name from you. And - get started early. After you pledge, be sure to share on Facebook or Twitter that your pledge is dedicated to your LGBT hero. Ask them to pass it on! I am a straight, Christian ally, but that didn't happen overnight.For many of us who have grown up in the church, there is a very real, very slow and very hard shedding of beliefs during the discovery of our own way of life and faith. And one of the most pressing issues we are navigating today is sexual and gender orientation.In early 2014, after making 75 short films, I decided to begin my first feature film. I have a strong value of not settling for ""safe"" stories, so I knew my first feature had to be something important and unique.My own journey certainly started with stories. It started by opening myself to honor the stories of my LGBT friends who also follow Christ. According to the faith of the church of my youth, this wasn't possible. And yet, here it was, happening right before my eyes. Lesbian friends of mine, living in a committed relationship of over 20 years, living more like Jesus than I was.This sent my wife and I on a journey of questions. And the answer we've come to is that: Christians have been trying to provide answers to questions for a long time now. I think it's time we lay that down and start asking questions - and take the time to truly listen. I know that's when I have developed the most meaningful relationships.At the heart of the film, amid the humor and quirk, is the sad truth that up to 40% of homeless teens are LGBT. Most of this has happened in religious homes, as the result of parents not knowing how to, or being unwilling to, understand or deal with the sexual orientation or gender identity of their child.Many times when religious parents turn to Christian counselors, pastors or authors for help, they are told not to accept their child.At The End Of The Day is not about LGBT rights. It is not about marriage equality. At The End Of The Day is about listening. It is about acknowledging there is much in the world I don't know. And it's about asking questions and taking the time to listen to and honor the answers.Kevin O'BrienWriter/Director/ProducerThat's me! While this is my first feature, I've written and directed over 75 short films in the past five years (see my favorites here).

But if we don’t start with a plan we’ll never get anything done.Here's the deal - we can't do this without your help! This film is for a very specific time in history, and that is now! Our goal of $20,000 is designed to show potential investors that there's a market out there for great storytelling. Of course, the ultimate dream would be for that goal to be blown out of the water, so we don't need investors to begin with. And if you awesome folks pull that off, there aren't words to explain how grateful we'd be....perfectly touches on the heart of the issue - and does so with sweet humor and emotion....very moving. It was happy, and sad, and felt authentic.I felt like there was a little bit of everything: funny, touching, things that make you think. Cried like a baby!",Indie Film is all about risks and challenges.The biggest challenge is that our Kickstarter goal is only the first part of production money needed for this film. We need investors to come along side us and add to the awesome commitments from you.
https://www.kickstarter.com/projects/redtuskllc/kobra-flash-modifier-system?ref=discovery_category_newest,redtuskllc/kobra-flash-modifier-system,"The KOBRA was made to give photographers an effective flash modifier solution that is lightweight, flexible and with an attractive design.As a professional photographer, I have used all the “on camera flash” modifiers that are available and have been unsatisfied with the results. I decided to stop complaining and make my own.The “KOBRA Flash Modifier” is molded from a high-grade, flexible, light diffusing clear silicone that is not affected by high or low temperatures. This allows the “KOBRA Flash Modifier” to bounce back to its originally molded shape after folded from storing in your camera bag. The “KOBRA Flash Modifier” gets its backbone from the patent pending built-in reflector. The reflector bounces the light forward through the clear silicone, acting as a second layer of diffusion, giving the photographer the ability to ""paint with the light, not spray.""The “KOBRA Flash Modifier” utilizes a molded, patent pending, state-of-the-art attachment system to secure itself to the ""KOBRA Band.""The “KOBRA Band,” is molded from a high-grade, flexible, black silicone that is not affected by high or low temperatures. The “KOBRA Band” fits most flash heads. It's simple and self-contained with no need for hook and loop or magnet attachments.The ""KOBRA Band"" not only holds the ""KOBRA Flash Modifier"" but also multitasks by securing our ""KOBRA Color Gel System.""Even with the advanced technology of today's cameras, low light conditions subject your images to movement or noise. To avoid this scenario, you need to bring light to the party. You need the ""KOBRA Flash Modifier.""You can bring location lighting systems with you such as umbrellas, but that takes extra work and are a hassle to move around. Small “on camera flash” can help, but bouncing your flash off walls and ceilings not only drains your flashbut also results in a lesscontrol of the ever-changing lighting conditions. Sure you can get a diffused lightin return, but when that wall is not a perfect white that same color cast from the wall will fall on your subject, resulting in you fixing color casts in post-production.In most cases, there are no white walls or ceilings to bounce off of. That is where the ""KOBRA Flash Modifier"" is a game-changer. Now, you are walking around with your own wall.My goal in the modifier comparison test was to photograph only the light emitting from the modifiers. The best way to achieve that is too black out the sides & ceiling with gobos. This will help control any light spill reflecting back on the model. Also, this will show how effective your modifier really is. The camera was set to manual, ISO 100, Aperture f5, Shutter1/100. The flash was set to ETTL +1 because of the white rear wall. Why ETTL? Most *Event Photographers use TTL because it is the best way to evaluate exposer in-camera in an ever changing distance to the subject. What was clear from the start, the flash built-in catch light panel (small bounce card) is practically useless as a serious contender because of the massive light loss of the panel. All the modifiers that had a 360° spraying coverage all lost exposure resulting in unexposed images. The modifiers that had a forward facing reflector exposed correctly were the KOBRA, Magbounce, Foto4easy & Neewer Bounce Cap. The Altura Diffuser did the worst surprisingly as I was using “Through the lens metering.” Foto4easy Foldable, similar to the Rogue Flash Bender, slips off the flash easily; you’re going to lose the Foto4easy, “real easy” pun intended. Bigger usually means better but that didn’t lead to a better exposer maybe because of its massive footprint this is a little too large to walk around with. The Neewer Bounce cap named maybe because it looks & feels similar to a shower cap worked ok but again slipped right off the flash too easily. The Magbounce like the KOBRA had the best soft light & skin tones but with weight (12ozs) of all that silicon material plus six large earth magnets put a lot of pressure on rotating the flash head in the wrong direction was definitely a downer. Well, something to consider when you are looking to buy your next flash modifier/diffuser.Paul McKelvey, Professional Event Photographer Vero Image*What is an event Photographers? Event photographer can be anybody with a flash from a soccer mom trying to cover her son or daughter's birthday party a weekend warrior, wedding photographers all the way to the professional photographer covering major events. ""Switching between horizontal and vertical is a breeze!"" -Mario Romero, Vero ImageThe objective of the KOBRA is to bounce light off the internal reflector before it hits your subject. Rendering a pleasing three-dimensional quality to the light. To further enhance the user's experience, KOBRA has a refreshing, cutting-edge look without the need of the weight and bulk of powerful “Earth Magnets,” or noisy “Hook & Loop” attachment systems.The KOBRA has a brand new, patent-pending, state-of-the-art attachment system. It comes with a unique multitasking silicone band, which not only grips and holds the KOBRA but holds our color gel system.Due to its silicone grip and flexibility, it is simple and self-contained, fitting most flash heads. It needs no other magnetic or hook & loop attachments.The KOBRA Gel system comes with six pre-cut colored gels each contained within our rigid and flexible clear plastic gel holder. The gels are inserted into a KOBRA band that is already attached to a flash. To help white balance in tungsten light, the kit comes with 3 CTO's (color temperature orange) Full, 1/2 & 1/4. To add more for dramatic lighting effects you will find Red, Green and Blue filter.We only use LEE Filters which provide high-quality lighting filters that are accurately consistent from batch to batch, long-lasting and dependable. Every filter is checked against a scientifically generated set of parameters.The idea for this project started in 2011 when out on location shooting an event. We were unable to set-up a studio light with an umbrella due to the tight location and were surrounded with dark walls. In that moment, we wished we had a flash modifier in our kit.After years of research and development and working in the field with multiple 3D prototypes it is exciting to move forward with the release of a production version of the KOBRA flash modifier.One of the first questions we are asked when meeting professional photographers who have seen the working prototype is, ""Where can I get one?”Red Tusk LLC. is a start-up design studio passionate about photography and efficient design.

We hit the festival scene, won some awards, and had a blast. If you didn't catch it then, you can catch it now on YouTube.

https://www.kickstarter.com/projects/artistsliteracies/the-democratic-field?ref=discovery_category_newest,artistsliteracies/the-democratic-field,"There is a momentous election in the US this year (maybe you've noticed!). Right around the last presidential election, there was a lot of talk about the role that implicit bias and media distortion played in shaping voters' preferences. But what do we know now that we didn't know then? Where has that talk led? How can we access these deep-seated and subconscious tendencies, to be more critical, more well-informed, and have more agency over the forces that often shape our civic decisions from outside ourselves?“The Democratic Field” is a theatrical table-read, social research project, and civic intervention which uses actors to expose the role of implicit bias and subconscious perception in the way we vote.  And we need YOUR HELP to bring it to as many US states as possible in the midst of the primary season and leading up to the Democratic National Convention in July!Imagine ten actors of various ages, races, and genders, readingverbatim and in the exact cadence of the policy statements of ten different candidates for President - without the audience or the actors themselves knowing whose words they were voicing? How well do we know the candidates we prefer, and how much of our political preference is based on appearances, identities, and personality, versus the substance of policy itself?This is ""The Democratic Field."" Beginning with policy statements from 10 Democratic candidates on selected issues, actors trained by the Verbatim Performance Lab then table-read these policy statements using an embodied verbatim method unique to the VPL, and developed for just this sort of hybrid theater-social research.The statements are handed out randomly among the actors so that bodies, genders, and races are shuffled, and the audience (and actor alike) no longer know whose words they are speaking. Forced to listen carefully to the words, and to gauge their reaction to the identities of the ""candidate"", new awarenesses about perception and preference emerge in the audience members that no form of polling or surveying can access.Following the performance, the audience is polled for their voting preferences, to capture which of the candidates ""won"". Then a facilitated discussion with the audience draws out perceptions, observations, preferences, and dislikes, before the true identities of the candidates is revealed.Our political preferences are a complex blend between persona and identity, policy and substance, self-image and projection. This qualitative, participatory, art-based research method allows us surprising, nuanced social insights and offers audiences a reflective experience that deepens and informs their political engagement in ways that can only benefit the health of our democracy. By iterating “The Democratic Field” through the full campaign, pairing each performance with the real debates, we will enrich the civic discourse, deepen the public conversation, and short-circuit the reductive and destructive effects of online political media.So far, we have done 4 engagements of this project at the Centre for Social Innovation in New York, and now 1 in Cedar Rapids, Iowa, just a day before the caucus there. Each event is newly surprising, informative, and leaves a lasting impact on a group of voters. They don't get told who to vote for - instead they come to understand much more deeply why they support the candidates they do, and their minds are opened to considering other candidates that they may have shut out as a result of some deeply-held bias. It's a unifying, refreshing reconnection to our agency as citizens, and a necessary check on the power of spectacle and algorithmic thinking in selecting our elected officials.Now we want to take it on the road for 4 months, and we need your support to raise $10,000 to do so. Iowa was such a huge success (see our local news coverage here) that we are ready to go to as many states as possible in the midst of the primary season, and leading up to an event just preceding the Democratic National Convention in July. We have interest in New Hampshire, South Carolina, Alabama, California, Wisconsin, and more each day - we just have to get there, partner up with local communities and organizations to put together a cast of performing artists, give them a crash one-afternoon workshop on how to read a scored verbatim transcript, and then have a reading for the public!  Your support gets us out there!We've proven we can do this at low cost and on short notice; Iowa came together in just 2-3 weeks, and we were there for just 2 days, but the outcomes and impact were profound and lasting for both the actors (who received free professional development and a new performance tool) and the audiences.We need your help to fund TRAVEL, OUTREACH to prospective partners, and the ability to help subsidize those PARTNERS in the states we want to be working in - by covering things like publicity, overhead, research reporting, office expenses, and photo/video documentation. ""The Democratic Field"" isn't just a theater project that is forgotten as soon as people are back outside the theater/townhall/community space. It's also an innovative research project that leverages an actors' ability to inhabit candidates in order to draw out response-data from the audience, and let us share that back with the audience in an act of feedback and reflection. We're furthering our general knowledge of the role of implicit bias in political choice-making, and creating a broad snapshot of the state of the American electorate in 2020 - in order to build resilience against persuasive forces that act beneath our consciousness. And so with every event, we release summary analyses, complete with unique sets of qualitative data, that can inform a larger study of democratic decision-making.After analysis of responses from just one performance, there were already indications of significant and meaningful outcomes. We have assembled these into a comprehensive analysis report, with separate studies on the perceptions for each candidate, and the cognitive experience of the audience. Just a few samples below:• After the performance, over 70% of the attendees ended up voting for a different candidate from the one they had indicated a preference for at the beginning; signs of a significant cognitive shift and a demonstration of the challenge of having informed political discourse in a spectacle-fueled environmentEach event generates its own body of fascinating and valuable social knowledge, for both participants and hosts. We capture this knowledge through a participatory discourse, followed by an aggregation of responses into a summary report, complete with visualizations to help see how preferences and perceptions are changed and shaped.Andrew Freiband founded the Artists' Literacies Institute in 2018, as a combination school for artists (not an art-school!) and agency to connect artists to meaningful research opportunities.Artists' Literacies itself is a framework for artists to identify their unique ways of knowing, and apply them to meaningful contexts, such as the pursuit of social justice, environmental sustainability, or humane intervention in large and complex systems.Artists know things nobody else knows, and are able to learn in ways nobody else can learn. What is often intuitive in a creative practice can be made cognitive through a process of critical dialogue, reflective feedback, and the structured study of various ways of knowing.Markets and economies demand that artists be defined by the products and objects they produce. Artists’ literacies instead centers your process, and the knowledge you possess to create new value and opportunities for artists as world-shapers and culture producers.Research conducted by artists is extremely effective at identifying the deepest structures underlying the most complex systems. This sort of knowledge is extremely valuable both to shape just and humane societies, and to reposition artists as among humanity’s most prominent producers of knowledge.The Verbatim Performance Lab (VPL) emerged following the success of Her Opponent, a re-staging of excerpts from the 2016 U. S. Presidential debates with gender-reversed casting, created by Maria Guadalupe (INSEAD) and Joe Salvatore (NYU Steinhardt). That performance premiered at the Provincetown Playhouse in January 2017 and then went on to enjoy an Off Broadway run at The Jerry Orbach Theater. A full archival video of the performance is available here.Since ""Her Opponent"", VPL has re-staged many other gender and racially controversial events, including Judge Kavanaugh's Supreme Court Hearing (""The Kavanaugh Files""), The US Open Women's Tennis match (The Serena Williams Project), President Rodrigo Duterte criticizing Obama (No(body) but Nobody), The Access Hollywood Tapes (The Grab 'em Tapes), among several others.Important to note is that Verbatim Performance is not satire. The actors words, vocal inflections and physical gestures are all pulled directly from the events as they happened, and performed verbatim. VPL produces content that challenges accepted political, cultural, and social narratives, while embracing the philosophy that social change emerges from dialogue, not monologue.","The challenge?  Getting to as many states as we can in the next few months, while the campaign continues to evolve.  As candidates drop out, we are ready to adapt the project to stay relevant to the political discourse - by varying the number of candidates, offering statements on more issues, and exploring other variations made possible by the toolset of verbatim performance.  We know that even if we don't get to a state before their primary election, that this exercise has huge benefits for navigating the upcoming general election.  We see this as the beginning of long, slow cultural change, not only a quick fix for 2020.  The risks?  Well, air travel has its risks. Other than that, we're enormously confident that ""The Democratic Field"" will make an impact on the participants (actors and audience alike) that will be meaningful, lasting, and surprising to all of us!  We need to keep finding the local partners to work with, but with the funds from your support we'll be able to incentivize arts orgs, theaters, and community groups to join forces with us!",https://www.kickstarter.com/projects/artistsliteracies/grief-deck-an-artists-card-set-for-communal-grieving?ref=discovery_category_newest,artistsliteracies/grief-deck-an-artists-card-set-for-communal-grieving,"Follow this project at @artistsgriefdeck on Instagram!The GRIEF DECK is a set of 50 medium format ‘flashcards’ that are each individually designed by artists, sometimes in collaboration with grief workers. One side displays the artwork, and on the reverse is a ‘grieving prompt.’ These are memorial and processual actions that give the individual something to do - a gesture, a tiny performance, a movement, an act of mindfulness - in memoriam for someone or something whose loss they are grieving. The GRIEF DECK provides aid to organizations working in disaster relief by guiding emotional and spiritual care to their constituents in need, as well as for individuals and families to navigate and structure their mourning in the midst of a catastrophe that continues to keep us apart.The cards exist in tangible, printed form, and will also be freely available in an online archive, open to continued additions by new artists and grief workers, so that new prompts are always available, and even printable. The online GRIEF DECK will also have paired accessibility features, to ensure the prompts can be used by the hearing and visually impaired equally.  With your support, we can mobilize artists to begin to address this essential and necessary need, and aid the millions of people who are grieving loss without sufficient communal support.Covid-19 is unique among natural catastrophes. Loss is experienced on numerous levels, and it is ongoing. It is not geographically specific, and so there is no ‘getting out’ of the affected area to recuperate and heal. As it takes an enormous toll in human life, it also prevents us from gathering together to mourn, interrupting rituals of grieving across all cultures.Our partners with the NYC Voluntary Organizations Active in Disaster (NYC VOAD) have identified people’s inability to process loss, to grieve with their friends, family, and community, and mourn in communal settings as one of the most pressing unmet needs of this disaster. The continuing threat of Covid-19 means we cannot hold funerals, sit shiva, pray together, or even embrace one another as we once did - all of which are essential pieces of natural human grieving. As a result, we are experiencing an event of mass traumatization without some of our most essential tools for coping, processing, and building back resilience.Artists are uniquely situated to help build new structures for grieving. It is artists, after all, who are historically producers of human culture, and from whom so many of our traditions and rituals have derived. The GRIEF DECK seeks to mobilize artists around the world to fill this urgent unmet need, drawing on their practices of performance, memorialization, mindfulness, and community caregiving. In this still-unfolding disaster, artists are our ‘second responders,’ and with your help we can connect their efforts to the millions of people in need, to try and stop short a cycle of traumatization that threatens humanity through the next generation.Your backing will go to supporting the call to artists, the design, formatting, printing and distribution of the card decks themselves, and the design and development of the online platform, including its accessibility features. Importantly, artists contributing to the Grief Deck will be provided with compensation for their work, and your contribution will therefore be supporting artists whose economy has been decimated by Covid-19, as well as the Grief Deck’s constituency, those who have experienced loss of a loved one and are in need of methods of remembrance and grieving.CLICK HERE FOR MORE ON THE OPEN CALL, AND CONTRIBUTING YOUR ART AS A DONOR REWARD!Alongside the crowdfunding campaign, we’re pleased to announce an OPEN CALL for artists of all disciplines, traditions, career stages, and backgrounds to submit original visual work and grief prompts for inclusion in both the printed Grief Deck and the online archive.We especially encourage BIPOC artists to participate in acknowledgement of the disproportionate impact Covid-19 has had on these communities - and therefore the greater need for grieving tools that serve them.On one side, each card will include an original visual work: an image that can serve as a focal point for healing, reflection, meditation, or remembranceOn the other side, a ‘grief prompt,’ or text-based directions for a simple action that can occupy the holder in time, and create a personal ritual, memorial gesture, or mindful movement. These can be original to the artists’ practice, or derived from personal or cultural tradition and adapted for the singular experience of grieving in isolation. You can see some examples of these prompts in our sample cards above. (This side of the card will also credit the artist and/or the author of the grief prompt.)Artists are invited to collaborate with grief workers or develop their contributions individually. Artists whose work is selected for the printed deck will receive a $250 honorarium. All artists work is also eligible for inclusion in the online component of the Grief Deck, which will be utilized by disaster relief organizations to provide emotional and spiritual care throughout the pandemic and beyond.First Round of Submissions Closes SEPTEMBER 9! This is for inclusion in the printed deck (and a $250 honorarium) and the opportunity to share your original work as donor rewards in this campaign! (Don't worry though, there will be a Second Round upon successfully achieving our Kickstarter goals!)For more information and to submit work, visit our submission form here: https://forms.gle/x7xPwfvxrd1DqXsv7For any questions about the Open Call, message us here or by email: info@artistsliteracies.orgThis project was born out of the Artists' Working Group on Communal Grieving Processes, a coalition of artists convened through the Artists' Literacies Institute and the NYC VOAD (Voluntary Organizations Active in Disaster).Andrew Freiband, Project Producer:As the Artists’ Literacies Institute I help artists reframe their creative practice as research and the creation of knowledge (beyond the creation of art-works), and then create engagements for research-artists with organizations and institutions that need these unique ways of knowing applied to their work.Adriene Jenik, Project Producer:I am a media and performing artist, arts educator and death doula who resides in the desert. Through my public performances reading climate futures with my ECOtarot deck, I have been deeply engaged with ecological grief and community loss. I have a long history with collaborating with others outside the art field.NYCVOAD/Artists' Working Group on Communal Grieving Processes:New York City Voluntary Organizations Active in Disaster (NYCVOAD) and the Artists’ Literacies Institute formed a working group in early April, 2020, to uncover ways that artists can be directly involved in the massive disaster relief effort that COVID-19 demands of us.NYCVOAD - a coalition of non-profit, faith-based, and government organizations committed to strengthening the capabilities of organizations working together in NYC to relieve human suffering caused by disaster - identified communal grieving as a huge, problematic gap in their response, and the CGP Working Group was formed toaddress it.Neither NYCVOAD nor any of its member organizations will receive any funding from this campaign.","Our first challenge is running the open call to artists at the same time as our fundraising campaign.  We are creating the this open call in order to solicit artwork and prompts and methods from as diverse an array of creative practitioners as possible; but through our own immediate networks we already know we can generate enough cards to fill the collection - so the open call is more about creating diversity of approaches and reaching out to artists beyond our own networks.  The mock-ups on this page are just some of the many cards already prepared; the campaign will be all the more successful if we are able to curate from a much larger collection of contributions.We are also navigating the risks of sensitivity and awareness around this delicate issue.  Working with our partners in the NYC VOADs, we’re ensuring there is a protocol in place to make the collection inclusive and nondenominational - without losing the specificity of the traditions that humans have leaned on throughout our history.  We’re grateful to have an extensive network of advisors from both secular and faith traditions to help navigate these challenges, as well as a diverse network of artists poised to contribute to the project."

We design the watches we want to wear, and work to make them as affordable as possible. Removing all the unnecessary mark ups and ensuring we keep to our founding belief of high quality at a fair price.Sticking to this core value has led to features across the industry:Our Debut Collection launched late 2019 following a successful Kickstarter campaign, and thanks to the ongoing support from a worldwide network of happy customers, we are now able to proudly introduce:The result of months of design, iterations and testing; our latest timepieces subtly showcase a stunning Japanese automatic movement behind each beautifully detailed dial, with a price point to contrast the premium features. At a glance, each watch in the collection includes:You can find full details of the collection throughout this campaign:Self Winding Mechanical MovementIntroducing an automatic watch was the single most requested comment from our debut campaign, and we couldn't be more excited to oblige. Automatic/self-winding watches are often chosen as the perfect combination of character and heritage of the mechanical watch, without the need to manually wind the movement each day.Our chosen Japanese movement is no different. A truly stunning display of horology. Crafted with precision while avoiding the mark-up that comes with the Swiss label.MIYOTA 82S5 JAPANESE MECHANICAL AUTOMATIC MOVEMENT Hours / Minutes / Seconds Self-winding mechanism Power reserve (if not worn) 42 hours 21,600 vibrations per hour 21 JewelsWater ResistanceWith a screw down crown and pressure seal rated to 10 atmospheres (10ATM/up to 100m water resistance) for that added peace of mind.Materials:Our 40mm subtly detailed timepiece is designed from scratch, in-house in the UK. Utilizing perfect combination of premium materials, each chosen for their impressive unique properties, ensuring your next watch not only looks good, but lasts.316L Stainless SteelThe case and metallic bands are both crafted from 316L stainless steel, chosen over other material variants for its impressive strength and corrosion resistance, even in salt water environments (You'll find 316L is often used in diving equipment for the same reasons).Full Grain Genuine LeatherFull grain leather is the bee’s knee’s. The best you can get when it comes to leather. Contrary to the name, full grain leather is not grainy in appearance or feel, but has a smooth richness that is only achievable with a cut of full, unaltered hide in its natural form.You'll often see ""genuine leather"" stamped on products, but know that this term covers anything that is technically leather, no matter how processed and altered it is.Full grain is the real deal.Scratch ResistanceThe nightmare for any watch owner is having a scratch across the glass. That's why we're using sapphire crystal glass on all of our watches. Famed for its superior scratch resistance and with a hardness rating just less than that of diamond, you'll have a hard time scratching this one even if you want to.Super-LumiNovaEnsuring all day and all night usability with Swiss Super-LumiNova coatings. Our chosen BGW9 lume is transparent in daylight with a long lasting blue night glow.We tested a number of different coatings and found that C1, for example, just didn't perform as well as we had hoped. C3 lume on the other hand, performed well in the glow test but we didn't think the yellow tint the C3 lume has in day light matched the Gentlemen's clean look.The Swiss BGW9 has the best of both worlds, a lovely and long lasting blue glow at night without the yellow-ish look in the day.Options:Face variationsThe Gentlemen's Collection comes in two base colours: classic black or navy.Strap VariationsA watch, no matter how elegant, cannot be great without a strap to match, and we've gone all out. Butterfly deployment clasps compliment either the five tiered stainless steel bracelet or a choice of full grain leather straps.All strap options are fitted with classic butterfly deployment clasps.Stretch Goal #1 Unlocked: All leather straps will be fitted with quick release pins for easy on and off.To add an extra strap to your reward, simply add £15 to your selected reward level!TechnicalAs we surpass various funding goals, we'll be adding a few perks to your rewards to sweeten the deal just that little bit more.Help us get there by sharing the campaign with your friends and family!Stretch Goal #1 UnlockedTake a look around the current watch market and you'll notice our latest collection exceeds in value for money. We're using premium materials and manufacturing our watches to a much higher specification than what you'll find at this price point.So how are we are able to sell our products at such a great price?The first reason leads us back to why Pompeak exist at all - we believe in high quality products, at an honest price. We design the watches we want to wear, at an honest price. Putting pride before profit.The second reason is that we sell directly to our customers; meaning there are no distributors, retailers or other middle-men adding in their own mark-up and bumping up the final cost.Take a look at what people are saying about the latest collection:- Esquire- British GQ-Oracle Time- Yanko Designs- The CoolectorApril 5th 2019 marked the end of our debut collections successful Kickstarter launch, and the official birth of Pompeak watches.

Not because we had any missing parcels, but because we know you're taking a risk backing us, and we want to make sure you feel as comfortable with that risk as possible, including knowing exactly where your watch is, and when it will be delivered.There is a level of concern around the current coronavirus: Will it cause delays and is there a risk of transmission through shipped goods?Delays: As it stands, our supply chain is currently managing the risk and although we've built a buffer into the timeline, we're not expecting any delays.

If necessary, we will keep your watch safe until you're able to receive it.Transmission: Again we're keeping an eye on the latest advice. The health and safety of our people and customers will always take priority, but the risk here is very low. Please see the below extract from the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC):""In general, because of poor survivability of these coronaviruses on surfaces, there is likely very low risk of spread from products or packaging that are shipped over a period of days or weeks at ambient temperatures.

https://www.kickstarter.com/projects/mushamukas/tolo-loch?ref=discovery_category_newest,mushamukas/tolo-loch,"“TOLO LOCH”""Toro abrazado"" es el significado de éstos dos vocablos mayas ""tolo"" y ""loch"", los cuales, al juntarse forman el nombre de un instrumento elaborado por mexicanos, ""el tololoche"". Dicho instrumento es un ícono importante en la música mexicana, ya que desde hace más de un siglo ha sido un elemento instrumental que le ha dado vida y color a los sones huastecos y jarochos, a la música norteña, a las rondallas o a las orquestas típicas de diferentes partes de México. Ciertamente es un instrumento diferente al contrabajo, sin embargo, tienen una relación muy cercana y con mucha frecuencia se les confunde al llevarlo cargando por las calles de nuestros pueblos mexicanos.""Embraced bull"" is the meaning of these two mayan words ""tolo"" and ""loch"", which together form the name of an instrument developed by Mexicans, ""The tololoche"". This instrument is an important icon in the mexican music, since for more than a century it has been an instrumental element that has given life and color to the Huasteco and jarocho tunes, norteña music, to the rondallas or to the typical orchestras from different parts of Mexico.It is certainly an instrument different from thedouble bass, however, they have a very close relationship and are often confused when carried through the streets of our Mexican towns.TOLO LOCH no solo es nombrar el orígen etimológico de un instrumento, sino que es una alegoría que involucra a nuestro país y a la música que queremos crear para abrazarlo, es la difusión de una antología musical basada en distintos rasgos de la cultura mexicana actual,teniendo en cuenta sus raíces y las influencias que ha tenido a lo largo de la historia. Sus principales objetivos son reforzar lacultura de México, llegar a un público cuantioso, establecer una identidad humana en el ámbito artístico internacional ysensibilizar a la sociedad respecto a todos los elementos que han influido en la transformación de nuestra cultura, desde elMéxico prehispánico hasta el actual.A partir de la segunda mitad del siglo XX ha ido surgiendo un vínculo cultural entre el contrabajo y México, el cual se hadesarrollado muy poco, pues dicho instrumento no ha sido descubierto en muchas zonas de nuestro país y es infravaloradopor gran parte de la audiencia, sin embargo, es un instrumento con muchas cualidades por conocer. Por ésta razón el Taller-Ensamble de Contrabajos “Mushamukas”, desde hace 5 años construye el camino para que el vínculo entreinstrumento y sociedad crezca.TOLO LOCH is not only about the etymological origin of an instrument, but it is an allegory that involves to our country and the music that we want to create to hug it, it is also the diffusion of a musical anthology based on different features of the current Mexican culture, taking into account its roots and the influences it has had throughout the history.Its main objectives are to strengthen the culture of Mexico, to reach a large audience, establish a human identity in the artistic field and to sensitize society about all the elements that have influenced the transformation of our culture, from the pre-hispanic Mexico until the present.Since the second half of the twentieth century there has been a cultural fusion between the double bass and Mexico, which has developed very little, because this instrument has not been discovered in many areas of our country and is undervalued by a large part of the audience. However, it is an instrument with many qualities.

Es así que el resultado artístico del taller es el nacimiento de un ensamblepermanente dedicado a abordar un amplio repertorio, que supera los límites históricos y estilísticos de la música.Beginning In the 2013 in the city of Leon, Guanajuato, as a double bass orchestra it was subsequently consolidated as a ensemble, as one of its main objectives is to promote new talents and to form musicians with a solid base in chamber music and in the technique of the double bass from its roots, up to the new trends of the 21st century.It is in this way that the artistic result of the work is the birth of a permanent musical ensemble dedicated to offer a wide repertoire, which exceeds the historical limits and the style of the music.El proyecto inicia con la recopilación de obras de siete compositores mexicanos y un compositor español.

The authors have the mission of recreating a cultural landscape of Mexico in their works, making a maximum use of the technical resources and sound that a double bass ensemble offers and seeking to highlight the features of past, present and future that have formed the Mexican culture.It should be noted that there will be a cultural exchange between Mexico and Spain with one of the works that will contain the country's vision that caused one of the largest cultural transformations of America.

Dicho instrumento es un ícono importante en la música mexicana, ya que desde hace más de un siglo ha sido un elemento instrumental que le ha dado vida y color a los sones huastecos y jarochos, a la música norteña, a las rondallas o a las orquestas típicas de diferentes partes de México. Ciertamente es un instrumento diferente al contrabajo, sin embargo, tienen una relación muy cercana y con mucha frecuencia se les confunde al llevarlo cargando por las calles de nuestros pueblos mexicanos.""Embraced bull"" is the meaning of these two mayan words ""tolo"" and ""loch"", which together form the name of an instrument developed by Mexicans, ""The tololoche"". This instrument is an important icon in the mexican music, since for more than a century it has been an instrumental element that has given life and color to the Huasteco and jarocho tunes, norteña music, to the rondallas or to the typical orchestras from different parts of Mexico. It is certainly an instrument different from the double bass, however, they have a very close relationship and are often confused when carried through the streets of our Mexican towns.TOLO LOCH no solo es nombrar el orígen etimológico de un instrumento, sino que es una alegoría que involucra a nuestro país y a la música que queremos crear para abrazarlo, es la difusión de una antología musical basada en distintos rasgos de la cultura mexicana actual, teniendo en cuenta sus raíces y las influencias que ha tenido a lo largo de la historia. Sus principales objetivos son reforzar la cultura de México, llegar a un público cuantioso, establecer una identidad humana en el ámbito artístico internacional y sensibilizar a la sociedad respecto a todos los elementos que han influido en la transformación de nuestra cultura, desde el México prehispánico hasta el actual. A partir de la segunda mitad del siglo XX ha ido surgiendo un vínculo cultural entre el contrabajo y México, el cual se ha desarrollado muy poco, pues dicho instrumento no ha sido descubierto en muchas zonas de nuestro país y es infravalorado por gran parte de la audiencia, sin embargo, es un instrumento con muchas cualidades por conocer. Por ésta razón el Taller- Ensamble de Contrabajos “Mushamukas”, desde hace 5 años construye el camino para que el vínculo entre instrumento y sociedad crezca. TOLO LOCH is not only about the etymological origin of an instrument, but it is an allegory that involves to our country and the music that we want to create to hug it, it is also the diffusion of a musical anthology based on different features of the current Mexican culture, taking into account its roots and the influences it has had throughout the history. Its main objectives are to strengthen the culture of Mexico, to reach a large audience, establish a human identity in the artistic field and to sensitize society about all the elements that have influenced the transformation of our culture, from the pre-hispanic Mexico until the present. Since the second half of the twentieth century there has been a cultural fusion between the double bass and Mexico, which has developed very little, because this instrument has not been discovered in many areas of our country and is undervalued by a large part of the audience. However, it is an instrument with many qualities. For this reason the ""MUSHAMUKAS Taller-Ensamble"", since 5 years ago built the way to enhance the fusion between instrument and society.Al fusionar lo anterior con la necesidad de impulsar a la cultura de México mediante el arte, para conservarla viva y en continuo crecimiento, surge la idea de cubrir dicha necesidad, fomentando el redescubrimiento de un instrumento extraordinario y dejando plasmada en un disco compacto la sonoridad briosa de un ensamble de contrabajos, una gran masa de sonidos envolventes con una extensa gama de colores.By merging it with the need to promote the culture of Mexico through art, to keep it alive and in continuous growth, the idea emerged to fill this need, encouraging the rediscovery of an extraordinary instrument and leaving embodied in a compact disc the big sonority of a double bass ensemble, a large mass of surround sound with a wide range of colors.Taller-Ensamble de Contrabajos “Mushamukas”Surge en 2013 en la ciudad de León, Guanajuato, como una orquesta de contrabajos que posteriormente se consolidó como taller-ensamble, ya que uno de sus principales objetivos es impulsar a nuevos talentos e ir formando músicos con una sólida base en la música de cámara y en la técnica del contrabajo desde sus raíces, hasta las nuevas tendencias del siglo XXI.

Dicha especie animal se relaciona estrechamente con el papel del contrabajo como uno de los instrumentos musicales de mayor tamaño que existen y el rol que juega el gorila en la naturaleza, se relaciona con el contrabajo por ser un instrumento de poco protagonismo en el ámbito musical.""Mushamukas"" name origin comes from the alpha male Gorilla called Mushamuka that was a mountain gorilla. This alpha male was the responsible of preservingthe specie after have being an endangered specie in the 70´s in Africancontinent. This animal specie and its role in the nature are closely related with the double bass role as one of the largest size instruments and one with the less leadership in the musical culture.El proyecto inicia con la recopilación de obras de ocho compositores mexicanos y un compositor español:Paúl León .- Ricardo Barney*1 - Adalberto Tovar - Paulo Tovar - Simón García*2 - Fco.

Every time Andrew falls asleep his mind opens a portal to another dimension where monsters exist. Andrew has decided to stay awake, with damage to his mind and body.Here is a behind the scenes look at some of the beasts that will be appearing in our film. These monsters will be brought to life by Special FX artist Cody Ruch. We plan on bringing all of these monsters to life via practical effects. Each monster will present and obstacle for our hero during the runtime of the film. Each monster will have its own distinct and unique personality that will be showcased in the film.As a kid, my father had me on me on a healthy dose of atomic monster movies and other genre films. The older I got the more I saw the creature genre change. Gone are the days of The Relic, The Fly, The Thing, Mimic. These films mastered the art of being entertaining and adventurous but also featured practical effects. Today, creature movies have been pushed to the side of the horror world and sentenced to the schlocky dungeons of late night channels.The creature features that I grew up with and loved were the 80s and 90s movies--the heyday of the genre, featuring practical effects and amazing atmosphere.To learn more about my full story and my love for movies, click on the link below to hear an interview I did on POW!cast.Before Kickstarter, the only way to fund unique and creative ideas was for creatives to throw themselves on the mercy of their friends and family--or worse, to find a business mogul who usually ended up owning your project by proxy.

https://www.kickstarter.com/projects/omegapictures/day-7?ref=discovery_category_newest,omegapictures/day-7,"In an alternate world, a group of mercenaries with varied backstories and flaws attempt to aid an old friend in saving a mystical forest from destruction. But they quickly realize the true danger when they come up against a notorious brotherhood of assassins with a personal vendetta.Day 7 focuses on the relationships of the mercenaries, and the thrilling battle between them and the assassins. Through dialogue and production design, we'll give a glimpse into the history and lore of this unique world. Day 7 ends with only one survivor, and a hint at the new mission on which she'll embark. Day 7 is a live-action short film that will have an estimated run time of 27 minutes. We've come to Kickstarter to find partners in bringing this film to life. The budget is drafted, the plans are made, and we've assembled a great team; all that's missing is you!Omega Pictures is a Nashville-based production company made up of a bunch of creative types who've been working together for years. Our slogan is ""Opening Portals to New Worlds"", and with your support on Day 7, we'll do exactly that. This project is about so much more than just a killer short film. Read on! Our writer/director Hunter Perschbacher has been developing the world of Day 7 for the better part of a decade, and his enthusiasm for this world is contagious.  The whole Omega Pictures team has been chomping at the bit to get a story from this elaborate world onto the screen, and Day 7 is that opportunity.  Day 7 has all of the thrill, beauty, and grit of a high budget feature film, but it is achievable in short form at this budget level  Day 7 will also serve as proof of concept for this unique world, and has the potential to help us bring more films like it into existence. We've had interest in our body of materialbased on this world (which includes 3 feature screenplays and outlines for 3 more). Day 7 will showcase not only this unique world, but our command of the material and ability to execute films of this type.At its core the story of Day 7 is simple.  Seven mercenaries come to the aid of an ancient people who are threatened by a band of warrior assassins hired by a greedy corporation.  Old foes will face each other, old friends will be lost, and the repercussions of this seven-day standoff will ripple throughout the entire world. Part of what makes this story special is the backstory of each character, and what led them to this moment.Backstory: The Seven, as we affectionately call them, come from all walks of life and have each experienced different challenges and terrors. But they all share one thing in common:  an unwavering trust in NARINA DISTRAN.  As a child slave, Narina escaped the chains of bondage with RAMER, a fierce little girl who grew to be a deadly sniper, and VARNES, who owes Narina everything after she pulled him from the brink of self-destruction. The Seven are no strangers to battle. KLUUG, the most seasoned soldier and Narina's most trusted ally, embraces the mantle of “warrior-poet”.  Narina has a knack for sensing the good in people, and when she captures skilled young thieves RIAN BONE and YASUJI ANDO-WOODSON, she forfeits their substantial bounty and instead guides them in using their skills for positive ends. Narina and her long-time friend APOLLO are both fiercely loyal to MÜNDBORA, chieftain of the ancient YAELENBRUN tribe that inhabits the mystical FOREST OF AEGIS and taps the power of its YUWÄ BLOSSOMS. Mündbora took Apollo in when he fled his homeland; he also helped Narina through a difficult time in her life. Narina's loyalty leads her to rally behind Apollo in defense of the Yaelenbrun and their precious ELUM CRYSTALS. Seduced by the power of the crystals, LORE CORP hires a ruthless band of assassins called the SONS OF TALOS to hunt down and kill The Seven.LORe Corp’s ultimate aim is to strip the land of all valuable resources, and the caves and trees of the Forest of Aegis crumble before the corporation's near-indestructible drilling machine.Our story begins here, with The Seven in a battle for more than just their lives.Day 7 takes place in a world that is like our own in many ways, but also very different.  It's a mish-mash of time periods; with Victorian and Verne-esque elements combined with modern and even Pioneer-era elements. Day 7 will showcase the look, themes, and style of the world with a story that is personal, explosive, and entertaining. In this world, ancient brotherhoods take up sword and rifle against clattering hordes of battle-hungry machines. Cosmic ores allow humans to move through time, with irreparable results. Wars rage against a backdrop of thunderous timestorms. The remnants of a once-opulent civilization hint at better times. Villains reign, heroes fall. And those who wish to do good band together to protect those in need. A wealth of history and lore wait to be brought to life on the screen.Day 7 is the first of many stories we hope to bring you from this world.We have great rewards at different backer levels, and we can’t wait to share these goodies with you. The GIF and Backer Badge will go out to all backers during the campaign so you can show your support and help spread the word about Day 7. The digital script will go out to all backers soon after the campaign ends, as will the movie posters and concept art in the $50 and $100 reward packages.   You can see samples of some of our concept art in the sections above, and we will share more as we go. Rewards for the $250 and above packages will go out after the film is completed so that we can ship everything in one go.  We will share images of props, costumes, the custom slate, and the production book as they are created. It's no secret that filmmaking is a costly endeavor, especially when you have a large cast and crew, and a rich visual world to portray. We've drafted a detailed budget, and called in some favors to make it work. While we can successfully deliver this project at this budget, we have great plans for every dollar raised beyond. This includes:Equipment $2500: Camera, lighting, sound, and other miscellaneous production equipment. Cast $4500: Includes cast and trained stunt performers. Crew $5000: Includes the cost of post-production services--editing, sound design, score, etc.  Production Design $6000:  Props, costumes, set pieces, weaponry, and practical effects.  Food $2000: Meals, snacks, and plenty of coffee to help keep us going on long shoot days.  Administrative Costs $3000: Production insurance, Kickstarter fees, and the cost of creating and fulfilling backer rewards.We've already cast the major roles, assembled our crew, and begun pre-production. Once the Kickstarter campaign concludes, production design will begin in full force. We'll scout locations, build set pieces and props, and work with our costume designer to bring our characters to life. In order to accommodate our working cast and crew, we've split up the shooting over two holiday weekends this winter.  We've scheduled ample time for editing and sound to ensure we'll meet our May 2017 completion deadline. Final reward fulfillment will take place as soon as the film is complete, and we will simultaneously begin our festival push. We have a large and talented cast and crew, and will be sharing videos of them soon.

Costs include the following:We want to thank our backers in person by throwing a backer party here in Nashville. All backers will be invited to come and mingle with our awesome cast and crew. Help us hit $27,000 and we'll get this party started!For best quality video, use this link: Day 7 on VimeoDay 7 is a fantasy/sci-fi short film that will transport you to a world that’s like ours but with its own unique properties, history, and lore. Day 7 tells a simple story from one small corner of this world and is our first step in bringing stories from this world to the screen. The look, pacing, and themes of Day 7 are rooted in some of the films that have most affected us and lit our imaginations: Paths of Glory, Star Wars, The Dark Crystal, and Seven Samurai to name a few.We tried with words and concept art to show what’s in our heads, but it wasn’t enough. So we smashed our piggy banks and turned over all the couch cushions to scrape together the cash to shoot some test footage so we could finally SHOW you a glimpse of this strange and beautiful world!We ask two things of you:  1. Watch our video, which showcases the test footage for Day 7 and also the team behind this project. 2.	 If you like what you see, pick a reward and join us in this adventure, and invite everyone you know to come along!You’ve read this far and perhaps you want to know more.  Read on to learn about the world of Day 7 and the people who inhabit it!Day 7 takes place in a world that was once grand and beautiful, but has slowly crumbled due to the catastrophic repercussions of time travel-based wars. The contrast of beauty and grit, opulence and destruction set the tone for the type of stories that exist here. Because of the once-rampant use of time travel, tradition clashes with modernity. There’s a mish mash of Victorian elements with Verne-esqe touches alongside advanced weapons and technology. There's also a touch of mysticism in this world, and cosmic ores that have many properties from healing to time travel.  Seven mercenaries, brought together by a resilient and principled woman, rally behind a young, enigmatic leader to protect a mystical forest. The ancient forest is under siege by a ruthless corporation and its brutal steam-powered machines. The mercenaries quickly realize the true danger when they come up against a notorious brotherhood of assassins with a personal vendetta.Old foes will face each other, old friends will be lost, and the repercussions of this seven-day standoff will ripple throughout the entire world. Day 7 focuses on the relationships of the mercenaries and the thrilling battle between them and the assassins. Through dialogue and production design, we'll give a glimpse into the history and lore of this unique world.  Day 7 ends with only one survivor, and a hint at the new mission on which she'll embark. Backstory:  The Seven, as we affectionately call them, come from all walks of life and have each experienced a different set of challenges and terrors.  But they all share one thing in common: an unwavering trust in NARINA DISTRAN. As a child slave, Narina escaped the chains of bondage with RAMER, a fierce little girl who grew to be a deadly sniper, and VARNES, who owes Narina everything after she pulled him from the brink of self-destruction.The Seven are no strangers to battle. KLUUG, the most seasoned solider and Narina's most trusted ally, embraces the mantle of “warrior-poet”.  Narina has a knack for spotting the good in people, and when she captures skilled young thieves and best friends RIAN BONE and YASUJI ANDO- WOODSON, she forfeits their substantial bounty and instead guides them in using their skills for positive ends. Narina and her long-time friend APOLLO both feel a fierce loyalty to MÜNDBORA, chieftain of the ancient ​YAELENBRUN​ tribe that inhabits the mystical FOREST OF AEGIS. Mündbora took Apollo in when he fled his homeland; he also helped Narina through a difficult time in her life. Loyalty drives Narina to gather her motley band of warriors to rally behind Apollo in defense of the Yaelenbrun and their precious ELUM CRYSTALS. Seduced by the power of the crystals, LORE CORP hires a ruthless brotherhood of assassins called the SONS OF TALOS to hunt down and kill The Seven. The trees and caves begin to crumble before LORe Corp’s indestructible drilling machine. This film begins here, with The Seven in a battle for more than just their lives.  Apollo will finally face the consequences of running from his homeland, and Narina will experience a new level of loss as she watches the bonds she’s forged throughout her harsh life break one by one around her, with consequences she has yet to understand.The great thing about Kickstarter is that it's not something for nothing.

https://www.kickstarter.com/projects/rhinoandtheredbill/the-rhino-and-the-oxpecker-the-animated-pilot?ref=discovery_category_newest,rhinoandtheredbill/the-rhino-and-the-oxpecker-the-animated-pilot,"Hello everyone, and on behalf of the team, welcome to the official Kickstarter for “The Rhino and The Oxpecker”, an exciting new animated pilot that we need your help to make a reality.We are a team of artists and filmmakers with experience working on productions for Disney, Netflix, and Amazon, and with your help, we plan on bringing our next animated project to life! Having just finished development on our most recent production “Breathing Space”, we are looking to continue building on its success and producing more original animated content.The StoryIn the wild, Rhinos and Oxpeckers have a very unique symbiotic relationship. The oxpeckers spend their day nestled on top of the rhino for food and protection, and in return they help to alert the visually limited rhino if there is danger in the area.Inspired by this relationship, ""The Rhino and the Oxpecker"" is an action-adventure cartoon, featuring the story of Niles, a blind mercenary rhinoceros, and Redford, his neurotic-but-trusty guide bird. With Red acting as the eyes, ears, and brains of the duo, and Niles handling the action, the two work together to survive predators, poachers, and anything else the jungle can throw at them. That is, provided they can survive each other.The pilot episode follows Niles and Redford as they attempt to cross through a dangerous quarry. Together the two will have to outwit and outmatch a gang of poachers who don't take kindly to trespassers on their turf.The MoneyCompared to most animated pilots, The Rhino and the Oxpecker is a relatively inexpensive project. Thanks to the streamlined rendering and rigging processes developed whilst making Breathing Space, we are animating at fast rate without sacrificing quality. To get this project off the ground, we are starting with a goal of $17,000 (Canadian) to develop a 2 to 4 minute animated short, that would serve as a proof of concept for the project. Our first stretch goal of $24,000 (Canadian), will allow us to create the extended cut of the pilot, which would be an approximately 6-8 minute episode. The second stretch goal posted at $30,000 Canadian will allow us to hire some extra freelancing help, most likely help with audio/music composition or background painting, depending on how the production phase of the process goes.At the moment we have already done a sizeable chunk of pre-production work, which has allowed us to keep the project at a lower cost. So far The Rhino and the Oxpecker has completed many pieces of concept art and characters designs, and many characters and sets have been modelled and rigged. A story has been outlined and boards have been started. So far the project is going very smoothly, and with your help, we are very excited to take it to the next level.Financial backing of any amount will be greatly appreciated, and will go a long way towards making this pilot a reality. If you can’t provide any financial support, you can still help us out by sharing the project with your friends and on social media. If you’re interested in following our progress, we regularly post work on the director's social media:https://twitter.com/ArtOfAlexH Thanks for taking the time to check us out. We’re very excited to keep moving forward with this, and we hope we can count on your support. ","Animation isn't easy, I won't lie. There's a lot of work involved and a lot to coordinate.  Fortunately, this isn't my first time doing it. This will be the fourth animated short that I have developed, the most recent film “Breathing Space”, was made on a similar budget and time frame. And because this entire project is digital media and we already have access to the necessary tools and software, the only costs needed to be covered are for labor. With a team of people who have experience working on productions for Disney, Netflix, Amazon, and more, I am confident that we can not just repeat success, but take our work to the next level.",https://www.kickstarter.com/projects/rhinoandtheredbill/the-rhino-and-the-redbill-the-animated-pilot?ref=discovery_category_newest,rhinoandtheredbill/the-rhino-and-the-redbill-the-animated-pilot,"Hello everyone, and on behalf of the team, welcome to the official Kickstarter for The Rhino and the Redbill, an action-adventure animated pilot that we need your help to make a reality!My name is Alex Henderson, and for years now I have been developing animated content for film, television, video games, and more. Now with your help, I'm looking to branch out into creating more original content. My team and I specialise in blending 2D and 3D animation to create unique art styles that are both efficient and appealing, and we're ready to take these styles into this next big project. The Rhino and the Redbill is a story we've been developing for several years now and have been looking to bring to life through animation. We're seeking funding to create an 11 minute animated action-adventure pilot episode that we can take to festival screenings and industry events, and eventually release publicly for everyone to enjoy. This would ultimately serve as a proof of concept for producing more content.The short is meant to appeal to all ages, dealing with mature themes that adults can appreciate while still being accessible to younger audiences. The tone is meant to fall in the same vein as shows like Samurai Jack and Avatar: The Last Airbender.In the wild, Rhinos and Red-Billed Oxpeckers have a very unique symbiotic relationship. The oxpeckers spend their day nestled on top of the rhino for food and protection, and in return they help to alert the often visually-impaired rhinos if there is danger in the area.They can however, be a nuisance to their hosts, often picking at wounds when searching for food, and their bond can quickly turn parasitic.Based on their relationship in the wild, The Rhino and the Redbill is an action-adventure short about a blind rhinoceros named Niles, and a flight-impaired oxpecker named Redford, working together to survive the harsh realities of a drought ravaged wilderness. Scorchwater Valley is dying and it's taking everyone else down with it. It's every creature for themselves as social structures have collapsed and factions of carnivorous gangs, evil cults, and deadly poachers struggle to survive. Niles and Redford have to work together to survive in a dying world, provided they can survive each other.Niles is a gruff and surly mercenary. He talks a big talk, walks a big walk, and can take down pretty much anyone who challenges him on it. Even though he is legally blind, he doesn't let that stop him from being a force to be reckoned with. The work is still dangerous though, and finding a safe place to call home in the valley is no small task, so Niles reluctantly accepts help from Redford, his trusty guide bird to help him through the treacherous badlands.Redford is an upbeat bird who acts as a lookout and navigator for his larger-than-life friend. Red owes a lot of his friendly attitude to how oblivious he is of the dangers around. While he tries to be approachable, he's a bit naive to how irritating he can be, especially to a grouch like Niles. While they clash a lot, Niles and Red remain reluctant friends, and they're stronger together than they are apart.The Rhino and the Redbill is a project that makes use of 2D and 3D animation techniques, to craft a visual style consistent with TV animation standards that is also cost effective to produce. The process involves using 3D models, hand drawn render passes, matte paintings, and more, to create a visual style meant to emulate works such as Samurai Jack and Spiderman: Into the Spiderverse.In the trailer you can see plenty of examples of finished animation to give you an idea of the graphic style that we are striving for.Compared to most animated pilots, The Rhino and the Redbill is a relatively inexpensive project. Thanks to the streamlined rendering and rigging processes developed whilst making Breathing Space, we are animating at a fast rate without sacrificing quality.To get this project off the ground, we are starting with a goal of $24,000 CA to develop the 11 minute animated pilot.This money will mostly go towards funding the animation, as that makes up the bulk of what needs to be done. We've already done several scenes to get a sense of how much time it will take to complete the project, and this number will cover the cost of labour for our estimated time frame.We are also offering plenty of stretch goals to help expand the project should we hit our funding goal! Hitting these milestones will allow us to expand our festival run, and add new content such as bonus scenes and opening theme sequences!At the moment we have already done a sizeable chunk of production work, which has allowed us to keep the remainder of the project at a lower cost. So far The Rhino and the Redbill has finished pre-production, with a full story reel completed, and plenty of shots already put into production. The work has been going very smoothly, and with your help, we are excited to take it to the next level.In addition to completing the film, we are also offering some fun rewards to our backers. There are digitalbundles that include getting your name in the credits, the downloadable soundtrack, and the digital art book.If you're looking for physical rewards, we are also offering various acrylic charms and a poster, which all feature artwork of the film's characters.At some of our higher backer reward levels, we are offering the opportunity to be involved in the project in more unique ways. This can include getting a producer credit, which gives you plenty of industry cred for sponsoring an independent project, and also gets your name or the name of your company in the opening credits.You can also pledge to have a character of your own design make an appearance in the pilot! (See FAQ for more details).We've had plenty of great and talented people helping to develop this project to what it is today, many of whom have work that can be seen in the trailer. A big thanks to our two leads Foster ""Adler"" Eber and Richie Ammons, playing Red and Niles respectively. Both have years of experience with voice acting and have delivered great performances. This project wouldn't have been possible without them. Follow the links to their websites to see more samples of their great work.Also in our talented cast is Rob Schwarb, who has been contributing additional voices to the project. He's got a wide arsenal of unique voices that have gone a long way to bringing our animations to life. Follow the link to check out more of his work.We would also like to thank Joshua David Mitchell for the music he has been providing for the project. We've had some great people helping out with this project, with plenty more we'll be adding along the way.If you want to follow along with the project, be sure to check out the director's Twitter, where we regularly post updates and in progress work from the project.Thanks for taking the time to check us out.

https://www.kickstarter.com/projects/americanheritage/american-heritage-revitalize-the-leading-magazine?ref=discovery_category_newest,americanheritage/american-heritage-revitalize-the-leading-magazine,"American Heritage was the leading journal of U.S. history for more than 65 years. In 2013 it was forced to stop print publication after going for half a century without an increase in subscription prices.Since then, a small group of volunteers has kept the magazine alive. They often paid for web hosting out of their own pockets, and commissioned articles for possible new issues by authors such as John Eisenhower, Tom Fleming, Harold Holzer, and James McPherson. They built a major educational system, Fourscore, and created ebook versions of 112 previously published books as well as new anthologies. But to relaunch the magazine, at least digitally, American Heritage needs to 1) update its website, which runs on outdated and unsecure software, 2) build systems to create new issues and new types of web content, and 3) construct a system to track subscribers. That will enable the magazine to sustain itself into the future and allow us to provide future generations with the lessons (and entertaining stories) from our past. Since 1949, the mission of American Heritage has been to make top-tier scholarship accessible to a wide range of audiences, proving that history can be lively, interesting, even spell-binding.  It has won numerous awards including the National Magazine Award.American Heritage has always been apolitical and non-partisan, but tells the story of our nation and the diverse people who built it with respect and affection. Hardbound editions of American Heritage were an iconic presence in homes across the country.  “My family subscribed to this marvelous publication when I was a girl,” writes former First Lady Laura Bush.  “I vividly remember the special shelf of white hardback volumes and how we eagerly awaited each new issue.”  Founded by Pulitzer Prize-winning historian Bruce Catton, American Heritage has published hundreds of the nation’s most respected writers including Stephen Ambrose, Ed Ayres, Douglas Brinkley, Malcolm Cowley, John Dos Passos, Joseph Ellis, Eric Foner, Henry Louis Gates, Jr., John F. Kennedy, Pauline Maier, David McCullough, Samuel Eliot Morrison, Arthur Schlesinger, Jr., and Barbara Tuchman. “I am delighted to recommend AMERICANHERITAGE to anyone looking for an enjoyablereading and learning experience”  —George H.W. Bush, formerPresident of the United States“A great national resource” —David McCullough, Author, Historian“Illuminates and interprets the past so one can betterunderstand the present, with grace, wisdom andstyle.” —Barbara Walters, TV Commentator“A nation’s history is its memory, its identity, theembodiment of its values and its sense of self-worth.A society that knows its heritage has the faith to faceits future. I know of no other publication in the worldthat captures the vitality of a nation’s history aswell as AMERICAN HERITAGE does. It is anextraordinary magazine.” —Henry A. Kissinger“AMERICAN HERITAGE is everything a magazineof popular history should be – elegant, lively,informative, entertaining, and intelligent.” —Arthur Schlesinger, Jr., Historian Like many other print publications, American Heritage faced increased competition from other media including the Internet, declining ad revenues, and rising costs.In 1960, subscribers paid $15 a year for American Heritage at a time when a nice car cost $2,000, movies were 25 cents, and Cokes set you back a nickel at the soda fountain. In 2013, more than half a century later, American Heritage was still only able to charge $15 a year. That barely covered printing, paper, and postage expenses. The cost of maintaining the subscriber list alone (invoicing, renewals, labels, address changes) was $350,000 a year.After taking over the magazine in 2007, we cut costs as best as we could and the magazine broke even in 2009. But few investors stepped up to help cover losses during the recession and to pay for promotion and other critical expenses. After print publication stopped in 2013, revenue dropped off to almost nothing.How can American Heritage keep this extraordinary archive accessible, continue to publish writing by younger historians, and add new types of content to encourage the next generation of Americans to learn about history?It can be done, but not without resources. To survive, the magazine must:1) Modernize its complex, 30,000-page website, which was mostly built eight years ago. Its software is now unsecure and no longer updated by developers.2) Hire writers, editors, and designers to help create new issues of the magazine, at least for digital editions,3) Build systems to publish future issues, and add new content and website features to attract new readers, and4) Build systems to enroll and track subscribers, and hopefully restart the print edition if subscriber lists grow.This will enable us to continue to produce the kind of respected, accessible historical writing thatAmerican Heritage is famous for.

For more than 65 years, American Heritage has been that source as the leading journal of U.S. history. Millions of readers, including many students and teachers, have benefited from its accessible, interesting stories crafted by respected historians.But these are challenging times for magazines. In recent years, with increased competition from the Internet, American Heritage was only able to charge for subscriptions the same price that it had in 1961 -- half a century earlier. The magazinewas forced to stop print publication in 2012.Since then, a small group of volunteers has kept the magazine and its archives alive. They often paid for web hosting out of their own pockets, and commissioned articles for new issues by authors such as James McPherson, John Eisenhower, Tom Fleming, and Harold Holzer. They built a major educational system, Fourscore, and created ebook versions of 130 previously published books as well as new anthologies.But to relaunch the magazine, at least digitally, American Heritage needs to 1) update its website, which is now running on outdated and unsecure software, 2) build systems to create new issues and new types of web content, and 3) construct a system to track subscribers.That will enable the magazine to sustain itself into the future and allow it to provide future generations with the lessons (and entertaining stories) from our past.Since 1949, the mission of American Heritage has been to make top-tier scholarship accessible to a wide range of audiences, proving that history can be lively, interesting, even spell-binding.

Why can't you have a place with great coffee and breakfast! Well, that's exactly what we are going to do in Daphne and with your help, we can make it happen.For seven years, Serda's Coffee Co. in downtown Mobile has been providing the downtown community with our fresh roasted coffee, all fruit smoothies, 24 flavors of gelato Italian ice cream, sandwiches, wraps, soups, salads and more. Now we want to bring everything Mobile has come to love about us to Daphne, but with an awesome farm to table breakfast and lunch menu. Serda's in Daphne will be using as many ingredients as we can find from local farmers including fresh farm raised eggs, produce, fruits, meats, cheeses, honey and butter. Our new breakfast and lunch menu at Serda's in Daphne will be one of the freshest and healthiest breakfasts and lunch you have ever tasted. We have partnered with local farms and are currently working on our new breakfast and lunch menu. We will post it as soon as it is ready.","Serda's Coffee in Daphne hopes to be open by June 2016. The location we are opening is a brand new strip center that is currently under construction which is next door to the Popeyes on Hwy 98 across the street from Target in Daphne. As with most new construction projects, there may be some delays in opening on the scheduled date. The contractor of the project is Rogers and Willard who is a well known and very reputable contractor with a great deal of experience. If any problems arise, Rogers and Willard will definitely be able to handle it, but it may set our opening date back a little. Once construction is complete, we will install all of our equipment and fixtures. One of the risks with equipment is not getting it delivered on time. We have spoken to our equipment supplier and do not anticipate any delivery delays, however, it is still nonetheless a risk which would just be a minor setback until it is delivered.",https://www.kickstarter.com/projects/934446393/serda-brewing-mobile-alabama-craft-brewery?ref=discovery_category_newest,934446393/serda-brewing-mobile-alabama-craft-brewery,"There’s something special happening in Mobile. People are building things again. Good things. Using local resources and an inventive spirit, there’s more innovation in technology and entrepreneurship happening in Mobile than ever before. And the results are impressive. At Serda Brewing, we believe in this renaissance. Whether it's building airplanes, littoral combat ships, stainless steel, fiber optics, bike lanes, entrepreneurial incubators, restaurants, or even a brewery, there’s a sense of pride that comes from building something great. We want to share Serda Brewing with you, and we want you to play a role in helping us build it. By becoming a Serda Founder, you’re embarking on this journey with us, and together we are going to build something truly special. Over the past 48 months, we’ve been working feverishly to raise capital to get the brewery off the ground. We’ve ordered a beautiful, fully-custom, 3 vessel, 30 barrel brew house. But we want to do more than start a brewery. Nestled in the heart of Downtown Mobile, we want to build a first class taproom experience, a space to make your own while enjoying the artistry and craftsmanship that defines Serda beer.Mobile was ""Born to Celebrate"" and we have a big vision to create the taproom that continues our tradition of celebration. A place to celebrate Mardi Gras, closing that deal, pulling off that huge event, making it through Monday, he or she saying yes, it's a boy or girl, that friend is back in town, that promotion and even funding your own project. We want to be a part of your celebration!CLICK HERE TO SEE ALL OF THE REWARDS IMAGES Serda Brewing is a craft beer microbrewery being constructed in downtown Mobile, Alabama to serve the Greater Mobile and regional Gulf Coast markets. Located at 600 Government Blvd., the over  12,000 square foot facility will incorporate production and packaging facilities as well as a pub-style hospitality venue for tours and retail bar sales of the brewery's products. The beers offered will reflect traditional German beer styles as evolved by modern American craft brewer boldness and innovation.The core brand beers will be traditional German styles that have had an American craft beer face lift: richer in flavor, bolder in strength, more complex in character, a reflection of the past with modern craft brewing innovation.  There is a notable void in the industry craft beer menu as most new breweries have focused on West Coast style micro-brews and a smattering of English style ales.  Serda Brewing will bring about more choices of what consumers are looking for in a market crowded with a limited style selection. Our flagship beer will be our Hook, Line & Lager - light straw to golden color and crystal clear. Hops are very prevalent with a spicy bitterness and a spicy floral flavor and aroma. Smooth and crisp with a clean malty palate. Lagers are more difficult to make and take longer, but they're worth the extra effort. Hook Line & Lager - Pilsner  Our flagship Pilsner, brilliant and zesty with ample hop bite. Malted rye and noble hops deliver a spicy refreshing zing. A perfect beer for any occasion, especially thirsty occasions.Profile notes: Pale golden with thinning white head, black pepper sharp hop aroma with faint toasted grain and sulfur yeast lingering in the back, crisp slight malt sweetness behind noble hop forward balance, bitter hop is perceived as dryness that does not linger in the aftertaste. Very fresh German noble hops and yeast at the forefront, malt sweetness is present but subdued. Rye malt adds a layer of complexity and a slight oily/creamy texture that helps lighten the hop bite.Clear Prop - Porter Our flagship dark beer brewed in the Baltic Porter style. A heavier but balanced offering to please stout and porter drinkers with a variation of style seldom introduced into American beer markets. Layers of subtle roast and caramel honey-prune flavors weighed out with a mellow bitter smoky and herbal hops.Profile Notes: Dark unfiltered opaque brown with a off-white frothy head. Heavy leaning with layers of malt complexity. Some smoked perception lingers in the background from the hops even though this is not a smoked beer. As forward the malt flavors are, the beer does not finish as thick as you would think, the higher alcohol thins the body out to a more moderate mouth feel. You can drink several of these, but you will feel the effects. Mobile Bay - IPA Brewed with several new German hop varieties and traditional alt-bier yeast using American craft brewing techniques to drop a hop bomb of unique citrus aromas balanced with the smooth malt base of German barley.Profile Notes: Upon first look, the beer pours slightly clouded from unfiltered hop oils and has a tight frothy sticky head. IPA nose is very upfront and packs a fresh citrus/mandarin orange/apple-pear punch. Moderate body from a strong pale ale fermented drier than most American versions. Won't leave you with heavy thick finish, but a lingering sweet hop burn. Tidewater - Vienna A smooth malty amber mainstay with clean moderate hop bitterness in balance with toasty sweetness. Floral and spicy in both malt and hop aroma, but easy drinking and satisfyingly complex. Profile Notes: Pouring a reddish amber with a tight creamy white head, the sparkling carbonation releases refreshing floral and spicy aromas from both the toasted malts and noble hops. Once settled in in the mug, the carbonation subsides to a smooth and slightly sweet quaff with a hint of caramel and a kiss of herbal hops. Moderate body with short lingering flavor makes this brew a perfect companion to any type of meal.Like all good teams, each member brings something unique and positive to the group.

Twenty plus years of professional craft brewing experience in brewpubs and microbreweriesDirector of Brewing Operations, Serda Brewing CompanyTwenty plus years of professional craft brewing experience in brewpubs and microbreweriesOriginally from the greater New Orleans area, Todd moved from Destrehan, LA to Mobile in 1982, starting 6th grade at St. Dominic Catholic School. He then went to McGill-Toolen Catholic High School, graduating in 1988. After high school, Todd attended the University of South Alabama from 1988-1992.Todd first became interested in the fickle art of fermentation during his teenage years. Ironically, his initial inspiration was his family’s winemaking hobby. After Todd won a Best Specialty Wine award for a potion made from Prickly Pear Cactus fruit, his Mom shut out her main competition by buying her son a “True Brew” beer rig for his 18th birthday.  Already having a taste for great imported beers, Todd knew, with practice, that he could brew beer himself.  By the time he got to the University of South Alabama, he was experimenting with every type of unique brew he could concoct.Todd Hicks is a familiar face in the craft beer community's cast of professional brewers and beer advocates. He joined Mobile's Port City Brewery, located on Dauphin St., in 1993 and was instrumental in the opening of Alabama's first brewpub since Prohibition. Todd started as an Assistant Brewer in training under Brewmaster Bradley Fournier and was quickly promoted to Head Brewer. He also brewed occasionally at the company's other location, Magic City Brewery, in Birmingham, AL.  Over the years of beers to follow, his devotion to brew the best and most unique craft beers possible has never strayed. This determination (and subsequent reputation) has led to numerous head brewer and consulting positions for Todd all over the southeastern US.  Todd’s specialization within the trade is troubleshooting and upgrading equipment, reviewing procedures to increase efficiency, and hands-on training of brewery staff.  Not to mention, he is adept at producing a variety of great tasting, unique beer styles!While still working occasionally for Mobile’s Port City Brewery, Todd moved to the Florida Panhandle and began brewing along the Emerald Coast. He started brewing with Steve Fried at McGuire's Irish Pub in Pensacola and then was key in the 1996 startup of McGuire's of Destin.  In 1997, Todd left McGuire's to brew at the Santa Rosa Bay Brewery in Fort Walton Beach, and later that year also took over brewing for Sharktooth Brewery, which later became Nigel Manley's Microbrewery across the island in Destin.After Mobile’s Port City Brewery closed in 2001, Todd began consulting, training new brewers at Hal & Mal’s Brewery in Jackson, MS, and providing brewing services to The Cannon Brewpub in Columbus, GA. He knew, however, that with the closure of Port City, a prime location and a lot of brewing equipment became available back in Mobile.Starting in early 2002, Todd developed a plan to purchase and reopen the former Port City Brewery under a new banner, Mr. Jim's Cannon Brewpub. The name was in memory of the deceased co-founder of The Cannon Brewpub in Columbus.  2003 was a year of extensive renovation with Todd as Project Manager. “Mobile’s” Cannon Brewpub opened in early 2004 with Todd as Brewery Manager. On the refurbished 15-barrel brewing system, he brewed a few of the original Cannon brands with revised recipes and a few revamped brands from Mobile's beer past.Unfortunately, the absentee owners from Columbus had legal issues back in Georgia and in early 2006 had to eventually sell their entire operation. Mobile’s location was not exempt, and Mr. Jim’s Cannon Brewpub closed as a result.In mid-2006, Hurricane Brewing purchased the equipment, leased the property, and began plans to open at the same location on Dauphin Street. Todd was hired as Head Brewer and was responsible for developing fresh recipes for the new operators. Hurricane Brewing opened in late 2006 after six months of renovations. Todd’s brewing goal was to keep the focus on the beer itself and increase the number of beer styles available by adding new keg space and upgrading the draft beer system.  He created a variety of contemporary English/Irish beer styles that have been widely reproduced in the wake of the craft brewingrevolution. Sadly, Hurricane Brewing also only lasted about two years due to a myriad of internal issues. The building owners decided to turn upper stories into offices and lease out the bar area to a Mexican-themed restaurant, which is where Montego’s is located today.Back in 2003, Todd joined the grass roots movement of “Free the Hops” as a founding member. He volunteered to organize the Mobile Free the Hops Chapter and lead the local beer community in support of shattering the embargo against craft beer in Alabama.  This work continues today with his involvement in the Alabama Brewers Guild, where he was also a founding member and briefly a Board of Directors member.By word of mouth, and through introduction at the WYES International Beer Festival in New Orleans, Todd was approached by two business partners about consulting on a brewery business plan in 2010. After about a year of planning, a site was selected in Baton Rouge, and construction began with a tight budget, a used 30-barrel brewing system, and a few new fermenters. Todd spent a couple of years consulting in various stages of recipe development, construction, training of brewers, and equipment expansions. Their business and facility is growing every year and shows no signs of slowing down. This brewery is known as Tin Roof and continues to be very successful to this day.Currently, Todd and four investment partners (who are also all McGill-Toolen graduates!) are opening Serda Brewing Company, a 30-barrel brewhouse and packaging microbrewery with a tap room style pub in Mobile, Alabama. The downtown location, at 600 Government Street, is directly adjacent to Lower Dauphin Street and connects directly with the LoDa Entertainment District and the many popular restaurant and bar venues nearby. It is also directly on the Mardi Gras parade route! Serda Brewing will have ample outdoor patio seating (shaded by large sail cloths) and an outdoor food truck court. The tap room will feature one of Mobile’s largest bars, nearly 40 feet in length and crescent shaped that will span the width of the tap room. On site, secure parking will be plentiful. Serda will both keg and bottle its year-round beers for distribution. Seasonal and specialty test beers will be available only in the taproom in the near future.A July 2017 opening is being targeted.","With all new business ventures some degree of risk does exist and as responsible business owners, we feel obligated to explain them. We’re offering many different rewards and a very unique and ambitious membership program. It is possible that this would prove to be overwhelming for our new venture if the campaign were to greatly exceed expectations. It’s highly unlikely that this event could cause us to fail on our promise to deliver the rewards, but it could delay the delivery.Many of our rewards rely on vendors for fulfillment: a problem with any one of them could lead to delays or a change of plans. We would seek new vendors as soon as a problem arose, but there are no guarantees we could produce identical rewards in some cases.Probably the greatest risk for backers comes from the nature of start-up businesses: Serda Brewing is young, has no revenue, and still faces many challenges to opening. These circumstances often create cash flow problems for young companies. While we've planned our campaign finances and rewards very carefully, no start-up is immune to cash flow issues. Such circumstances could threaten our ability to deliver rewards, although we would do absolutely everything in our power to avoid such a situation."

It’s a community on the brink of change, full of hopes, dreams and pressures, where the biggest struggles can be deciding which traditions you take with you, and which ones you leave behind."" (from R&H Theatricals).Our ensemble is committed to creating and presenting performances that are inclusive of all kinds of backgrounds in an effort to build more accepting, empathetic, and diverse communities. In the Heights as a story is a miracle of the modern musical theatre in how it broke through conventions and gave voice to the dreams and struggles of an often marginalized and underrepresented community, and did so in a what in which anyone could empathize - brining a greater understanding of the Latino and immigrant experience though the exploration of their strong ties of community.As a story about an embracing community, our group is not exclusively Latino but rather inclusive of people of all backgrounds. We are exploring what being Latino and what being part of a community means by challenging our preconceptions of these... What if Daniela from the salon happened to be a man, or if Abuela's family migirated to Cuba originally from Ireland,or if the Piragüero were a huge opera singer before leaving his country,or if Usnavi was actually from the Caribbean but also happened to be white skinned... What else is there to unearth and further understand from this music and these words which we haven't already seen on the stage... We might see on stage perhaps not an exact replica of what society looks like, but rather a promising image of what an inclusive community does look like.This because we believe that theatre should be cheap and accessible to everyone! That also means that the only way of securing admission is through a kick-starter donation. Your support will help us be able to pay off the rights (which we've acquired - respect to intellectual property!), the performance venue, costumes and props, and with certain musical support and equipment.Help us make make the most our of our rendition of In the Heights!","Student productions always face a constant barrage of obstacles as it is developing. Resources, both human and material, are always limited - but it is also within limitations that we are at our most creative.We've had to get very creative in finding rehearsal spaces, securing funding, as well as forming the right kind of team. At the end of the day, we can't  afford a fifteen piece orchestra, nor a large set of microphones, large set pieces, or any other characteristic feature of the large and lavish Broadway productions...However, it is within the the heat and pressure of these limitations in which are are at our most creative.  pressured set of limitations that creativity is sparked. It is our commitment and passion for this music and story what is most essential to making a good's performance of it. We derive richness from collaboration, and a striking simplicity that originates from a sincere curiosity and desire to share. We are proud to consider ourselves underdogs, producing theatre through the most bare and immediate means - always searching and experimenting possibilities. Much like street musicians, our ensemble derives our power to create from a preparation to work anywhere and at any moment! It is a process as thrilling as it is gratifying.",https://www.kickstarter.com/projects/floreskomatsu/tour-gira-de-andares-makuyeika-colectivo-teatral?ref=discovery_category_newest,floreskomatsu/tour-gira-de-andares-makuyeika-colectivo-teatral,"Somos un grupo de teatro conformado primeramente por actores de comunidades indígenas. Ahora estamos lanzando una gira de nuestra última obra, ANDARES, a los estados y comunidades Mayas de Campeche y Yucatán.(We are a theatre group composed primarily of indigenous actores, and we are launching a tour of our play ANDARES to Mayan communities in the states of Campeche and Yucatán). Con este apoyo cubriremos las costos de las siguientes tres areas:¡Conoce nuestra historia!ANDARES es una creación escénica sobre las vivencias de tres jóvenes indígenas desarrollada a partir de anécdotas personales, cosmogonías ancestrales y diversas artes y músicas populares. Conmovedora al igual que desafiante en su temática — usurpación de tierras, resistencia comunitaria, perdida de identidad — la obra es una reflexión honesta y potente sobre aquello que encara el indígena ante el crucero de la vida moderna y la tradicional. Una propuesta artística y humana, la obra es un intimo acercamiento a los rincones más recónditos del país y a lashistorias extraordinarias de sus más humildes habitantes."" Tres jóvenes indígenas encararán el cruce entre la vida moderna y la tradicional: Maychi, un joven maya que cuestiona el pasado glorioso de su pueblo ante el precario presente. Xhunco, una muxe que desafía su rol dentro de la cultura Zapoteca. Lupe, un joven Wixarika atormentado por no lograr cazar un venado como lo han hecho sus ancestros. Y un músico de son jarocho, quien canta ante olas de violencia que han azotado su hogar en la región del sotavento. Juntos retratan un mosaico viviente del México actual a través de sus vivencias y andares.""La obra fue creada para adaptarse tanto a foros de teatro como a espacios alternativos y localidades rurales, habiéndose presentado hasta la fecha en diversas comunidades y ciudades en México y proximamente en el extranjero.Makuyeika: Colectivo Teatral se dedica a la creación escénica en torno a las narrativas y teatralidades de los pueblos originarios del México, abordando con gran sensibilidad artística temáticas de alto valor social y cultural Makuyeika significa “caminante” en el idioma Wixarika, llamándose así al formarse tras una extensa búsqueda de talento a través de diversas comunidades de México por parte de The Julie Taymor World Theatre Fellowship, de la célebre directora estadounidense Julie Taymor.¡Níib óolal tech! ¡Kolavalik! ¡Diuxi! ¡Gracias!","Esta gira se había planeado con un recurso de una institución importante de Campeche, y un mes previo a iniciar la gira se nos retiro dicho apoyo. Esto nos dejo en una situación precaria, ya que habíamos invertido de nuestros ahorros personales en transportación de ida, al igual que comprometernos con varias sedes y comunidades.  Hasta ahora, sabemos que llegaremos pero no tenemos como regresar. Es innegable que en la actualidad mexicana existe, tanto en la sociedad en general como en las artes escénicas, una falta de inclusión a las narrativas e identidades de procedencia indígena. Para un país de fuertes raíces y manifestaciones culturales indígenas, hace falta incluir a estas, a sus públicos y a sus creadores en discurso teatral nacional y así ampliar y fortalecer el valor de las artes en el país.Por eso es que nuestro grupo se empeña en presentar historias indígenas contadas por miembros de estas mismas comunidades, apoyando no solo las narrativas de la gente sino también a nuevo talento de estas procedencias. Es trágico que de tanto talento actoral latente en los pueblos indígenas, podamos contar con una sola mano el número de actores realizados procedentes de estos. De igual forma, los recursos destinados al desarrollo artístico y cultural de los pueblos originarios, especialmente en relación a la expresión verbal y oral (como lo es el teatro), son muy limitados. Con tan solo decir que nuestro trabajo se origina en las comunidades indígenas, muchos grupos e instituciones descartan el trabajo junto con una serie de prejuicios y estereotipos que los pueblos enfrentan. De igual forma, es poco decir que toma una gran labor sostener este grupo, pues el simple hecho de viajar reuniros implica un gran esfuerzo y sacrifico por parte de todos."

To clear his head after becoming ""All cuted out"" he drew his first ever Bad Taste Bear, ""Hey kiddies! Here's the chainsaw bear!"" He enjoyed drawing it so much that he started putting a list together and drawing and painting bears in ""interesting"" situations as a release for his twisted imagination.How old are Bad Taste Bear collectibles?Bad Taste Bears have recently celebrated their 15th Birthday. Back in 1999, the sketches were discovered by Piranha Studios, a leading character giftware company who turned them into collectable figurines. They began with just six figurines on sale in the Gadget Shop - at this stage the bears were being hand-cast and painted by home workers in Newcastle upon Tyne. Within the first year the range increased to twelve and were on sale in gift shops across the country. Due to increasing demand in the following months, production was moved to a factory and a collectors club was launched to provide a point of contact for the growing hoards of Bad Taste Bear fanatics!Did you know?

This fully functional, talk & text mobile phone is unbelievably tiny!We’re proud to introduce the world’s smallest mobile phone. It's so tiny, you won’t believe it’s real! It’s the perfect gift for any gadget lover and fits in any bag or pocket no matter how small.The Zanco tiny t1 mobile phone is smaller than your thumb, lighter than a coin and is ridiculously cute.The first time you see it you can’t believe it exists. Your second thought is why does it exist? When you look a third time you realize how much you want it.So here are just a few reasons why you need the Zanco tiny t1:The Zanco tiny t1 will work with any mobile phone network. You can change the nano-SIM at any time if you want to change your network too.The tiny phone operates on the 2G network. The battery has 3 days standby and 180 minutes talk time.Points to Consider Before PledgingPLEASE NOTE: Due to its tiny size, the Zanco tiny t1 will ONLY operate on the 2G network.This is because of the components used to achieve the Zanco tiny t1‘s diminutive size. The situation with 2G networks varies greatly from country to country. For example, sources in the United Kingdom suggest 2G will be around for longer than the 3G network because it offers a higher level of service in certain use cases. Vodafone, one of the leading network operators, say that they will continue their 2G service in the UK and Europe until at least 2025 - see article By way of contrast, Australia and Japan have already stopped using 2G for any type of mobile connection. Our advice is to check the availability of a 2G network in your country and with the operator of your SIM card prior to backing this project.This article from TeleGeography provides an overview of the current situation - see articlePlease check your local area has 2G coverage before pledging as some countries no longer support the 2G network.The phone will be available in 2 band frequencies - 850/1900 and 900/1800 (You will be able to select your chosen frequency band according to your country in a post-campaign survey)Sim Card  - The Zanco tiny t1 uses a Nano sim card.Please check that your sim card supports the 2G network.The Zanco tiny t1 is a talk and text mobile phone - It does not have internet capability.The Zanco tiny t1 is provided as a handset only and is not shipped with a sim card. Sim cards are to be purchased separately.The Zanco tiny t1 will have CE RoHS approval and will be manufactured to the highest standards with quality components.Zini Mobiles Ltd is the proud owner, developer, and manufacturer of the Zanco brand.Zini Mobiles Ltd is also the Patentowner for the Zanco tiny t1 phone.Zini Mobiles Ltd has invested heavily in research and development to produce the amazing Zanco tiny t1 phone and will take immediate action against counterfeiting.This Kickstarter campaign is the result of a two-year journey. Back this campaign and you could have the Zanco tiny t1 mobile phone in your hands in just 14 weeks after the close of the campaign!The challenge was set and the prototype made, but the big question is 'Does anybody really want a mobile phone so small?'This Kickstarter campaign is quite simply to ascertain if the world’s smallest phone is too big an idea, too revolutionary for the world to cope with.A fully functional mobile phone, with text and voice call capabilities, smaller than anyone's ever created. But in the immortal words of Jeff Goldblum in Jurassic Park “We spent so long figuring out if we could, We never stopped to question if we should”.So now we are giving you the opportunity to answer that question by backing this campaign.What started as a bit of a joke, is now just about to become a reality. A few years ago we were shown the Zanco Fly prototype and were blown away by its sheer size.Around 18 months ago we were sitting with Shazad Talib, the founder and owner of Zanco, discussing business opportunities. Jokingly we said 'can you make a smaller phone than the Fly?' and he replied 'we could probably make one half the size.' The challenge was set and here we are today!This Kickstarter campaign is a collaboration project between two companies whose founders love their gadgets - Zanco and ClubitFounded in 2007 Zanco have a proven track record of consistently and reliably producing the world’s smallest working mobile phones.Zanco are the creators, inventors, brand owners and IP owners of the Zanco tiny t1 mobile phone.The parent company of the Zanco brand is called Zini Mobiles Ltd. Zanco's Research & Development hub and manufacturing base are in Shenzhen, China. The Zanco brand is highly recognisedacross central and southern Asia, Africa as well as the UK, Europe, and South America.Zini Mobiles are not only the developers of the world's smallest phone but also have a range of over 120 different models including: Big button phones for the elderly, fully feature phones, rugged phones, smartphones, tablets and novelty phones (some examples shown below)Established in 1999 Clubit have been involved in the retail and wholesale distribution of video games, collectables, novelty gifts and gadgets.

Should we miss projections, we’ll let you know why and make it right as quickly as possible.

Want to hear how we got the nameDos Polacas? Click HERE.(Hint: It was when we were working on our first project in Mexico in 1997.)Now, after ten years of working together on a book project,“In the Hands of Our Elders”we have decided to take the next giant step. Part of the project will be a weblink with stories you can hear told by the elders in English and in Kwak'wala, their language.Please help us raise the money to finish this labor of love and integrity.To paraphrase the words of an Australian aboriginal woman:We have not come to this decision as an effort “to help tribal people.” That would be wasting the time of the elders and our supporters.We have come to this decision because our liberation is bound up with resiliency of the elders, the energy of the indigenous youth and the integrity of native communities.We have decided to create this book becauseassimilation has swallowed up untold numbers of indigenous cultures around the planet.The kaleidoscope of world cultures has not yet turned monochromatic but the threat is on the horizon.What supports the strength and continuity of native civilizations?Who insures a culture's stability? When a language dies, what remains of that way of life?Every indigenous person we have spoken with has the same answer: their elders.This book celebrates the resilient spirit of tribal elders by using their own stories and and their portraits. The book will be in their words, not ours. The photographs are of their choosing. Please go HERE to read how Sharon takes a portrait.The elders are the heart and soul of our project.The book’s full title isIn the Hands of Our Elders: A Project of Memory and Future with the Kwakwaka’wakw People of British Columbia.With your invaluable and generous help and support plus our efforts, this book and weblink will celebrate the elders, inspire non-natives and provide the youth with a lasting legacy.Dos Polacas’ real treasure lies in our unparalleled access to the indigenous communities of the Pacific Northwest developed over the last twenty-five years. These personal connections allow us to sit at kitchen tables sipping coffee and in carving sheds watching artists at work. Every chance we get, we document the elders' humor, knowledge and personalities so they are not lost to the passage of time.Now we need to record another 40 interviews interviews or so, gather yet more excellent photography and then publish it for the world, the community of Alert Bay, for you, our supporters, and for everyone interested in cultural sustainability through language.So exactly what experience do we have?My camera lens has been described as a visual bridge connecting people and translating indigenous cultures to the non-natives around them.  Ceremonies and languages, stories and songs, crafts and art move back and forth across this lens-bridge.I am a fifth generation artist, a professional photographer of over thirty years, published photography in Smithsonian publications and a National Geographic Photography Instructor. I have given talks on the native people of the Pacific Northwest for decades. Both of Pamela and myself constantly learn from the elders. I have spent many years with native peoples of the Inland and Pacific Northwest of the United States and Canada. It has dramatically affected my attitude towards how and what I see. Against a backdrop of magnificent natural beauty, I have learned about the richness and drama deeply woven into the daily lives of these native peoples who consider their land and territory as part of their community. It is my honor to be allowed to create portraits of these elders and their hands for this book.The job of documenting elders belongs not only to the photographer’s eye but also to the writer’s words.  The Kwakwaka’wakw elders talk and Pamela listens, recording their voices, using their stories to strengthen vital cross-generational and cross-cultural exchange. Pamela and I have worked together on many smaller projects since 1997, when we produced the publication Opening Hearts about the Raramuri people (Tarahumara) of the Copper Canyon of Mexico.For Opening Hearts, Pamela wrote the background pieces and sidebars, transcribed interviews, and assembled the pieces for publication. She put the complex culture and history of the Raramuri people into a context that allowed for non-Raramuri to begin to understand this tribe’s self-imposed isolation from the Mexico around them. Since then we have worked on numerous projects large and small. For In the Hands of Our Elders, Pamela’s role is to not only capture the elder’s spoken words but create the interview’s context on both an intimate and universal scale in as few words as possible. Pamela brings context and a written beauty to my photography.We speak about the world in the same way. I use imagery and Pamela uses words.Our goal is to have 90% of the words in our book be from interviews so that it is the words of the elders you read explaining their culture.This project also stretches into the Kwak’wala language education. Pamela records the elders’ stories in both their native language and in English to be available through a weblink.The money raised here will fund100% of the proceeds from the sale of the book will go to teaching Indigenous language.  Pamela and I will not take any royalties or any of the profits from the sale of the completed books.We are supported in this project byThese organizations support us by using their own social media to broadcast this project.The book will contain:And last, but certainly not least, we dedicate this work to children who are our greatest resource.","Our first challenge is finding the relaxed time to sit with the Kwakwaka'wakw elders. When we are with the elders photographing and interviewing, we are on their time. We have budgeted for many trips to Alert Bay but just because we are ready to go does not mean everything falls into place. Interviews happen on the elders' schedule, in a relaxed fashion or not at all. We also understand the majority of the community is on the move during the summer, harvesting berries, fishing and bringing home tidal groceries. Most of our work will probably be done over the winter months, from October 2016 to March 2017 although some excellent opportunities may come to us over the summer. Serendipities, like fireflies, land in your hands only when you're not trying too hard to catch them.Our second challenge is finding an enthusiastic publisher who can work with us, crafting this book within our budget. We have two excellent leads we are currently following up. and will broadcast publishing decisions as they happen.",https://www.kickstarter.com/projects/dos-polacas/indigenous-knowledge-and-the-box-of-treasures?ref=discovery_category_newest,dos-polacas/indigenous-knowledge-and-the-box-of-treasures,"Our Kickstarter book project is calledInTheir Hands: The Keepers of the Box of Treasures.The funds raised through Kickstarter from our wonderful supporters will go to producing this book, including any additional equipment or travel.100% of the net proceeds from the book sales will go toward Indigenous language education in the Kwakwkak'wakw community.We will not take any royalties or any of the profits from the sale of the books.This projectwelcomes you to witness the knowledge and experience of the elders of the Kwakwkak’wakwpeople talking about resilience, reconciliation and strength.We are collaborating in this tremendous book andonline project with two women steeped in their culture. Andrea Cranmer is a traditional culture teacher and mentor.Pewi Alfred teaches Kwak'wala at the elementary school in Alert Bay and is a traditional dance instructor. Theyboth grew up inthe Kwakwaka’wakw culture in Alert Bay, British Columbia learningabout their traditionsfrom theirmothers and fathers, grandmothers, other family members and their community.As teachers and mentors they have devoted their lives to their culture, passing it on to the next generation. ​We are very thankful they are working with us, insuring the voice of the project is that of the First Nations community.In Their Handsstarted 17 years agowhen I was asked by Andrea Sanborn, the U’Mista Cultural Center’s executivedirector, to photograph the older members of the community. Pamela joinedme to interview them while I created their portraits. The result is a series ofintimate portraits of these elders and in-depth interviews. Please visitour websiteHEREwhere I talk more about how I see the art of portraiture.What will you experience by being a part of this project?By celebrating the oldest members of the community, the youth and the earth, we build a bridge stretching between cultures. Across this bridge travel traditions, healing, reconciliation, strength, stories, spirit, music and mystery.Some aspects of the Kwakwaka'wakw culture are held in their Box of Treasures. But what is the Box of Treasures? We asked seven members of the community this question ranging in ages from 14 years old to 83 years old. The answers are revealing and fascinating. Here is the first in the Video Series ""What is the Box of Treasures?"" with Patricia Nolie of Alert Bay, British Columbia. For the rest of the series, please click HERE.Looking around us we see the kaleidoscope of world cultureshas notyetturnedmonochromatic but the threat is on the horizon for many Indigenous cultures.If First Nations cultures are diminished, we are allimpoverished.Look at the faces and their hands of these older members of the First Nations community.Listen as the Kwakwaka'wakw elders share their life experiences.When we grow and learn together, westrengthen each other and celebrate our similarities as well as ourdifferences.We ask you to join us!Contribute to our Kickstarter campaign!Accompany us on this fascinating journey!What motivates us?A sense of urgency that energizes but does not make usfrantic.The feeling of being part of a groundswell, likea rising spring tide.A push toward greater things ahead.​Working with people who have no time to waste.​Honoring and celebrating the resilience of thiscomplex culture through their grandmothers and grandfathers.First it was Andrea Sanborn, the executive director of theU'Mista Cultural Center.Now it is our collaborators, Andrea Cranmer and Pewi Alfred.​But it has also been so many members of the Kwakwaka'wakwcommunitywho have been sogenerous with their time and encouragement, likeRobert “Bobbie Joe” Joseph,StanHunt, Maxine Matilpi, Beau Dick, Vera Cranmer, Don Svanvik, Juanita Johnson and manyothers.In collaboration with First Nations communities, and morespecifically the Kwakwaka’wakw community, we are working toward better relationships between cultures. This project is a model of how non-natives work together with Indigenous peoples tomake a healthy planet with courageous youth and honored elders; wherereconciliation, collaboration and resilience define our inter-culturalcommunications.This book project and its accompanying onlinelanguage resources highlight the resilient spirits of many older First Nations communitymembers. They tell their own stories accompanied in the book by portraits oftheir faces and hands. In Their Hands: The Keepers of the Box of Treasures provides a platformfrom which to broadcast the values of these elders.With your generous help and support, this projectwill add to work already begun: Indigenous language education, teachingcommunity youth the age-old Kwakwaka’wakw cultural traditions, and involvingthe community in reconciliation through story-telling and portraits. Byengaging non-native people outside of the Kwakwaka’wakw community in theseefforts, through the sales of this book, our collaboration will support the strength of this complex, resilient culture.Dos Polacas’ real treasure lies in our unparalleled access tothe Indigenous communities of the Pacific Northwest developed over the lasttwenty-five years. These personal connections allow us to sit at kitchen tablessipping coffee and in carving sheds watching artists at work. Every chance weget, we document the older peoples' humor, stories, knowledge and personalities so theyare not lost to the passage of time. ​Westill need to:Sharon'sBackgroundAs afifth generation artist I am driven by the power of creative images. My camerais not just the tool I use to create photographic portraiture, it also allowsme to stand on a bridge, that crosses between different cultures. Through mylens I am fortunate to observe ceremonies, photograph fine art being made,listen while stories and songs are shared and make portraits of those samestory tellers and singers. Photography gives voice to my experiences and allowsme a personal interpretation of the world.Spending decades with Native and First Nationpeoples of the Inland and Pacific Northwest of the United States and Canada hasdramatically affected my attitude towards how and what I see. Throughexperiencing the diversity of peoples I have learned to recognize the colors,the light and it’s shadow side, of my home, here in the Pacific Northwest, in avery distinct way. Against a backdrop of magnificent natural beauty that is theNorthwest Coast these same decades have gifted me with life-long friendshipswithin Native and First Nations communities. Through these dear friends,aunties, and uncles I continue to learn about the richness and drama deeplywoven into the daily lives of Indigenous peoples. I am profoundly grateful andhonored not only each time I lift a camera and exchange that moment thatbecomes an image...but also for the joy of presence and connection.Pamela'sBackgroundThe job of documenting elders belongs not onlyto the photographer’s eye but also to the writer’s words. The Kwakwaka’wakwelders talk to me and I listen,recording their voices,using their stories to strengthen vital cross-generational and cross-culturalexchange. Sharon and I have worked together on many smaller projects since1997, when we produced the publicationOpening Heartsabout the Raramuripeople (Tarahumara) of the Copper Canyon of Mexico.ForOpeningHearts, I wrote the background pieces and sidebars, transcribedinterviews, and assembled the pieces for publication. I put the complex cultureand history of the Raramuri people into a context that allowed for non-Raramurito begin to understand this tribe’s self-imposed isolation from the Mexicoaround them. Since then we have worked on numerous projects large and small.ForIn Their Hands,my role is to not only capture the elder’s spoken words but create theinterview’s context on both an intimate and universal scale in as few words aspossible. I bring context and a written beauty to Sharon's photography.Sharon and Pamela speak aboutthe world in the same way but Sharon uses imagery while Pamela uses words.""Our goal is to have 90%of the words in our book be from interviews. You will read the words of theKwakwaka’wakw community explaining their culture, not our words.""This online part of theproject will supplement Kwak’wala language education. Whenever possible, Pamelarecords stories in both the speaker’s native languageandin English. These recordingswill be available on a webpage.​​Additional information on the     Kwakwaka’wakw culture to be provided by native community members, edited     by Pamela and community members A dedicated webpage with     recorded stories in both English and Kwak’wala will be available for freeThis is ourgift.We are supported in this project byThese organizations support us by using their own socialmedia to broadcast this project.","Our first challenge is finding the relaxed time to sit with the Kwakwaka'wakw older community members. When we are with them photographing and interviewing, we are on their time. We have budgeted for many trips to Alert Bay. Interviews happen on the elders' schedule, in a relaxed fashion or not at all. We also understand the majority of the community is on the move during the summer, harvesting berries, fishing and bringing home the bounty their natural world provides. Most of our work will probably be done over the winter months, from October 2017 to April 2018 although some excellent opportunities may come to us over the summer. A serendipity, like fireflies, lands in your hands only when you're not trying too hard to catch one. Our second challenge is finding an enthusiastic publisher who can work with us, crafting this book within our budget. We have two excellent leads we are currently following up.

The Crowminius is constructed from standard components with no esoteric parts and is fitted into a sleek aluminum attache case for easy portability.Crowminius Demo #1-- Original v1 prototype demonstration.Crowminius Demo #2 -- Crowminius w/MIDI aftertouch demo.Crowminius Demo #3 -- Crowminius Duet:Scarlatti's Sonata in G (k.455) The Crowminius features three full-range analog oscillators (tone generators) that each can be set via rotary switches from sub-sonic frequencies through a set of ""organ stops"" (octaves) from 32' (bass) to 2' (high soprano). Each oscillator has six waveforms also set by rotary switch to provide the harmonic spectra used to create various sounds.Oscillators 1 and 2 each feature individual pulse-width modulation generators--a feature not found on the vintage model D--and oscillator 3 can be set to act as a ""control oscillator"" to provide vibrato and filter modulation by use of the on-board modulation control or by MIDI modulation commands from a remote controller. The Crowminius has an on-board white/pink/red noise generator that can be used to create audio effects such as wind and surf sounds, but the noise source can also be used as a modulation source. Another feature included on Crowminius that makes use of the noise generator is a ""sample/hold"" circuit that uses oscillator 3 in control mode as a clock to trap the noise signal levels and provide a series of stepped random modulation voltages. These signals are all presented to the 4-pole ladder filter and control amplifer, an all-discrete transistor (no chips!) circuit combination that defined the sound of 1970s progressive rock. The filter has dedicated controls for tracking and modulation, and the filter and amplifier each have their own contour generators to control the dynamics of your sound.The Crowminius also features an Atmel MIDI control front-end based on the ATMEGA328P chip, the same as used in the popular Arduino Uno.  The open-source firmware supports MIDI note, velocity and aftertouch as well as MIDI pitch and mod wheel support. An optional LCD can be installed to monitor system functions but it is not necessary.  In the case of interfacing with vintage pre-MIDI gear such as the classic Minimoog, modular synthesizers and modern instruments that offer the necessary control signals, the unit can be operated from pitch control voltage and choice of voltage trigger or switch trigger jacks. Other features include an external audio input into the filter, a ""locking"" portamento/glide circuit for moving from note to note in solo style, and a ""decay mute"" feature which allows immediate muting of notes when keys are released. Both the glide and decay mute functions can be operated by external footswitches if needed.Finally, two essential performance features are provided. A reference tone at A-440 (""concert A"") can be enabled for precise instrument tuning. This tone is created by the microcontroller using a direct-digital synthesis algorithm that outputs a very accurate PWM-modulated sine tone. Secondly, a dedicated headphone jack and headphone volume control allow the performer to mute the instrument, set up a new voice patch, tune up and and un-mute right back into a live session without disrupting the performance. The entire Crowminius system is powered from a single 12VAC, 500mA wall-pack power supply, with provision to allow the use of two supplies for improved supply operation. The best part about all this is: the Crowminius already exists! The Crowminius was originally presented as a DIY project to synthesizer enthusiasts in early 2015, but as so many people have asked about a pre-assembled version it was decided to offer a production run with an initial goal of shipping 100 units. To this end the design has already been reworked for surface-mount assembly, with the production prototype being hand-built and fully tested before committing the SMT assembly line to production.More information is online at http://www.crowmini.us/Thanks for reading!","As I am an actual manufacturer, I have seen every kind of delay and pitfall there is.  In the case of Crowminius the main potential issue is: parts lead times. When you are making one of something it is generally not a problem procuring the parts, assembly time, etc., but when building a hundred or a thousand of something, all of a sudden the scope of the operation is accordingly magnified. The manufacturer has to contend with competitive demand for parts, back-ordered items, wrong parts delivered, defective parts delivered, OSHA checking up on you, and even ""acts of God"" such as a bad storm knocking your production line out for ten days (this actually happened in 2011).  Preparedness is the only sure footing against all these.  The key element in preparation is to have a fully-debugged production prototype in-hand that represents the final product.  This allows for parts orders to be placed sooner rather than later, and lead times known early on can be dealt with.  Eleventh-hour problems are very expensive--both in terms of money and time.  Production, while scalable, still involves a certain number of units actually deliverable per time period.  In this case, the estimated delivery time frame is based on an initial 100 units.  More units past this initial batch of 100 requires that their delivery window extend into the next period, nominally 90 days.  Thus the first batch would meet the initial delivery window, whereas subsequent batches would require their own delivery windows.

I found this shoe to be very well made. The detail in the craftsmanship is very noticeable and elegant. The leather they used has a brilliant finish with a shine that catches the eye. I love that the shoe fits comfortably and snug, and that the shoe is made to contour to my foot. This shoe is great for casual nights out and outstanding with a suit and tie. This type of shoe is a steal for the price they are being sold. I can't wait to get my feet into one of their boots!!-Mike R., Wings in ebonyAnthony R. Ox-Blood Wing Boot in College LeatherTucker S. Black Monk in Box Calf LeatherI got the black double monks. And really like them. They are breaking in very nicely. The leather is molding well. They do not have the molding issues of some shoes of a lower caliber, such as creasing and wrinkling in unnatural ways. I have experienced this in a lower quality shoe and it was very frustrating. The craftsmanship appears to be superb. The overall fit of the shoe is excellent, it really fits like a glove so I can only imagine how well fitted they will be after being fully broken in.

The idea for this project came from an assignment I had when I was a student at The Art Center College of Design in Pasadena where I met and had the chance to photograph animator, comic book artist and cartoonist Scott Shaw!  I started working in earnest on the project a few years after graduation, and here we are today. Over the past 25 years I have photographed over 200 of these amazing artists.With your support I am hoping to publish a new coffee table book of these portraits, complete with the bio's & art of the artists included. In this new edition I've included some quotes from each artist as well. The list of artists includes the ""Who's Who"" of the Comic Book, Cartoon, and Animation fields and just for fun, some amazing illustrators & designers who have greatly influenced this genre- I think your gonna love it! Here are just a few of the artists photographed for this book:Sample Page Layout: each artist will be represented on a double page spread that will include the photo, a small bio, a quote, a copy of the artists signature and a representative piece of art by that artist.Book details: Hard cover, a minimum of 220 pages, 10 1/2 x 11 1/4 inches. B&W and Color. Currently, I have over 110 Artists and am hoping to photograph 10-12 more by the end of the year.*Bonus for Book Pledge Kickstarter Supporters only. Each copy of the book comes with one free 8 x 10 bonus print featuring at random one of the following artists: Carl Barks, Jack Kirby, Moebius, Alex Toth, or Dave Stevens, Check them out:Costs and Stretch Goals: As you might imagine, the costs involved in a book of this scope are quite high. From airfare, assistants, lodging & meals, rental vehicles, etc., to the book's publication costs, including editing and design from our book support crew, the accumulative numbers have been great. The production and mailing costs alone are at least $26,000- that's our minimum to bring this to life. Should we gain your support, we will look into increasing the value of the book by upgrading the binding, paper, increasing the dimensions and page count, adding a few more artists, and doing everything we can to make this as gorgeous as possible through stretch goals. Should we have the good fortune to be in the position to do so, these stretch goals will be announced as the campaign progresses.Michael Dooley- Author and Professor of Comics and Animation History on book 2:""Greg Preston has diligently and passionately devoted decades of his life to seeking out and documenting the most significant professionals in the fields of animation, comic books and strips, graphic novels, and political cartoons. His ""The Artist Within"" is a publishing milestone, unsurpassed in providing us with a unique appreciation and admiration for the giants of graphic narrative. And now we all have the potential for a second volume, one that builds and expands on the accomplishments of the first. I've seen the original prints, and they’re even more stunning and essential.

For the past 25 years I have photographed some of the most amazing comic book artists, cartoonists, animators and illustrators.The idea for this project came from an assignment I had when I was a student at ""The Art Center College of Design"" in Pasadena where I met and had the chance to photograph animator, comic book artist and cartoonist Scott Shaw! I started working in earnest on the project a few years after graduation, and here we are today. Since then, I have photographed over 250 of these amazing artists.The First 101 portraits were published as a coffee table book by Dark Horse Comics in 2007.With your support I am hoping to publish a second book of portraits complete with the bio's & art of the artists. In this new edition, I've included some quotes from each artist as well.The list of artists includes the ""Who's Who"" of the Comic Book, Cartoon, and Animation fields and just for fun, some amazing illustrators & designers who have greatly influenced this genre- I think your gonna love it!   Here are just a few of the artists photographed for this book:  And over 100 more!

Just Imagine!Costs and Stretch Goals: As you might imagine, the costs involved in a book of this scope are quite high. From airfare, assistants, lodging & meals, rental vehicles, etc., to the book's publication costs, including editing and design from our book support crew, the accumulative numbers have been great. The production, printing and mailing costs alone are at least $26,000- that's our minimum to bring this to life. Should we gain your support, we will look into increasing the value of the book by upgrading the binding, paper, increasing the dimensions and page count, adding a few more artists, and doing everything we can to make this as gorgeous as possible through stretch goals. Should we have the good fortune to be in the position to do so, these stretch goals will be announced as the campaign progresses.""Greg Preston has diligently and passionately devoted decades of his life to seeking out and documenting the most significant professionals in the fields of animation, comic books and strips, graphic novels, and political cartoons.

All images are taken within the Municipality of Anchorage… Which is a HUGE area with a whopping 1,961 SQUARE MILES.  See map below. Along with standard holidays and moon phases, on each month there is information on the average Anchorage weather conditions for that month; rain/snowfall, high & low temperatures, and daylight hours. There is also a smaller photo and a quote (inspirational, comedic or thought-provoking) from a famous person such as Helen Keller, Abraham Lincoln and Groucho Marx. See sample below. I am continuing to shoot more images in order to continue to produce a new calendar each year in hopes of starting a tradition. I am open to hearing from everyone about other locations, weather patterns and phenomena that they would like to see in future years. The calendar will retail in stores for $12Publication Date: Available early spring 2015 Specifications: •	Retail Calendar is 8.6 x 11.8”  folded size •	Hole punched for hanging•	Printed on high-quality gloss paper with UV coating on cover•	Printed locally in Anchorage, AlaskaBelow are the images that will be in the calendar.

Likewise the design is nearly complete.

In this case, the icons of Alaska’s Iditarod TrailSled Dog Race® will include memorable people, dogs, places, gear, and evenevents from the Last Great Race® that have shaped Iditarod history.The Project:I’m Jeff Schultz, a professional photographer whohas lived in Anchorage, Alaska, since 1978. My career was established around photographingimages for corporate, editorial, and stock use. And then in 1980, I was blessedto meet Joe Redington, Sr., the man known as the “Father of the Iditarod.” Backthen, I had no idea what the Iditarod was—a thousand-mile race by dog team fromAnchorage to Nome—but soon I learned. Joe invited me to get involved as avolunteer photographer, and I first followed the race with my camera in 1981.The next year I was asked to be an official photographer, and since then I’veaccumulated more than 55,000 images in my Iditarod photo catalog.In these thirty-six years, I have become a part of the “Iditarod family”and met dozens and dozens of amazing dog people: mushers, race officials, andvolunteers. Their stories hearken back to the race’s earliest days. Likewise,I’ve had a front-row seat as Iditarod has come of age. In 2017, Iditarod isturning forty-five and it will be my 37th race!Several years ago, ExxonMobil, one of Iditarod’s major sponsors,asked me to conceive a photo display titled “Icons of the Iditarod” for their pre-racereception. They asked for an elegant presentation, so we created the images asclassic black-and-white prints. While I was curating those 70 or so images andlooking closer at those icons, the idea came to me: expand this concept byadding more icons and broaden the audience beyond those present at that reception.Hence this book. Although I’ve been thinking about the idea since then, I feelnow’s the time to produce this book for fans of Alaska history, dogs, andespecially Iditarod. Who chooses which icons make it into the book? I madethose choices, along with a few otherlong-time Iditaroders, but by no means are they meant to be an exhaustive orconclusive list. We simply feel they are most noteworthy.Sample chapters will include: Icons of the Iditarod will include imagesboth in classic black-and-white as well as color. Many have not been publishedbefore, among them portraits of Iditarod champions taken at their homes in thesummer. This is not just a coffee-table photo book. The text, written byIditarod book veteran Tricia Brown, will educate and advance fresh and excitingdetails and stories surrounding the Iconsof the Iditarod.Once again I’ve enlisted the same team of professionals from my previousChasing Dogs Iditarod book—people Iknow, trust, and who have experience with Iditarod to make it the best book itcan be. A great writer/editor, photoeditor, designer, and production manager. Will you join us in this endeavor?The Pitch: Although it’sstill in its concept stage, Icons of theIditarod has been outlined, visualized, some of the photos chosen and theteam has been assembled. Now the challenge is covering the expense of producingit. Support through KickStarter will pay for the team’s expenses, the printing,and shipping. With your help to make Iconsof the Iditarod a reality, you will receive any of several reward packages.The plan is to have this beautiful, informative book in our hands just prior toChristmas season, or the latest, early 2018.

The quintessential American drive-in theater, where generations of moviegoers enjoyed movies under the stars with their friends and family, perhaps even hadtheir first kiss, is threatened. Looking to cut costs, the movie industry is rejecting traditional 35mm film for new digital film prints. Film as we know it is coming to an end. To keep up with changing technology, theaters must either convertto digitalprojectors orfade to black, forever. Unfortunately, the new projectors aren't a dime a dozen- its $75,000 a pop. That's HUGE for a small theater like us. There is simply no way that we can afford a sum like that.When we first heard about the possibility that movies would stop being made in 35mm, we hoped for the best and waited to see how much more timewas left.

The communities we serve are fiercely dedicated to shopping local, staying local, eating local, and supporting local small businesses.

He decides to participate in a raffle, and wins a vacation. Everything ran perfectly until his flight crashes. As the only survivor along with a man he saved, he has to try to survive on an island. After a while they notice that they are not alone...I have been working with animations since 2011. This animation is the biggest project I've ever worked on. It will probably be 15-25 minutes long. The problem is that the main language is German and not English. But maybe I can change that if this kickstarter project has success. In this article are a few examples:12 minutes of the animation are currently done.But I can't continue working because I lack the resources.If it is possible, I will make livestreams, where you see how I continue to the animation.You can also support me on my Patreon-page!","The only risk is that if my animation program contains errors, and the animation thus belated.",https://www.kickstarter.com/projects/zepsch/pocketstar-play-retro-games-on-your-keychain?ref=discovery_category_newest,zepsch/pocketstar-play-retro-games-on-your-keychain,"Simply insert a Micro-SD Card to play games and view the content.

Back then, we did not know a lot about product development, but now we have the necessary knowledge and are working with producers who make this project possible.One of the risks is producing on a large scale. Although we have the prototype we still have to adapt it for mass production. As with any startup, complications may occur and shipping may be delayed.The biggest challenge is the games that are currently in development.We hope we can finish the most important games before shipment.

HAVE YOU EVER THOUGHT ABOUT WHY YOU DON’T HEAR ABOUT WOMEN BIG-BAND LEADERS? HAVE YOU EVER IMAGINED THAT JAZZ MUSIC, IN THE 21ST-CENTURY, STILL HAS MOSTLY MALE MUSICIANS AS BANDLEADERS?I am so excited to share with you, that my next recording project is designed to make a contribution toward changing this historical omission, and filling a void. What is the project about? Creating a woman-led big band live recording, preserving the big band tradition, and supporting jazz gender justice.THE LIVE CONCERT RECORDING IS SCHEDULED FOR TUESDAY, MARCH 26TH AT 7:30 PM. YOU CAN ATTEND BY CHOOSING THE PLEDGE OF $25 FOR THE CONCERT ALONE, OR $65 TO SUPPORT THE PROJECT AND ATTEND THE CONCERT.The resulting project will be a full album, commercially released, a video of the live recording and photography from the rehearsals and recording. This project employs 20 musicians, and a dozen music and music business professionals, employs four generations of renowned veteran musicians, as well as emerging and student musicians.Who loves big band music? Lots of people do! And I had no idea of the particular attraction many people have of the songs, the culture and the musicians who play big band music. I LOVE big band music!! The power, the excitement, the range of emotions embodied in 20 musicians, all playing their hearts out together! There is nothing quite like it.And, I learned there is a huge community of people who LOVE big band.WHY Big Band?! Well, this NY Times' recent article tells us why big band is experiencing a re-emergence. https://www.nytimes.com/2018/12/31/arts/music/jazz-big-band-revival.htmlAs a nod to the great women bandleaders who were singers, this recording is my way of paying tribute. It is a little- known fact that many women bandleaders were mostly heralded as “just singers” but were actually the CEOs of the big bands that toured in the 30s, 40s and 50s. From the all-women led bands like the International Sweethearts of Rhythm to women performers who led all-male or mixed gender bands like Betty Carter, Ella Fitzgerald, Lil Hardin Armstrong, Ina Rae Hutton, and Blanche Calloway (Cab Calloway sibling), the list of women fronting big bands is long and compelling. WHY THIS RECORDING MATTERSBut, where are the women-led big bands now!? Women are leading big-bands – you just don’t hear about it often. In the NYTimes article above for instance, those featured and discussed are mostly men (they include one woman instrumentalist). But the singers who front bands are not often looked at as bandleaders, especially if they front big bands. Did you know that Ella Fitzgerald was the official bandleader of the Chic Webb Orchestra after his death. It is often assumed that one of the men in the band is the musical director or bandleader (making the musical decisions) but it often isn't so!Big band music is integral to the history of jazz, and I believe it is a tradition worth saving - especially re-creating a narrative of a women-led big bands and big bands that have women instrumentalists! This recording is about inclusiveness and seeks to debunk the long history of all male bands, male bandleaders, male composers and arrangers. For this project, the knowledge, the access and the resources are spread across age, gender, culture and ethnicity.Women’s voices are important in the jazz recording history. Why? Because women contribute to the shaping of culture. Without a woman’s perspective our stories about humanity are one-sided.I've always wanted to record with a big band and this is our chance to make history together.However, the challenges of managing the recording of a big band - the costs of paying 20 musicians alone stops many people from doing a project like this.I have convened a group of four generations of talented men and women musicians from some of the best jazz musicians performing today. What we will achieve is a recording and live concert experience with the power and sultriness of big band jazz, with some of the hippest musicians around. I'm fortunate that I was able to engage Branford Marsalis' engineer, Rob ""Wacko"" Hunter (who also engineered my Chronicles of a Butterfly album release and who has won Grammy awards as an engineer and producer) to be our engineer for this project!The music: great jazz composers who also led bands like Nina Simone, Ella Fitzgerald, Duke Ellington, George Gershwin, John Coltrane, Betty Carter, Dizzy Gillespie and others are featured. The arrangements? Superstar arrangers, and newcomers! Some are written by two North Carolinians; the Kinston, NC born saxophonist/educator Brian Horton and Johnston County’s Maurice Myers. Also featured are several arrangements from GRAMMY nominated jazz arranger/trumpeter Cecil Bridgewater and renowned jazz pianist/composer Stanley Cowell. Other arrangements are written by pianist/singer Lydia Salett Dudley and myself. In September 2018, I had a big band concert in Durham, NC. What an amazing moment!! Just thinking about it gives me chills (check it out in the video snippets above). That concert performance was for a sold-out crowd and we received a standing ovation!It has been seven long years since my last album, I Love Myself When I’m Laughing released in 2011! It was also the year that I married my husband Fred Hammonds and became a step-mom and grandma. So much has happened since then...Since 2005 I have had the great privilege to help train the next generation of jazz singers and instrumentalists as an Assistant Professor, Jazz Studies at North Carolina Central University' Department of Music. It has been a humbling journey. And you know what I learned that surprised me the most? My students are watching my journey to take clues about what their journey could hold. As much as the thought of how daunting the idea of a big band record for this project scares me, I have to move forward with inspired courage. Amidst my busy teaching schedule and working on my doctoral degree, I neglected to focus on making recordings. I miss you, and I'm ready to sing for you!! I’ve been doing a lot of writing and performing in several countries over the past few years. I'm ready to start recording my next album. I want to be an example for my students that women are courageous, and are successful entrepreneurs in jazz. I want to show that we can be a music CEO: create opportunities for other musicians, generate income; foster experience for music professionals, and contribute to the jazz discography. This project has many objectives, and overall will prove that we can rewrite the jazz narrative to include leadership by and inclusive of women! This is where you come in.. .The Game PlanWe’re officially kicking off my Kickstarter Campaign - For The Love of Big Band, The Album. I will make a record in the same way I’ve always made records—using the best musicians, the best engineers and recording in the best locations available. The record will be recorded like my Chronicles of a Butterly recording which was produced by Branford Marsalis, “live” in an old historic church in Durham, NC where I live. This old historic church, the Hayti Heritage Center has a rich history to the community in which it is surrounded – an important historical legacy where business leaders from Black Wall Street would meet and plan for future generations. It is a cultural treasure and historic landmark, and acoustically superior to almost anyplace I’ve ever performed or recorded.The only difference with this recording is that we are choosing to enlist the “power of the people” to fund my CD.For my past couple of releases, the budget for simply producing and manufacturing my records has been around $20,000. And then my record label invests thousands more in marketing and promotion. When I was on an indie label for my earlier releases, these dollar amounts were nearly doubled.So what I’m reaching out to you for, is to enlist your support so that we can make a great album with this great group of musicians I’ve amassed, awesome arrangers and a spectacular engineer in an acoustically superior location.Now all we need is you to reach our goal!WHY WE NEED YOUCostsMaking a record can vary, and producing a record with a big band - 20 - 25 musicians is really reaching for a big vision. To give you an overview of how much we'll have to spend to make this project a success, here is just an overview:Musicians $25,000.00 (includes fees, lodging, travel, meals)Engineer $2,000.00Location/Venue $1000 (discounted by Hayti in support of project)Arrangers $4,500.00Mixing & Mastering $2,000.00CD manufacturing @ 2000 $4,000.00Licensing $500.00Graphic Design & Photography $1,250.00Videography & Editing $2,500.002 day Piano Rental**, Piano Moving & Piano Tuning $1,000.00**Piano rental discounted from Paul Hopper/Hopper PianoGround Transportation for transporting recording equipment* $200.00*Recording equipment donated by Branford Marsalis!Marketing/Advertising $1,2500.00Radio Promotion $3,800.00Project Assistants $1,000.00Reward Fulfillment $3,000.00Total: $50,500Kickstarter Campaign Ask: $28,500WHAT HAPPENS WHEN WE EXCEED OUR GOAL?Stretch Goal of $50,000. If we raise more than our goal, we can keep going! If we reach our Stretch Goal, all that we raise will go toward marketing and promotion, original video content and tour support. Reaching funding beyond the core needs will also allow us to provide opportunity to go out into the community and reach young people with jazz education workshops about big band tradition and youth jazz concerts in schools. This tour support will allow me to do shows in more places and that means I’ll get to meet you out there on the road. All of the funds we raise will go right back into engaging with you, the supporters.Incentives and RewardsI think we’ve compiled a cool list of items and experiences to fund this project. Check them out!! I am particularly excited about the house concerts and song commissions! I would love if you can join me at the live recording concert, and look forward to meeting your friends and family, whether at the recording, or if you have us come to your home to perform a house concert!As a Chicago born-and-bred gal, music has always been core to my personal and family life. This year marks my 20-year anniversary of making records!! My first recording made in 1998 was released commercially and was titled Spirit Child, finally released on J Curve records in 1999. I have been really fortunate to have dedicated folks who stuck with me from indie labels and supported my foray to my own record label, Zenzalai Music. I am so frickin’ grateful for my audience and my dedicated followers! We have accomplished so much together, now it is time to make some new memories!This is a whole new chapter of my life and career. I can’t thank you enough for your support!With Music,Lenora (Zenzalai) Helm HammondsVisit www.LenoraHelm.online and www.LenoraHelm.com","Making a recording can be a harrowing process. No matter if the weather prevents travel on the day of the recording, or illness of key musicians or personnel, we have to prepare for whatever happens. I am 100% committed to making sure I get this product completed and in your hands. I am known for being relentlessly persistent, so no matter what, our project will come to fruition and we can enjoy the fruits of your pledges to us, and the great music we will make for you.

The venue is fully ADA-accessible, so all our friends will be able to come visit.

A knowing nod to those around us that have been through the same experiences, fought the same battles and come out on the other side. Whether it's saving out your 9th version of the ""final"" file to end a project, dealing with ""a gift"" on your office floor given by the cantankerous office dog, or slugging it out for long hours at an unpaid internship. There is a unique subculture that exists amongst those of us that have paid our dues and the Design Gangs Series humorously captures that through a series biker gang style badges on a variety of printed goods.After a long career inside design shops and agencies, as a designer and creative director, I've been running my own small studio for a few years. A short twitter exchange with the design firm, Forefathers, had us joking about some of these situations understood by those of us in creative professions. This interaction made me think about the other ""gangs"" that could inhabit the modern world of visually creative professions. Before I knew it, this exploration was turning into a series. Based on the response I've received from all the work I've posted online, the resounding response has been very positive, with people connecting with various badges based on their own personal experience.So Kickstarter friends, my goal is to raise enough to produce a series of 9 of these designs as t-shirts, all 20 on a screen printed poster, and some fun temporary tattoos. Kickstarter is the perfect platform to allow me to produce these as a series and get them in the hands of everyone that wants them.I hope you dig the series and thanks in advance for taking a look and backing the project!","The artwork has all been created, so hopefully you all feel like you know what you're getting. Potential obstacles are production and fulfillment. Because I've been a professional designer for many years, I have a good handle on production pitfalls, selecting good vendors and understanding timelines. I created a successfully funded project a few years back called MAX100. It was a high end art book and I learned many lessons regarding fulfillment and shipping on that project, that will help me to make sure that process runs as smoothly as possible. I have also partnered with vendors I know and trust for both the print (the Half and Half) and the t-shirts (Cotton Bureau). I have experienced their quality and attention to detail firsthand.",https://www.kickstarter.com/projects/mattstevensclt/good-movies-as-old-books?ref=discovery_category_newest,mattstevensclt/good-movies-as-old-books,"My Good Movies as Old Books series combines my love of film and old book art. As a professional designer and illustrator, I took on the project as an exercise to help me out of a creative funk and as a way to experiment with new mediums and techniques. After doing a few entries the project took on a life of its own and I became excited about continuing to explore new ideas and reinterpret movies from my life that I have a deep affection for.The response online has been enthusiastic, so I saw this as an opportunity to get the artwork into people's hands in both book and print art form.The book will be a high end piece, produced by one of the most reputable book printers in the United States. The prints will be high quality giclee prints, on archival paper.A NOTE ON PRINTS: At the end of the project, I will provide you a look at all 100 finished covers along with the backer survey and you will choose the print(s) you want (number of prints based on your reward level).I have over 60 pieces done by the date of this project launch. You can view all the current entries here. I will spend the 30 days of the project to continue to produce new illustrations to reach a grand total of 100. I will share some of my thoughts and process along the way via project updates. I won't show everything, because I want there to be new and surprising content for those that have been following along online. Hopefully we get funded and we meet each other at the end and can make a book & some great art together.I have provided several reward levels to accomodate those that are more interested in the book, the prints, or those that want both. Thanks for considering and for your support.","I have produced a similar book in the past on Kickstarter, so I feel well-armed to handle the challenges and risks of a project of this type. As with any project relying on outside vendors, there is always inherent risk. To minimize this risk, I will be working with reputable printers that I have worked with successfully in the past and have a good working relationship with. I will communicate any production delays quickly and clearly.Shipping is also a risk. Things can get lost and damaged. I will use only trackable forms of shipping so that you as a backer and I as a project creator can be clear on the status of orders. This will make shipping more costly, but in my experience, that security is worth it."

Each is dealing with the situation in an opposite way: Jamie overcome with emotion and her father emotionally shutting down, resulting in them alienating themselves when they need each other the most. This story specifically focuses on the moment when all this comes to a head (through the loss of Jamie's horse, also her best friend), when Jamie and her father must confront their differences and find a healthy way to deal with their demons, otherwise those demons will destroy them.Our film is a drama with fantasy and thriller elements, the latter of which occur when Jamie, not getting what she needs from her dad, retreats into her depression in an attempt to be with those who care. The film looks at serious topics like loss, family, and mental health, and does so in an honest and authentic way, but it is also uplifting and inspirational, presenting our world as hopeful and worth experiencing, even if it isn't ideal.Why do we want to make this film? Great question!Beyond our love for filmmaking, animation, and storytelling, we want to make this film because of how powerful the story is, and how personal it is to us. Whether it's losing a loved one, difficulties with family, or dealing with mental health, the issues our film explores have directly affected our lives. What we went through and how we got through it, what we dealt with and are continuing to deal with, we put it all into this story, and we're putting it all into this film.As filmmakers, we really want to highlight these key ideas:Another key purpose of our film is highlighting mental health, both mental health issues and awareness. Specifically, this film looks at both suicide and depression. We think these are critically important topics, one that haven't been adequately addressed in film. This is partially because film is a visual medium and mental health is not visual, but it is also because many filmmakers don't have or haven't tapped into the experiences necessary to tackle these topics, and also because studios tend to prefer less heavy and risky storytelling.Our story, however, is different. We've found a way to visualize depression, a way that is inspirational, powerful, and real. And while this topic may be too risky for Hollywood, it is perfect for independent filmmakers like us. This is why we are so excited to make this film, and to make it through donations from supporters like you. Making our film this way, we are free to tell a story that hasn't been told, to put characters on screen that we've never seen before. We are free to make a powerful and authentic film that audiences can connect with, both those going and not going through these issues.In our opinion, this is the most powerful thing film can do: build empathy and understanding, put yourself in someone else's shoes. It's all about connecting our world a little more, and that is what we plan to do with our film.We believe animation is a way to tell stories that can't quite be told using live action. In our case, animation provides the ability to blend fantasy and reality, mental with emotional, and make them all feel like the same world.Animation also gives an almost unrestricted ability to create unique beings, and it allows for these beings to interact in ways that would be prohibitive in a live-action movie.Additionally, animation, particularly 2D animation with its handmade quality, allows for wonderful displays of artistry and emotion, not just through character and story, but also through the designs, styles, and even the animation itself. Like what you see in The Iron Giant, Song of the Sea, and pretty much every classic Miyazaki and Disney movie.These are more than just movies, they are works of art, and that is also what we want our film to be.Gabriel has written and directed over a dozen short films, several of which have screened at festivals across the US, including those in Los Angeles, Chicago, and Atlantic City.

Our script is amazing and our team is incredible, but without your financial support, What We're Meant For won't get made.Animation, even short animation, is expensive. This is especially true for our project, which contains aspects that due to their expense and difficulty are not often found in short films. Additionally, our story requires very high quality animation, particularly in facial expression and character motion, so you won't find South Park style animation here (not that we don't love South Park, the style just won't work for our film).Because of this, the majority of our budget goes toward animation.

As such, this fundraising campaign is specifically for preproduction, and breaks down as follows:Once preproduction is complete, we will use everything we've created (concept art, model sheets, storyboard, voice acting, score, animatic, and more) to raise the funds required for animation. We have several options on how to do this, including:We will pursue each option above, and we will get this film made, no matter what.GETTING THE WORD OUTIn addition to donating, there are other ways you can help make this film. Like sharing! Tell your friends, your co-workers, your family; tell everyone you know about this film! You can do this by:You never know who might be in a position to support this project, and so the more people who know about it, the closer we come to reaching our goal. Also, the more people who share and tweet about our project, the more likely we are to trigger Kickstarter's algorithms, get their attention, and become a staff pick! And once that happens, we get all sorts of attention. So share and tweet away! Lets make this film happen!We know you've worked hard for your money, so we've worked hard coming up with (and will work even harder delivering) amazing perks that will make your donation a fun and rewarding experience.PLEASE NOTE: Full perk descriptions are in the right-hand sidebar.SIGGRAPH press release: https://www.siggraph.org/2d-animated-short-what-were-meant-for/Art With Impact interview: https://www.artwithimpact.org/awi-exclusive-interview-what-were-meant-for/Film Daily Writeup:https://filmdaily.co/news/crowdfunding/what-were-meant-for/The Shek Check mental health podcast:https://www.theshekcheck.com/checkcast/checkin-what-were-meant-forTwo Guys On Set filmmaking podcast:https://podcasts.apple.com/us/podcast/episode-26-gabe-bruskoff-stephanie-eisenberg-interview/id1405214142?i=1000434236593Write On Ejaleigh blog post:https://writeonejaleigh.wordpress.com/2019/03/17/why-i-wont-accept-money-to-advertise-on-my-blog/Been Better Comics shoutout:http://beenbettercomic.com/archives/beenbetter/eye-feastSIGGRAPH Producer interview:https://www.siggraph.org/member-profile/stephanie-eisenberg/The Bee Writes... blog questionnaire:https://thebeewritesdownloads.wordpress.com/2019/04/21/g-bruskoff-answers-the-proust-questionnaire/We LITERALLY can not do this without you. We are so humbled and grateful for your donations and support. ","Frame by frame 2D animation is inherently challenging, due to the time and effort it requires. The funds from this campaign will cover everything through the beginning of the animation process, including an animatic (storyboard brought to life through voice acting, sound effects, and a film score), which is basically the first cut of the film. Our animatic is included in THE MOVIE perk, meaning everyone who donates at this level or higher is guaranteed to see a version of our film from the funds raised in this campaign alone. Likewise, the vast majority of our other perks will be fulfilled (everything but the HD version of the film, commentary tracks, and VIP Invitation to the Premiere) with the funds raised in this campaign.The main risk for our film will be transitioning from preproduction to animation. Because this campaign only covers a portion of the animation process, we will be securing outside funds to complete animation. We have several options on how to do this, and we will look into and pursue each avenue to ensure our film gets funded and finished, no matter what."

After watching his video, I thought... since we were in high school together, I thought, if he can do it... why can't I ?!The film centers around religion and the part it plays in our lives.It's a passionate topic in the United States, but most awareness in the media surrounds the Abrahamic faiths. (These are the big three you're thinking of: Judaism, Christianity, and Islam)The film looks to counterbalance that.My last film was about stereotypes, and while making it I confronted a few of my own that I had developed while growing up.One of those, that was broken early, was seeing a white person practicing Hinduism (and this was way before yoga studios appeared on every block) While being appreciative and surprised, I always thought ""What could motivate him to discard his religion of birth and adopt a new one?""The film takes the childhood thought of mine further by asking the question:""What if a locally raised Midwestern man and converted Hindu starts a Hinduism-based school in his conservative Christian town?""At its core, Hinduism's message is one of pluralism, tolerance and acceptance, which is what our lead character wishes to spread.The story will follow his journey towards the very noble goal of bringing tolerance and acceptance to his town, but at what cost? It digs deeper into the toll unchecked ambition can take, and forces our main character to learn new lessons about sacrifice and family along the way.Given today's social and political climate, there's no better time for theme of tolerance, acceptance and mutual understanding.With your help, we can make it happen.Since 2006, I've been involved in filmmaking, from directing, writing, and editing. Since working on the pilot episode of Mad Men, I've completed two documentary films, Creating Utsava and Not a Feather, but a Dot. These have screened in both film festivals and theatrical venues.I've also written and directed short films and spec commercials, including Dorito commercials with two talented actors in the video, Ami Park and Danielle Joy. You can watch those here and here.Humor and satire are a big part of of my work, as I believe even serious things have a strain of humor within it.My last project was a fun tribute to the classic, Reservoir Dogs, called Reservoir Aunties.Oh, and here's me with someone who's dabbled in satire a little bit also.Here are some of the other talented people I've worked with, on past projects, and could potentially work with on this projectAlex DePew,a cinematographer that has worked on an assortment of projects ranging from narrative, documentary, short film and commercial. He has worked on projects for  LL Bean, Samsung, Corona and New Balance. Alex has been DP on a few of my short films.Lionel Cohen,a film composer with over 300 IMDb credits, including TV shows such as: American Idol, House, Elementary, The Big Bang Theory, 2 Broke Girls, The Mentalist, and others. His commercial works include Sony PSP, Cadillac, Buick, BMW, Mercedes, Adidas, DirectTV, Louis Vuitton, Kohl's and Macy’s. Lionel has scored one of my short films.Paula Landry,  an award-winning writer/producer, whose recent projects include a VR filmAbracadabra!, A CAT’S TALE and others;   She is the author ofthe 2nd edition of Scheduling and Budgeting Your Film: A Panic-Free Guide (Focal Press), and The Business of FILM,with Stephen Greenwald (Focal Press).Her clients include Forbes, Pearson Television, Entertainment Weekly, and others. Paula has consulted on my documentary film, Not a Feather, and helped with countless other projects.What's been doneAn initial draft of the script has been written, as well as some preliminary location scouting in India.108 is an auspicious number in Hinduism. The reality is, it takes more than $108 to make a commercially viable film, so the initial amount we're seeking is $100,108.00. The initial funding will go towards script rewrites, location scouting, pre-production and production.If 926.9 people each put in $108, good vibes would be maximized for all, and we'd get to meet nine tenths of a person.And lastly.. P.S. Zach, if you're reading this, Gaslight or the Gate?Contribute $50 or higher for the official ""I backed..."" T-shirt(Disclaimer: Zach Braff is not officially a part of this campaign)","Films are inherently risky and bla bla bla... I'd rather just tell a story here:For one of my previous projects, I had worked out an agreement with a location to shoot for six hours, we had spent over a month agreeing on a date, crew size, etc...

(Yes, I get that it's a little late to say that)Last year I ran a kickstarter* for a feature film project, and thanks to some amazing supporters, it had raised just over $50,000. However, the campaign target was slightly over $100,000. Choosing to see the ""glass half-full"" (and just being a tad tenacious about this project in general),I've decided to try again with a new video and a new campaign target to raise funds for phase 1 of the film project. (And I'm just really having a ball with these photo mashups)*Note: If you pledged to the previous campaign, since it raised only half the target amount, no pledges were charged (Kickstarter funding is all-or-none)My documentary film, ""Not a Feather, but a Dot""in part investigated the stereotypes associated with the South Asian community, and while making it,I had reflected on some of my own earliest developed stereotypes, and how they were broken.One such example was seeing a white person practicing Hinduism in the Hindu temple we used to frequent. (This was waaaay before yoga studios appeared on every block) While being appreciative and surprised, I always thought ""What might motivate him to discard his religion of birth and adopt a new one?""The film takes the childhood thought of mine further by posing the question:""What if a locally raised Midwestern man and converted Hindu starts a Hinduism-based school in his conservative Christian town in an attempt to promote pluralism and mutual understanding?""Hinduism's central message is one of pluralism, mutual understanding and acceptance, which, in my view, is not adequately represented or known by the US mainstream consciousness. I mean, we're just now dealing with Apu.The story will follow our protagonist's journey to India, which to him is a foreign land, and his struggle to bring new perspectives back to his original hometown.It's a ""fish out of water"" story, except this fish goes back in the water.His goal of bringing this acceptance to his town is noble, but at what cost? The film will dig into the following themes: Community sacrifice, acceptance, and toll unchecked ambition can take on a person, his family, and his surrounding.Given today's social and political climate, there's no better time for these themes to be presented in a new, engaging way.And once again, with your help, we can make it happen.Every pledge helps, no matter how much.Below are some locations in India that are potential shooting locationsThe chart describes Phase 1 fund usage:The breakdown:The film will be written and directed by myself, most recently I've hada short film, Double Identity, feature at the Los Angeles Neo Noir film festival.

I'm an Actor, now Director, and writer! I am working on bringing major films to Missouri and Arkansas, as well as working on expanding jobs in my area (Branson/Hollister) by offering jobs on film sets, such as Catering, Security, and Finance as well as many cast and crew positions!Things are going great, but weren't always that great. I moved to Brazil at age 21 in 2009, to ""find myself"" and explore the world, as well as acting and learning new languages and cultures. In 2010, my brother, SrA. Tre F. Porfirio, was killed as a result of being shot 3 times in Afghanistan by a ""rouge"" agent in his USAF Installation. He was awarded the Purple Heart, and went through major surgeries that were ground breaking! However, he later died as a result of the wounds. - This put me in a strange spiral of sadness and anger. in 2011 a war in Brazil between gangs and cartels broke out against police and civilians in Sao Paulo and Rio de Janero. I decided to link up with aCivil Police Militia and got trained up for urban combat. I was angry at the wrong people, and the wrong things at my young age, but it gave me the edge I needed later in life to help people.""How?"" You might ask.Well, after seeing murder, and violence, and losing family and friends as a result of evil, and violence. I decided it was time to go back to one of the best places in the world. The Midwest of the United States, that I now call home. I was diagnosed with severe anxiety and PTSD, and never really understood it until I had a horrible spout of it one day, causing me to write this movie. 22 Veterans a day kill themselves as a result of trauma, PTSD, and anxiety, and another 100 civilians per day do the same thing. I've lived this long because I am meant to help people, and that's what I intend to do. I want to bring awareness to PTSD, and now to Service Dogs and how they can help our veterans and civilians!

With over 25 contributors and 22 stories, each comic is centered around one Major Arcana tarot card at a time, beginning with The Fool and ending with The World as you read the story of tarot, fleshed out in illustrated form.At the end of each story, the comic culminates into a tarot card artwork, giving context and character behind the imagery of the card. Are you new to tarot? We'll have pages dedicated to teach you how to perform spreads, title pages telling the nature of each card, as tradition and identity go hand and hand to tell TABULA IDEM's tarot.TABULA IDEM will also manifest into a full color 22-card Major Arcana deck, giving a colorful illumination to the card artwork printed in the anthology. Rife with symbolism and injected with queer reflections, the deck and anthology work hand in hand, the cards providing practical, every day use while the anthology elaborates their figures.TABULA IDEM was born from the desire to see more of ourselves in tarot, and to see queer identities in a divine light. It is a form of meditation where we sometimes ask the questions we are too hesitant to answer, and how much more comforting is it to see answers from cards that reflect its audience? We chose the Major Arcana for their archetypal nature, but more than that, to give people an opportunity to view those old, traditional figures in a new way. Each contributor poured a piece of themselves into each card's story; be it in magic, in space, in fantasy or all combined, we hope that the cards can speak to you not only in prediction, but one of the most strengthening qualities of tarot: community and relatability.Follow along with TABULA IDEM at @TabulaIdemTarot on Twitter, or tabulaidemanthology.com!Our main hurdles are that we're printing both a book AND deck, as well as paying contributors, shipping, and other reward fulfillment costs.

This anthology will be printed in black & white with 240+ pages, sized at standard American graphic novel (6.625""x10.25"").

You could argue that the basest human impulse is to make order from chaos - to scry meaning from the overload of aimless noise that surrounds us - and Tarot is one way millions of people do this, through the clear, resonant medium of words and pictures.
