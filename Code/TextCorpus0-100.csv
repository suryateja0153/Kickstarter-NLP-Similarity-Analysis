https://www.kickstarter.com/projects/921574158/500mics-distribution?ref=discovery_category_newest,921574158/500mics-distribution," Many independent albums all lack the same basic elemental necessities when it comes to the success of the project. The one key element that commercially signed artists have over indie music artists, besides a professional marketing team, label, and almost limitless financial funding at their disposal, is distribution. Distribution is the act of facilitating units (CDs & Mp3s) to the proper outlets for purchasing by fans and consumers (ie Wal-mart to customers or Itunes to Ipod). With this kick starter, our goal is to focus on acquiring such assets to our promotional arsenal.  There are several reputable digital and physical distribution resources that are willing to partner with artists who are at the independent level to help them achieve worldwide exposure capabilities. Such companies include but are not limited to Spotify, Apple Music, Amazon, Google play, and Pandora. ","Risks involving a goal such as this is always timing above all. All distributors that are of a commercial outlet give grand priority to major labels over all others. Projects of our genre are often dwarfed in the wake of a major artist release. With that in mind we have strategically plotted at two to three month window after the close of the kick starter where our project will have optimum attention from our vendors. It is our goal to ensure the delivery of a premium product to you, the fans, on all platforms that are being used in your every day life.",https://www.kickstarter.com/projects/921574158/500mics-packaging-and-duplication?ref=discovery_category_newest,921574158/500mics-packaging-and-duplication,"500MICS by Independent recording artist Miztuh Chazs is finally finished! Let us rejoice. It has been a little bit over a year since recording began in a professional studio in Kansas City. That's 365 plus days of travel, almost a thousand hours of studio time, beat production, mixing and mastering, official music videos, photo shoots, album cover design, and additional promotional events. Needless to say it has been very productive. And also a very pretty penny LOL. All of the cost have left the album budget all but tapped out.All that is left is the packaging and duplication for this album to be released to the public. Unfortunately with being independent there is not a record label to extent the appropriate funds towards the final phase of the project. That is where WE the fans come in!!! Let US the fans become the driving force of the final phase by becoming official sponsors. An array of sponsor tiers have been set aside to show his overwhelming gratitude towards each and every one who sponsors this project. Thank you for your time and support.","Risks involving a goal such as this is always timing above all.

Monster movies in particular have always fascinated me. Over the course of the last five years I have been working with the delightfully talented actress Sarah Frisby. A lot of our work together is available online so check it out to see what we can do with no budget. You will probably notice the footage used above in our other projects. This is because these were proof of concept pieces to determine wether our idea was doable with our current skill set.Click for youtubey goodness!Spores has been a project we have wanted to do for a long time. The script was written, locations were scouted. Effects, makeup, and monster designs were started but we soon realized to make this the best we possibly can and have a real chance at making it into the festival circuit we needed more than our usual budget of nothing and some fake blood. We have already been able to buy a nice camera, sound and lighting equipment, as well as some decent steady camera rigs, so that drives our budget down considerably but the more funding we can get the better we can make this film. Including better locations, effects, and equipment.As a backer you are not only supporting this project but supporting us as an independent filmmaking team. You are saying that youbelievein us and our ability to bring to life something truly fun and frightening. That's not something we aim to take lightly or forget. We would love to be able to keep in touch and update you on our progress toward our goal of doing big budget features in the future. Hopefully we can do something special for our first backers who have kept in touch when that time comes.For now though as a special treat to our backers we are going to make a second short afterward very similar in tone to Spores but in a more outdoor environment. I don'twant to spoil too much of the plot of either of them so that's all I will say. We will be updating this page hopefully frequently.","As with any project there are risks, potential delays, and challenges. Spores will be made regardless of if we get the backing or not. It just won't be quite as polished as we would like it to be.",https://www.kickstarter.com/projects/1117100067/one-freaking-dollar-the-movie?ref=discovery_category_newest,1117100067/one-freaking-dollar-the-movie,"What can you do with a single dollar?

We are not just crowdfunding this film, we are crowdsourcing it. Meaning every backer gets to have a say in the finished product. So what do you want to see on the screen. Chip in a dollar and tell us!Think of this film as a social experiment of sorts. What would a collective group of people want to see if they had control of their entertainment directly.

Perhaps you want to be involved in the casting process? We'll set up an exclusive area on the website for you to watch audition tapes and provide feedback on who you'd like to see in the film. Maybe you just want to add time to the films length or be featured as a wacky crew title. Crew titles will be added as others are taken so there should be plenty of those to go around. Check out the add ons for those that want to bundle up and do multiple things. All backers will get a special thanks on the website wall of fame.*A note on the Help Cast the Film add on.

Everything must be in good taste and not demean or discriminate against any person or group of people. All submitted materials must also be wholly original and not infringe on the copyrights of any third party. All submissions must be approved by our staff.",The film is funded as of backer #1. As this is an experimental film the amount we end up with at the end of the day is the movie you all choose to make. There may be delays or production mishaps but we are used to these sort of things and can work around them very well.

I also have some FREE MUSIC available.As a DJ, I collect music that I deem useful: well-produced grooves that guarantee dancing. As a music fanatic, I collect music that I enjoy listening to. The problem is that a lot of modern electronic music doesn't belong in both these categories; they've become mutually exclusive. Fie! 'Tis an unweeded garden!Now — don't get me wrong — there's tons of great, artful electronic music that can move you (dozens and dozens of artists come to mind). I plan to add my music to this pool, and get it out there. Help me leak my tasteful and nuanced dance music out into the world, providing electronic music fans with music that makes them dance and think at the same time (funky jams: guaranteed!).The great thing about making electronic music is that you don't have to pay for studio time — as long as you've got the software and the gear, you can do it at home. So most of my tracks are close to finished, ready to be mastered.I'm using Ableton Live 8 on my Mac to produce the music, and local, Austin-based services for everything else. :)The money will go to paying for professional mastering/mix-down services and CD duplication, done right here in Austin, TX (yay local businesses!). The leftover cash will be used for distribution and shipping costs, and paying an artist for the posters and cover art (also a local!).Because I don't need any money for making the music, the cost for this album is relatively low (some albums on Kickstarter require $10,000 or more). I've priced the project so that the amount raised scales with the amount of CDs I can produce — this ensures everyone who pre-orders ($10 or more) covers the average cost of one CD.All prices on the right include shipping, but I appreciate a couple extra dollars from international pledgers! (It really helps me out.)When you get to the $50+ pledge levels, you can choose between an electronic song or an acoustic song written for you. I'm open to requests (for example, ""Hey Steven I know you don't play violin but I will pledge $30 if you attempt to play Flight of the Bumblebee""). If you pledge above $500, I will make you both songs. Because you're awesome!""Enceladus's"" might look incorrect but it actually isn't! Enceladus is a singular noun. :)Um, that's all I got! Now it's your turn: pledge and let's make this album happen!

The theme is what I would call the essence of ""god"". I am currently organizing and editing notes that I've written over the years on different subjects, all of which pertain to my philosophy, and the sum of which can be construed as my spirituality, into a small book. Although aspects have been inspired by some, it is not derived from any one specific religion or culture. It comes straight from me, and my life experiences. When I am done editing, I'll type out the files, convert it to a PDF, and then send it to you via email for a $1 contribution. I should be done as early as November, but no later than January of next year.With this book, I hope to accomplish one thing above all else, the redefining of the term spirituality. People often put too much significance on the ""spirit"" part of the word, but not so much on what it means to have one.Here is an excerpt from my book,""What does it mean to have a soul? It's everything that makes you selfless, and everything in you that promotes the well being of others. It doesn't have to a be that real, lucid, intangible entity we often see in movies or read about in ghost stories for us to have a discussion on it. Regardless of the many different specific semantic beliefs of the worlds' populace, it exists within us and it's innate. And that's precisely why I would like to hijack the term, so that we may someday be able to discuss it in a worldwide open forum without these artificial religious and cultural philosophical barriers.""

I AM going to ""eat the moose"". I will be leaving from Pennsylvania, and moving (forever) to Alaska - land of the ummmm, what...?!? I don't even know, clueless. BUT - I would like to fund a fun-filled website of my discoveries.Moving this far is a HUGE process/ effort, so I figured maybe I could raise some extra money to share my eating/ tasting adventures and experiences along the way. I will share all my new food experiences along the way (as I am your typically your picky beef and chicken eater). Looking ahead, I am actually afraid of what I might find on my plate!I have researched our move thoroughly, and it was an incredibly time consuming and tedious task. I am looking to make a video blog/ webpage for others who are also thinking about, or looking to make a similar move. Since it was such a chore for me to gather the information, I was hoping I could simplify the process for others. I am looking to purchase decent equipment that would be needed (a good camera, video camera, etc.), and costs for the start-up of this project (purchasing website, etc). I think it would be better to have more than a just a Facebook page filled with this information, and with grainy videos and pictures from my phone to inform others of what this process entails. The journey is more than 4,000 miles, so I would like others to be able to have others see every aspect of what we go through (in order to decide whether, or not this would be something they would want to do). An odd idea, perhaps, but I am sure that we were not the only people/ family looking to compile helpful information on such a move. I just figured that if I raised some extra money, it would be helpful to others to be able to find everything in one place. Our move is already costing us enough, so I cannot afford to start up a project like this without help.This will be a whole new world for us in so many aspects, so I am hoping it will be a fun-filled, incredible journey. I am looking forward to the trip, and was hoping others might be interested in seeing the efforts, trials, and tribulations along the way (in case they decide on doing something similar). If it is funded, that would be wonderful. If not, I suppose I can be found on Facebook if anyone is looking for information.This is not just me, but is also my husband, and three children (ages 12, 10, and 2). Sounds like fun, right? Yeah, right. Granted, my husband will eat ANYTHING - so he is on the safe side. I am actually looking forward to having HIM eat moose balls! It is the rest of us that will have the crazy, oddball meals to deal with. Imagine trying to have 3 picky kids eating some of these things too...?I would imagine though, it could be fun to watch from the aspect of the ""outsider looking in"" perspective, which is why I have decided to come here, to KICKSTARTER to offer my experiences (both good and bad). I will be creating a webpage (hopefully) to start documenting everything (and anyone who knows me knows that i mean E V E R Y T H I N G). I am expecting this to fall somewhere along the lines of a ""made for TV"" drama, reality, soap opera?!?!I will send the link to anyone who donates anything once started up (if not funded, I will ""friend you"" on Facebook once our trip starts, so you can view our journey there). Either way, I promise to keep it interesting, fun, and informative for anyone interested in seeing my life go up and out like this (someone who is usually prepared, precise, and is afraid of change).I will be taking/ sharing pictures and videos of everything from boxing up my house, all the way through to arriving at my destination (and beyond - said in the Buzz Lightyear tone). There will be tons of pics and videos of everything on the actual website, the Facebook entries would be limited. Like I mentioned previously, I am looking to make this as informative as possible if I can get it funded!To anyone that is looking at this, I have never eaten moose (or elk, bison, caribou, etc) - how about you? yeah, this will definitely be one for the books. Why not come along for the ride?","I am not expecting any setbacks. Should anything come up - it will only delay my project for a short time.

There will be details of what they see, what they feel, people they meet,and any resolve they might need along the way.The book would be much easier to produce if we had the funds to get it ""in the works"".We are also interested in publishing a second book based on their ""new start"". This would include the trials and tribulations of a new school, making new friends, learning how to function in a whole new environment, maintaining past/ long-distance relationships with friends and family, etc. Should this project work for them, we will also work on the second book as they realize their accomplishments and failures...A creative project indeed, especially for two young, anxious girls! I am just uncertain of the costs to get it off the ground, and would like assistance from anyone who might be interested in helping to do so. My girls are waiting to get started with recording their journey, even if there aren't others interested in taking it with them.Any donations are greatly appreciated, and will be put to good use to get this project ""kickstart""ed!! We would love the opportunity to be able to help any other young child facing the same situation, especially when the experiences are coming from other children (in their own words, through their own pictures, etc). For a child, I feel the words and pictures of other children are taken more to heart than the advice given from parents and adults.I feel this could assist other children with many issues, and is a great project to fund! I guess we will have to just wait and see where this one goes!","The only risks are the funds that would be required to have the book professionally put together, published, and printed.If the funds are not donated, I will put the book together myself and see where we can go with it. I feel this is an excellent project, and provides a wonderful opportunity to two girls who are looking to get started in art/ writing careers!"

Please post your favorite party activity, decoration, or idea on my comment page with a $1 + donation. Your comments and contribution is highly appreciated!I, Joe Rivas, a person with cerebral palsy, have been a Pink Floyd fan for most of my life.  In 1994, Pink Floyd toured the United States with two concerts in Dallas, Texas.  I, with the help of other resources, was scheduled to meet band members David Gilmour, Richard Wright, and Nick Mason.  Due to bad weather conditions and high traffic in the area, I arrived at Texas Stadium about ten minutes too late.  In addition to missing my dream, I was unintentionally left at the stadium in the pouring rain and cold temperatures.  I was later picked up by another friend at 1:00am.  The event left me heart-broken, depressed, and extremely cold.  I later recovered, but I still carry a hope that one day David Gilmour and/or Roger Waters will come to visit me or ask me to visit them.This is why I would like to make a Pink Floyd Pig Pinata with glowing eyes.  Pink Floyd is well-known for their floating pigs during concerts.  I love pigs, and I would like to make the pig from the ""Animals"" CD into a paper machae pig.  I can share my pinata with others.  I do not know if I will ever meet the band members of Pink Floyd.  I have made several other attempts to meet Roger Waters without success.  My pig pinata will be to show others my constant commitment to the band.  Remember from the song the ""Hey You"" from the CD The Wall, ""Together we stand, divided we fall!""Needed items to complete the projectNewspaper and cardboardFlour and water1 high quality balloonPaints and brushesSpecial lights for the eyesI have made pinatas before, so I know the needed item to make it. Making pinatas is fun for everyone. Pinatas are not just for birthday parties, but they are good venting out frustrations. You can use pinatas for room decorations. I enjoy Pink Floyd music, so having a floating pig with glowing eyes above my bed would be awesome. I can even video some of the art project and take pictures of my progress. I think everyone should make a pinata once in their life-time. It's fun and messy.Project Update #1I made $10.00 over the weekend.  Come one backers, you going to potato salad man win?  Let's see if someone can pledge $15.00.  I might have to upgrade my flour brand.  The flour brand determines how hard the shell will be. For a pledge of $50.00, I will make two pinata with glowing eye!!!!!!!","I may not make a proper pinata with the glowing light.  The balloon could pop during the process.  I may need some additional art supplies.  I might fail at the first attempt, but I can always start over.",https://www.kickstarter.com/projects/jo1/the-ellen-degeneres-christmas-card?ref=discovery_category_newest,jo1/the-ellen-degeneres-christmas-card,"I would like to make Ellen Degeneres a very special Christmas card.

https://www.kickstarter.com/projects/hasenfang/hasenfang-winter-walk-with-me?ref=discovery_category_newest,hasenfang/hasenfang-winter-walk-with-me,"Well, where to start? I have been writing lyrics since the late eighties and have been recording albums for over twenty years now. I have formed or co-founded various bands, such as Trembling, TR0LL, Stars & Moons Pillow and Nana's Favorite Gin, as well as my own solo music, Hasenfang. I have also collaborated with many other bands which I would rather not list off at this present time, seeing that I might forget a few and anger them.For the two decades I have made albums (of which there are over twenty), I always had always lived by two simple rules:1.) Never sell any of our (or my) albums. Just give them away.2.) Never play live, even if asked to do so (i.e.; open for another band).Those rules were based on the mentality I had, to see just how far ""underground"" we could go and still get recognition. During that time, depending on which band(s), we have had radio air-time and even had some songs played at clubs. Even to this day, the name TR0LL is still being used at our old school, where it originated from, in relation to a particular person. Twenty years and still kicking. I would say after all this time, to still be noted for our music, even by not selling one album or playing live to a crowd, we have fulfilled that mission. Now, for the first time, I am looking forward to recording and producing and album which is of high quality and one I can finally market. I have come to kickstarter to promote this undertaking and ask for your help. Back in the day, we always provided our own funds to buy instruments, mixers, recording devices and materials to make our own music. Thousands and thousands of hard earned dollars were spent to make tapes or CD's to pass out, free of charge to anyone even slightly interested. But these days, now that I am married and main breadwinner for my wife, it is hard to come by the cash I need to get this album underway, especially when trying to make it of good quality sound and production.So, here we are...from starting of Christmas week till one week before my birthday in February, I will be kickstarting this project. This is the first time I have ever asked for help when pressing a release, so believe me when I say I feel a bit awkward doing it in this fashion...and will feel even more awkward when actually selling the album. However, I would really like to see if I can pull such a thing off. After twenty years, I feel it is about time to try and I deeply appreciate anyone who helps, heck, to simply wish me luck, even if it is just an encouraging remark with no accompanied funds, I'll be grateful for that. I know in this day and age, extra cash is hard to come by, which is why I am trying to produce this at the lowest price possible and still have a good sound come from it. The album will be entitled Winter Walk With Me and is a follow up to my last album, Liaisons (released New Year's Eve 2008). Usually, my albums are ""themed"", however, this one was a bit hard to nail down. The title itself is loosely tied to my joy of seeing the return of Twin Peaks coming back for a third season (a mockery title of the film title Fire Walk With Me). Sadly, the only song which seems to have a David Lynch / Angelo Badalamenti style to it is the last track, Lust & The Douglas Fir. So, straying a bit from that, I have always loved the 80's New Wave / Synth-pop style. I can say this album will very Depeche Mode in essence, as well as having a hint of Darkwave genre, chirpy Steampunk and a trippy Ween flavor (for those who know those bands). I'm trying to incorporate sounds which impressed me as a teen, during the late 80's and early 90's.One thing I am doing new for the first time, is using a pinch-pull, drag-n-drop format of various music generator applications, such as Musicshake and Magix Music Maker. I always use to be hands on with my synth music, even playing the rapid arpeggio with my fingers. But, I wanted to see how well this style of music-making fitted with my lyrical sense, as well as over-dub my own sounds into the mix, to make a unique electronic experience. So far, it is coming along good. As of right now, the album has a track list of 17 songs and will be nearly 80 minutes in length. Depending on how much over the goal we go, I might end up making a couple CD singles and even a double LP vinyl release (please see below for ""Over-Funding Rewards""). Perhaps even put out a maxi-single CD for a song before the official album release. I am posting up the minimum amount it will take to mix and manufacture this item, as well as list the minimum amount for funding packages. However, if we exceed the goal, and depending on how much extra we raise for the project, the packages will increase in what you get. I am going to try and put every penny into something which can be handed out to ALL fund amounts, if we exceed the goal. Hopefully, with your help we can pull this off, to make a wonderful product which you can enjoy...as well as one I can finally achieve. Thank you.~Michael Hasenfang~SAMPLE TRACKS~Here are some track samples so far. Mind you, the songs have no vocals laid yet, nor are they finalized in mixing or mastered. This is just to give you all an idea on the progression of the sound. I will update this section, as the songs become more finished.~COMPLETE ALBUM TRACK LIST~~T-SHIRT PLEDGE~For all ordering, here is a picture of what the T-Shirt looks like:NOTE: Be aware that the $15 T-SHIRT ONLY Pledge is NOT part of any Over-Funding Rewards or the Blizzard Goal Upgrade...it is just for the shirt, nothing else. Since Diskmakers does not do shirts anymore, I must order them made through CustomInk. Doing this makes the album and shirt two separate products, which will be under the same kickstarter. However, for all who Pledge $25 or more, if we reach the Blizzard Goal, I will tack in from the extra funding, that everyone gets a shirt added into their Reward Packages. Anyone who does end up with a shirt, regardless of pledge, please be sure to respond with the size you would like (YXS-3XL). ~OVER-FUNDING REWARDS~Here is the happy upgrade part. For those who have generously given to this project, any extra funds would not go wasted. I plan to upgrade what those who pledge get, if we reach certain amounts. Here is a chart explain the main basis for each increase...*Just so there is no confusion, the prices listed above are ""over the goal"". So, $1500 + $2000 = $3500 for the first Over-Funding Reward, if that makes sense. So, for the 200 vinyl release, $1500 + $8500 = $10,000. Blizzard Goal (listed below) is the total funding amount of this project, minus The T-shirt Pledge, which is a total of $18,000.So, what do these upgrades entail? Simply put, upgrades in Rewards are as follows, depending on how much is raised:$5 Pledge = A CDBaby Digital Download Card release on the main album and any/all singles released.$10 Pledge = Any/all upgrades on the hard copy of the album (digipak, panel, etc.) and a hard copy of all singles released.$25 Pledge = Same as the $10 Pledge....X2, as well as a CDBaby Digital Dowload Card for the album and single(s) released.$50 Pledge = Same as the $25, but you will also receive an album poster, ""thank you"" album credentials and a copy of the double vinyl release, if we actually managed to get up to $7K.SMALL ADDED BONUS: Please observe, as an added extra-extra bonus, if we by chance do indeed reach the $8500 mark, I will personally front, from my own pocket, as part of the reward; a postcard photo and an album sticker/CDBaby Digital Download card into the packages of ALL who pledged (INCLUDING TO THE $1.00 & $15 T-SHIRT PLEDGE), with free S&H! So, for instance, if you Pledged $5, you now get TWO CDBaby Digital Download Cards (one that has a full-sized album sticker attached) and a postcard photo. The rest follows suit. Make sense? Let's see if we can pull this off. Also note that the T-Shirt Pledge in not added into these bonuses, as it is just for the shirt, nothing more. The Early Bird Pledge will be counted as a $50 Pledge, when it comes to any Over-Funding Rewards, so grab them while you can, case it is a TON of stuff for a cheap price!Which leads me to...~THE BLIZZARD GOAL~As you might have noticed, I have limited amounts to all my Pledge funding. There is a reason for this. To make sure that I use practically 100% of all funds given to me for the production of this album, I have decided to create one final Reward, entitled The Blizzard Goal. This reward will ONLY be given out if we reach the near-top goal of the kickstarter funding cost, which is $18,000 (of the $19500 max: excluding the $15 T-Shirt Only Pledge). Upon doing so, here is what will happen...I say $18000, instead of the full $19500 max amount of Pledges, cause of adding in various site and sales taxes, S&H costs, copyrighting, etc. For $18000, we can make an insanely great product for all to enjoy. From smallest goal to largest, I will do all I can to make a great product come forth from this project. I cannot thank you enough to see this finally come to light. Your contribution has helped wonderfully in releasing an album I have put off for far too long. Let it be known, logically, that the Rewards which move down a notch does NOT include the Executive Producer Pledge. There is only one Pledge for that and does not notch down into the $50 pledge category. Just putting that out there before people start asking silly questions...THE FINAL BONUS: Once we reach $18,000, I will remove the Pledge Backer Limits and we'll see how far we can take this puppy. Most likely, with more pressed disks and vinyl.","My only two challenges I have at the moment:1. Time2. MoneyWorking a 72-100 hour weekly shift, studying for my insurance license and being main breadwinner to the wife and I, it is hard to find time to record, write, mix and whatnot. But, I will try to squeeze in, the best I ca, my pressing this by the end of winter, at the very least. Apart from those two issues, nothing really comes to mind. When I desire to create a project, I tend to do my best to get it out when I say it is going to be released. Still, life does indeed get in the way, but we'll see what we can do.",https://www.kickstarter.com/projects/hasenfang/winter-walk-with-me-hasenfang-album?ref=discovery_category_newest,hasenfang/winter-walk-with-me-hasenfang-album,"Greetings to all,I will make this description shorter than my original campaign. I have achieved reaching the goal, for my seventh solo album, entitled Winter Walk With Me. It is an 18 song, 80 minute Electronic/Synthpop album. Yeah, I filled it to the brim! The original project can be viewed here: https://www.indiegogo.com/projects/hasenfang-winter-walk-with-me/x/9913506NOTE: Before indiegogo, I tried a kickstarter for this project, but then realized, through intense research, that I could get the album finished for $1000 LESS. So, I dropped that project and moved ahead with the cheaper version.As of this date, the music is finished, the first round of stickers and tee sorts have been ordered. All I need to do now is lay the vocals over the finished music, send it off to be finalized in the mastering process, then simply print the album and send it off to you. Again, all funding I needed for this project has been fulfilled. The reason I am posting this up again, is to fill the space in between now and waiting for the album to be released. Since I finished the project on indiegogo, I thought I would also post up a campaign, here on kickstarter, for anyone who has missed the first funding goal.So, in short, my album funding is done. Most of the rewards have been printed and sent to me (or are in the process of finalization). I am merely posting up a new campaign here, for those who wish to be on the bandwagon and purchase some items, before they are up on bandcamp, at a much higher price. The funding here is going to give you a discount, as I will have some extras to pass out at a cheaper rate. The tee shirts will be available ONLY through this and the previous indiegogo campaign. Once they are gone, they are gone forever. So snag one while you can.As a promise to show that I have finished quite a bit, you can also download WHITEOUT (the instrumental -no vocals version- to Winter Walk With Me) for FREE on my bandcamp site, as well as all my previous albums: https://hasenfang.bandcamp.com/Once the hard copy of this album is released, WHITEOUT will be taken down. So, again, get it while you can.As for rewards, this album has reached its project goal. From indiegogo, we have reached one of our stretch goals, which will be included on this kickstarter; an upgrade to digipak from jewel case. The album will also have a 8-page foldout of lyrics (something not mentioned in the indiegogo campaign, but will be available to all). Because most of the quotes for the album have already been negotiated through the manufacturer, any stretch goals made would have to be above $800. Once we reach $800, I will start adding in stretch goals for us to enjoy. Otherwise, this is primarily just an extended run of the already funded project to my album. If you would like a copy NOW is the last chance to get it at such a great price. Looking forward to seeing you at the end of this run.Many thanks,~Michael HasenfangP.S. For those who have not caught on, ""Coming this Winter"" in the video, is a state of mind. I do realize that here in the U.S., July is not winter. ;)LISTEN TO WHITEOUT [Winter Walk With Me - Instrumental] & DOWNLOAD FOR FREE!","To this date, no risks or challenges await ahead. The album is on its way to being done and all of the other rewards (tee/stickers) have been ordered and are ready to ship. The ONLY problem we have been having, was trying to find time to lay the vocals. I work between 72-100 hours a week and that time conflicts with my engineer's time off to record tracks. So, it has been and on-&-off struggle trying to find time to get it finished up. But, even setting that aside, we are still on track for a June/July release. Everything else is all ready to go. Apart from any delays in mastering through Channel Fuse Media, it are on schedule. I will inform all of you, if there are any delays. Until then, we're solid!"

Every person who donates will get a digital download of it and it will be on the site for all to see.  Tier 2- Motion Comic If we pass our first goal and raise US$3,000 (AU$4,040), we can turn that comic into motion. This means it will have voice actors, some music and some basic movements but it will not have the frame by frame actions or lip movements of an animationTier 3- Animation Should we get the support we need of US$7,000 (AU$9,430) we can make Episode 3 into a full on animation.

https://www.kickstarter.com/projects/projecttrinity/the-perjurer-ova?ref=discovery_category_newest,projecttrinity/the-perjurer-ova,"  The original Perjurer series premiered on Youtube in 2010, and became both the first project from the team and its first finished series. Its central theme revolved around people called Perjurers breaking the intimate trust of people close to them, sacrificing the lives of others in order to extend their own shortened life spans. Spoilers: People died.  It's been over two years since the series concluded, and we're ready to revisit the project with more experience, a bigger staff, and a new direction for the tale--one we decided would be best done in glorious 3D.  What We Need and Why on Earth We Need It:  What may come as a surprise to many is just how costly art is! It takes tons of time and energy for the artists on-board to create the images, voices, songs, and videos you all see and hear. $20k goes a long way in helping us make this a reality.  $11k goes towards the animation team, where we can commission modelers and animators to create new 3D models, better textures, and smoother presentation. $8k goes to the voice actors, sound effects, and equipment/software anyone would need.  And lastly, $2k was added to cover shipping fees (no matter where you live) and the fees Paypal, Amazon, and Kickstarter take out for using their services. Last thing we need is to be $2000 short! We've been scratching our brains, thinking of ways to win your hearts over so that everyone wins, and we finally came up with how to do the rewards!  Every dollar helps, and we don't mean that lightly. That's why you won't just receive a thank you and goodbye: everyone gets something!

You will also be able to watch any trailers and behind-the-scenes footage we make before everyone else! We upgrade your movie and film soundtrack to physical copies! (DVD images in ""Perks"" title banner used for demonstration only; the final product is subject to change.) You'll also be put in the special thanks segment of the ending credits. The Perjurer isn't the only story in the ProjectTrinity-verse (PTverse), and it's not quite a standalone! No matter how abstractly so, each story we create is interconnected with one another and spans across novels, games, films, shows, and radio plays. For $500, you get the physical copies of all four books to our flagship series ""This Crazy World"" and the first book of ""Mesto Accelerando"". On top of that, one of our artists will draw your character and make an exclusive CD cover featuring him or her alongside the official cast! We bring your character to life! He or she can either make a brief cameo in the actual film, or you can take the director's seat and create a 5-minute short that will go in the special features section of the DVD menu. You'll be able to direct the voice actors, composers, and modelers (within reason/budget) and create a short story of your own.","We have a very loyal staff, many of whom are from the original series. However, there is always a chance we may lose an essential artist or voice actor due to unfortunate and unforeseen circumstances. Just as we do for many other projects, we have a multi-talented team comprised of over 40 creative members. If one must pass the torch, there will be many more waiting and willing to carry it onward.     We thank you for your time and hope to hear from some of you soon! This is an ambitious and exciting time for all of us, and we can't wait to get started!",https://www.kickstarter.com/projects/projecttrinity/mesto-accelerando-disc-i?ref=discovery_category_newest,projecttrinity/mesto-accelerando-disc-i,"Welcome to Mesto Accelerando! A world primed for heartache!Jasmin, an ""Elf of the Forest,"" learns her mother, one of four rulers for the south, was killed the night prior - and crowned Jasmin successor. Now she must learn how to lead an army, get to the bottom of her mother's dubious death, and pretend she's not a seventeen year old girl having to deal with more than a few issues.Basically the preamble to any book series of its ilk, really.The meat of this tale lies heavily within its characters and lore. Between ""mana"" (magic!) being treated as just another element on the periodic table and the world playing actual music with the same subtlety and presence as the air they breathe, there is plenty to discover along with the characters.The series can't promise you hyperactive or pretentious anime characters (We don't like them.) It can't promise to hold your hands and explain everything for you (It physically cannot do this.) It can't promise you that it'll confuse strong women exclusively for ""overpowered girls who beat up on men."" In fact, I regret to inform you all that, in an effort to make sense, the series ended up embracing concepts Hollywood would instantly blacklist us for.For those still with me:What this series can promise you is that all four books have been fully written and ready to be revised and released. When you dive into this campaign, you are entitled and guaranteed to, at the very least, a digital copy of the book or one of its soundtracks. We can assure you the series, although written with simplicity in mind - will not treat its readers like fools. It has full faith that it doesn't need to spell out every foreshadow or revelation for its audience. We already know that if you're reading a mature mystery novel, you want to be treated as such.We're here to deliver that. For a free excerpt from the novel, please click one (or both!) of the links below!Excerpt I: First Chapter (.pdf)Excerpt II: ""What Makes a Fool"" Conversation (.pdf)♪The Sonatinas are the four rulers of the Southern country. Despite their important roles as lawmakers and enforcers, they also manage their entire military, dividing the burden amongst themselves.♪ Sonatina chosen, Apprentices are as their titles suggest: replacements if their corresponding Sonatina is killed or unable to perform their tasks. For example, if Kathryn were to perish, her fiance Demetre would take her place and become a King.♪ Also Sonatina chosen, Escorts are personal bodyguards for their assigned Sonatina. Although weaker than their superiors, they oft add the intimidation factor needed to minimize the level of confrontations a Sonatina would otherwise face alone.♪Scientists, accountants, counsellors, blacksmiths, summoners, and mages are just as much a foundation as the soldiers are in Accelerando. Without them, the Sonatinas' military might would be all but crippled.♪Mesto Accelerando: Disc I(Facebook Page)♪Mesto Accelerando: Disc I Soundtrack (Soundcloud Samples Below)♪This Crazy World: Disc I(Amazon Page)♪This Crazy World: Disc I Soundtrack(Amazon Page)♪This Crazy World: Disc II(Amazon Page)♪This Crazy World: Disc II Soundtrack (Unreleased)♪The money goes straight into shipping out rewards, making Mesto Accelerando II's content beefier, the staff larger, and the quality stronger than it currently is now.(Keeping the other three books in the oven allows for us to listen to feedback from the first book and address/integrate them in the next!)♪The one responsible for the dialogue, characters, concept, storyline, and music. He's also responsible for producing and directing all the offbeat stories on his main Youtube channel.♪The one responsible for saving future readers from enduring bland descriptions and unexplored lore outside of the immediate storyline. With a strong demand for imagery, she took it upon herself to fix what would have otherwise been a story you ""just read for the dialogue.""♪The one responsible for making the story readable by formatting it for traditional reading away from the computer. When she's not being overworked by John, she's voice acting in countless original productions as well as creating her own. Youtube Channel♪The girl that gave the series its visual style! The amount of art she has dedicated to the series is approaching the hundreds and definitely a show of generosity near-unheard of. Her art can be found here.♪The logos and overall 'feel' of almost everything our group does is in thanks to his efforts! The book cover could have looked like something else entirely if we didn't have him at the helm. When not being overworked, he often focuses on his secondary craft of music composition.♪The vocalist behind the track: ""Leaving Home.""Natalie is a voice actor and sound designer currently in charge of her own audio series ""The Elysium Project."" For more information on her work, Natalie's website can be found here.The vocalist behind the track ""Black and White."" This marks the very first time she has worked with us (and the only 'new' on here!) She is incredibly busy with her own animation studio, so it's a real treat she's taking time out of her schedule to work with us on this! You can check out studio page here.Beta Testers: Samantha C, Nicholas S, Jennifer M, Alys H.♪ Why Kickstarter?Though it is impossible for backers to not receive their promised rewards, the stretch goals are something Kickstarter can significantly help us monitor and achieve. ...Besides, publishing companies apparently took issue with allowing bundles for Indies like my Book+Soundtrack offer. Who knew?!♪Will this be in traditional book format?Definitely! Manga/Comic styled books are only if the campaign surpasses certain stretch goals. Otherwise, the plan is the tried-and-true method of storytelling: Words only.♪Why is there so much art for a single book?Most of the art is for a visual novel (VN) adaption being helmed by Jessica Warner while I take more of a backseat. (A project which is too far off to provide details) Since pretty much every character in the VN appears in the book series, I thought it made sense using some of the art assets here.♪Will this book be available outside of Kickstarter?After the backers receive their products through the mail, it will become available through Paypal / Amazon / Lulu. Until then, you'll have to wait.♪How is this tale ripe with ""supernatural"" mysteries?I'm an avid fan of stories with an ""active"" mystery helping mature smaller ones that may or may not replace the former once it's been solved. The supernatural element in the series encourages readers to take a more unorthodox approach in solving some of the latter riddles the story offers.♪*How ""anime"" is this story?Some say I am a cynical critic if they ever saw one. That doesn't mean I annihilated the silly speeches, the overreactions, heartless objectifying, or took anime logic out back and put it down. Unrelated, the entire series is lacking all of these things.♪Why the anime inspired art style?Sticking to one type of story or artstyle bores me to tears. I need variety in all my creative endeavors. My last book series featured much more realistically drawn characters, but the writing is much less mature than Mesto Accelerando's (because of both tone and experience.)♪What helped inspire the creation of this series?Primarily music. Hitoshi Sakimoto, Yoko Kanno, and Michiru Oshima were all foundations in creating the atmosphere of Accelerando. Lore and story wise, Final Fantasy XII, Berserk, and the original Drakengard definitely gave the series it's unusual edge.♪Why not release all four books now?Although we put the series through the ringer to make sure the narrative was a coherent, enjoyably miserable ride, there's always a chance new fans may beget new concerns we didn't foresee. And any concern with weight ought to be addressed in future installments.♪I'm noticing a lot of female characters.You legitimately do not know the half of them.♪How many of them are there? And how many are important?The overwhelming majority of the cast are girls and ladies. And as I'm a pretty firm believer in unbiased domino effects, I try to make sure pretty much all of them are essential to the story's overall quality.♪Don't you think thedisproportionateamount of women is a little...unbalanced?Tell me all about disproportionate.♪What of the men?!The men in Mesto Accelerando make for excellent supporting characters. I think you'll like them.♪If you make your stretch goals, you'll be needing a larger staff. Will you be hiring?!As I must! Because I have more faith in eggs becoming demonic giraffes before they hatch into natural, beautiful chicks, I won't be counting them prior to hatching. But if said stretch goals are met, I'll definitely be using the funds to hire artists/animators/ect. I'm sure you asked to give samples and possible quotes, so do hold off on them until this campaign ends.♪Does this book have an official Facebook page?Yes! Here she is! We even have an official forum of sorts! You can explore that here.","The book could open up and eat itself, devouring both its existence and the author. That's always a problem. To combat this, I have sent copies of the entire series to the main staff so that they may carry on my hopes and dreams until they regret having anything to do with me in the first place.They were also informed to zip the files up so they can avoid a similar fate."

This project is for a CD of 15 original songs by 15 different North Louisiana based artists/bands. This is the association's second CD of original material. As NoLaMA is not a profit driven entity, we plan to offer the CDs to our fans and potential fans at no cost. The benefits to the local community are endless. Artists/bands benefit because it allows us to reach a wider audience than if we sold the CDs. It broadens artist's/band's fan bases. This also allows artists/bands who are entering the recording phase of their career but lack the finances to record a full CD, to get a song to potential fans. Artists/bands can use the CD to help them get bookings as well. Club owners and other venues benefit as fans and potential fans visit their establishments to see bands that include a song on the CD. The CDs offer great publicity opportunities for fairs and festivals. Music stores in the area benefit as they can have something cool to give customers who make a purchase at a set amount. For example, the music store can have a sign on the CDs that informs the customer that it's free with a $20 purchase.Adding a Song to the CD: Artists/bands who donate a song to the CD receive no money for their contribution but receive free advertising on the NoLaMA website. The artists/bands keep all licensing to their music. Song additions are limited to 15 and are accepted in the order they are received if the fit the guidelines. There are only a few rules that North Louisiana artists/bands must abide by to add a song to the CD: 1. Only one song per artist/band can be submitted. 2. Songs must be studio-quality. 3. Songs must be originals. No cover songs accepted. 4. Songs must be radio-friendly. We want radio stations to play songs from the CD. No explicit lyrics. 5. Song length must be within reason. (generally 3 to 5 minutes in length).    About NoLaMA: In February, 2012, Brad Dison founded NoLaMA on Facebook as a way to link musicians in the area. Membership and all resources pertaining to the group are and will always remain free to any local musician or anyone with a skill set that can help local musicians. The group quickly grew beyond expectations and now has over 800 members. Since then, we have designed a website that has many resources to help local artists/bands and those looking to book live music such as listings of bands based on genre, a place for them to sell their music, listings of clubs, venues, and festivals that hire live bands, musicians who offer music lessons, videos of local artists/bands performing, and much more. Take a look at the North Louisiana Musicians Association website here. NoLaMA's only source of funding is from T-Shirt, Volume 1 CD, and coffee mug sales. NoLaMA promotes musicians in every way possible. Take a look at the video promotion for artists/bands on Volume 1.  We want you to be a part of our association. NoLaMA CD Volume 2 can be beneficial in many ways but it can only happen with your help.

My goal is to complete my debut album. I set my goal extremely low because I'm determined to complete my CD. That being said, the more backing I get, the sooner I can complete my project. I write, play all of the instruments, and provide all of the vocals on my songs.  I also made a video for ""Louisiana Sweat"" for youtube which has been viewed by my fans in multiple countries.  My original music is a mixture of rock, blues, and Louisiana roots music.  Visit my website at www.BradDisonBand.com.  ""Louisiana Sweat"" is receiving airplay and many of my fans are requesting a CD of my music.  I've written and have demos of the rest of the songs on the album but lack sufficient funds to pay the expensive production fees.  Two of my songs, ""Louisiana Sweat,"" and ""Bump in the Road,"" are complete and are available to preview and download on iTunes, Amazon.com, and CD Baby. I'm determined to complete this album and welcome you to my project. Together, we can complete this project. You can even be in one of my videos.

https://www.kickstarter.com/projects/flaviobassi/aeromouse-the-click-free-controller?ref=discovery_category_newest,flaviobassi/aeromouse-the-click-free-controller,"Hi,my name is Flavio Bassi and here is my current work, AeroMouse.It's simple but innovative, so it requires some explanation about, and so in the following there is its complete story: the initial problem, the research to solve it, the present working version, the future which will be possible with your participation in the project. AeroMouse is currently working on Windows platform. I hope to port it to Mac, Linux and other systems if the project will have success.If something is not clear, if you have any question, idea or suggestion, please tell me.Thank you for reading!Flavio°°°°°°°°°°°°°°°°°°°°°°°°°°°°°°°°°°°°°°°°°1 - INTRODUCING AEROMOUSE AeroMouse is a new control system for computers which works without click. The use of AeroMouse is a continuous wave: no click means no fire command, no hard stop; the movement is smooth and gentle. In fact, using AeroMouse, the fingers are free: they have no button to press, so they can stay anywhere they feel good  during the movement.The freedom of the fingers allows you to move the hand naturally, changing unlimited positions and also stretching when you like.2 - THE PROBLEMIf you use the computer for a long time using a mouse (or a trackball), at a certain point you will probably note some stress in the hand which carries the controller. At that point, if you proceed to work with the same habit, the stress will probably increase. Until you must stop for a while because of a terrible, often sudden, pain in that hand. Now, the question is: why does the mouse produce that problem in the hand? Would it be possible to invent a new, more comfortable, control system?.3 - THE RESEARCH Day by day, I found the time to analyze the problem. I experimented the tecnology and the ergonomycs of the standard mouse and of other unusual types of command. Like a standard trackball, fixed on the desktop;an old style, glorious, arcade joystick; a new finger trackball... which, in 5 minutes, blocked my fingers for pain... And an answer arrived: probably the 'bug' in the mouse family design is concentrated there, in the CLICK section.In fact, it's the click that blocks the fingers of your hand in a fixed, unnatural position. The hand can move almost freely, but the fingers can't. They must always obey to the same commands, UP and DOWN, PRESS and RELEASE, CLICK and DOUBLE CLICK. The fingers do always the same work for all the time, but our body is built to be free!So, I needed to build a new control system forgetting the click command.And so AeroMouse was born: the new system which controls the computer with motion only. Absolutely click-free..4 - AEROMOUSE v1: WAVE PIONEER The first version of AeroMouse, ""Wave Pioneer"", is here; ready to use.I work always with it for my ordinary tasks... without AeroMouse I feel that something is missing. Now: Wave Pioneer works quite well, but it needs a fine tuning (to avoid a few cases of confusion) and a graphic improvement (currently the aesthetic is a little elementary). So it needs time and effort to build a second, refined version. And here, it would be very important your participation!5 - FUTURE OF AEROMOUSELet's build together the new AeroMouse!------------------------------- ","The product is ready: AeroMouse v1 (Wave Pioneer) is finished, I'm using it on a Windows 7 pc. So, no challenge here.At the end of the crowdfunding period, I'll have to:1 - open the AeroMouse website, including the Community forum where users and developers can discuss; 2 - distribute the AeroMouse v1 software to the backers;3 - work on the next AeroMouse v2, hopefully together with the Community, refining few things in the working mode and improving the graphics;4 - distribute the AeroMouse v2 to the backers.The point 1 is basic and immediate.For the point 2, I would like to prepare a SaaS system; this could take a couple of months. I have to say, it could be a challenge. If severe obstacles will come out, I'll move to the easier, traditional, download distribution.The 3 has no practical difficulties, it's nothing more than a tuning that needs only time. The longer time, the better result. I think to work another couple of months.The 4 will use the same distributing way already created previously, so it will be immediate.A final note about the Associate Edition Card: integrating AeroMouse in common sw/hw systems should be easy, but in certain cases it could be impossible to do. In these cases the Backer will have the choice of: - converting the Associate Edition Card in other AeroMouse Cards of the same total value;- obtaining a full refund.",https://www.kickstarter.com/projects/flaviobassi/aeromouse-v2-1st-non-clicking-mouse?ref=discovery_category_newest,flaviobassi/aeromouse-v2-1st-non-clicking-mouse,"AeroMouse is the first system in the world which transforms any standard mouse, trackball, trackpad or similar control in a new non-clicking and non-tapping device. It's a software that manages your hardware pointing device modifying its working way to a new motion-only environment.ADVANTAGE The main advantage is a new freedom for the hand: its fingers have no more fixed operations to do on the buttons or on the pad as it happened before, because button clicks and pad taps are now useless.Every command is given by motion. So you can take your usual control device moving the fingers and the hand in any position; this variety of free positions makes the hand  relaxed and your work more comfortable.TRY BY YOURSELF NOW! You can try now: move your mouse forgetting the existence of buttons. You have only a whole, compact body to control. Where do your fingers go? BASIC PHILOSOPHY The basis of AeroMouse theory is the Wave environment, introduced in the v1: in this environment the control way is a continuous, rounded move-wait-move, like a wave, instead of the standard, sharpened, move-click.NEW IN THE v2 The v2 has a new refined graphic interface, less invasive, and a new timing of the move-wait-move technics, now more efficient and able to control practically any common task like internet browsing, word processing, software developing, graphic design, photo editing, video editing, etc.You can find some real-time video sample of tasks controlled by AeroMouse in the gallery.This is my favourite vision: v1 created the waves; v2 adds a surfboard, to move through the waves with efficiency and fun :)WHY FUND IT?AeroMouse v2 is a radically new system that could change computer interactions. The product is ready, and at this stage it needs funds to organize a marketing campaign, making it be known around. Also, user feedbacks are always very appreciated to develop the next versions. Any amount of funds and number of participants will be useful, because also a little step is always a step towards the future.So if you......want to try an innovative way to work at computer, never seen beforeor......like to actively participate in informatic developmentor......look for a more comfortable way to use computer mousethen you could find AeroMouse v2 interesting to fund.","AeroMouse v2 is already working and has been verified in Windows 7 and Windows 10, so I don't see risks or challenges here.I will apply the v2 on other major systems like Mac and Linux in the next months, but I can't guarantee about them for now.Anyway, in any case: if you will back the project, try AeroMouse in a month and be not satisfied for any reason please tell me: I will refund you the money I received."

Each book is a softcover, black and white interior with a beautiful color exterior, and is around 150-200 pages. The books all include comics originally published on adrastuscomic.com, as well as bonus content, sketches, concept art, and more not found anywhere online!This is the story of Sarah Bryant, a pretty typical young woman who likes to race motorcycles, fix cars, and collect tabloid articles about the supposed giant robot that has been hidden on her parent's ranch since the 1970's. One day, she is out racing her motorcycle when suddenly three men in suits show up and start shooting lasers at her! That's when she discovers that Adrastus, the giant alien robot from the planet Ankali, is real! Now Sarah, with the help of her government-issued bodyguard secret agent Michael Baxter, must learn to pilot Adrastus against the evil forces of the Varugo. Along the way, she learns about her own strength, and about the power of family.This story is my modern love letter to the 70's and 80's giant robot genre of anime. It uses many tropes popular in the mecha genre (such as Calling Your Attack), but puts a parody twist on them when they're looked at through the eyes of a more modern audience. Though much of the influence comes from the mecha (giant robot) genre, it is also a story about family, friendship, and humanity. Most of my regular readers online are not hard-core fans of the mecha genre, but they find Adrastus' characters lovable and the story engaging.I've been working on Adrastus for about 7 years now, and publishing it to the web for around 5 years. Previously I published Book One and Book Two on my own. Stuff happened last year and Book Three didn't come out on time. Now though I'm ready to get it printed and out in to the hands of my readers!Book 3 will contain around 150-200 black and white pages of content. The majority of those pages will be Chapters 9-12 of the Adrastus comic. Between chapters, and in the back of the book, will be bonus sketches, development art, and more that is not available on the Adrastus web-site. In addition, the back of the book will have an extra 20-25 page comic story, written by Kurt Sasso of TGT Media and drawn by Liz Staley (me!).So what's the bonus story about?This story will be all new and will focus on a different angle of the Adrastus world. While Sarah, Michael, and Sector Seven are busy dealing with the huge Varugo invasion force, who's watching out for the little invasions? The radioactive hamsters from Nadiavittor who dig up gardens and eat all the vegetables? The joy-riding teenager aliens from Yerkes who make crop circles in their stolen saucers? Adrastus: ROGUES (working title) will answer just that question. It's ""Supernatural"" meets giant robots and aliens as brothers Sean and Danny Browning travel the country in their vintage muscle car, LUCY, and watch the local tabloids for the tales of the weird. Development art is already in progress for the two main characters and I'm going to start working on pages soon!About half of the money from this goal is going to go to printing books and getting them shipped to me from the printer. Another 10% is the shipping from me to you, the backers! Around 10% is going to buy shipping supplies like boxes and envelopes to protect these delightful books as they journey to you. I've allocated 15% for miscellaneous fees, such as Kickstarter fees and credit card processing fees. And 15% of the budget is allocated toward paying my awesome colorist, who has worked very hard on Chapter 15 and Chapter 16 for me!PDF Files: Strictly digital with your comics these days? We've got you covered. You can get one PDF or a PDF bundle in most reward tiers.Physical Copies of Books: This is what this Kickstarter is all about, getting these pages to print! The lower physical book reward tier will get you a copy of book three (great for those who already have books one and two!)Inked Sketch inside of book (Artist's Edition)- Want the inside of your book personalized? This is available as a $35 tier for just Book Three, or as an add-on if you're getting more than one book. Check the A La Carte section for pricing.Original Artwork: Want something a little bigger? Higher reward tiers include an 11x17 Pencil drawing commission. This will be done on Bristol board and limited to two characters, please. Absolutely no: pornography, excessive gore. Subjects I will draw: human characters, furries/anthro, chibi characters, robots. If you want a portrait done of a real person it will be done in a stylized manner- either comic or chibi, your choice.Sarah and Michael plushies: KICKSTARTER EXCLUSIVE! For this campaign I've made three sets of Sarah and Michael plushies! These 12-inch-plus dolls are handmade, with handpainted faces, hand sewn clothing, and hand crafted hair. Michael includes removable sunglasses made with a double layer of craft foam and elastic. These are the only Adrastus plushies in existence and very well may be the only ones that ever get made. Each one has a unique facial expression and is one of a kind. I've put many hours of love and work in to these little guys and would love to see them find new homes among Adrastus fans!There are only THREE sets of plushies available. Each $350 reward tier comes with one set of plushies. The first backer to back at this tier will get the first pick of one Sarah and one Michael plushie they wish to have. The second backer at this level will have a choice of the remaining expressions, and the third backer will get the two that remain. Each set consists of ONE Sarah and ONE Michael (sorry, you can't have two Michaels).Absolutely! All books will come signed by me automatically. Here's some a la carte options for you to create your own custom bundle or add sketches inside your books!Then we'll have a party! Yay!No, seriously, we have some stretch goals planned to get backers more awesome stuff if we go over the initial goal. Check out the stretch goals below for what could be unlocked!Digital Wallpapers are going to be commissioned from a couple of artists- no previews yet unfortunately!

I have not had any issues like this with CreateSpace before, but there's a first time for everything! Backers will be notified of any delays as soon as I know of them, but I am anticipating a smooth order from the printer.Though I have successfully done shipping multiple orders of items before, this will be the most fulfillment I've had to do all at one time. I'm coming up with a plan already though to get orders packed and shipped as quickly as possible though once the books arrive at my door, and I have friends who have agreed to help.",https://www.kickstarter.com/projects/154975183/the-ultimate-adrastus-collection?ref=discovery_category_newest,154975183/the-ultimate-adrastus-collection,"First Stretch Goal - UNLOCKED!! Scripts for chapters 8-17 will be included in the bundleSecond Stretch Goal - LOCKED! Did you know that back in 2013 the incredible Kurt Sasso wrote a script for a bonus comic that was supposed to be in Book 2? At $250 this comic, ""Adrastus: Rogue"", script and updated concept art will be included in the bundle.Adrastus has been a comic on the internet since April of 2010, and telling the story of a young woman who discovers that she must take up the family tradition of piloting a giantrobot and protecting the world from an alien invasion. The comic is a love letter to 70's and 80's giant robots, told through the lens of a modern story and with a woman piloting the titular robot. Over the past 8 years, I have produced over 520 comic pages and covers, three printed book collections, and dozens of other illustrations, sketches, and promotional images. Recently I have decided to take Adrastus in a new direction and tell the story in prose instead of as a comic. I feel that this is a better form for the story because of some of the more complex story elements.Because of this new direction for the story, I wanted to make a collection of comic pages and other things for the readers of the comic that have been with me for years. And so the Ultimate Adrastus Collection was born! This collection brings together jpg files of every comic page, PDFs of all three of the physical book collections (and their bonus content), concept art, bonus art, character bios, sketches, and an all-new mini-comic that was supposed to be part of Book 2 but never made it. That comic has been updated with new art and writing, and has not been seen (even in teaser screenshots) anywhere before!I started making Adrastus because I love telling stories and because I wanted to give a comic a try. I made a lot of mistakes along the way, and there are so many things I would redo if I could go back in time and change things. But I will never regret the years spent telling this story and drawing these characters. I learned so much about comics and about visual storytelling, and I met so many new friends along the way. This Ultimate Collection is my way of saying thank you to those who have enjoyed Adrastus in the past, while also making way for the future of this story that I love so much.So if the content in the collection is already made and ready to go, why am I having a Kickstarter? Because a Kickstarter is like a big, exciting party! Why not send the comic off with a celebration? I think after over 520 pages and eight years, we should definitely have a party!","Because this is a digital collection, everything is already done! Once the funds clear, a download link will be set to all backers."

(check out the video references, below)the tracking is the monitoring of a group of pixels in a motion picture ... it's used to anchor visual elements (in this case animation) on a clip and make it look like it is there for real on the final video.- to rent a camera with good video quality.- to rent equipment for mapping.-	to do an original soundtrack for the film.-	to make the animations.-to move around the city or the state (maybe C: )-	more money means projecting animations in other parts of the state. The state is called Michoacán… around the state there are problems; fear, poverty, marginalization. but there are beautiful places, actually there are eight towns called ""Pueblos mágicos"" or magical towns in which we can project more animations with their respective traditions and cultures. there are old buildings, pyramids, huge cathedrals, giant statues, islands, historical sites and more… On the state there are two important events, the migration of the monarch butterfly, and migration of sea turtles. every year, these species of animals come to breed to these beautiful places.IMPORTANT- This is not our work!! but we can share it with you.below are examples of Mapping and Tracking animation films, we want to mix the two techniques to make a really beautiful work.Santolo - Mapping Animation made by our friend Alejandro Garcia from Llamarada de Petate(if you do not want to see all the videos, please watch this one, it is a really cool mapping animation, we want to use some of this techniques moving around the city)https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MjCDR1FgFOIHomeless - Mapping Animation by Vjsuavehttp://vimeo.com/vjsuave/homelessMinilogue-Animals Tracking Animation by ljudbildenhttp://vimeo.com/ljudbilden/animalsCaveirao Tracking animation by Guilherme Marcondeshttp://vimeo.com/guitv/caveirao..This is all for now, We'll keep you updated about the project..","our biggest challenge is being a begginers in kickstarter.. but we have faith about this projectWhile we may face delays and setbacks, we are confident that completing our goal, everything will be fine!We are not sure about the soundtrack yet, It will be an original but typical soundtrack, that's the only we know about the soundtrack, the most important is the animation.. anyway, we are sure that it's gonna be a beautiful film :)",https://www.kickstarter.com/projects/1744874783/from-cartoon-to-reality?ref=discovery_category_newest,1744874783/from-cartoon-to-reality,"I love painting with all my heart and I want to share my paintings with the world.I want to create a realistic version of popular cartoons.

Because of advances in technology, it is now possible to do even more than that. My name is John Jenkins and my invention is called Busco Quadnary. This difference between my invention and traditional binary is that you can program in four dimensions right out of the box. This has tremendous implications for 3d graphics and gaming. Today, we use what are called Z-buffers to simulate 3 dimensions. With the use of 3d engines, games are able to deliver a quality approximation. What would make this simulation even better, however, would be if we could allow four dimensions to be built into the computer, at the machine language level. This is what I plan to do.

I wish to travel to many Ivy-League universities and speak in different venues. The search for a unified, ""theory of everything"" occupied much of Albert Einstein's life and career. In fact, he was working on such a theory while on his death bed. I discovered my theory while playing an online video game. The equation I discovered is, quite simply, zero equals one. Much shorter than even the theory of relativity: e=mc2.The video, titled Unified Tours, explains my theory, as well as what I plan to do with the money. (I lowered my funding goal because I may be able to do a single speaking engagement if I can defray certain costs).","I am not a physicist and I did not go to an Ivy League institution, so I have no exposure to the world of scientific discovery. I don't have any contacts in the field and it will be extremely difficult to get a speaking engagement at a top-tier university. But I may be able to secure enough speaking engagements outside of academia to compensate for that. In addition, my first Kickstarter ended on 4/19 without reaching its goal. I hope that my popularity increases and that people don't just get tired of me."
https://www.kickstarter.com/projects/toruslinkvolume1/torus-link?ref=discovery_category_newest,toruslinkvolume1/torus-link,"Torus Link is the parallel-stories tale of eight uncanny young adults split between two connected worlds: the real world we know and live in, and a world of complete fantasy where telepathy and magic rule. Just as their worlds have been split apart, so is Torus Link itself a comic split into two sides: Side A and Side B. Tying the two sides of the story together are the four Classical Elements Fire, Water, Earth, and Air. In Side B, the Elements are seen as deities whose ancient laws have guided all of human society for centuries......Laws which mandate a separation between the classes of people. In Side A, the Elements are the personified characters of a struggling young comic artist's imagination. Did I mention this artist has no self-confidence whatsoever?Enter grad-school illustration student Hazel Lavasani and Azalea of the Convent of Telepathy.While Hazel flies off to another continent where she believes she will find this man, Azalea prepares to learn the results of her own future placement in Society, in hopes that she will see her old telepathic friend once more. Little do either of them know that their paths and the paths of six others:A goofy photographer,a manic musician, a driven designer, a crazy roboticist, a literary soldier,and a magical princess with a VERY animated temper...Are about to collide. All for the sake of healing an ages-old, elemental rift in creativity.My goal with the funds raised from this Kickstarter is to produce the first volume of Torus Link by the end of 2016.What are Torus Link Mini Links???? Glad you asked! I'll let Sanji explain this one: Right on. Whoops, my bad. Please explain this next one Zirconia! :D...Yup! :D Sorry guys, but we are no longer doing milestone incentives as originally planned. :(That's right, Hazel. At this stage of the Kickstarter, it's all or nothing--- If I get funded, I give you the story of Torus Link as I have promised, as well as all the wonderful rewards listed for backers. Which is a pretty sweet deal in itself. :) What's more, I haven't scrapped ALL the original extra incentives, as there is still... If funds reach $35,000 or higher by the end of this Kickstarter, not only will I bring Torus Link Volume 1 to print, but I will create and share a 30 second animatic featuring a very special Secret sneak peek in the story on the Torus Link Facebook page. ***Estimated delivery date will vary: I will aim for December 2015.***","The main challenge I foresee is shipping all rewards on time, particularly to international destinations. To offset this, I have given myself hopefully long enough estimated delivery times that everyone can receive their rewards by those dates. I have also budgeted in costs to hire an external mailing company. The second challenge I foresee is maintaining my updating schedule alongside any other artistic projects I undertake not funded by this kickstarter. Torus Link remains my biggest priority. It will always come first in my list of production.In the case of any other mandatory schedule demands, I shall ALWAYS communicate these online. In addition, I am going to keep up the TL Mini Links well ahead of updating time---so in the event there should be a necessary hiatus, readers will have new updates to look forward to every week.",https://www.kickstarter.com/projects/toruslinkvolume1/torus-link-linking-up?ref=discovery_category_newest,toruslinkvolume1/torus-link-linking-up,"I want to make a video that links creative people up by showing THEIR similarities! (Which... honestly, I'd do anyway; to get a complete description of why my goal is only $10 for this, please watch my video, as well as what I ask from you to help make my creative endeavor possible. ) KEEP READING TO FIND OUT MORE!Who am I?My name is Yasmine Pirouz, and I am the crazy person who has been dedicating myself NONSTOP to making the webcomic Torus Link since April 2015--- along with helpful videos that I put onto You Tube to help others share their stories as well.Shown above here are my characters--- the main cast of Torus Link, and yours truly in the bottom middle.These guys have been with me for the better part of the past 16 years of my life, having come up with them when I was 12 years old. Their story is one that, initially, I struggled to tell.I had these characters, with each of their own desires... but I didn't know how they tied together.And as one who NEVER shared these guys' stories with anyone else around me for the longest time, I kept them all to myself.... almost giving up completely on them.It's not until I went to study at an art school in Scotland on a HUGE leap of faith, that I lived the experiences I would weave into this story----turning a tale of one into two parallel tales.By telling a story that runs in tangent, literally two sides, I realized I could tell a story that speaks to multiple viewpoints concurrently... as these characters themselves seek to unite across the sides.Complete in a setting that revolves around making art, the four elements of Water, Fire, Earth, and Air, and parallel ties that connect everyone.For the past three years since I began putting Torus Link online, I have dedicated my ALL to telling this story that I hope it can help people see how connected we all are as well--- and to help us all have the freedom to tell our own stories as we wish to.To this end, I have worked tooth and nail to receive support so that I can continue to produce Torus Link, as it is a full-time job.***Example below: one of my videos helping you share your story by sharing mine!***However, what I lack is exposure. Try as I might, I have not been able to reach a broad audience to help me sustain my efforts. As it stands though, I truly believe it is possible to link up in real life--- and that sharing these projects that I wish to use to help others can be done through community exposure.By showing parallels between different artists who share their work with me.Just like with Torus Link, where likenesses and similarities exist between people, helping them to connect and achieve their goals, I wish to show connections between artists.Wherein I invite artists of ANY creative type to give me your input on what you do, based on the following tiers (explained below)--- and I will make a video SHOWING PARALLELS I FIND BETWEEN YOU, and giving exposure as well for the creative thing you do.EXAMPLES OF PARALLELS I MAY FIND:And more.Once this Kickstarter finishes, I will gather this information from you by sending you a questionnaire via email. For higher tiers, I will request digital images and/or footage as necessary.My only restriction is that all content I receive MUST be suitable for audiences ages 12 years old and up. If I receive any content from a backer that does not meet this requirement, I will refund their backing ASAP and decline said content. FOR THIS REASON, AS WELL AS FOR TIMELY PRODUCTION, I WILL REQUIRE ALL ARTIST CONTENT TO BE SENT TO ME WITHIN 30 DAYS OF THIS KICKSTARTER'S END.And then, using whatever similarities I can find, I will connect the dots and post onto You Tube for full public exposure. Wherein of course, I FULLY encourage all backers who take part in this to share this Kickstarter with ALL their peeps, bringing in more viewers for EVERYONE, and hopefully bringing interesting connections to us all! :)All reward backers will have their names and creative-practice contact information listed in the credits in this video.In addition to all features in the Recorded Footage reward, I have included a Super Linked reward for those magnificently extra-mile fans and participants who want to have special Torus Link artwork in addition to being a part of this video: Signed limited edition copies of the Torus Link 2017 Ink Drawings book.Soft cover 8 1/2 X 11"" book includes 15 original ink conceptual drawings of Torus Link main characters and themes.If this is an above-and-beyond thing you want to do in exchange for one of my limited edition books (only 25 copies of these exist in print), signed, sealed, and delivered, I sincerely thank you.If we reach $10 by the end of this Kickstarter, I will make this video with however many backers I have, using the digital means I've currently got.If we reach $300 by the end of this Kickstarter, I will buy myself some new prescription glasses to aid my eyeballs (as I have been relying on the same ones for the past 5 years now...) and then make this video using the digital means I've got. Considering that in full seriousness, the only way I can make higher quality videos is if I can upgrade my computer, to THEN upgrade my video editing software, microphone, camera, etc. WHICH MEANS THAT If we reach $3000 by the end of this Kickstarter, I will upgrade my computer and all recording equipment to make this into the BEST HIGHLY POLISHED THING I CAN. (And will be posting updates for you along the way so you know how it's looking. :) )And if we reach $3300 by the end of this Kickstarter, I will upgrade all my aforementioned equipment, make this the best highly polished thing I can for you, keep you posted... and then go buy myself some new glasses.If you want to know how you can support Torus Link on a CONTINUAL basis past this Kickstarter, please message me and/or watch my video for a link with further information. Many thanks, Yasmine :)","Potential risks that I see with making the video: -If I receive a large amount of backers, requiring me to make more than 15 minutes of footage, I will release multiple videos, and notify all backers of an extended deadline so as to release all videos at the same time. -Whereas making a video on average takes me a week to complete, to account for a potentially large number of backers, I have given myself an estimate of using at least two months after the Kickstarter has finished (Late November 2018). If necessary, I will extend this period to three months. (Late December 2018). I have ALSO included a mandate that all backers send me their artist information within 30 days so that I can begin production in a timely manner. -To ensure that I have adequate data to list parallels, my questionnaire will ask for websites, art-related social media, and a minimum of 10-20 questions about the artists, the kind of work they make, and their backgrounds, as well as one question where they can tell me anything they'd like me to know, and/or would like to see in another artist. -To minimize technical difficulties, (PARTICULARLY if the Kickstarter does not reach enough funding for me to upgrade my equipment,) I will state what kinds of files I need from backers with their content (e.g. .doc, .jpeg, .mp4, etc.) at the end of this Kickstarter. -Regarding processing any shipments for signed Torus Link 2017 Ink Drawing Books, potential risks include damages to the books in the mail. To guard against this risk, I will use padded envelopes. The books are already printed, and I have experience mailing booklets, cards, and prints, having produced and sold my own as a self-employed artist."
https://www.kickstarter.com/projects/dinodan/triassic-park?ref=discovery_category_newest,dinodan/triassic-park,"Beautiful. Majestic. Colossal. Inspiring. These are just some of the buzzwords I googled to convey the awesomeness of dinosaurs.Everyone knows there is nothing more awe inspiring and breathtaking than dinosaurs. These gargantuan beasts roamed the land millions of years ago, spreading awesomeness to every corner of the planet. From the lumbering Stegosaurus to the mighty T Rex, these creatures ruled the world like scaly kings. As children we read books about them and played with poorly detailed plastic replicas. We dreamed of soaring like a Pterodactyl or stomping small creatures underfoot like a mighty Diplodocus. What could be better then, than a theme park filled with real life dinosaurs, cloned from genetic material and brought back to life with dark science?Unfortunately health and safety requirements prohibit us from using real cloned dinosaurs but they can't stop us using the next best thing: life size dinosaur statues! That's right, for under £10,000 we can buy a life size fibreglass replica of a T Rex from China.Now we know some of you may be worried about the authenticity of the experience. You might be asking why anyone would want to go and look at a realistic fibreglass replica of a terrifying prehistoric beast, but there's more to the experience than that! We will stand near the dinosaurs and make authentic roaring noises guaranteed to scare children and make you think you're really about to be consumed by a hungry carnivorous monster. Still not enough for you? Wait till you hear this then... If we have enough funds left over once the park is set up, we'll install flashing red LEDs in their eyes that will be sure to strike terror into the hearts of all who gaze upon them. Wow, we're feeling scared just writing this!To the people who are saying this theme park will be awful and that it's just going to be a fibreglass dinosaur in someone's garden, we say: well... yes, technically it will be, but we think you're over simplifying it a bit too much! You just have to use a bit of imagination. You can pretend you're about to be eaten alive. You can scream as you imagine that immobile dinosaur replica is actually about to sink its teeth into your soft human flesh. If you ask us, it doesn't get much more authentic than that!(Please note: there will be no vehicles allowed in the park because the noise of the engines scares the dinosaurs. We apologise for any inconvenience this may cause.)The Boring DetailsTo put things simply, I want to buy a life size replica of a T Rex and keep it in my garden. My neighbours will hate me, my wife might even leave me, but at least I'll have a T Rex. So what do you say? Will you help make one man's dream of owning a life size T Rex come true?",Apart from the obvious risks that come with owning a 14 tonne carnivore the project should be very simple. As soon as the campaign finishes I will order the T Rex and await its arrival. The rewards for the pledges will be simple to produce and ship to backers.,https://www.kickstarter.com/projects/dinodan/hide-and-seek?ref=discovery_category_newest,dinodan/hide-and-seek,"Hide And Seek.

https://www.kickstarter.com/projects/1585021231/a-truely-awesome-wordsearch-the-hardest-in-the-wor?ref=discovery_category_newest,1585021231/a-truely-awesome-wordsearch-the-hardest-in-the-wor,"This is just a good old fashioned word puzzle. The big difference between other word searches and this one is the size. Over 6500 words hidden within one HUGE A0 poster. Don't worry about having the space to hang the poster, it can be folded so that you can do a section at a time. Ideal for the office rest room etc. 2013 seems to to be the year of the wordsearch. I know of at least two others that are aiming to break the Guiness world record for the largest wordsearch. Well just into 2013, I too sent off a claim to the Guiness World Records about my wordsearch. However, I didn't start this project to break a world record - if it does, then that's a bonus - I started this project to create an extremely hard-to-do wordsearch. The hardest ever?My name is Andrew Nicholls and my day job is as a self-emplyed artist. However I also have a creative mind, and I am forever coming up with ideas, many of which are art based. The idea for the hardest wordsearch ever came about after a not-so-challenging 30 minutes of doing a regular wordsearch.This wordsearch is being created by hand, in as far as I have sorted out all the words and am currently handwriting those words into a massive grid to create the puzzle. There are NO themes, NO categories just loads of words to find. My wordsearch has, three letter words, four letter words, five letter words, seven letter words, ten letter words, twelve letter words, and sixteen letter words. 6500 plus words to find.To help you find those words and to keep track of any found, I will also produce (being written as I go along) a book of between 70 and 100 pages. This book outlines the project, a little bit of background about me, how the words are hidden and an alphabetical listing of all the words, including names of the backers that will, hopefully, make this project work come to life.The wordsearch itself. The wordsearch puzzle itself will be printed onto paper and will measure A0 in size (1189 x 840mm) in black and white. This will sent out carefully folded (much as a map is folded), unless you are opting for one of the rewards where it will be rolled and sent in a postal tube. The words are hidden as in a regular wordsearch, that is they can go upwards, backwards, diagonal, forwards etc. If you find one word a minute that would take you 6500 minutes which equals over 108 hours of word search. And as anyone who has done a word search in the past will know, once you start marking words off it can get a lot harder. All in all many many hours of word searching. Because the word search is folded, you can do a section at a time, you don't have to have the poster stuck on a wall somewhere.The image above show the prototype grid. It is really this big. With around 56000 charcters hiding 6500 words.The word book. Consisting of between 70 and 100 pages. This book will be comb bound enabling the book to be left open or folded around at a certain page. This book is A4 in size.Both of the elements, the poster and the book, will be presented within a card box. In addition, I will also be including a customised word search pen for you to use.The world record side of things. I have contacted Guiness World Records about my wordsearch and at the time of writing am still waiting to hear back. However, as I have said, I know of at least two other claims, so that could be the reason for any delay, too many attempts........ If I don't get the world record then its not the end of the world and I will continue to market the wordsearch. Remember my aim was to create the biggest and hardest wordsearch ever, if I get the record, then that is a bonus. I will then also be sending out a special certificate to everyone who helped make it happen.The future of the wordsearch project. If I reach the funding for this project then it will enable me to move the wordsearch on at a faster pace then I would if I didn't get the funding. I will be able to produce and publish the books and poster myself, and therefore be able to ensure quality. Without funding - if the project doesn't reach its target - then I will continue to push ahead with the word search it will just take a little longer.If the project is funded I will also try and create a community around the wordsearch, see who will be the first person to complete the puzzle, get early notification on other 'word' projects that I hope to do. Of course all this will be up to you, you can buy the wordsearch and just quietly get on with it, or get involved in the competition of trying to find words.My ultimate aim is to sell at least 50,000 copies of the wordsearch and book worldwide, so by backing this project you are really helping to Kickstart something quite big. This will also hopefully lead on to other great things, as I am certainly not short of ideas.Remember this is a UNIQUE project. An A0 size poster with over 6500 words hidden for you to find. (perhaps creating a world record at the same time) The only way you will be able to get hold of one of these is through me, and getting onboard at this early stage guarantees that you SAVE money.Shipping costs. Shipping outside the UK is expensive. The word search package will weigh in at something like 800grams (each boxed set) - which although doesn't sound like much costs to ship. For the rewards that offer multiple packages then obviously the weight rises, and so do the shipping costs. I have though, kept the shipping costs as affordable as I can.Why only 21 days?I'm the impatient type, I want to be doing. I also think that this length of time is long enough for people to have time and decide whether to get involved or not, and It is short enough that I wont have to wait too long before I can get this project out to you all, but long enough to get full funding.................I hope. ","Risks.The biggest risk with this project is not being able to get it finished on time in order to fulfill the promise to get the rewards out by May 2013. In total this project will take around 250-300 hours to complete and as I write this I have probably done around a quarter of that. With funding comes some certainty, and with certainty comes conviction. With your help I am 100% sure that I can get this project completed.Challenges:The challenges with this project go and in hand with the risks. The biggest challenge is in-putting all the words and producing a viable file that can be used to print out the poster. With 56,000 characters to input, the risks that I won't get it done is real. However one reason for doing this project through Kickstarter is that with people backing me I HAVE to deliver. I WANT to get this project finished, and so I make a promise that I WILL get the project completed.",https://www.kickstarter.com/projects/1585021231/project-1-your-portrait-painted-in-a-simple-and-na?ref=discovery_category_newest,1585021231/project-1-your-portrait-painted-in-a-simple-and-na,"Part two of the 50 day project is now live. Check out Primary Pet Portraits here http://www.kickstarter.com/projects/1585021231/part-2-primary-pet-portraits-your-pet-painted-ontoMy name is Andrew Nicholls and I am getting on a bit now, so to celebrate getting to the big 50 in June, I want to do 5 art projects each of 10 days duration. Ten days times 5 projects = 50 days. One day for every year that I have spent on this earth (we won't mention the time spent in another galaxy).Project # one. 50 Portraits (at least 50, and I wouldn't mind the challenge of doing more)Update: 1st April - So far I will be painting around 24 portraits, will I get to 50? Now, my day 'job' is an artist, and I have been painting since I was old enough to hold a brush. I generally create miniature paintings for dolls house collectors, and have been doing this for the last ten years or so (check out my website), however I happen to also like doing portraits. I have done a number of 'proper' pastel portraits in the past, but have always admired the simplicity and naivety of a childs portrait painting. The art world can at times get a bit 'stuffy' so this project aims to recreate that simplicity (although I have to resist the temptation to 'correct' the painting, and get 'things right') However as can be seen from the picture below, I can't quite bring myself to strip away all those years of painting experience.The portrait will be painted onto heavy weight water-colour paper using acrylic paints and will then be mounted (matted), and given some backing card and so will be ready to frame when you receive it. The frame required will be a 16 x 12 inch frame. this is a standard size frame so you should be able to find a frame readily in many retail outlets, or of course you can take it to a picture framer. The portrait will be done from a photo that you will supply at the end of the project.Despite the challenge of painting 'like a child', when I am clearly not, I am prepared and ready to create at least 50 (that number again) portraits for this wonderfully creative project (although in truth, any number will be great). Ideal as a fun gift for someone or a different style of staff pictures for the office wall, go for the family package and with matching frames the portraits would look awesome.Additional reward for every backer, 'pop art' style poster. See update #4 for deatils.NEW REWARD. Double trouble Plus+. You and someone else in the same picture, or why not have your pet painted alongside your portrait. This picture will be slightly larger to accomodate both portraits, but will still be a standard frame size. Anyone who has already pledged for the DOUBLE TROUBLE and wants to have the two portraits in one picture can just let me know when the project finishes.Now why only 10 days? Right, well I have a number of projects that I want to do and I don't want to hang about. So 10 days sounds about right, most projects seem to have a burst of pledges at the beginning and then again at the end, so my thinking is that if the beginning and the end aren't too far apart, then pledges should be consistant over the time the project is live. I did flirt with the idea of 50 projects at 50, but this is probably over the top, but five projects each 10 days duration seems do-able.Please only pledge if you want to get involved with this project and are happy with the style of the portrait you will receive.This is project one. At the moment the other projects will be something along these lines......Project two - 50 paintings. (this has now changed from what it was previously) I will be offering 50 of my original paintings, measuring 7 x 5 inches. These paintings will be offered with a mount (matt) and ready to frame. Why 50? well one for every year I have been around....Project three - Not sure at the moment, perhaps a poster of some sort .......... limited to just 50?Project four - Animal portraits. I will be looking for at least 50 animals who want their portraits painted. These can be pets, or just your favourite animal, everyone can get involvedProject five - A book that tells the story of the previous four projects, with words and pictures. I will also include a short biography of my life, how I got into painting, what sort of painting I like etc. etc.And this is how I want to celebrate my 50 years.But this will only happen if the first project gets funded. Have a bit of fun and get involved NOW.STRETCH GOAL #1Due to all the support I have had with this project so far (only day 2 at the time of writing) I feel that I can offer some extra rewards if the project reaches a certain level. The first stretch goal is when funding reaches £500. Everybody who has pledged will receive an additional reward. The portraits that I paint will be scanned and that image used to create a little printed portrait complete with printed frame. (frames style may change, indeed I have gone for a more modern looking black frame, see below) This 'framed' miniature printed portrait can then be stuck to any surface or used in conjunction with the folding card easel and displayed on a desk or other flat surface.","Risks.The main risk is that the project doesn't get funded. I have tried to reduce this risk by keeping the funding target low. (see above).Challenges.The portraits need to be painted, but as an artist I think I should be OK with this particular challenge. I have the paints, the brushes and the paper on which to paint. Of course if this project takes off and I get many many pledges, then  time may be an issue, however I still believe I can cope (for this reason I have set the reward date May 2013) which should be plenty of time to get the portraits done and sent out, even with my other commitments (and projects). Of course if I have fewer portraits to paint, they will be sent out earlier."
https://www.kickstarter.com/projects/2134752613/beautiful-birdhouses?ref=discovery_category_newest,2134752613/beautiful-birdhouses,The money raised for this project will help purchase the tools and materials to make these birdhouses. Hand cutting each of these pieces is pretty time consuming (and tiring) so I would like to use some of the money to purchase an electric miter saw. This will save me a ton of time in preparing the wood before I even get to the hard part!Here is another view of the side of the birdhouse.The front and both of the sides are hand carved with beautiful designs. Only the classiest birds will want to live here!,"my project is pretty simple in nature, relying heavily on applied skills rather than manufactured parts.  I anticipate running into very few problems.While making this house, I ran into one problem with it not weathering well outside.  I solved this problem by applying a light coat of polyurethane to the wood to help weatherproof it.Another problem I have thought of, is that from time to time, certain kinds of lumber can be hard to acquire at reasonable prices.  Fortunately, I have used my current supplier for over eight years, and have only encountered a short-term shortage once.  Just in case, I have sought out a local back-up supplier where I can hand pick through the boards in case there is a problem with my primary source.",https://www.kickstarter.com/projects/2134752613/hand-made-pens-and-pencils?ref=discovery_category_newest,2134752613/hand-made-pens-and-pencils,"I really enjoy doing woodworking as a hobby, and especially making these pens. You can see in the main photo what some of them look like. With your help, I'll be able to continue making these and spread around the end results.

They are made with Cross parts, so they write really smoothly. The pencils also work great, and it will be pretty impressive having a matching set!Since I'm exploring all kinds of finishes, species of wood, and colors, the pen you receive will be somewhat of a mystery! I'll take some feedback after the project is funded to make sure you get something you like!The main woods I will be working with are Walnut, Maple, Cherry, and Padauk. I have a few other exotic woods that I will be experimenting with also.Here is a close-up of the a green pen. This is curly maple dyed green with satin gold colored pen parts.Another picture of a matching pen and pencil set! These are polished stainless steel with padauk wood.","Since I've made a few of these already, I have most of the obstacles figured out.  I've already learned that some woods are easier to turn than others, some grains only cut in certain directions.  Because this project isn't creating one certain product, if one pen doesn't work, I'll try something else.In short, I don't anticipate any obstacles I haven't already overcome."

My Kickstarter project is very simple and consists of two phases and two products.1. I love cartoons, not just watching them but drawing them too and i love to turn my friends and celebrities into cartoons, what i would like to try and do is turn as many members of the kickstarter community into cartoons too, starting with you! all you have to do is make a pledge of your choice and wait to receive a information pack from me which will ask you to submit a photo of yourself and a few other details such as what you would like to be wearing in your cartoon portrait etc. I will then begin to turn you into a cartoon, by first hand sketching a number of ideas on paper, once i have generated a sketch that i think best resembles yourself i will computer illustrate the sketch until it looks something like the samples on this page. You will receive a computer file and a hard copy of the image.. what you choose to do with it is entirely up to you, many of my friends have printed their portraits onto t-shirts, mugs, bumper stickers and all sorts of other things...2. Phase two of the project will start once i have completed each individual portrait (expected to be completed by March 2013 however this depends entirely on how many people pledge) ... Phase two will feature every character i have drawn for this project and will consist of all of you lovely kick starter 'pledgers' who will be crammed into a 'Wheres Waldo/Wally' type scene and printed onto a poster. If your not sure what What 'Wheres Waldo/Wally' is then give it a google but basically its a book that i grew up reading/scanning which consists of overcrowded illustrations featuring hundreds of people and you have to try and hunt down one particular character and a few other bits and bobs (example below) These posters will be posted to you (once completed) for you to hang in your office, studio etc.Thank you for taking time to visit my project and a even bigger thank you if you have made a pledge. I look forward to turning all of you lovely people into cartoons.","Reaching my estimated target date is a challenge i may face as this project will require a lot of labour from myself, i have however taken time off from all other projects and will be entirely focussed on the completion of this project.

Many artist, just like Bryan, have many ideas and concepts for new stories and IPs,  and they are housed in multiple different locations: Sketchbooks, Notebooks, Napkins, loose leaf paper or wherever they can write the idea down and when it comes time to gather their ideas and sketches to present their newest project everything isn't easily accessible.Now with the 30 Day Pitch Bible there is a way to organize your thoughts and ideas in one very sleek looking Sketch book.The 30 day sketch book is a 30 day planner/sketchbook that allows you to plan out your goals for the next 30 days while posing questions and areas to answer those questions with art.Having all this information in one space allows for artists to quickly and professionally show proof of concept before committing to the entire in depth project.How:The 30 day Print Bible will be printed by these guys,For those of you who know me are well aware that this company is right up my alley.

The PROJECT MANAGER planner is more than a daily, weekly, or even monthly planner. This planner is a workbook, a journal, a sketchbook, and an accountability planner that will help empower and motivate you to get all your projects done and then some. Use this planner every day to crush your deadlines and up your productivity.I know from experience that procrastination is the killer of dreams and productivity. This planner was created to help me be a more productive artist and creator. The PROJECT MANAGER took over two years to complete and presented many trials and failures along the way, but since there were no planners that met my needs, I set out to create what I was looking for! I am so proud of the hard work, blood, sweat, and tears that went into creating the PROJECT MANAGER planner, and am so excited to be able to share it with everyone here on Kickstarter.Thank you all so very much for all the support you have shown me and the PROJECT MANAGER. It's time to seize the day, get to work, be creative, and get your projects done!-Bryan Tillman, Founder, Kaiser Studio ProductionsSet the tone by designing the first page how you see fit, and by setting five goals that you want to accomplish by the end of the month. Once you have done that, create a list of the supplies needed, any tutorials that will help you accomplish these goals, and any relevant events you need or would like to attend during the month.One of the most common things that you will find in planners are the monthly calendars, but what you normally won't see is TWO monthly calendars per month. The PROJECT MANAGER provides you with a calendar for everyday life and one for your social media production. Now there is no excuse as to why you aren't producing content for social media.The next section that is unique to the PROJECT MANAGER is the monthly project accountability section. Within these two pages are many checks and balances to ensure that you will be able to complete the main project that you are working on. Not only does this section have a tracker, but the month is broken into weeks and individual days for you to plan out tasks. Complete your tasks on a weekly basis and assign yourself some rewards!No accountability spread would be complete without some reflection questions and this spread is no different. This will enable you to assess where adjustments are needed to ensure that you crush your next project.The weekly section enables you to incrementally reflect on your accomplishments and provides a great place to assign smaller projects that help complete the larger projects you have planned.Being able to visually track things like health, reading, drawing, exercising, relationships, or anything else you might think of, is a great way to keep tabs on areas that may need improvement. This single daily tracker allows you to create and track up to three umbrella topics and five sub-sections under each umbrella.The daily section of the PROJECT MANAGER is the meat and potatoes of this planner. This two-page spread for each day of the month is stuffed with a multitude of sections to keep you on task and to supercharge your productivity. Here is everything that is stuffed into these two pages:When one has made such an effort to boost their productivity, they must to be willing to look back on their successes and where they need improvement; that is exactly where the MONTHLY SUMMARY comes into play. This section allows you to reflect on the goals you set out to accomplish, your social media standings, highlights, and distractions, in order to make next month even better.As creatives, content creators, and project completers, we are always collecting business cards from the people we meet and there is nothing worse than forgetting why you have or who gave you a card. This section is at the end of every month and allows you to jot down notes so that you will never forget why you actually have the card.That's great! There is a notes section at the end of the planner that is dedicated to notes, ideas, journaling, story writing, brainstorming and anything that would require lined pages.That too is equally great! There is a section after the notes section that is a dedicated sketchbook area. Nothing but open pages so that you can doodle, design, plan, brainstorm, draw, and anything else that might require blank pages.As a professor of the arts, I am always telling my students to stay on task, that they should be working more and that, yes, they do have enough time to complete their projects. But they weren't the only reason why I created this planner. To be honest it was for me! I WAS notorious about procrastinating when it came to doing projects and it was my wife who suggested using a planner.The only problem was that there just wasn't anything out there that worked for me. So, I started on my journey to make something that would. I spent many months drawing layouts in my sketchbooks, using different sizes and even switching to a traveler's notebook. I realized, however, that I was just recreating planners that already existed and knew that these would not meet my needs.I discovered that what I REALLY needed was a planner that would force me to look at my progress every day. A planner that would enable me to keep track of productivity AND accountability. This planner has upped my productivity, my creativity and my motivation and I hope that, by sharing this with the world, it too will help others do the same.The PROJECT MANAGER planner is already created and ready to go. I have already ordered copies of the planner from an amazing North American printer and couldn't be happier with the results.So, when it comes to fulfillment and shipping there shouldn't be any problems with the December delivery date. The only issue that might arise is quality control. I am a stickler for good quality so rest assured that only the best will be shipped to you.",.
https://www.kickstarter.com/projects/haynes/social-network-for-sharing-and-discovering-website?ref=discovery_category_newest,haynes/social-network-for-sharing-and-discovering-website,"My mission is to create a website where users can share other websites with people. Think of it as a social network exclusively for websites. Users will be able to share, comment, rate, etc websites with the world. The problem with sites like digg, stumbleupon, facebook (and the list goes on) is they are made to share all types of media. It wasn't until recently, I discovered sites like this one (kickstarter.com). I wondered how has this been here for so long and I just found it. With the number of sites growing on my ""where have you been all my life"" list (including quirky.com,thingiverse.com, wantist.com) I decided something must be done.The final product will be a website that is free to join and start posting immediately. Your account will show the sites that you have added, your favorite sites as well as a general activity feed showing comments, votes, etc. With this type of interface, it will be easy to showcase your online obsessions. Other users can view your profile, which will generally cause the amazing process of discovery. I've found that once I find a person that seems interesting online (this may sound creepy), exploring their various online profiles reveals a number of websites that I will most likely enjoy. My attempt with this new website is to shortcut that process into a sexy streamlined network. In addition to discovering larger sites, this will also give the little startup websites at least some chance out there. From there if the users like the site the higher votes will keep them in a 'hot' or 'trending' category which will increase their exposure. Websites will also be sorted by theme (such as technology, design, foodie, etc).The money will be used to develop this vision. Specifically covering the development, hosting, web design, plugins, etc. I am confident that the funding will cover these costs.",,https://www.kickstarter.com/projects/haynes/logo-switch-its-time-to-rethink-your-logo-brand?ref=discovery_category_newest,haynes/logo-switch-its-time-to-rethink-your-logo-brand,"Don't believe me?

I have been designing just about anything you can think of for over 10 years. After completing 100's of design projects, I continue to see great websites, companies, products...with thoughtless branding. Although, I won't be able to save them all...I would like to try to do what I can...starting here on KickStarter. I'm in the business of making people look good. I hope that you will consider this an opportunity to switch your logo with LogoSwitch.My idea is to create 50 unique and professionally designed logos in 50 days (or less). The attempt is to be sure each logo has a day of full attention. We want to be sure that the brands we help build all have a unique voice. One day will allow enough time to evolve into the logo that willinevitablyset your business/product/band apart from the masses. In addition, each of the logos created, will be archived on our website in a special '50/50 Project' category.All of our backers will receive a professionally designed logo that will be placed on our website LogoSwitch.com. The logo will be linkable to a URL of your choice. The larger the project gets, the more logos created. These can be used for just about anything you can think of (A website, company, band, name, product, idea and the list goes on). For a small investment, you will know that you have helped me create a great project. In addition, you have a permanent place on our new website.

You do not have to accept a reward. Your pledge just needs to be $20 or greater. At the end of the Kickstarter, we will ask you for the name you would like to include in the extra episode, so it doesn't have to be your name if you are pledging on behalf of someone else. If you pledge at the $120 level or higher, then along with your doubled rewards, you will also get to put in a second name. If you don't have any friends, we can put your name in twice.The working title for the new episode is ""The Shareholder's Brawl."" This episode will recap what amounts to an all-out fight between a group of Kakos Industries shareholders. Your name will be mentioned at least once, and probably in reference to some outlandish, perhaps cartoonish act of violence. If you're uncomfortable with that sort of thing, send us a message and we can talk.And now back to your regularly scheduled Kickstarter content.---Welcome to the Kickstarter for Kakos Industries! Do Evil Better. If you believe the cover story, Kakos Industries is a dark and satirical look at the world of business, politics, science, and even interpersonal relationships in the form of a podcast. Join us twice a month for the corporate shareholder announcements keeping you up to date with all of the recent bizarre, wacky, and unsettling developments from Kakos Industries, its client base, and its surprise guests. Divisions discussed include the Adult Entertainment Branch, the Division of Philosophical Sabotage, the Division of Propagating Propaganda, the Division of Secret Societies, the Division of Pharmaceutical Advancement, the Division of Retro Religiosity, and everyone’s favorite, the Division of Gleep Glorp. Listen in as Corin Deeth III, the young CEO of Kakos Industries, gives the announcements, and also as a revolving door of guests join the broadcast, interrupt, and occasionally declare war, broadening the ever expanding Universe of Kakos Industries. Kakos Industries is written, produced, directed, edited, and scored by Conrad Miszuk, who is also the voice of Corin Deeth.You can find Season 1 at http://www.KakosIndustries.com (Warning: NSFW language)You can find the video advertisements here. (Also NSFW language)Now to the all important question: What is the money for? Well, to put it simply, the money is for Evil.More specifically, the money is for lesser evils (fees) and Real Evil.More specifically, Real Evil is broken down into Evil Material Costs, and Real Serious Evil. The posters and T-Shirts all cost money to produce, and we want you to have the highest quality items possible. Along with the packaging and included US shipping, the material costs will account for around half of our budget. They are printed in the US by mostly willing participants, but I am told the side-effects of working with us will be long lasting and mostly negative.That’s probably still not specific enough. It is obvious to anyone with a smartphone that web design is not my forté. In addition to getting professional help with the main site, we will create a web store for items like these as well as many new items in the future. We will also be putting a sum of the money toward having a better hosting plan, which will help to spread Evil much faster.The Evil of Immense Gravitas can be further broken down into Evil Software and Production Costs (the things that make the show and the youtube videos possible and sound/look good) and True Evil. Kakos Industries is in need of some expensive software upgrades, storage solutions, and other ""legitimate business things.""True Evil should be obvious. And if it is not, then you are not meant to know. Rest easily knowing that it will not go to anything good, depending on your perspective, I guess.Why$13,264 USD? In response, we only have to ask you this: Have you not been paying attention to the numbers during the broadcasts?To summarize, the money will go to making the show sound better, it will streamline the processes of putting the show together, it will secure the data storage, it will go to making the show easier to access on the website and elsewhere, it will go to making more humorous advertisements, and it will go to making the excellent swag that you are about to order, and a store to order even more swag from in the future.Speaking of the swag, it's about time that we saw some of it.You can put The Sticker on your car, on your laptop, on your bicycle, or perhaps on a kinky friend's nipple. Kakos Industries is not about judgment.There are three T-Shirt designs. Everyone who pledges at the ""We’re-Finally-Getting-There Shareholder"" level or higher gets a T-Shirt. T-Shirts are screen printed in white ink on Gildan black blanks and are unisex sizes. You may increase your pledge for additional T-Shirts. See the pledge levels for rules.T-Shirt 1 tells us to Do Evil BetterT-Shirt 2 features the company name.T-Shirt 3 features only a larger logo.Some action shots:The standard Kakos Industries Poster (18x24"") for everyone who pledges at the ""Poster Child of a Shareholder"" level or higher:The Shareholder Certificate (8.5x11"" on parchment paper) for everyone who pledges at the ""A Real Shareholder"" level or higher:The text body of the certificate is still being worked on. With all of the blanks to fill in, no two certificates will be the same. Each will feature the signature of Corin Deeth III, a fancy embossment, some number of shares, a certificate number, and some numbers to ignore.The limited edition variant ""First Blood"" poster lets the world know you were there for us at the start. Everyone who pledges at the ""Shareholder Deluxe"" level or higher gets one!Is there something else you want? Let us know and maybe we can work it out.Please feel free to use the contact links if you have any questions or comments.It may seem like hubris to announce stretch goals before we have made The Goal, but, as we've said before, at Kakos Industries, hubris is kind of our thing.

This episode will also take place in a different time frame, and will require a new score. The additional funds will help to secure that new music. Again, this is anadditional episode, not a replacement. It will be released concurrently with one of your regularly scheduled announcements from Corin Deeth III.What's next?Push us higher and find out!","The challenges facing the Kakos Industries Season 2 Kickstarter are printing the rewards, shipping the rewards, and continuing to make great episodes of the podcast. I am new to printing posters and shirts, but I have spent the last few months refining designs, communicating with printers, and calculating costs. I even ordered a batch of T-Shirts with money out of my own pocket to make sure that they are as awesome as they need to be. For these reasons, I'm confident I can tackle any problems that arise. International shipping may be a challenge as its cost varies from country to country. Problems may arise because of this variance, but we will always work with you to get you your rewards. If you know that shipping to your country is complicated, feel free to contact us and we can look into it.In regards to challenges in making new episodes, I've been working on this project for over a year, and I am also confident I can keep that going. The additional funds and tools will hopefully make things easier.",https://www.kickstarter.com/projects/2098449300/kakos-industries-podcast-needs-your-support?ref=discovery_category_newest,2098449300/kakos-industries-podcast-needs-your-support,"Should we reach our goal all backers will be the first to receive the never before seen:Kakos Industries Division of Diversion Program 32AB-9 “Game” Experience Kakos Industries in the truest possible fashion: a choose your own adventure game written by the show’s creator Conrad Miszuk. At last you’ll be able to immerse yourself in the show’s universe as you adventure into the depths of the company that does evil better.  Imagine what you might do if you woke up one day and found yourself inside Kakos Industries… Would you escape? Explore? Look for a job? What if you found a monster?  Would you do stuff with the monster? Choose your own adventure and choose your own fate!The Kakos Industries Choose Your Own Adventure Game will be developed on the Twine platform, a text based, interactive, multimedia, storytelling engine for the web. If the stretch goal is met, the target completion date for the game would be December, 2017.ATTN: SHAREHOLDERSRE: ONE DAMN SHIRTWelcome to the Kickstarter for Kakos Industries, the company that helps its clients to Do Evil Better. We specialize in improving evil wherever it can be found.  Currently we are focused on making evil more fashionable and fashion more evil.We want to make a shirt that you will love and wear every day until the cloth has rotted off of your sunburned post-apocalyptic-desert-wandering frame and fallen into the sands behind you like the memories of what could have been. If you ever get the choice of shirt to wear on your multi-million-dollar ride into space, we want it to be a Kakos Industries shirt.  And if you ever need to rip a shirt into strips of fabric to stop all of the bleeding, we want it to be another shirt. Not our shirt. There’s got to be another one around, right?Quality evil doesn’t come cheap, and we have poured millions into the development of this perfectly evil shirt. However, the executive board diverted some of the funds earmarked for shirt development to finance a night of debauchery, and we found that we are now in the red. Rather than cover the shortfall by cutting their salaries or bonuses, the executive board unanimously voted to pass the cost onto you, the shareholders. And make no mistake, if you’re reading this page then you are a shareholder in the evil produced by Kakos Industries.So just how big is the budget shortfall? Well, about $25 should cover it.That's one damn shirt.And so we are turning to you, our Shareholders, via Kickstarter, to help us complete development of this most evil shirt. Of course we at Kakos Industries are always willing to reward evil. You have been demanding another run of T-Shirts with new designs. You have also been demanding hoodies with the Kakos Industries logo, and all manner of other merchandise. Your demands have finally been answered! We will be rewarding the Shareholders who back our Campaign with first crack at these new designs and new merchandise, as well as access to our beloved, evil classics.  In fact there are a variety of Rewards: from shirts to posters to Kakos Industries stock certificates suitable for framing, and even a learn how to podcast class with Kakos Industries' scapegoat/alleged creator Conrad Miszuk.  As a bonus, one lucky shareholder who selects a shirt as their Pledge Reward will receive a Certificate of Authenticity signed by Corin Deeth III, while the rest of you will receive the highly sought after Certificate of Inauthenticity along with your shirt, letting you know that you gave us your money for nothing (except a shirt).Still not on board with your new status as a Kakos Industries shareholder? Take a look at the T-Shirt designs and you may find that they need no explanation at all. Many of these shirts have been designed and crafted to get you the attention and laughter you deserve whether you listen to your shareholder announcements or not.So, what are you waiting for? Scroll down to see pictures of the Rewards and get coveting!Kakos Industries is one of those newfangled Audio Drama Podcasts. That is, it’s a podcast, and one scripted to give you the highest density of humor and entertainment for your time. Towards that end, Kakos Industries has consciously remained free of advertisements since its beginning, over 70 episodes ago, in 2014.  But…Podcasting isn’t cheap.The team behind Kakos Industries has selflessly given so much to produce this podcast.  But, there are ongoing costs and debts that need to be paid. Web hosting and design costs money. So does making each episode. Equipment like sound cards and microphones also cost money. On top of that, this show takes up much of the time of creator Conrad Miszuk, the voice of Kakos Industries CEO Corin Deeth III, who needs to eat, prey, and pay for occasional self-care.All of the money pledged during this Kickstarter, above the cost of Backer Rewards and Kickstarter's fees, goes directly to supporting the show that you love (or will soon love). Making humorous and high quality entertainment for our listeners is a lifelong dream of the creative team and we are all so thankful to everyone who listens.  The Kakos Industries Podcast takes the form of corporate shareholder announcements from Kakos Industries, a company specializing in helping its clients to ""Do Evil Better"". In these announcements, listeners are treated to updates on the life of Corin Deeth III, CEO and host of the announcements, updates from the many divisions of Kakos Industries on their advancements in evil, and updates on all of the strange and eerie occurrences inside of the Kakos Industries facilities. While Kakos Industries specializes in doing evil, older and less effective evils (such as sexism, racism, and other forms of bigotry) are routinely shunned, creating an open and inclusive environment for all to do evil.You can listen to Kakos Industries on iTunes, Google Play Music, or directly at KakosIndustries.com.You can also read the full transcript of each episode on the Kakos Industries web site. And you can watch Kakos Industries bonus material on the Kakos Industries YouTube Channel.We have an amazing assortment of rewards to show our love to our Backers!

Other rewards will be purchased from companies providing Backers the greatest value for their pledges.  Conrad Miszuk, creator of Kakos Industries, has been selling and shipping podcast merchandise directly for several years, so you could say we’ve gotten the hang of printing, packaging, and shipping merchandise. What we haven’t gotten the hang of is all of these time travellers from the future coming back in time to try to steal an original t-shirt from our storage facilities. We must become pretty influential in the future, like Wyld Stallyns. Barring any influx of nefarious collectors from the future, and human frailty, this should be a simple project for us to complete and fulfill."

Did this spud only sell for that much because he photographs celebrities for $500,000 sitting fees? Can you imagine invoicing a half-million dollars for a photo shoot? And wouldn't $1 million be enough for the potato photo? Did he have to collect that extra $80,000? Because (makes frowny face) ""Sorry, I just couldn't let it go for $1 million.""Phantom by Peter Lik - Sold for $6.5 millionJonathan Jones of The Guardian described it as such: ""The $6.5m canyon: it's the most expensive photograph ever – but it's like a hackneyed poster in a posh hotel."" And Peter Lik's sale has NOT been substantiated. That seems like a lot for a black and white photo, if you ask me. Does that include a mat and a frame, or is that extra? (I think Hobby Lobby is having a frame sale this week.)So, I want to REALLY sell the most expensive photograph ever – a verified sale – with a collective buyer (all of you), to claim rights as the most expensive photo ever sold, and to poke fun at the lunacy of these prices for a photograph. And to do some good work with the funds, which you'll see below.These recent sales remind me of Marcel Duchamp's Fountain, where he could make anything, including art out of a urinal, and it would sell.From The Art Story Web site: Fountain (1917) ""The most notorious of the readymades, Fountain was submitted to the 1917 Society of Independent Artists under the pseudonym R. Mutt. The initial R stood for Richard, French slang for ""moneybags"" whereas Mutt referred to JL Mott Ironworks, the New York-based company, which manufactured the porcelain urinal. After the work had been rejected by the Society on the grounds that it was immoral, critics who championed it disputed this claim, arguing that an object was invested with new significance when selected by an artist for display. Testing the limits of what constitutes a work of art, Fountain staked new grounds. What started off as an elaborate prank designed to poke fun at American avant-garde art, proved to be one of most influential artworks of the 20th century."" And also the work of Piero Manzoni.Can we make news around the world with this photo sale? And maybe get featured in Time magazine and other publications, and the photo will be seen and admired around the world. It's a happy photo, don't you think? Definitely a conversation starter! Maybe put it up on the ceiling, where you wish you had a skylight?You all will be the collective buyer – of the most expensive photograph ever sold. That should be worth a little something at cocktail parties.It's titled ""SKY BLUE SKY"". It was created on January 29, 2016, using a vintage Canon FL 55mm 1.2 lens on a Panasonic GF1 body once owned by famous photographer, Mike Johnston, of The Online Photographer. There will never be another photo exactly like it and you'll have a ""piece of sky"". You will receive the image file to print and frame (as a JPG full-resolution digital download), that you will be able to gaze at on grey and rainy days, and that will help you look forward to the next sunny day.And once all the JPGs have been delivered as rewards, the original will be offered to the Smithsonian or the Lyons History Museum (one of them should take it.) The backers will have the only other copies of the most expensive photograph ever sold.Let's have some fun and make this project soar. If I can get $1 from a whole lot of people, we can make this 'sale', and history! So, if you can, toss a buck in. Come on, you'll be able to say you bought the most expensive photo ever sold!Thank you! See my full bio for what I will do with the funds, including turning a local Colorado project, THE WISE PHOTO PROJECT, into a global project  – I photograph the elderly and print them large so that they can live on in our homes after they've passed away. I'll be able to offer sessions and photographs to people without needing a fee, if they are unable to pay. I've been a professional photographer since 1987, and some of my work can be seen at my site, KennethWajda.com.",We could end up with $6 instead of $6 million.  And that would be tragic.,https://www.kickstarter.com/projects/1123635639/pclippy-the-human-social-network-photo-book?ref=discovery_category_newest,1123635639/pclippy-the-human-social-network-photo-book,"PCLIPPY - Connecting with a simple Paper Clip! This is a book project documenting the launch of this new Human Social Network.I was out at a Chipotle restaurant, standing in line, and everyone was on their phone. I thought, wouldn't it be great if we could talk to each other in line. But who would be up for that? If only there were a ay to know that person behind you was a huge Curb Your Enthusiasm fan like you. Or into obscure cult bands. Or a Leica photographer, like I am.So I started PCLIPPY and it's free* to join the conversation. (*Practically--you do have to find a paper clip!) There's nothing to login to. No app. No forums. The conversation happens in the real world, between humans. That's why I call it The Human Social Network.This book will document folks across the U.S. and will invite photographs of people around the world to share photos of friends they've made with others via a Paper Clip. (And some of those photographs also may make it into the book.)It's kind of like Humans of New York, but the humans are all of us, and we talk to each other instead of reading about strangers online. Simple human connection, instead of being buried in our phones and Facebook feeds. And it'll help us not feel weird about talking to a stranger. (They're no stranger than we are!)Optionally, I thought it'd be cool to add a pin or sticker or something to the paper clip to let people know what our favorite thing is to talk about. It could be for a favorite TV show, interest, hobby. Really anything! You can even make your own. Or a tie pin? Or find a friend who makes jewelry to make you one. Here're a couple of mine. A couple of examples from real life that also inspired this idea:I will use the funds from Kickstarter to buy ten boxes of Paper Clips at Staples ($2.99 each):And I'll spread these 1000 paper clips to 1000 people in person and I'll photograph them and other people I meet who are wearing paper clips and talking to each other to publish in a book on the project. Thanks for coming aboard. And I hope to meet you in line somewhere!","The biggest risk is no one will want to put down their phones, and I'll have no book project.  And I'll have to put up $29 myself.   I'm hopeful that people will reach out to one another.  Perhaps younger people will be more open and less afraid to offer an open door to conversation, but I'm not sure what will happen.  We'll see."
https://www.kickstarter.com/projects/rocksetta/rover-the-shopping-drone?ref=discovery_category_newest,rocksetta/rover-the-shopping-drone,"In this Kickstarter project I will make a publicly accessible Youtube video outlining the steps for others to make their own version of my Rover the Shopping Drone. I need your funding to be able to purchase larger vehicles to make Rover more useful. Larger vehicles can have more rechargeable battery space, can have a container to put purchased items into and could be a base for more attachments, which are not a part of this project.My name is Jeremy Ellis and I am the maker of http://www.rocksetta.comand the IoT Rant athttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1ZYcCXPAMPoFor my day job I have helped people with Tech, Computer Programming and Physics issues for over 2 decades. After work, I normally solve long-term Computer Programming problems of my own choice.I often then make a Youtube video linking to an example program on Github so that other people can use my Open Source software and also so that I can forget the solution and start working on the next problem.See my videos at :https://www.youtube.com/user/keyfreemusic/videosAbout four months ago, (November 2014) I saw the Spark Core Kickstarter campaign at:https://www.kickstarter.com/projects/sparkdevices/spark-core-wi-fi-for-everything-arduino-compatibleand I was hooked. I wanted to learn everything I could about micro-controllers.So now I have started making prototypes of real objects not just computer programs. The only problem is that my techniques to solve problems often involves multiple versions since I tend to break earlier versions. With real objects this technique is getting a bit expensive. I hope that you can fund my project so that I can continue to make and share my DIY solutions.I have also found out that my experience with Technology and Physics has given me a few skills to help simplify the Internet of Things, and bring those easier techniques to you.The basic idea is to take an RC car and make it work with the Spark Core www.spark.io Then flash a program to the Spark Core that communicates with the car through a standard webpage. I then put my SIM card into an old smartphone and set the phone as a hotspot, then login to Skype and attach the phone to the car. This allows the Spark Core to have Wifi where-ever it goes and using Skype I can see where to drive the car and can communicate with my surroundings.

Can you pay online at your local Corner Store and will they load your drone? When will Walmart have a drone loading bay? Personal drones or business drones? Will you start a Shopping Drone business in your city? Will you have overhead flying Drone Support for your Rovers. Will the overhead support be powerful enough to pick up a damaged drone? As Cities enforce slower speed restrictions on drones, will one person be able to drive several drones at one time from the comfort of a main office? Once a drone has been to a store and delivered the product to a house can the commands be remembered in a file? Can that Drone then replay the file and beep at the office only when human interaction is needed such as when crossing the street? Could one person then control 10 drones at once? Can drones be equipped with collision sensors and software?Please support my Rover the Shopping Drone Project so that I can continue making Youtube videos and breaking IoT prototypes to help spur other peoples creative ideas about the Internet of Things.","1. A larger vehicle may mean higher voltages and currents. I have found a Pololu Motor Driver that can handle the higher currents, I just need to see if it works with my Spark Micro-controller. The other solution is to hack the RC circuit board, I prefer the first option but will look into the second option as a backup.2. Information time lag. Unlike RC cars, using Wifi creates a time lag. For this project I will try to minimize the time lag through polling AJAX software (I have a few ideas that I will try, such as not waiting for a reply from the server, the reply tends to double the time lag. Not waiting may actually make the software easier as I might not have to use AJAX at all). I will probably not look into using the more advanced web sockets to keep this project at the beginner level, so that other people can make their own drones. 3. Learn how to drive a Rover/Drone. I should have played more video games. I need to be able to drive this drone. It might be easier if a I put on the webpage a few buttons that help turn the drone a small amount each time you touch the button. Trying to time turning when you do not know the time lag is very difficult.",https://www.kickstarter.com/projects/rocksetta/rocksetta-neural-network-machine-learning-mp3-crea?ref=discovery_category_newest,rocksetta/rocksetta-neural-network-machine-learning-mp3-crea,"So I am not going to make a robot that can play the piano, but that does make a nice visual of what I am trying to do.I wish to make short pieces of music, based on past successful songs by entering many small snippets into a Tensorflow Recurrent Neural Network (RNN). A bit of software from Google that allows computers to learn a skill and reproduce it's own version of that skill.Imagine entering every Beatles Generation song snippet and having a computer create it's own version of Beatles style songs, lots of them! Some songs might be too close to the originals, some might be just plain really bad, but occasionally the computer might be able to produce a gem that takes you back to another time. Imagine what a musician could do with that golden rift from the past created by the future.To give a more modern example: perhaps Michael Bublé or Kate Perry would be interested in what a machine could come up with from their successes.Please make this decades long wish a reality by donating a few dollars to my project.The present problem is the song entry. Most Machine Music Learning tools uses huge datasets of thousands of midi generated multi-track files. I have not liked the quality of this approach, and prefer simple melody files. Uploading high quality melody files has been a problem. I would have to hire a musician to check the quality of the present database and to upload more choice snippets. (If anyone wants to painstakingly enter hundreds of songs snippets for free just for the love of music research, I would be very impressed)Another cost will be the development platform which is presently $19.00 USD per month. To have this site available for a few years will cost ($19.00 x 24) ~$456.00 USDMost of the difficult programming has been done over the last decade and can be viewed on the http://rocksetta.comwebsite. The Machine Learning part is reasonably new but can be viewed on various of my github sites at https://github.com/hpssjellis/char-rnn-tensorflow-music-3dprintingand several others athttps://github.com/hpssjellis?tab=repositoriesAn example machine learning music making but demo is working athttps://big-char-rnn01-rocksetta.c9users.io/rnn-both.phpA strange coincidence is, that the music notation I have developed over the last decade (http://keyfreemusic.com ) actually works very well with machine learning since every combination of characters produce sensible musical sounds. (I have developed four styles of music notation: Keyfreemusic, Music Letters, Rocksetta Notation for database entry and the best a readable diagram notation.)The final goal is to make a Web App that allows anyone to generate genre based song snippets from several datasets optimized for different song styles. This gives people a chance to experience some of the benefits of machine learning as an assistance to creativity. It is then up to musically creative people to take the song snippets and make full fledged songs.Please support this project and lets see what music we can make!","The three main risks are:1. Updates to the Google Tensorflow Machine Learning software. Sometimes updates can cause issues with the present software. A solution is to stay with an older version of Tensorflow, or update the Machine Learning code.2. Garbage in creates garbage out: The quality of the entered song snippets influences the output. Much of my costs will be to pay musicians to correct and enter high quality song melody snippets.3. Not enough songs to generate a quality output. Still working on techniques to improve the quality of the output using minimal input. A present technique is to randomize the entry of the songs several times in the dataset. Other ideas are to populate a main dataset of successful songs with the new songs to study.A challenge is to keep the song snippets short enough and as a single note melody so as to not get in trouble with the original Artists. Obviously if there are issues, those song snippets will be removed from the database.Another challenge will be to upgrade the main Adobe Flash Web App to HTML5 Web Audio for modern browsers. This is not an immediate issue and is something I will enjoy doing as time permits."

For over 100 years aircraft have been very smiler- Wing, fuselage, tailplane fin. This way of making aircraft is old and outdated and I want to show how a new twist on aircraft design makes them, not only safer, but more aerodynamic and thus greener and cheaper to fly.My End GoalOnce this project is complete I want to have a flying blended body aircraft that I can share with the world via the internet. I think this will help promote new ways of thinking and maybe one day companies will start to recognise that aircraft need to evolve.I also want to produce a plan, and I hope, a laser cut wood pack of the final model so that others modellers can share the dream.What have I done so far?For the last year I have been using CAD and CFD programs to develop my idea of a Blended body aircraft. I do not earn money (im 18 in a small town!) so it has been difficult and I am limited to free software. With your help I want to take the models from the theoretical computer and into the real world to prove the design.So far on the theoretical side I have this:Unlike conventional aircraft, this types fuselage is blended seamlessly into the wing. This means there is little interference drag. I hope to remove the fins to reduce interference drag even more, but I cannot tell if this is possible by pure computer work.Another difference blended bodies have to conventional aircraft is that the that they have a aerofoil cross section throughout. This means that every part contributes to flight instead of being dead weight.Using simple CFD I was able to analyse the flow over the aircraft and improve its shape. The programs a little bit glitchy on my laptop but it more or less shows how there is a clean reduction in pressure over the top (this pressure drop is what causes lift).Whats the plan?My plan of action is simple:1) create a small 1m span foam glider to test C/G and ""bad habits""2) Improve the glider and add a motor.3) create a built up 2m span version powered by twin EDF.4) Improve some more!ExperienceI am an experience aero modeller so I am capable of designing and building the aircraft to as low a price as possible.Thank you for your time,Michael",Since Blended Bodies are very new and untested so there is a very real threat of delays in the delivery of rewards. Dont fret though I expect problems and enjoy tackling them!,https://www.kickstarter.com/projects/471420640/im-making-a-parkjet?ref=discovery_category_newest,471420640/im-making-a-parkjet,"Well I kinda run out of money at the last hurdle.

I really appreciate your pledge.StoryOnce upon a time, a Cthulhu Devil Elebun got married to Cthulhu Sunflower and they had an adorable baby girl named Sunnypus. Sunnypus had several friends, they are Piggy Pink, Unicorn, Bunnymouse, Octoarms. She was very beautiful but always gave her parents trouble and her father had to often rescue her from the evil clutches of Franken-Bride Cthulhu and Werewolf Cthulhu. She liked to pick flowers from Mr. Elephant's house and got caught but she never apologized. After that she went to the jungle with her friends and two days didn't come back. Her parents were worried about her then found out from her friends who ran out of the jungle to Sunnypus' house told them she got caught by Franken-Bride Cthulhu and Werewolf Cthulhu. Her father had to fight with them to rescue her. After couple days she went to Elephant's garden and he was not happy at all with what she did before. She was kind of sad and walked out with her friends. At that time Elephant's son (adopted son) his name is Elepus who was very shy but very nice and they liked each other right the first time. He took her to go visit his father's garden and taught her how to take care of them. After that day she knew what she did was wrong and came to Mr. Elephant apologized and of course the apology was accepted. One day she changed her attitude and suddenly became a good girl. She didn't treat her friends Piggy Pink, Unicorn, Octoarms or little Bunnymouse poorly anymore because she fell in love with Elepus. It didn't matter that they are a different color and have different body types because they enjoyed each other's company. They completely devoted themselves to their love and eventually they started their own family just like Cthulhu Elebun and Sunflower.

In itself, this is a great purchase simply for its visual beauty, hand-crafted origins, and timeless qualities.But that's just for starters...Funds from these prints will help commission the production of a kick-ass, 3-minute film (produced alongside the Manifesto script). Upon completion in summer 2018, this is going to provide an audio-visual LoveBomb! to the web, and effectively launch a proactive world-helping mission to ignite the human spirit, and unite the human species!*The EVEN cooler part!*This print is an 'investment' for your wallet as well as your wall. Allow me to explain.Within next year's shortLoveBomb! film, premium snippets of the 'Making of...' footage (from the project video, above) will be woven throughout, as well as the finished productWood Print, itself. This will ensure the value of your Wood Print - both in status and financial worth - grows with time. The more views the film collects over the years, the more of a collectible your original print becomes!The ABC Manifesto is a simple guide to a great future. Hand-drawn wall art sharing a unique and original philosophy for life: Founded upon three root values of Adventure • Beauty • Contribution (ABC), these words positively reinforce and remind us to step into our greatness, and from there, onwards... into the world's true wonder.This is daily empowerment and lifelong balance.All-in-all, theWood PrintABCManifesto is a 5-year labor of love that takes the digital Manifesto to a whole new level. The final result makes the time and effort totally worthwhile. As soon as you unbox it, you will understand why. With no cables or computers in sight over the entire process, theWood Print has a human magic that digital print simply cannot replicate.You can literally feel the ink upon the premium quality, Italian Fabriano paper (maximum thickness).Each Manifesto print isA2 scale (841x297mm). This strikes the perfect balance between eye-catching and easy to read. All prints are Jet Black, ensuring the greatest consistency in quality of finish, and ascript that emanates outwards from the paper, further enhancing the power of the words.With each print labeled individually as part of a strict batch of #1111, and accompanied by a Certificate of Authenticity, this is a future collectible in the making.The combined effort of heart and hand make thisprinta beautiful backdrop to the day. It boasts a truly classic feel that will look great in any frame, on any wall.A deeper look at the Manifesto content and structure (3 mins):In line with the ABC Manifesto's words ('the magical art of giving & giving'), the first and last print will be gifts.* TOTAL: 1111The first print is a wedding gift to a South-African couple who resonate deeply with the ABC values.After hearing the Manifesto, Toni and Tracyincorporated the three values into their vows at their wedding, earlier this year. This was lovingly sealed by both getting 'ABC' tattoos!Prints #2 - 1110 are all priced equally at £59. This is the fairest possible price given the extent of work and skill behind each print. Allocation of prints will be determined simply by 'purchase order'; The first pledger will receive print #2, the second pledger will receive print #3, and so on, until #1110. Any prints left at the end of the campaign will be sold at £89 + postage.The final print will be a giveaway, as a means to engage public, and encourage sharing of the LoveBomb!video, when it is released in 2018.In your parcel - along with yourWood-print- will be a Certificate of Authenticity. Towards the end of the fulfillment phase, a high-definition'Making of...' film will be sent as a digital file to all pledgers.This high-definition, 2-minute film - included as adownloadreward for all pledgers - is simply the project video above, minus the closing slide.With it being a short film, pledgers can easily store it on any mobile device and have it to hand, as and when desired.For those who grab a Wood Print, you will also have a cinematic reference to the meticulous process behind your beautiful wall art (a cool conversation-starter with dinner guests!)Once the fulfillment phase is fully complete,my attention will turn to 2018, and the LoveBomb! film. Early into the New Year, a Collaboration and Contribution Invitation will be sent out.My overriding goalis to sell ALL Wood Prints during this 30-day campaign period.This will fund a focused, 6-month drive from 1 January 2018... and effectively kickstarta vast and deeply considered, world-helping mission. Pledgers will have the option for prioritized communication and collaboration over this 6-month period.This will be a refreshingly quick turnaround for a Kickstarter project. As the video shows, we are ready to print, and I am hopeful we can begin shipping a week or two after the campaign end.The ABC Wood Print makes a truly unique and special gift (for yourself or another!). If you would like it guaranteed by Christmas, please addto your pledge amount to account forEXPRESS SHIPPING.(Over to the right, and up!)This short film - planned for completion by summer 2018 - is intended to amplify the ABC Manifesto script in a manner fit for modern media. My hope is that it will provide a timeless blast of high-impact positivity to viewers, through the web.In true Kickstarter style, pledgers who help commission this will have creative contribution and collaboration opportunities within the LoveBomb! film, including but not limited to:* Remember, the more views this film collects, the more collectible yourWood Print becomes!The LoveBomb! film will be backed by a clear CALL-TO-ACTION.The development of a dynamic platform is a central part of my long-term strategy. I own IgniteUnite.com and will be channeling 25% of any profits from this Kickstarter into the seedling development of this site (among other financial areas, covered below).During the first 6-months of 2018, I will develop a foundational version of the platform (think, stunning landing page *with benefits*). This will act as a means to begin connecting those who resonate with the ABC Manifesto, it's wider message, and ambitions. More than this, it will form the early inception of a Force-For-Food Ecosystem that will sit at the intersection of 'social media'and 'social enterprise'.Financially, I will be adhering closely to the following basic principle; After all costs (including taxes, platform fees, card-handling fees, and the £15,000 above) a percentage distribution of profitswill be allocated across several strategic areas, as follows:Throughout the 6-month period, pledgers will have inside access to more detailed information relating to the above areas, via 2 x Quarterly Contributor Reports...in March and June, respectively.Alongside Daddy'ing and practicing mindful-embodiment of ABC values, campaigning and project management is something I am well-versed in.Since 2012, I have been a core part of the team at Peace One Day (POD), a campaigns-based organization that has lead the drive in global exposure of Peace Day, 21 September, from 280 million to approximately 2.2 billion over the last 5 years.During this period, a personal high was the project management of a partnership with UNICEF and various Ministries of Education. This lead to the design and distribution of an interactive, culture-sensitive Peace Education Poster to over 71,000 schools across 6 countries (DRC, Rwanda, Uganda, Kenya, Tanzania,and Burundi). This has provided millions of pupils with a gentle reminder of peacemaking, through a fun and vibrant classroom resource. As an added bonus, working with Peace One Day has solidified my confidence and ability in regards to campaigns and professional project management.This is entirely transferable to the project management of crowdfunding, and the follow-upfulfillment process :)Jakkee is the real-deal when it comes to Wood Carve Art, andI'm super grateful for his help in bringing this project to life!At the tail end of 2016 he wascommissionedby Bangkok's ultra-luxury lifestyle mall, Central Embassy, who now give away his prints as exclusive gifts to customers spending over One Million Thai baht (£23,000 / $30,000).In May of this year, his private exhibition paying tribute to the late King Bhumibol Adulyadej was a total sell-out (x81 prints and some serious spenders). The following monthhe wonChangBeer's annual, national art competition (last year he came second).Here is a print of his - available to buy via an online, fine-art store - priced at $3,200.On top of all this, over the last 12 months, Jakkee has had numerous national magazine features, two of which were cover features.Dom is an upcoming talent in the film-making industry whom I met in January this year.

I love playing my guitar and ukulele, and I also love math and science.My newly-developed interest, if you haven't guessed yet, is designing and making marvelous jewelry pieces with electronic parts. This idea came to me while I was building a robot for Tech Challenge 2017.I was working with jumper wires, and they just appealed to me as a bracelet. From there I was off to making more than jumper wire bracelets! I experimented with many other electronic components, and I also thought of adding a bit of mechanical parts.As I made a few different pieces, they turned out to be fairly attractive, and therefore sellable. My initial efforts of trying to make complicated designs ended up being very challenging, but after hours of practice, I mastered making complex and cool designs.I live in Cupertino and the bay area is full of people working in the tech industry. These jewelry designs can be worn by them or by students at school, at parties, or any other functions.Even though I am only thirteen, I keep thinking about college, and my future. I haven't decided what I want to become, but in college I do want to study either business or design. Therefore, I am doing this to add up to my portfolio.So I would be really happy if you are interested in purchasing these unique tech jewelry.By selling these jewelry pieces, I want to collect money to support Art and Technology curriculum by donating 70% of my earnings to my middle school.Although I have set campaign target of $500, I want to collect at least $3000 for my school.So,go ahead and explore the rewards and pledge as much as you wish to help me achieve my goal :)Hope you enjoy my work!!!!!!","These will be completely hand made. I will be making these during my spare time and weekends. Thats why I have kept the target low. I will be willing to make more of these if people are ready to wait for a little longer to receive these jewelry pieces.So other than that, there are no risks involved in making me achieve the goal.",https://www.kickstarter.com/projects/sajidsaiyed/techlery-tech-jewelry-for-tech-generation?ref=discovery_category_newest,sajidsaiyed/techlery-tech-jewelry-for-tech-generation,"Hello there! My name is Sheza Saiyed and I am a 14 year old teenager (this project is under adult supervision of my father who is a also a designer) who doesn't buy electronic components to place them on a circuit board, or make robots with them, but instead make jewelry! Yes, I make jewelry using all different types of electronic components such as transistors, capacitors, resistors, diodes, jumper wires, and many more!This is not my first time launching a project on Kickstarter. I had earlier launched a project in September last year, but unfortunately it wasn't successful. I have learned quite a lot from that experience and have executed my knowledge from that project into this one. Technically, I have more than a year of experience making these jewelry pieces! I have broken, fixed, and created many designs and pieces, and have definitely made progress in terms of the quality of my work. All of the designs are original and mine!If you have not heard recently, there have been some raging wildfires striking California and burning acres of land, innocent people's homes, and lives! They have ravaged the entire town of Paradise, CA and other parts of CA. The fires has affected many lives. More than 80 people have died, making this one of the deadliest fires in the history of California wildfires. I myself live in the Silicon Valley, and knowing about the damages being caused in my surroundings makes me ponder about it.I sincerely want to help my dear community. If not much, I would like to make a slight impact, or provide even the littlest of help to those who have had tragic losses.My goal is to accumulate as much money as I can by selling my jewelry, and donating 100% of the money I manage to generate to American Red Cross for the damages caused by the California wildfires.Please help me in helping all those who aren't going through the best times, and to let them know that there are people out here who care for them.Even though the goal is 50 dollars, let's not let that stop us!LET'S GET MORE!

https://www.kickstarter.com/projects/soapytuesday/unique-handmade-postcard-set?ref=discovery_category_newest,soapytuesday/unique-handmade-postcard-set,"POSTCARDS.Every postcard that you can buy in stores is almost the same. They are not unique or look very good.So i have created 3 unique designs for postcards. Are they different? Yes. Are they a bit weird? Yes. Are they unique? Definitely.I made them using old magazines, postcards and made a collage with them. The postcards will have a normal postcards size; A6 (14,8 × 10,5 cm or 5,9 x 4,3 inch). Every package will contain 6 postcards (2 of each design). And depending on the rewards you will get 6 white blank envelops with them.(Off course the watermark (Soapytuesday) will be gone)POSTERSPersonally i love getting and sending out postcards. Isn't it a nicer feeling when you get a postcard from someone instead of a message on your phone?But i know that not everyone is a big fan of postcards. Which is why i alsooffer my designs as a digital download. I had them scanned so you can print them at home on any kind of paper you want in any size. (However i do not recommend bigger then A2. I made these poster on A3 size and i don't want the quality to get bad)Why do i not make and send the posters myself? In my store i do sell some handmade posters. But i have noticed that it can be difficult to make sure these postcards get delivered without any damage. Also everyone would like a different size or likes different paper finishes. This is why i decided to offer them as a digital download. This way anyone can print them in a way they like. (personal use only)ABOUT ME.My name is Sterre. I am a 21 year old art student in the Netherlands. Ever since i was young i have always been busy with art and creating stuff. Last year i opened my own store on Etsy filled with my handmade posters, postcards and shirts. Since i opened my own store 2 years ago i noticed that i really loved having my own store. So i have expanded it since then. I now have my own online store filled with items that i love. Its not done yet and i would love to keep working on it. But its been hard to get people to notice my store since its now no longer connected to Etsy. But im hopeful and i love to keep working on it. Kickstarter is a way to show what i make to more people. The goal is not to get more people to my store. All i want is for people to like my art. This gives me so much motivation to keep creating!REWARDS.After some long thinking i have carefully made the rewards. I want to make sure that the everything is perfect. Which means i will have to go check out a few different stores, paper kinds, printing methods and more to make sure its exactly as i want it.Making these postcards is going to cost me quite some time and some money. This is why i have chosen for these specific prices and the goals for at least 500 euros. This gives me the chance to order in large quantities to keep the prices as low as possible. This will also cover the costs of printing, packaging, and leaves room for some tries and failures.If this project is successful i will start by looking for the bast quality paper. And the best place to have everything printed. I aim for a perfect quality for this project, cause im not doing this for profit. I want to deliver good products. And i will some time to figure everything out. So i aim to ship everything in June, but it might be earlier or later (even though im going to try my hardest not to be delayed)PIZZA SHIRT.This pizza shirt is designed by me. Printed on high quality 100% cotton shirts. They are unisex so anyone can wear them. Unfortunately i can only sell them in 3 sizes: Small, Medium and Large.

Cant wait to start working on more and more projects! Want to see my store and some more handmade work? You can check it out here:soapytuesday",One of the challenges for this project is going to be planning and testing. I have never worked on a project this big. But i am highly motivated to do this. Planning for this is going to be difficult. Im going to have to do a lot of testing to make sure i get the best results. Im going to have to be critical about my own work and make sure im 100% satisfied with what i deliver. Its going to be stressful and hard.

(Printing will be done on a fancy printer and a normal home printer. So don't worry you do not need a fancy printer!)So i might change some tiny details and the colours might change a bit, but the final posters will not be very different to how they look now!"

I am a new music teacher in Charlotte, NC and I am forming a steel band comprised of my elementary school students. The school has suffered a musical drought in the years prior to my arrival, as I have witnessed the surprise and fascination on fifth grade students' faces when I opened cabinets on my first day and showed them their old and dusty musical instruments. Soon, we were playing with simple rhythm sticks never seen before by many and making music together.  This sparked a fire in me. I don't want to simply teach these children. I want them to hunger for music and seek it out for themselves. The best way to make this happen is getting them in front of an audience more diverse than just their parents and perform a full fledged concert. We will strike the news next year and the students will create a story for themselves. My ultimate goalis forming a steel pans ensemble for my 4th and 5th graders which will perform in Charlotte's community.  The problem is, we do not own near enough musical instruments suitable for such a performance. Next year's fifth grade class size will be near 120 students. We own a few frame drums, two neglected violins, a set of beat up hand chimes, an assortment of boom whackers, and a personal purchase of beginner sound makers for the youngest students. I did have two incredible donations to the school within my first three months of work. A parent donated a slightly used drum kit and a staff member donated an alto saxophone. We are starting to make some headway, but not fast enough and not quite in the right direction. The best instruments for the job are Steel Pans made for young ages.  The wonderful thing about Steel Pans lie in their simplicity. I can teach the rhythms, the notes, and the technique much faster when everybody is looking at the same type of instrument and making the same motions. This is why i am hesitant to bring a full fledged band into the curriculum. With every student (remember I teach K-5) taking music only once a week, teaching woodwind, brass, and percussion skills would not be as feasible unless I could have a class dedicated to each instrument. Steel Pans are simple to understand, easy to play, and effortless to maintain.Multiple students can play on the same pan throughout the day, and there are no mouthpieces to clean or reeds to keep track of.  Best of all, Steel Pans are affordable to purchase. At under $200 per pan package (including height adjustable stand, mallets, music, and the drum itself) the Panyard Jumbie Jam Steel Pan is looking to be the best option to start with. With the help of my good connections in the Music and Arts Company,we can purchase 20 of these instruments for under $4000. If your support allows, I can also supply auxiliary instruments which will augment our performances and make them more lively. These may include djembes, congas, cajons, timbales, and upgrades to the already existing drum set. (which I will be performing alongside my students)  I have extremely high aspirations for my students and I expect nothing less to happen. It is difficult to teach music without musical equipment. I have made due this year and have seen tremendous results. The staff I work with is amazingly supportive and is thrilled to see such a drastic change in direction I am taking. I want to instill in my students a human drive, thenecessity of music in their lives. I won't step up on the advocacy pedestal, but I will say that musicians who succeed on the stage inevitably succeed in other areas of their lives as well.  I will be documenting the process all the way. I want to start this group now and keep it going for years. As time goes on, we can purchase higher quality equipment, introduce the skills to earlier grade levels, and possibly travel to perform in venues around in Charlotte!Let's make it happen!","Finding a music venue to support us may be a challenge. I have connections with the local churches, most prominently Christ Church of Charlotte. Their director is incredibly supportive and influential in the Charlotte's music scene. My school and I have several ties with the Charlotte Symphony Orchestra and I have performed with several members of the group. I am also affiliated with several musically talented school's including the University of North Carolina in Charlotte, Providence High School, and Fort Mill High School. Hopefully with these contacts I can establish a few performances and gain some traction with the professional musicians in the greater Charlotte area.      Obtaining skill level appropriate music is a small challenge. I am confident that the students will dive into the work. The real challenge will be finding the right music for each class. My goal is to have each class perform its own piece, written at their skill level. Fortunately, I am also a composer so I can make any adjustments to the music. If there are any composers who wish to compose for the group, that would be a great connection to make.     Storage space will also prove to be a challenge. Currently, I am located in one of the smallest rooms in the school. It is difficult to teach music with loud volumes without disturbing nearby classes. (Drum set day was interesting...) hopefully this will spark a much needed classroom adjustment or maybe we can simply go outside for out rehearsals. That being said, I will need to prepare a storage space for the drums when they arrive. Perhaps, if enough money is raised, we can build a storage shed on the school grounds?",https://www.kickstarter.com/projects/1412584397/elementary-music-materials?ref=discovery_category_newest,1412584397/elementary-music-materials,"My students need music materials!In short, I am an elementary school music teacher who wants his students to have the best possible early life experiences with music. We need instruments and other equipment to get out into the stage light.I am aiming to host multiple concerts throughout the year with my students.And I don't intend on them being generic choir concerts. I want percussion ensembles, drum circles, music theater, and opera reenactments. I want to create music videos with them. I want to give more than what a generic elementaryschool music curriculum offers to students these days.The first step is purchasing Vic Firth SD1 drumsticks. If we break $50, I'll start outlining a budget for everyone to see.So help me out, help me teach some incredible music! ","Minimal risks. My main concerns will come after we have acquired the drumsticks. We will then need drums to play them on.

I am designing it for use for all as a free licensed online font with ease of readability in mind.The new and enhanced Nuehaus font family will be submitted to the Google Font Library.I have completed my first initial draft of a font that I have called Neuhaus (a geometric sans serif font). I would like to continue to develop this font and build multiple weights i.e. bold, light, italic, condensed etc to create a full family typeface for professional use.Any milestones achieved ahead of schedule will in turn be delivered at authors direction ahead of schedule, with the exception of the font's public release date. September 2018End of funding period.October 20181. Finalise the regular weight of Neuhaus for the foundation of further weight developments.2. Begin development of both light and bold weights.November20181. Finalise the light and bold weights of Neuhaus for further weight developments.2. Begin development of italic and condensed weights.December 20181. Finalise the italic and condensed weights of Neuhaus.2. Revise all weights of typeface.January 20191. Release to all patrons their tier of the complete Neuhaus typeface.June 20191. Submission to Google fonts for public release.","I am dedicated to this project. I already have a first draft of the regular weight that has taken over 200+ hours. I am as excited as you are to see this project carried through to completion. The biggest challenge will be in time management, as there is a lot of hours involved in developing a full typeface set of weights. As I have already developed the regular weight it will make things easier although I still need to fix kerning, spacing and some slight amendments to a few characters.  As I have said prior though, I am dedicated to the completion of this typeface with no expense spared to produce the highest quality I possibly can.Emails will be sent to contributors whenever there is an announcement to make, so you’re always in the loop.

McKinney, CEO & Founder of Asteroid Mining Corporation.This Kickstarter fund raiser is to help us create a realistic moon/mars simulator studio with a rover that people all around the world can control in our warehouse. We will charge per minute as a fund raiser to help us grow our company. If you donate here, you will get to drive it cheaper than other people that come to our website.Eventually i want to mine the moon, mars, comets and asteroids. First, we have to get our company known around the world. It is a very small outer-space start-up company and any advertising will help get the word out. So please help us with this project, so that we can get this simulator and our company started.more details:I am wanting to create a moon/mars rover simulation studio. In this studio i will have a rover. This rover will be some type of remote control vehicle, car, truck, electric wheelchair base, or other r/c vehicle that works well. It will not be a full size rover like the ones actually on Mars but i hope from the live video camera feed on this ""rover"" it will seem real.I will let people all around the world control it from the internet if they have donated, or if they pre-pay for driving minutes. I will eventually install drills and lasers on it, and let people do ""missions."" I may program into it a delay, to simulate the 4 second round trip signal transmission time to the moon, and the 20 to 26 minute round trip signal transmission time to mars. Since many people will get bored with the long delay time, we may skip the delay until our simulator gets very realistic in the future.I think this will be very educational and inspiring for people of all ages.I'm asking for $10,000 because i already own the 50,000 sq. ft. building, i already the gymnasium, lights, digital projector, flat screen tv's, have wi-fi internet, and have some parts that it will require to build this rover. If i didn't have all of this, i would be needing over $100,000.I should be able to get this working and looking pretty good for the $10,000. I will have to hire someone, possibly from elance.com or something similar, to help with some of the networking and javascript and connecting my wi-fi and rover together along with the electronics it takes to make this work. This person will be able to create customized software to help us keep track of how long each person has been driving.Stretch goals:If we get more money than it takes to do the basic goal, then i will try to add extra cameras, controls, possibly a mechanical arm/hand, and more such as missions. I would like to incorporate Oculus rift or something similar too (depending on the funding that we get.) I don't have any set amounts for the stretch goals, or what will be done, but i will do my best to make it awesome. It will automatically cut people off when their time is up, it may keep up with a ""score"" or ""mission status"" if we can incorporate a game or mission into the program. i will also be buying a remote control toy car at first for the tests, but when it works, then i'll create or buy a more realistic rover vehicle. If we get to this point, i would like to offer some type of rewards for completed missions, or if the rover finds valuable ores, etc.Rewards:If you donate money, you will be awarded with this simulated rover driving time. The price per minute of driving the rover is $1 per minute if you only donate $1 at a time, but the larger donations get more minutes per $1 donated, and you may also receive other donator rewards. For those people that do not donate, then the price will be slightly higher per minute on our website.Our website currently goes directly to our Facebook pagehttp://www.RoverSimulator.comPlease help me with this awesome project. I will add pictures and video of the gymnasium i will be converting into a studio soon.In the past, I have converted electric wheelchairs into remote control vehicles. I took the chair off, added led lights, sirens, 2-way radios, laptop, webcam, wi-fi ability. I used a remote control airplane transmitter to control this electric wheelchair base. I put a laptop on it, and different type of wireless video and video transmitters. I used it as a security robot at my warehouse. I also made a remote control lawn mower. I'm doing almost the same thing, except it will be controlled via the internet.Thank you for reading and helping!T.J. McKinney - CEO & Founder of Asteroid Mining Corporationlike us on Facebook at http://www.AsteroidMiningCorp.comand follow us on Twitter @MineAsteroidsDrive our Rover Simulator soon and like our Rover Simulator Facebook page at:http://www.RoverSimulator.com","I just have to find someone to help make me a simple website with the live video feed on it, a way for people to log in and a way for us to keep track with how long they been driving. I will have this person program the micro controller to take the commands from the website and transmit those commands through the wifi to the r/c vehicle. I seen many people online do this before, using arduino and raspberry pi plus so this should not be a large obstacle to overcome. i may have to use this money to hire someone on elance.com or other website that can help me out. I have a lot of these parts already too, just need a little more help hooking them up and controlling them from a webpage. I can build simple html websites, but will use elance.com or some other method of getting a professional to help me control this ""rover"" over the internet. This is where some of the money is going to, in addition to buying extra parts, paying for wifi repeaters, paying utility bills for the gymnasium lighting, making the studio look realistic etc.The other challenges, would possibly be the lighting, but this is no big deal. i can either use on board led lights, turn on the big lights in the gym, or use infrared illuminator that should show up as normal light on the webcam. so this is not really a big problem.I will update the realism of the studio as the funding permits. Hopefully if this gets very viral, then i would enjoy putting this same rover simulator outside in a desert, but that will be later on after i work out all of the bugs.thanks for viewing!",https://www.kickstarter.com/projects/590961140/moon-rover-simulator-part-needed-ip-camera?ref=discovery_category_newest,590961140/moon-rover-simulator-part-needed-ip-camera,"short description:The Rover Simulator will be upgraded as i get additional funds. It will start with a basic remote control vehicle, (since you may not see the actual vehicle in the live webcam, then this will not be important at first, but later as stretch goals, i would like to add remote control led lights, arms, etc. and make it look more realistic looking, similar to one of the Mars rovers. It would alsoinclude having a professional website built, along with Iphone and/or Android app controlling if possible.By donating, you will get to drive this rover yourself and help me with this inspirational project, that will get people interested in outer space!All backers will receive recognition on my website and will also get first chance at controlling my rover in our warehouse, here in Sedalia, KY. All backers will get a discount, compared to other users on our website.Detailed description:Hi, my name is T.J. McKinney. I'm trying to build a moon rover simulator studio, with a real life ""rover"" that will be located in my warehouse in Sedalia, Kentucky USA. It will be controlled over the internet from anywhere in the world. I'm asking for a little help, and not trying to appear greedy, so i'm asking for only $50. The entire project may cost me $500 to $1000 though. I think i can make a basic rover simulator with the equipment i have, but i need this ip camera to finish the basic project.It is going to take several parts, such as a radio control vehicle, wifi repeater, lighting, paint, props, sand/dirt, software, programming, a website, and i will probably use Raspberry Pi B+ at first for the brains of this rover.I'm already in the middle of creating this project and one of the last things i need for it is anip webcamThat is what this fundraiser is for. It is for this specific part. (if i get more than $50, will be used for the other parts and to complete this project faster)I can get a brand new ip camera on eBay for approximately $50.I'm trying to build this project but due to many costs in utilities, mortage, insurance, parts, domains, advertising, websites, etc. it is hard for me to pay for the completion. With your help, i can get closer to completion.Even though this fund raiser is only asking for $50 for the ip camera, if i can get more than $50 then i can of course use it for the rest of the upgraded parts to make this rover even better. I may also have to hire someone from www.Elance.com to complete the networking & professional website, along with customized Raspberry Pi programming for me, if i can not finish it on my own.Keep up to date with my progress at my Facebook page:http://www.RoverSimulator.comand Follow me on Twitter @RoverSimulatorYou may also like my main Facebook page at:http://www.AsteroidMiningCorp.comAnd Follow me there on Twitter @MineAsteroids","The obstacles i have are:Programming the Raspberry Pi B+ to communicate properly with the radio control vehicle and the built-in web-server over the internet using it's on-board ip address but i'm pretty confident that i will have the bugs worked out soon, i'm guessing before Feb 1, 2015.Another obstacle i may have is my wi-fi range may not currently reach or be strong enough to reach the warehouse, so i can fix this by setting up a wi-fi repeater router, which i have done in the past in this area, so this should not be a problem, and should be completed also by Feb 1, 2015. Another obstacle i may have is, if this Kickstarter only reaches $50, then i will have enough money to buy the ip webcam, but i may not have the extra money to purchase all of the other supplies out-of-pocket. If this happens, then I will either start another Kickstarter to buy additional parts, and/or just invest a little each week into this project out of my own pocket, which will take longer. I still believe that Feb. 1, 2015 is a reasonable goal for me to shoot for, for all of the parts, either by this Kickstarter, another Kickstarter, or providing the funds myself.It will be completed a lot faster if i can get additional funding right now on this Kickstarter, and If i get enough, i may make MULTIPLE ROVERS so more than one person can drive them at once!Another obstacle i will have, is the warehouse will need to simulate the moon's surface, which will cost even more money, so at first it may be on a wood floor, and i will update it as the funds come available.Another obstacle could possibly be battery life. I will try to get a radio control vehicle capable of carrying a large battery to provide longer drive times, and that will provide enough energy for the camera, etc."

Imagine the tales you'll tell with your new companions at your side along the forest path.I’m RenaVarsakis, designer and owner of The Red Fox and Gown. I love to knit and havedone so for over a decade. I have been designing for the past two or threeyears, creating whimsical, original designs inspired by the world around me. Ireally enjoy seeing my designs come to life when other knitters createwonderful items. You can see a portfolio of my designs on my blog and also onRavelry and Etsy if you’re curious to see more!I have a passionfor vintage and I love animals. I thought to combine these loves into a specialhand knit pattern collection of vintage-inspired woodland animals. The book will feature aminimum of six woodland animals with removable cute clothing for boy and girl versions of each, as well as a minimum of six baby animals.There will be extra clothing patterns in the book so that you can make moreoutfits for your new friends. There will be sweet little A-line dresses and weecardigans and charming vests and tiny bowties and more. The finished animalsthat you will create are no bigger than 11” / 28cm tall, a perfect size for a smallcuddle. Unlike many toy patterns, the animals will be knit in the round. There will be minimal seaming required, primarily to finish the clothing. The book will be available as both a softcover printed version and ane-book, approximately 80-100 pages. Patterns will also be sold separately foreach girl and boy animal, with one outfit per animal.I need your helpto get this project off the ground. I’ve knit up a prototype of the very firstanimal, Bailey the Bunny, and I had so much fun designing her and the baby bunny too. I need help topurchase more materials to complete the project to design the rest of theanimals and clothes, such as yarn in a range of colours and knitting needlesand notions. I need help with the costs of having my patterns checked by atechnical editor to verify their accuracy and ease of use. The patterns will be test knit too. I also need adigital SLR camera with light box to photograph the animals for the book and I wantan entry-level model that should be able to do the job much better than myphone! I’m also hoping for help for the first printing of the book (50 copies in full colour minimum via Kickstarter - I will be personally putting another $1000 toward printing costs for additional copies)so I can qualify for the best discount. That way I can pass those savings on toyou to have an affordable book and also begin to get the book distributed toknitting shops. There's also a 5% fee from Kickstarter and a 3-5% payment processing fee. My plan is to release the finished book in October 2015.Thank you fortaking the time to read my story!

Luckily I haven’t had this problem so far and take lots of breaks and I stretch my hands and wrists. I’m also allowing lots of design time for the patterns and knitting time to produce the rewards to offset this risk. The only unforseen challenge here is if there is a large demand for the hand knit rewards I will be very busy knitting up animals!  I used to knit items to sell so I am familiar with the amount of work it involves.Another challenge is putting together a whole book. I’ve put together a knitting book before so I know what it involves and I can manage my time accordingly. I’m doing everything myself, from toy design to photography to writing and layout. The only thing that I’m not doing is the technical editing, but my experienced editor is very quick and I have used her successfully many times before for other projects.",https://www.kickstarter.com/projects/1000839012/happy-monsteropus?ref=discovery_category_newest,1000839012/happy-monsteropus,"Fun little baby monsteropus just for you, happy and snuggly. They are an ideal size to go anywhere with you. They are perfect for your office, shelf or pocket! They are a great treat for yourself or a gift to give. They are an original design of mine. Each little monsteropus comes with a personality and some quirky habits.Each monsteropus is hand knit by me in Vancouver, Canada in a smoke-free home. I knit each monsteropus using either merino wool or allergy free acrylic yarn. You can select in the survey following the campaign if it is successful which material you would prefer, as well as eye colour, yarn colour and mouth style from several options. The baby monsteropuses shown here are knit using very soft merino wool. They have 7 tentacles.Each baby monsteropus takes me 4-5 hours to knit and the grown up monsteropus takes me 8-10 hours to knit. The baby monsteropus is 3"" / 7.5 cm tall and the grown up monsteropus is 6"" / 7.5 cm tall. They are safe for anyone over age 3.There are some early bird rewards if you would like a monsteropus in limited quantity for you to choose from. I have several ideas for stretch goals if my campaign is successful and I will gladly post them here.Your support of this project will go towards producing and shipping the rewards, as well as allowing me the opportunity to develop more monster designs and provide materials to do so.

We can't afford to arrange flights/visas/passports to bring Africans over to play in the UK so we have had only a few gigs with a UK based Jamaican front man. We are like all musicians are also plagued by illegal downloads.The recording equipment is of course also expensive for home studio work, as are the album releases.The albums despite their success through international critical acclaim have landed me in debt with the studio equipment and I am unable to carry on like this, release anything else or promote the previous albums properly without support. My salary does not cover our basic living costs either. But for some music for your soul go to our weblinks :)I know there are so many people that would love our music that do not even know it exists due to a lack of advertising and gigs so as well as finishing and releasing the next album I would like to also promote it properly. New music lovers and fans of the other project I initiated at the same time but was left out of (Dub Colossus who have had Realworld promotion they are better known and share members with Invisible System) but still we are not really known. Fans of the Ethiopiques (we share singers), Zion Train, The Damned, Ozrics and Eat Static, Hole, Portishead, Baba Maal etc etc.I can't afford to press enough CDs, place adverts in the music press or pay off the debts from the work to date on my salary and supporting my family (I am an unqualified teacher). I can not afford to qualify or take a masters so that is also out of the question. Like most I have not paid off my loans from my first degree yet and any help to keep making music and promote what we have done would be much appreciated.I have tried funding through trusts but nothing came, likewise with the arts council .Please help us to fun the finish and release of the next album so that we start to do do things properly and entertain you along the way.I also tried to set up a charity, then a community interest company to continue my aid work for the arts (as I was frustrated that artists were never helped via aid work) but I could not keep up with the paperwork and accounts even though the company was dormant and I was nearly heavily fined so I closed it.I would like to soon work on something new involving Africans and return to Africa also next summer. That would be my wish if the funding came in much higher than we ask. That really would bring in a truly amazing album. Popping to Mali with my wife and or back to my old homeland of Addis Ababa.

Each pledge goes to a musician. They get paid more than the £5 or £10 if that is all you pledge but the smaller pledges add up.Also I put the target at only £50 to make sure we got some funding as if I had put e.g. £500 it may have got to £490 then no further which would mean no musician would get paid.We really need £1000 to start with if possible so getting close.Again none of this money goes to me, it pays the musicians involved in the project or if more can help them to buy an instrument.Thanks.http://invisiblesysteminmali.weebly.com/Here is the project blog above.I am off to Mali on the 23rd of this month (July) until the 28th August. I used to be an aid worker in Mali from 1999-2003 during which I married a Malian and had my daughter. I am also a well known Ethiopian fusion music producer from my days of aid working there. All links with sound to my music are below. Dive in there! e.g. youtube/spotify/itunes/soundcloud.This pledge is to help generate income for Malian musicians involved in this project. Who they are will be shown on the blog as I meet them out there. Each £10 will go directly to the musicians to give them a wage and allow us to exchange ways of playing and recording sound.This is a British Council and Arts Council funded project with some of the funds going to the musicians but the more £10 hits, the more musicians can benefit from this.The last time I lived in Mali I was in the middle of the desert with hardly any recording gear and isolated. I then moved on with my family to aid work in Ethiopia where I started building a decent home studio.Over the last few years I have released six independent albums, and one via World Music Network as a bonus CD to the Rough Guide to Ethiopia that we also had a track on.I fused mainly Ethiopian (also some Jamaican) with dub and rock, acid and dance, post punk, funk, and also Malian, Gambian and Jamaican sounds.

I created 52 quiz questions for each of the five topics covered in a basic high school physics class: Waves, Mechanics, Energy, Electricity, and Modern. An additional category for Math alone covers all five topics. In total, the game has as many as 312 quiz questions to help you prepare for physics exams. Players can study alone or in groups of any number. The game begins by players designating a ""Physics Master"" who will be in charge of reading card questions. Players spin a spinner to find out which category they will be playing for. The Master reads the question and if the Player answers correctly, then the Player keeps the question card in his/her pile. If the player answers incorrectly, then the card is returned to the pile. Players continue to take turns answering questions until one player has accumulated three cards in each category. S/he is now the new ""Physics Master"" and game play begins again. =========================================================Creator: NYC Physics teacherInterview with Terry Dana Jachimiak II, the Theater Professor about Physics: The Game of Cards:Why?

We weren't aware of what was draining our lives out.When we finally managed to start appropriate treatment, we noticed that taking medicine wasn't enough to go back on our feet. While it definitely gave us a needed push to pursue a desired life, this was only just the beginning of our journey.What we realised was that to get our lives back we needed to change our thinking patterns. In order to do that, we had to take action.The aim of the book is to show in a creative way that taking action doesn't have to come with fear. Yes, it requires some time. And yes, it is a bumpy road. And your feelings are true and valuable - we felt various, often scary emotions too.But becoming familiar with those opportunities and going after them helps you to open yourself to the world and what it might give you.While we are not professional therapists - and you are always welcome to use their help if you need (we did as well) - we are here because of our passion for the topic and because we want to gently remind you that it is all in your hands to get better.When we felt lost, we wanted to have a book such as this for resources, therefore we created it for those in need.

The third rendering uses stars withmagnitude 14 and brighter, which yields about 14 million stars.As the number of stars renderedincreases, a cloudy area appears over a large portion of the map, that's themilky way, our galaxy, where most stars of this magnitude range are located.There are also several renderingdimensions, from 6MP (3600x1800 pixels; 30x15cm or 1x0.5ftif printed at 300DPI), to 414MP (28800x14400px; 2.4x1.2m or8x4ftifprinted at 300DPI), this defines the quality of the image, and how big of a monitor or print can therendering be shown on.Current stage of the projectBeloware a few sample renderings of the Orion constellation (around Betelgeuse), at the lowest resolution rendering (6MP), with varying star magnitude renderings (versions 1,2,3).Below are a few sample renderings of the Orion constellation (around Betelgeuse), at the highest resolution rendering (414MP), with varying star magnitude renderings (versions 1,2,3).Remaining workStreamline and fine-tune the process to reach the most coherent and beautifulrenderingpossible.Once rendering quality is satisfactory, experiment with different printing technologies and providers.Common questions with answersHow is the map generated, whichcoordinate system is used?I use the right ascension as thehorizontal reference, and declination as the vertical reference, this yields toa flat rectangular map where the width is twice the height, there is a distortionthat is maximal at the top and bottom portions, as in flat world maps.Can you provide a sub-region or differentprojectionsystem?Currently I would like to focus on providinga high quality universal map of the stars using a single projection system,further projects would focus on a specific area if suggested by backers.Does the picture claim to show precise starpositions, show coordinate grids or other visual clues to help locate stars andconstellations?No, this is primarily intended asan artwork that has educational value, I will provide some guidance aboutcommon bright stars on a separate, public document, with link to other resources like relevant Wikipedia pages.Does the rendering contain celestial objectsother than stars?No, Sun, Moon, planets, satellites,asteroids, comets, meteorites, meteors, fireballs, artificial satellites, spacestations, rockets, space junk,are not shown, nor are deep sky objects like galaxies, nebulae,star clusters, etc. such as those from Messier and NGC catalogs.","Rendering large images takes some time, 10mins-120mins depending on the number of stars, but this should be mitigated by iterating over smaller areas before final renderings of the large whole images.Renderings provided as rewards can get as large as 100MB, I plan to use SkyDrive to distribute them if they get beyond the allowable message attachment limit.Star brightness might not be as precise at different resolutions due to raster nature of bitmaps. Will try different settings to adapt and improve the rendering.Colors are approximated and will never be as accurate as telescope observations/pictures. However, I will fine tune them to make them as coherent as possible based on the B-V color index.The star catalog used (like most other catalogs) is based on automatically captured and analysed images of the sky at different times and positions, this adds inaccuracies to portions of the stars and I will try my best to make the rendering as coherent as possible, to avoid having several patches of different colors.",https://www.kickstarter.com/projects/firazsamet/timeless-calendar-designing-the-most-compact-calen?ref=discovery_category_newest,firazsamet/timeless-calendar-designing-the-most-compact-calen,"Hi,My name is Firaz Samet, I am a Software Engineer in Redmond, WA. In this work, I focus on my passion for programming and innovative designs. My goal is to create a timeless calendar that achieves both a compact and reusable design. The funding goal of this project is to try different printing and shipping providers.I started with a very simple observation, I still have a few years old calendar stuck on my fridge, while I usually use a smart device to track dates, it is always great to have a printed calendar that is always handy. It would be great if calendars never 'expired', while there are already existing concepts for perpetual calendars, they are sometimes cumbersome to use and usually require manual calibration, I wanted to add a twist to that approach and also achieve a compact design at the same time.Basic ConceptsThe main idea is to reuse as many days as possible among several months, I achieve this by only keeping the low digits (0-9) and removing the high digits (1-3). I also use colors to tag days and highlight the first day of each potential month.Initial DesignThe initial design was to have a compact design with 7 columns by 10 rows, but that proved to be hard to parse and track months, it is however pretty fun to try out.Current Calendar DesignThe latest design expands the basic grid to make it easier to track months, it also shows upcoming month's color, based on its first day's color. For example, December 2013 starts on Sunday, so December's color corresponds to Sunday's color, December 10th corresponds to the second row, 3rd column (Tuesday), December 23rd corresponds to the fourth row, second column (Monday).Next stepsThe design will still be improved, and once the funding period is over and funding is successful, I will start sending the rewards to my backers.Thanks for your support!","To ensure high quality print results, I am going to print the top reward using a major chain print services.I will ship the top reward myself, to mitigate risks of delays and errors, I am limiting the number of rewards available. Printing and shipping a big number of rewards would need to be automated to avoid delays and errors, for the second reward, I plan to use the services of one of the USPS third party sites featured here: https://www.usps.com/send/create-mail-and-postage.htm."
https://www.kickstarter.com/projects/ianring/opus-arcana-piano-music-about-the-tarot?ref=discovery_category_newest,ianring/opus-arcana-piano-music-about-the-tarot,"I'm a composer of classical works for solo piano. I hope you'll help me accomplish my next big project.I'm going to compose 22 short pieces for piano, inspired by the major arcana of the tarot deck. Each one will be a different composition specifically inspired by the meaning and significance of each card. The pieces are intended to be performed by any sufficiently trained pianist; their difficulty will range from moderate to difficult, but none will require exceptional virtuosity.Work will begin once the campaign has been funded. I predict it will take about two years to complete. The finished collection will be delivered as either a printed book or printable PDF scores, depending on the level of your pledge. Some packages will include a recorded performance delivered as a music download. At the highest pledge level, you will receive an exclusive limited-edition of the work with extra content, some cool swag, and a nicer presentation, autographed and numbered.Raymond Buckland, an esteemed author, occultist, spiritualist and expert on the tarot, has agreed to write a foreward to accompany the printed editions. His exclusive content will be in the printed books only - it will not be available in the digital copies.Your pledge will help me buy the music software I'll require to produce professional-quality printed scores, and the software and sample libraries to render them as high-quality recordings.Even if you're not able to be a paid backer, you can still help! Share this campaign with your friends on social media - especially musicians, music teachers, pianists, piano students, educators, fans and connoisseurs of classical music.","I'm a conservatory- and university-trained pianist and composer, with many years of experience writing pieces for classical piano, and performing and arranging for a small jazz ensemble.I've been composing music for most of my life. In recent years I have begun offering my compositions to the public as scores. You can listen to some of my previous work at www.ianring.com, and there are even more pieces for sale at my Scubbly store.As the pieces are finished, I'll self-publish them the way I have with all my other recent compositions: I'll create a video ""reel"" for YouTube, and I'll put the typeset score up for sale at my Scubbly store. Everyone who pledged enough to be eligible for immediate access will be sent a download token so they can get each piece as soon as it's ready, and those that pledged for the audio recordings will get access to those.Buying all those scores individually from Scubbly will be quite a bit more expensive than the equivalent kickstarter pledge. So trust me that you'll want to jump on this kickstarter while you can. Besides, if the kickstarter isn't successfully funded, I won't have the software I need to do the project in the first place.When all 22 pieces are done, then I'll assemble the printed copies and other rewards for all the backers who pledged at those levels, and ship them out.To reach my goal, I feel very confident that I can finish at least one new piece every month. So I predict this project will take about two years to complete. That allows me an average of one piece every month, sustained over 22 months; and then a couple of months to compile the introduction, typeset all the scores, arrange printing, binding, and shipping.",https://www.kickstarter.com/projects/ianring/red-guitar?ref=discovery_category_newest,ianring/red-guitar,"This kickstarter for presales will raise the lucre needed to release this cover of David Sylvian's ""Red Guitar"", performed by me.

I've been on Christmas break from school and have been reading the Bible every morning. Two mornings in a row I felt like I needed to write a book for kids my age and told my mom.

I'm almost done with the first devotional that has 30 days of verses from Proverbs with stories, questions, and prayers for kids to walk through and learn how to apply what the Bible says to their life.I want to give this book to all the kids in my youth group at church.

He wrote White Mama (novel) and the 1980 television film including novels like Going Gently, Dream Shot, The Fifth Season, Living Together.I found the author's email from the Penn State University website. I email the author Robert Downs for permission to adapt his book to a stage theatrical.The next day, I got an email from the author granting me his permission to adapt WHITE MAMA to a theatrical stage production.How did I get started?After years of being a stay at home mom, I thought about getting back on my feet in the writing and acting industry.

And that's where I found WHITE MAMA.It took me about a year and three months to type the manuscript. In December, I wrote the final scene of the play and completed the whole script. After completing the script, I had to do my research on White Mama making sure that it hasn't been to the stage. So far, it hadn't been on stage and I became the first.Good News, Bad NewsThe good news was White Mama has been accepted in the New York Winterfest at the Hudson Guild Theatre. Unfortunately, I had a little pocket change that wasn't enough to travel to New York City, cover hotel stays, promoting White Mama, book a theater for auditions and rehearsals, and able to pay for actors and tech crew.

For all, you have done! Stay safe! Wash your hands! Stay Quarantined! And Enjoy Reading WHITE MAMA!","It took me years to find a way to produce this play. I have tried sending my play to festivals, play submission, and literary agents. Unfortunately, my play has been denied or put on the waitlist.Two years ago, my play has been accepted at New York Winterfest but I canceled and I haven't sent my play in any since then. I have talked with other theatre producers but they urge me to give it up which made me lost interest in my writing skills."

It is not really a patentable item because of the fact it utilizes hardware items which exist, for their primary purposes, so it is up to me to complete it and market it on my own. Kickstarter has gotten me excited about the idea of getting this off the ground. This first 2 kiosk version is a prototype and may not be framed as pretty on the mock up image as I have primarily included only the essential hardware, computer, and software tools needed framed in more of a box than anything that fancy yet.Here it is:Imagine you are walking down the sidewalk in New York City and you see a small crowd gathered around both sides of what looks like a big piece of art or something. As you get closed you realize it is a live portal between this spot and other cities, and other countries. You can talk and interact with no delay in full HD 24/7/365. Ultimately, as the concept is realized and spreads it will become a draw for people to go to their nearest link to say hi to a friend or relative or just to feel more connected to a bigger world. Motion sensing would also allow for it to be a revenue building billboard for the city, until a person comes within 15 feet of it, then the world window opens. Also, as placement grows, the location links could cycle monthly(NYC-PARIS link becomes NYC-TOKYO, and PARIS paired to MOSCOW).",Money and time.  These two things often equate to the same thing.  There are no unforeseen challenges in the actual creation and implementation of the hardware and software.  Marketing will be its own challenge for the next phase.,https://www.kickstarter.com/projects/1177497808/not-alice-not-wonderland-your-story?ref=discovery_category_newest,1177497808/not-alice-not-wonderland-your-story,"NOTES / RULES / GUIDELINES located under ""risks and challenges"" section.STORY: Alice had a wild dream in her Wonderland, now it is our turn as a community. This is designed to be a creative joint effort with all of you, but NOT meant to be too wildly random, disjointed, or offensive. Copyright notice, ""Alice in Wonderland"" now falls under the public works category, allowing it to be used freely in all works, including this artistic publishing project.At close of project all backers will receive a full final copy of the story. If we well exceed goals, I will send a professionally narrated version with illustrations to reflect what we created to all backers.Word choice color codes are shown below.AND HERE WE GO:","NOTES, RULES, AND GUIDELINES:1. LIVE UPDATES: In order to help keep people excited and motivated, this project will be updated regularly with your submissions, regardless of if it meets it would meet or exceed its goal, and regardless of if you ever need to pay a pledge.  The schedule for this is to fall along a repeating 48-hour window at maximum, so you should see updates each or every other day with your submissions.  As a chapter gets closed, or nears closing, the next chapter will be added clean and the previous chapter will of course remain for story reading.2. PRIORITY: There are 2 main guides here in regards to your submissions compared to overlapping submissions by other people.  One is the basic ""first come, first serve"" rule, based on your pledge date, not when I get the message submission of your words or paragraphs(Though I ask you to send your requests within the 48 hour windows).  In the event I have overlapping submissions, the larger pledger wins.  A $10 replacement of every reference to the Mad Hatter would prevent renaming him later, even if someone made this claim long before we entered his chapters.  A $5 paragraph replacement would win over a word within their paragraph submitted by someone else.  Also if someone donated $1.05, and someone else donated $1 at the same time, the $1.05 would win in that words placement.  However, I would just message the pledger to choose another unclaimed passage.3. CONSISTENCY: In certain passages to preserve the story as you have all created it, and of course at no pledge expectation from you, your word may be used more than once.  Doing this it may mean that a word pledged on is referenced repeatedly in a short passage.  When this is the case the word submission may be used in a few places to cover all the story based references in that immediate area of the story.  Others should again respect the first come, first serve rule if someone else placed a submission that overlapped a particular word.4. YOUR SELECTIONS: Kickstarter does not seem to be allowing me to make minimum donations below $1, so I just set it up to have 2 word submissions for the minimal $1 donation.  In some cases this $1 donation may yield 10 different word changes in that if something is repeat referenced in a short span or paragraph, that only counts as one submission, and I will change it in all related instances.  You are not required to match tense or usage, as I will do that for you in the edits for you.  Please just be clear about the page number(s), paragraph(s), and words you would like to replace.5. EXTREME CONTENT: You should be able to have fun with this using anything you like, This would include adult concepts or content within reason.  Please refrain from submissions which in extreme profanity, racial slurs, excessively graphic violence, etc...  If something is WAY TOO FAR OUT, I will message you back to ask for a second submission, or if you cannot respond, an alternate version where I attempt to keep your message in a variation on words will be made in the update.  But for the most part, I would very much like to leave the content open to anything goes, so HAVE FUN!"
https://www.kickstarter.com/projects/designandbuildcnc/xy-multi-platform?ref=discovery_category_newest,designandbuildcnc/xy-multi-platform,"Hi my name is Artur Wisniewski and I am pleased to present my Kick-starter project.Multi X-Y is a plotter platform to use as Wire cutter / Embosser or Laser Engraver / CutterIt is a Stand Alone unit build as Frame over Frame, controlled by compatible into RAMPS Arduino controller. The Controller works on slightly modified Marlin Firmware witch I've adapted to be compatible with a 2D Plotting platform (firmware will be available to download from website as it is Freeware).I have designed 3 versions of this X-Y platform , one is a desktop size ( small ) second size is bigger so you can put it on desk if you have enough space (medium), or third which is a standalone unit ( wardrobe size/ large)1. Small Desktop XY Multi-Platform:2. Medium XY Multi-Platform:3. X-Large XY Multi-Platform:There are plenty of cnc wire-cutters around, I designed this to be slightly different than all of them.Main goal in developing it was stability and precision. So that cutting in soft polyester foam wouldn't be a big challenge and wire didn't need to be strongly stretched, or very hot.Cutting/embossing in much denser material requires a strong tension on wire and fixing points to be close to material, most of typical constructions can't allow too much tension between main pillars ( Y axis ), the same is with simple spring tensioning. I've called it that way because when material is dense and hot wire melting it around passing in it, it push some of material outside the flat surface. Creating a bulge, it becomes even more interesting when use this method on clear acrylic Plexiglas.Distortion created by passing wire in acrylic is visible, but when you pump some light inside acrylic from side edge the light rays became taped in the same way they were taped in fibre-optic cable. Bouncing from clear plane edge, to moment when most of them finds the distorted material, light rays bounce from it in greater angle and them living the Plexiglas. In simpler words the patch in which the wire marked in material lights up.  Like for example below.For Embossing I’ve developed different way of fixing wire that simply springs, to eliminate the drag effect when wire finds resistance in material and it's position lags, giving lower resolution and much less precision in the object that is being manufactured. For XY Multi-Platform I’ve developed two wire tensioning systems:First is traditional spring tensioning can be used with soft materials like foams etc. it's easy to install wire and replace when needed.Second is a high precision adjustable wire guide witch can withstand wire temperatures up to 1000 degrees of Celsius,( red hot, brightly glowing), and be at the same time strongly stretch for embossing in harder material, as for example acrylic pleasing.In an easy way you can adjust distance between ends, release and lock them in other position, and tension wire the same way by unlocking/locking grub-screw nut. Having an X-Y platform was logical to develop a laser TTL controlled head to be quickly turned into laser engraver or cutter.3 Watt 450nm TTL controlled Head is enough to engrave in wood / plastic materials.But I realized even a best construction is unusable without a software which allows and assists users to design own projects. I started developing the software for my personal use, as most of the software available wasn't free, has limited capabilities or just not precision enough. First I developed a kind of CAM software which can convert 2 dimensional objects created in 3d software into g-code. Wire am can read AliasWavefront *.Obj file format as well Lightwave 3d *.lwo (multiface as well as typical triangled) it can load also standard *.STL files. It's an automatic algorithm which translates the position of an object, by pressing a button algorithm which detects edges of objects after edges are detected correctly, if all looks ok, by pressing another button it generates wire patch starting from Home position, to the start point and then to closest point on object, if there is more objects in project algorithm detects shortest connection between them and generate wire path to jump between them. The second program I wrote is a Bezier CAD/CAM, to speed up and eliminate other software, in process of developing our designs. (I know not all of us can use 3d modelling software to design 2dimensional clip-arts and it is a bit of an overkill)Inline images:My Bezier CAD/CAM software allows users to create own wire path based on simple lines and Bezier Curves. Idea was to allow an Image to be loaded into background and adjust it on virtual work space dimension /contrast / brightens to be just viable, and then use it as stencil to create it sketch by drawing some Lines/Bezier curves over it. There a few useful tools as 2d transformations/ measuring tools etc. added into it. When all Beziers are in place algorithm calculate g-code program according to them we can save it directly to SD card, and directly use in the machine controller.This way you can develop your design with much greater resolution, allowing the wire-cuter to show its precision. The Goal: I'm planning to add some option to program and merge it with its predecessor, before the project will end the program will be updated with algorithms for:• Laser engraving / cutting. • Image Rasterization for Laser PWM controller. • G-Code loader and simulator • *.STL *.OBJ *.LWO object loaderAt this moment there is only manual temperature controls of wire. DC-DC converter is able to control voltage and current flowing by the wire from 0V to 24V maximum continues current is 8A on Small and Medium Version X-Large Version converter can control 0- 36V and maximum current is 10AIn future I’m planning to develop fully automated temperature controller with PIR temperature contact less sensor. It will allow temperature to be set by g-code commands in program, and control process of embossing with even better results. A bit of History....Special thanks To;- Adam Skorupa (Scorpik ) for using  Fountain of Sighs as background soundtrack.-Farbrausch / Jeff Oxborrow / Ronny / Mike May for soundtrack from Fr025.","Risks and challenges:I’ve developed this project to this moment by myself, and it was challenging enough ;) My background is electronics design mixed with programming in C++ / Qt, and some mechanical engineering time to time. I set myself some goals, and they look at this moment like that:Adding flew more useful things to Bezier CAD/CAM. (Designing a new digital PWM wire temperature controller*)Option directly for Laser Engraving (This is second on list, as at this moment temperature of wire is controlled manually by voltage & current limiting on Buck-Down DC-DC converter.)Image to G-code Rasterization and clipping.G-Code Loader and Simulator / Editor. Create Video Tutorials about operation of Machine and all small things & tricks I’ve learn about cutting embossing to this moment.*(I2C connected to main controller board able to work with current up to 20A and high stability)Regarding third and fourth points, it’s good enough but having possibility of setting parameters from program can open some extra possibilities for moving forward this technology. I know all take time and sometimes there can be some challenges.With this project I’m testing waters, I never used Kick-starter, and I don't know how many of you can find project like this attractive/interesting, I did some research check other creators here and there and how they projects get off, and I know one think all depends from your response, if XY Multi-Platform get successfully founded, 90 percent of all components I got form local sources, located in range of flew miles from me.I found lots of helpful people working in companies I’m outsourcing my materials.The first batch of 20-30 will be assembled as soon as possible.  Which would be July/August and shipped August / September.If there will be much more interest, oh boy I’ve glad I have friends to help me to deal with this. And definitely will need a bigger workshop and few more 3d printers to start with. Everything is set in motion, just waiting for your response.",https://www.kickstarter.com/projects/designandbuildcnc/beziercam-software?ref=discovery_category_newest,designandbuildcnc/beziercam-software,"Bezier CAM is software developed for basic 2D/2.5D Modelling and Computer Aided Machining.BezierCam is 2D/2.5D Cad / Cam Software developed around basic Idea, that any drawing/sketch can be quick turn into G-Code forvarious small CNC machines.There are compilation available for Windows operating systems and Gnu/LinuxUnfortunately there is no Mac version.

First I wrote simply c++ program generating G-Code on base on .lwo object file, generated in modelling software from LightWave 3D package. But that was just long painful process using advanced 3D modeling software to generate flat 2 dimensional object then recalculated into basic vector lines and then into G-Code.When I'v decided to develop new models of cnc machines, I decided to rewrite program with Basic idea of using background Image as template and drawing simple geometrical lines and Bezier curves to create wire paths witch can be recalculated into G-Code.Later I'm start adding more features as automatic edge detection regeneration, features for other machines as Laser/Plasma CNC and 3 Axis Mill's.Links to Download:Linux AppImage_x86_64Windows Installerthe links direct you to Google Drive folder pleas keep in mind if I upload new Version You will find it in corresponding folder.And it will had in name CurrentVersion, to avoid confusing version numbers.A bit of update...I'm made some quick Video Tutorial showing basic functionality, of BezierCam I hope this will help you working it around.All feedback will be greatly appreciated.https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCJnZ9QOaBtSHRojsAmMauaw/videos","Next on my hit list is to add some more functionality.Add importing and exporting options for other vector file formats mainly DXF and DWG so popular in CNC word. Add 3D visualizations, at this moment program use OpenGL library only in Orthographic mode. Extend Mill/Router to algorithm for Z-Imaging with multiple stage.this will speed up process of milling because first Router milling bigger parts of material roughly by bigger tool, in a shape and then it use one or two passes with very precision moves to get final effect. Add tools options and tool edition section. And extended program setting, to give a user the opportunity to change colors, default settings etc."

Simple.It's also a magazine of the writing and photography and narratives he creates. And ultimately, the magazine will publish other people's work focused on our connection with nature, alternative lifestyles, minimalism, #vanlife, philosophy, travel and anything else that can help connect us with the world around outside.I'm not Yuri, and Yuri isn't me. We just have a lot in common.The minimum funding goal for this project gets issue #1 into your hands. I'd like to do a run of 2,500 copies--at that point it gets pretty economical. I could run fewer, but broadening the reach of this project will help it connect with other writers and artists in the Finger Lakes of New York and beyond.Each incremental $2,500 funds the next issue of & Ranch, and increases the likelihood it can become a platform for other artists and ideas. I can certainly fill up plenty of issues myself, but in my dream it becomes more of a structure.Beyond the issue/s of & Ranch you will receive, I'm offering up a few other reward items to share other work I've published under the Team Wet Dog Press label.The postcard set, Replicated Detritus, is based on ephemera of the tactile, printed word: encyclopedias, old maps, stamps, the things which are quickly vanishing from our increasingly-digital world.Conspiratorial is a four-part serial mystery (also starring Yuri Realman), about a journalist who gets sucked into a caper in Washington, D.C. It's designed to be a tactile experience--each envelope comes with high-res clues so the reader can examine the clues along with Yuri.12 Dreams is actually the first work Team Wet Dog Press published, and it includes three pieces all focused on ephemeral, surreal stories and the power of dreams.The zines are a mix of short fiction and illustrated narratives--small stories that are long on magical realism and short on definitive action.An a unique, non-publishing reward: If you want to back my project to the tune of $100 or more, I'll spend a couple of hours hand cutting a slice of applewood, sanding it down and turning it into something random and interesting based on the land here at & Ranch. Thank you!I'll just tell you up front, I'm typically no fan of the Oxford comma.The first issue will ship in May, along with any funding rewards. After that, the journal will publish quarterly. Shipped via good 'ol USPS.The first issue is formatted 6x9 and currently runs about 60 pages. Binding will be either perfect, saddle or stapled. Format subject to change after that: Go big or go home.","There are very minimal risks. Issue #1 is in the latter stages of editing and I can fill any number of pages if we fund beyond that. Your biggest risk is actually that you get stuck with 10 issues reading about a hermit and his cat, or that we stick precariously between funded issues but in that case I'd just do it anyway.",https://www.kickstarter.com/projects/859681062/and-ranch-a-literary-comic-about-a-writer-going-of-0?ref=discovery_category_newest,859681062/and-ranch-a-literary-comic-about-a-writer-going-of-0,"In a nutshell: I'm not a big fan of peoples, and so a couple of years back I moved off-the-grid and into the woods. And then I wrote a comic book about a writer moving into the woods.& Ranch is a literary comic about Yuri Realman, a writer who abandons his life in the city, roams the country for a while and starts to figure out who he really is: A hermit.Structurally, & Ranch is a comic book about Yuri's story, interspersed with his writing and photography. In content, the focus is on moving away from consumerism, connecting with nature and embracing alternative ways of living a fulfilling life.While there are many parallels between myself and Yuri (along with a striking physical resemblance), & Ranch is a work of fiction. But, it is well-researched fiction.Really, Yuri's story could be any of ours.I've always been a fan of people willing to take risks and create lives outside the norm. From modern nomads to tiny homes, off-grid setups to the #vanlife movement, a lot of amazing stuff can happen at the fringes. But while there's plenty of how-tos and encouraging social media accounts, there isn't (yet) much literature focused on those ideas. I'd like to help change that.The first issue will ship in December (hey, in time for the holidays!), and after that, will be published quarterly. Shipped via good 'ol USPS.The first issue is formatted 6x9 and runs about 60 pages.","There are no risks for supporters of issue #1, as it is already on its way to the printer. If you choose an annual subscription, there is a risk that producing four issues could take longer than I believe. But, it will still happen."

It received a ton of attention, but sadly wasn't able to meet my goal.But here's a preview of what's included with the LifeLeash. The Deluxe is a little bit more bang for your buck, but you include so much more!Most people have known about parachord, and the extreme durability. What I want to bring to the table is a dog leash & dog collar that has the essential survival tools...built into the leash & collar!

Virtually invisible to the naked eye, while retaining the reliability of the leash & collar. I'm going to have Three different forms of the project. Deluxe, Alpha, and Basic.____________________More information :I've received some suggestions on ideas and here they are!Since I'm providing three (3) different options -> The Deluxe, Alpha, and Basic. For the Deluxe version: Everything is going to be stored in the LifeSphere, it's waterproof & shock proof. To get to the contents you simply unscrew it. Inside you'll have all of the gear carefully & individually wrapped in a biodegradable material that can also be used as tinder for a fire. The LifeSphere will be attached to the actual handle, very securily with a rust proof metal loop, (again it can be removed by unscrewing it).The Alpha is going to have the gear (see the photo, I marked up what is included in each version of the LifeLeash) actually built into the weave of the leash handle. The weave will secure the contents (which are in a waterproof & biodegradable material). To get to the contents you simply untie the knot that is completely the loop for the handle. From there as you begin to unravel the weave the contents will be easily attainable. I will provide instructions (pictures!) on how to get the weave back & how to secure the knot.The Basic will just be the 50' leash & collar. Colors of your choice.______________________How do I get to it?The handle loop will be tied back into the leash. I'm going to have a knot that can easily be taken out, but secure enough that it won't come undone by a dog that tugs or in an event you snag it. Once you begin to unweave the handle the contents will be available. I'm going to provide you with instructions on how to get the weave back.""How do I know my dog won't get hurt from the hook on the leash?""Great question! The paracord has a enough structural integrity that you can even use the rope as a chew toy. Each hook does have a cork on it to ensure safety. But the way I have the weave, I guarantee your dog would not be able to get to it.  If it is a concern which I totally understand, I can have the option to send you the hooks separately and include instructions on how to weave them into the leash._________________Any product purchased from me, I stamp it with my approval & test it with my own dog.

Every morning, my wife and I sit down to have a cup of coffee. It’s one small chunk of time that had a surprisingly profound impact on our relationship. So much that I encourage you to try it.In the last 30 years we have had the opportunity to visit more than 15 coffee plantations around the world and now we want to share our passion for coffee with you.We have decided to start a specialty coffee subscription business.We have selected the best coffees in the world.

By hitting this funding goal, we are able to produce our final product in larger quantities, put our first big order with the quality that we want, so that we are able to deliver the best coffee in the world directly to your door.With this said, everyone who helps us in the making of this project, will get the product at less than future retail prices – and will be the first to be offered exclusive and premium perks coming down the road.","The main issue we have highlighted is keeping the coffee fresh, whilst delivering on our ship by date.

Send in the Clowns is already largely complete, but in order to bring you the anthology, Anomalous Comics has launched this Kickstarter campaign with the goal of raising $5,000 to print, market, and distribute this massive tome of terror!Check out our incredible rewards tiers and support quality independent comics production by backing our campaign!Want to know more about us or our project? We'll be adding a ton of updates, including videos of us doing our thing in our various studios and pictures of the original works we'll be sending to you, the backers we're trying so hard to impress. But for now, check this out. It's a five page story from the book, called ""High Strangeness"", and features none other than Mr. SadFace in his origin story.","We know there are many issues that can arise even after a project has been successfully funded. This is the reason we at Anomalous Comics decided not to run this campaign until after the book was at least 80% complete, which it is now. During this thirty day campaign, we will be uploading daily updates showing you the progress of the final touches on the book, as well as updates we've compiled throughout the book's production for this specific reason. We want to show you, the backers, how a comic book like this comes together, and how it is we do what we do. Once we receive funding, the book will already be complete. All that will be needed is to send the pages off to the printer and to mail out rewards once they arrive. Chris Johnson has collaborated with several of his local friends and set up packing parties to mail rewards to backers in a timely and prompt manner, as well as found lots of goodies and freebies for backers to enjoy with their rewards. Several random backers will also receive free, signed posters like the ones hanging up in the video.This is the plan, but if a setback arises, we will handle it the same way we have during the last seven months of working on this monster of a book.

I feel that I can offer this to readers and do a great job at it with the right resources. I want to be able to offer readers something different, something fresh. To offer new reviews, I need to purchase items to review for my site. I also need to update the software that fuels my blog so that is it up to date on the technology front. I put my all into everything I do and this blog is no different.  Sometimes solo hard work needs help though. That's where you come in. I need outside help to get my blog going strong. You can see what I have so far at greatmazinger.wordpress.com","I overcame these obstacles, therefore I believe I can overcome anything that is in the road ahead for this project. Here's my story. My real journey started 12 years ago when my father passed away. He was only 54. He sat down in his recliner, went to pull the recliner lever, and that was the last thing he ever did. 1 heart attack is all it took to change my life forever. I went down a very dark path that year. I lost both my grandma's that year, my best friends dad, my wife's grandma, and my dad. If it wasn't for my wife(at the time only my girlfriend) I think I would have been a lost cause.She kept me from drowning. At my very lowest, she picked me up, kept my head above the water. Though I loved my dad very much, he didn't make the best life choices. He built a very successful business with a few hundred dollars. It was impressive. My older brother was my dad's right hand man. As for myself not so much. I'm not crying here, but just establishing my story. My brothers first car was bought by my dad for him. A $30,000 truck. My first car, I had to pay for. I wasn't giving a choice. My dad told me I was buying a $1000 car, which was a piece of garbage. It would stall when I would hit a bump. It was broke down more than it ran. I also had to get a job when I was 13 to pay for half my high school tuition. My brother received a paid for education via my dad. Never changed my view of my dad, just pissed me off that I never had a summer vacation from when I was 13 to graduating high school.Sorry, I don't want to bore you so ill skip ahead to the year my dad died. He was in great physical health. His cardiologist told him that his heart was as healthy as a 20 year olds. He didn't have reason to believe his time was coming to an end. As to my surprise when I received a piece of mail. What was in this? Well, it was my dad's last will. Dated from the year he started his business, when I was around 5 years old. The benefactor of everything my dad owned, his houses, his cars, his generations old watch collection, his stocks, assets, etc.. All to his second wife. So this brings me to my drowning moment.Do I drown or do I swim?I always liked taking care of people. It brought me a great sense of fulfillment. My grandmother was ill, and she lived with us when I was 18. I helped take care of her. She was a great woman. Do I drown or do I swim I asked myself again? I decided to go back to school part time. My friends all are graduated from college and establishing themselves in their careers and here I am going back to school. I start working at a local hospital and going to school. 6 years into this journey, I finally get into my program which starts in 6 months full time. My first son is also born at this time. I start my program, I start working full time 12 hour nights on an oncology unit. I'm averaging 8 to 10 hours of sleep a week. Going 3 days straight every week without any sleep. I continue this for the next 3 years. Basically missing out on my sons first 3 years of life, struggling to keep my marriage together and trying to pass my classes. What a juggling act. Worst 3 years of my life. During that 3 years, my marriage almost failed, my last surviving family on my fathers side died, and my cousin who was like a brother to me committed suicide. But I continue to tread the water I call life.Well surprise to me and my clinical instructors I pass. On my final clinical/internship I score a 99/100. I slowly start putting my life back together. 4 years ago I pass my boards, I land a job and my marriage begins to get stronger than ever. My second son was born 7 months ago, my wife and I bought our first house and I love my career. I help rehab stroke victims, orthopedic patients, cancer survivors, etc... For example, with a stroke victim, if they lose use of their dominant side, I help teach them how to do all the things important in their life with their non affected side. Like dressing, eating, bathing, writing, etc.... It's what I should be doing, it's a dream come true. My other dream is to get a watch news and review site up, running and successful! This is where I need your help. I'm asking for help to make this a reality for me.",https://www.kickstarter.com/projects/1117708268/watches-with-a-bit-of-spice?ref=discovery_category_newest,1117708268/watches-with-a-bit-of-spice,"I am raising funds to fund my website.

I am very excited to get this project started. I put to contribution at $100 because this way I can hopefully get some attraction. Realistically, we are looking to hit a goal of $1000. This is a small production and that will cover the main expenses that we have accounted for as well as any miscellaneous items that may come about. So this is a creation that started a couple of years ago and has recently sparked my interest. It was never meant to be anything more. But after watching it, I found myself with a script. But the script took a turn and this trailer turned out to be The film to come. Caution, this will be disturbing on a psychological level. We are looking for a run time of about 20 minutes or so. We are hoping that this will lead to bigger and better films in the near future.If funding is not an option for you, please share this project. That alone is just as valuable. Thank you to all who decide to back this project as well as all those who share my project. Please follow this campaign to see updates on its progress.",I do not foresee any risks or challanges. It is a fairly straight forward horror movie. There may be some specific props that would be needed for certain scenes. But there is nothing that would delay production of this film except perhaps for Mother Nature. By that I mean if there is a severe storm or something out of our control.

Naturally, Apollo taught them to love the arts.Muses are known as the goddesses of the arts and sciences, serving as the symbolic embodiments of knowledge, creation, and inspiration.Usually presented as graceful and lovely, each represents a specific area of study including music, language, dance, visual, astronomy, history, comedy, even love—an art in itself, no?For my Break Kickstarter project I'm painting these goddesses in a way that I feel embraces their true essence of today—abstract modern minimalist.Canvas will be primed, painted, finished with a protective coating, signed, dated, and carefully packaged. All will include a Certificate of Authenticity.Each muse will be painted in the same style, but uniquely embellished with her own personality.The buttons, magnets, and stone coasters are high-quality muse prints, all colorful, all fun.

My name is Daniel and I am a Freshman in High School. I am interested in photography because I find it expressive and interesting. I am taking a photography class at school, but the cameras and filters they use are really just for very basic use. My mom gave me her older model Canon EOS 350D digital camera but I need to get a new 18-200mm zoom lens. The lens is $349 which is the goal for my project. If my goal goes over, then I will buy a fliter kits with different colors and types of filters, because I only have a skylight and polarizing filter right now. I also need a tripod so if exceed my goal, I'll also get a tripod and a new external flash. The rewards are photos that I have taken. I try to take photos are that unique and out of the ordinary. I like to experiment with different angels, for instance lying on my back or stomach to get a different perspective. My favorite photo is the one of the waves - I stood on the rocks waiting for the right wave to splash up so I could get a shot of the waves only, breaking in the air. It took a while but the wave smashed against the rocks I was standing on and broken right in front of me, getting me wet too, but the photo came out perfect. You can even see little round circles of sea spray in the photo. I really enjoy photography and want to learn more and advance my skill. I'd like to see where photography can take me after I finish high school. I like traveling and seeing new places, so maybe I could work for a magazine like National Geographic as a photographer.Thank you for supporting my project. *************************************************************************I took this photo of vapor trails over Northern France during a motorhome vacation through Europe with my family last year.*********************************************************************************This is Stonehenge in the Fall of last year.

Scouting provides life long skills, many of which are learnt at camp. For a little about me: I am an Eagle Scout and recently earned my first Bronze Palm. Last semester I was the Senior Patrol Leader for my Troop for 80 boys (it was a very good learning experience!); I have completed National Youth Leadership Training and will be the Junior Assistant Scoutmaster in my new Troop, helping other Boy Scouts develop, grow and become Eagle Scouts too. 3 years ago, my Scouting skills helped me save my friends life when he came out of his life jacket and sank to the bottom of a 15ft swimming pool. I want to document with photography and a video montage the experiences Scouts have at summer camp. We will also use the photo book/s and video at local Scout recruitment events. The funds from the project will help with expenses to attend summer camp ($350 and I have about half the cost covered myself), the cost to produce the photo books (about $40 a book)and additional photography equipment (filters, 18mm wide angle lens, tripod and remote shutter cable) to fulfill the project.

Therefore what if we did have magic in our world and how would that affect the plants within it along with the environments they grow in and the recipes you can make with them.I decided to create my own world filled with new plants anyone would adore.So I'm creating a travellers style journal with an accompanying recipe book for those who like to immerse themselves in anything fantastical and magical. Each page will have a series of traditionally done sketches around and under the text as well a digitally done polaroid style picture to illustrate the plant on each journal page. It will have a worn and weathered look to it as if a traveller has actually travelled to each of the regions to research and document the plants.The plants themselves will each have a page explaining a bit about them and where they grow as well as how to harvest them and even if they have any magical abilities or enhancements which some of them do.The accompanying recipe book will have a full page illustration for each recipe. The recipes themselves will contain only ingredient you can find in the journal so you know what they are talking about and so you can better imagine how it would actually taste.Thats why I created this journal and recipe book. I wanted to create my own plants with some being crystal like and sweet and others that look like cotton candy and can make you float as if you're floating on the moon and even a mushroom kind of plant that glows.Each journal page will have traditional sketches along with a digitally done polaroid image of the plant in either its environment or cut open to show its insides.The other main book is a recipe book where it shows what can be made with the plants in the journal with each page having it's own illustration for you to enjoy.So if you enjoy the fantastical and also plants and journals I hope you will like what I am creating.,The only risk may be timing and making sure all the process images are edited together in the right order and the book are all ready to go in an easy to email format. There's also the risk of funding but I hope that with the lower price goal it will be a low risk.

I'm not asking for a lot just enough to make it worth the while to do the course itself.The course itself will be a complete guide for beginners and is ideal for anyone who has no idea how to build a website online but wants to do so without spending years learning how to code...The course will be recorded in HD video and I will try my best to cover everything that I can think of such as setting up a domain name and hosting account, installing Wordpress, publishing posts, pages, and working with themes, how to use plugins ect....Here is an example of the quality of content that this course will have:I know a lot of people struggle with the technical aspect of setting up a website so I'm hoping this course will help introduce web development to those who have no previous programming experience.For anyone who pledges to make this course a reality I am truly thankful and I appreciate everything you have done.There are rewards and video tutorials/courses for anyone who pledges as a way of me saying thank you for believing in my work.Hey everyone just wanted to do a quick update to thank everyone who initially helped fund this project.I'm surprised already by the support I've been receiving and I appreciate everything that you've all done for me.I'm currently in the process of outlining the layout and curriculum of the course. If there is anything you want to see included please let me know!Cheers!Robin.Hey guys,Just wanted to give another update that the course outline is completed! I had some free time this morning so while having my regular cup of coffee to wake me up I brainstormed a rough draft of the course outline:It's not final and there will be other things I want to include but for now it will help keep me on track. Once again, if there's anything anyone would like me to include that's not covered here please do! ( WordPress plugin tutorials welcome ;) )Because you can't really see the outline in the pic here it is:How To Create a WordPress Website In 2017 For Non TechiesCourse Outline:As you can see there's still lots for me to do but that's okay I always like a challenge!After I start recording a few lectures I will be able to get a preview URL that backers can use to get a free preview of the course as I create it.That's pretty much all I got for this update. If anyone wants to add anything please feel free to do so!Thanks again everyone for making this possible!Sincerely,Robin Haney.Just wanted to give a big thanks to everyone who helped make this project a reality.Earlier today a bunch of backers sent a lot of love to this project and I'm still in shock...Since the project is completely funded I will start working now to get it completed ASAP.Everyone will receive their rewards as well early next month! If there is anyone else who wants to grab some free courses you can still be a backer until the funding period is over.Thanks everyone!Sincerely,Robin.Just wanted to give everyone a heads up that I added a $100 reward for those who you who donated so much. I am truly grateful for all the support.For anyone who donates or has donated more than $100 I am giving you all my Udemy courses...That's all 20 courses that can be found on this page...https://www.udemy.com/user/robinhaney/Cheers!Robin.","I've been creating and publishing online web developing course for a few years.

https://www.kickstarter.com/projects/alpoma/maptorian-plus-vector-maps-for-everyone?ref=discovery_category_newest,alpoma/maptorian-plus-vector-maps-for-everyone,"Maptorian is a vector map collection that was created having in mind what graphic designers, journalists, students and any other people may need to create visually appealing maps easily and quickly. Thanks to Maptorian’s layered maps, anybody who knows how to handle a current vector graphic design program, especially a program like Illustrator, can easily shape their own maps.Everything in Maptorian maps is editable. The distribution of thematic layers is designed to quickly create different types of maps through their activation and deactivation, change in distribution and, of course, edition. Yes, everything in Maptorian can be customized.Objects, layers, colors, texts… everything can be changed easily to create the desired map. Also, the user won’t have to rely on a different graphic design tool (can use Illustrator, Inkscape...), nor have to use any complex mapping software (GIS).Map information is often out of reach for designers or graphic design programs users. Would not it be great to have a collection of maps designed as templates to create new, customized maps not needing to use GIS or similar programs?That’s where Maptorian comes in. When creating this project, we always had in mind the ideal map pack in our daily work as graphic designers. Using Illustrator or any other popular vector design tool, you can create and edit any kind of map of the world, continent, country or region, simply using what Maptorian has to offer.Layered AI + EPS + PDF (Requires Illustrator CS3 or higher or other similar graphic design software).Thefirst version of Maptorian was developed over three years ago. It was a first attempt to create a useful map pack intended for graphic designers. Now we are about to complete the development of this new, improved and expanded version, much better than the initial one.To create this improved version of Maptorian (known as Maptorian Plus) we have used new data sources in the public domain that contain large amounts of information. This information must first be processed before being converted into templates that can be used to create maps.This processing stage is very demanding in terms of hardware requirements and time spent on the adjustment of layers and objects. Hence, to properly fund the final development stage of Maptorian Plus, we have placed our trust in the community of enthusiasts who make Kickstarter alive. Thanks to everyone for the support!The magic behind Maptorian lies in its structure. All the maps that make up Maptorian have been designed to be easy to use. To achieve this goal, each map has several layers of information distributed on separate thematic layers.These layers can be turned on or off, you can edit them, copy and paste or even merge them. There are layers of rivers and lakes, of roads or railways, cities, text labels… Playing with the arrangement of the layers and the elements that compose them you can create countless maps, all of them meeting your needs. Your imagination is the limit.Maptorian Plus is a collection of vector templates created to allow you to design any kind of global, continental, regional or country map that you may need. For more detailed information about the maps included in Maptorian, its features, layers, objects and descriptions, we invite you to download this guide. (PDF, 27MB).If you want to discover the power of Maptorian, we invite you to download a small sample. This sample contains a vector map created using some Maptorian layers. It will allow you to test and experience how easy it is to create maps from Maptorian vector files. (AI+EPS+PDF, Zip. 10MB).The new edition of Maptorian is much more than a collection of vector map packs. It’s a toolbox designed to facilitate cartographic mapping tasks in the fields of graphic design, journalism, computer graphics or publishing.SEE HERE A COMPLETE DESCRIPTION OF THE MAPTORIAN PACKSWhenever you need to create a world map, a map of a continent, a country or a region, owning Maptorian maps will greatly ease the task. Each map can be seen as a template. Each of them has several thematic layers that combined and edited to your liking, will become the map you wanted to create.There are plenty of cartographic databases in the public domain around the world, but unfortunately they are typically designed to be used by cartographers, engineers and geographers who use GIS (Geographic Information Systems) software for their projects. Generally, graphic designers, journalists or anybody else not familiar with GIS often have great difficulty in handling these cartographic databases.When all what is needed is to create visually appealing and accurate maps, but spatial analysis tasks are not needed, such databases, being a tempting target as they are, become a headache for those without access to GIS tools or the knowledge to take advantage of them.That’s where Maptorian comes in. Maptorian map packs were created thinking in visual graphic design to easily communicate information. To achieve this, map packs have been shaped using public domain cartographic databases, like Natural Earth. They also follow the CIA World Factbook maps and the National Atlas of the United States as reference.The resulting raw data is then dumped into a GIS, and later distributed in layers using Illustrator.Each vector object created following this process has subsequently been edited “by hand” whenever necessary, as is the case of text labels, elements of color, thicknesses and other graphic aspects. The final product is a vector map pack created to have a number of ideal quality templates at hand when designing visually appealing maps.","The process of creating Maptorian Plus is in its final stage. At this stage an investment in special hardware is needed so that it is powerful enough to allow to properly export the contents of Maptorian Plus. In the event that the campaign is successfully funded, no special risks are contemplated, since the entire map data is already processed. We are just waiting for the final push, which we hope to achieve thanks to Kickstarter. The distribution of rewards, except for USB drives, will be conducted through online downloads, eliminating any risk associated to receiving shipments.",https://www.kickstarter.com/projects/alpoma/minimal-geography-poster-map-digital-download?ref=discovery_category_newest,alpoma/minimal-geography-poster-map-digital-download,"I have worked as a graphic designer and cartographer for almost twenty years and, during all this time, I always wanted to design a poster-map that was different from what you usually see.The final result has been a map that brings together an infographic conception of the planet with a touch of curiosity. The central map, with a Dymaxion projection, is the element around which a multitude of data and thematic layers are displayed.Since 2011 I have developed a digital vector maps project called Maptorian. I have used as a base to create part of the poster my own layers of geographic information from that project, to shape a new vision of the planet. The end result is a beautiful poster that attracts attention and that, properly framed or simply placed on a wall, creates a very striking effect. People are accustomed to looking at world maps in very specific ways, usually through maps with Mercator projection, or Winkel-Tripel or similar, with the north at the top. But, the world can be represented in many other ways, all of them valid. To think differently, let's start by representing the world in an unconventional way: that's why I chose to use the Dymaxion projection.With the poster already designed, I thought I'd make it known to the world. I had several options to do that: I could market it as a printed product or I could make it available as a digital download. The advantage of digital downloading, in very high quality PDF format, is that it allows you to print it wherever you want, with the quality of paper you want and in different sizes, as well as being able to print as many copies as you want. Obviously, sending the printed poster was the most common thing, but I finally decided to offer it only as a digital download. The reason is very simple: I know from past experiences that shipping these types of products with quality and safety can be a nightmare.That is why, in order to avoid such problems, I have only chosen to distribute it as a digital product. You will have the complete high quality files available in PDF for high quality printing in two sizes. You can even print as many copies as you want with your local supplier, I do not put any restrictions on that aspect. If, in addition, you want to have all the vector tools I use when creating my maps, there is a reward available in which you can have not only the PDFs of the poster, but hundreds of vector digital maps, with thousands of editable objects, so you can create your own maps (here I describe the contents of that collection of vector maps- Maptorian).1.- Minimal Geography poster (Digital Download)High quality PDFs for print, 300 dpi, two sizes: 18x24 inches (45x60 cm) and 24x36 inches(60x92 cm).2.- Minimal Geography poster (Digital Download) + Maptorian Full Edition (Digital Download)High quality PDFs for print, 300 dpi, two sizes: 18x24 inches (45x60 cm) and 24x36 inches(60x92 cm) + Maptorian vector maps full edition, with more than 100 digital maps in Illustrator and PDF formats (about Maptorian).","The design is complete and I have done printing tests in various sizes to check the final quality of the poster. There are no shipping or manufacturing risks, as it is distributed as a digital product so you can print it wherever you want."

From a time I was overweight, depressed, and the drinks went down easily I have has literally revolutionalized my life. Now I study spiritual texts across all religions, and contemplate how I can use my life to better serve the people of the World.

So I started covering Video game music with my buddy Phil Smith. Our album 'Collectors Edition' was small success, so I continued to create covers and got obsessed! I have released 4 albums so far and I don't plan to stop any time soon.So Why do you need backing now?Up until now I have been using my very outdated computer, outdated software and dodgy interfaces. I haven't let this stop me though! and I will not stop creating covers even if this project is not funded. I love writing music and that will not stop.So I need backing because I want to put my music to the next level and to do that I need better equipment and software. I also I need to learn more and push myself into new directions. Unfortunately bills are not my friend and most of my current funds disappear before I know it.What will the money be spent on?The money will be spent on a new pc (as mine is currently 7 years old and held together by miracles. Software - Ezdrummer, Guitar Rig, Pod Farm 2.Mixing / Mastering Online Course.Fees and LicencingWhat will you be giving back?Well anyone that donates will receive a copy of the album that is created, I would also love their input on which songs / games they would like covered. I also will be donating all the album proceeds to the http://rhythmixmusic.org.uk/charity. They do some amazing work in helping people will mental health issues be apart of and create music, as well as other projects. I will be donating the proceeds of the album to Rhythmix Music even if this kickstarter remains unfunded.Why should we back you? Why should we care?Honestly, I don't have an answer for that, I want to do more and bring my music to a larger audience and hopefully make people happy by doing this. I personally live for music and I love the journey of creating new songs, as i said previously, I will continue to write and grow. Hopefully if I get some good responses it can be a journey of creating a community also, a journey I want to share.I will keep a production log so you all can see how this is progressing and can be involved.Anyway thank you for reading all that! even if you don't choose to back this project, a simple like or youtube view helps a long way.",Lack of response / negative reception -There is not much I can do about that except carry on and grow from the experience. I want to be a video game composer eventually and I will keep pushing for that.,https://www.kickstarter.com/projects/sharprainmusic/video-game-covers-season-6?ref=discovery_category_newest,sharprainmusic/video-game-covers-season-6,"Hello again! Steve Sharp here to tell about my new project, Season six!A little background?I cover video game music by putting my own unique spin on it. I have been doing this on Youtube for around 3 years now. After a certain amount of tracks I release those songs as an album. So far I have created 5 albums of VGCM, all made with love and passion.So why a kickstarter for the new album?I have been doing this all on my own back. In my last kickstarter I noted that I need new equipment to improve quality etc. Now since that was unsuccessful I have learned to work within my limitations however I still have ambitions of improving what I have and bringing a better sounding project in the future. This will spill into video production and mastering quality.What will you spend this money on?Better VST's, guitar tones and video editing software.Whats next?Well regardless if this gets funded or not I will still continue to write music and cover video game music. I am simply doing this to better my situation in any way I can. I thank anyone for reading this and even if yo dont back this any feedback or support will be very much appreciated.",None that I can think off

Tiffany and I are San Diego-based pinmakers and certifiable cat people. Those of you who backed us for our Falling Cats pin may remember out cat Bliss. Bliss is an angel, but... she only likes to be loved on her terms. Which I think we've captured in our latest design, which comes in either black-metal or gold-plated!Blissany Chrysanthemum Healy (we give our cats middle names)But for those of you looking for a little extra, we've got just the thing! Who loves stickers?! I know I do!Who is Bliss?Bliss is the first cat I ever owned. She's tremendously kind, communicates well and seem to suck away pain and negativity like some kind of karmic Some of you may remember shortly after we began our last campaign, Bliss had an unexpected health-scare. At the age of eight, we were told there was a fifty/fifty chance Bliss had developed bone cancer. In her initial treatment, the doctors took seventy five percent of her teeth. Fortunately, we learned she should be okay. Tiffany and I were both very thankful. The process of caring for her was certainly an expense that neither of us was prepared for, but thanks to our side business making pins, we were able to come up with the money we needed.Why Kickstarter?Tiffany and I have made a lot of friends of Kickstarter. On top of that, we have so many more ideas than we could afford to indulge, we just love to try to proactively get as many made as possible and Kickstarter has proven to be a great place for that!","Risks and Challenges?Well, honestly, my answer to what could possibly go wrong is usually ""act of god"". Tiffany and I have made more than thirty pins at this point. So, as long as we get funded, they'll get made!"

It´s a great gift - for a lasting, timeless connection.Here is how it works:Capture the shape of a symbol or for example your hands or your babies feet, like seen in the video.It can be any item that fits in the foam box. Choose something that represents the moment you want to be remembered and cherished.Send the box back to us, we scan it, print the pieces in sterling silver and send it straight to you.Puta smile on your friends faces and delight your families heart. As an intimate token of love, to be touched, felt, looked at and be remembered, it is a truly special gift lasting a life time.Choose your own reward from the perks or choose from the packages as a great gift for the upcoming holiday season.Background:In preparation to this kickstarter fundraising campaign, we have tested many things. From various materials to workflows, printers and 3D scanning technology. We want to bring this idea to life!To produce a high quality, elegant piece of custom made jewellery, it needs 3 parts:1) A high precision 3D scanner2) Software3) A very good 3D printer.The difficult part is the scanning. We looked at inexpensive scanners for mobile devices and high end industrial equipment. The problem we´ve found with most scanners, especially the consumer grade mobile phone scanners is the quality of the 3d model created from scanning the foam box, which has a direct effect on the resulting print quality of the jewelry.It needs a special high precision 3D Scanner and special workflow software to make this project happen and create nice, elegant and unique pieces of art.Finally, we have sourced and tested the right combination of technology and materials and now do want to bring this wonderful gift to market.Therefore, we are asking for support to make the investment and offer very low prices forthe very first round of personalized 3d printed jewelry. These prices are for contributors to this kickstarter campaign only.We want this to get started right in time for the upcoming holiday season.Just in time to delight your family and friends with a unique and surprising accessory.With the ""Love Token"",you can enrich any home and touch the hearts of friends and families around the world.

To accommodate for unforeseen challenges, we have built in extra time to our production and delivery schedule.Getting the foam boxes to you as quick as possible is the first priority. To help with the second step, the taking of the actual print - we are preparing a tutorial with tips and tricks on how to work with the foam box, for example on how to work best with babies and release it on our website.During the campaign as well as after making this a successful kickstarter project, we will keep you posted regarding our progress via social media and email on a weekly basis.",https://www.kickstarter.com/projects/hdberlin/1-blue-chair-1-model-2-pieces-of-art-make-100?ref=discovery_category_newest,hdberlin/1-blue-chair-1-model-2-pieces-of-art-make-100,"My name is Simone Dornieden.
