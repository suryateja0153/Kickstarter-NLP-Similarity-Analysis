This project takes the ordinary deck of cards a step further in the amazing world of internet unlike anything you’ve seen before: Rage Comics are series of web comics with characters, sometimes referred to as “rage faces”, that are often created with simple drawing software such as MS Paint. The comics are typically used to tell stories about real life experiences, and end with a humorous punchline. It has become increasingly popular to create the comics using web applications often referred to as “rage comic generators” or “rage makers”Rage cards are fun, quirky and interesting; each one is unique and sure to delight! This time we upgraded the cards to reach the perfect fit for each image as well as added new rage comic faces to make the funniest deck ever!With normal transformational decks, the traditional Jack, Queen and King are a bit boring. With Rage Cards, each court card is a unique and original rage comic face.To avoid copyright issues, the Jokers are now the famous dancing LOL dad ; always making trouble and having fun. Because of their popularity, I have made 2 dancing LOL Jokers for each deck. That’s right: 2 dancing LOL dad Jokers!The box is fully custom and designed to showcase all the rage faces of internet. It displays the world of the rage comic memes in ahigh quality cardboard box. The box itself contains a few funnyhidden messages as well as secretmovie refrences in the back image. Can you find them all?I created a custom uncut sheet for this project to beautifully present each of the cards in a way that looks incredible! This is the star of the project if you donate only 1$, we'll email you a high definition printable poster! Make sure to add one of these to your wall because it looks fantastic anywhere!","Why 100$ goal? As it was said in the video, the first batch of 100 decks is already on the way and we hope we will raise enough funds to produce a second batch which is financially achevable if we raise 100$. Even if we don't collect enough funds for a second batch,  the first batch should cover all the rewards. So either way, you will receive your rewards."

Luckily, circumstances meant I could still sing, and I can still bring some joy to people by singing in nursing homes, and now I am wanting to create an album of Musical Theatre songs, a sort of going back to my roots album.Featuring songs that will be dedicated to my friends and family I'm hoping this CD will be even more successful than the last!Money that we raise will go towards--The Recording Studio Fee-Promotional Photoshoot and Images for the Album-Imaged for the Album-Fee to get the CD's produced-The fee to get into a studio to make music videos to promote the albumA lot of time and effort goes into making a CD and it brings me joy making these CDS for you all to enjoy.Let's make this CD even better than the last oneHattiexx","Obviously, being a singer, I use my voice a lot on a daily basis and as everyone does, I get poorly, I have a condition ""CRPS"" which means if I get ill, it is incredibly painful for me and it takes me a long time to recover.

I was set to go onto University and continue studying Musical Theatre, unfortunately, my body had other plans.On July 20th, 2015 I broke my foot getting on a plane. The doctors couldn't find the break and subsequently, I developed a condition called Complex Regional Pain Syndrome and here I am, studying Screenwriting.Just because I can't dance anymore doesn't mean I can't sing.

The CD sold out in the first 2 weeks and I made £100 for Arthritis UK. A charity that helps people with CRPS and Arthritis, which many of my friends and family have.This year, with some huge events booked in on the calendar I would love to make another album.

I have scored all 16 baseball games, and want to print them in a spiral bound Scorebook, with game stats, series stats and post-game quotes.Scoring baseball is a great way to enjoy the national past time.  It’s also a great way to record the action and recall the highlights, with complete details of all the action.As a Giants baseball fan, born and raised in San Francisco, I waited my whole life to see them win it all in 2010.  It’s been an unbelievable run over the last five years, watching them return to glory again in 2012 and 2014.  Now I want to record their accomplishments in a spiral bound baseball Scorebook, a neat summary of all their hard work and triumphs in three World Series Championships.Traditionally scoring has been done with paper and pencil (or pen if you’re really good and confident) on pre-printed forms.  But technologies advance and we can now score games with an app, and get all the stats along with the scorecard visuals.  I use iScore, and the results are fantastic.  I can edit and fix any problems, I can get complicated plays correct, and the scorecard output is in full color.  The app helps me keep everything organized, and I also get the batting, fielding and pitching stats along with the Scorecard.  The Scorecard printout looks clean, and is beautifully color-coded (things like green for base hits and red for outs).With three World Series Championships in five years, there are 16 total games the Giants have played, five games in 2010 against the Texas Rangers, a four game sweep of the Detroit Tigers in 2012, and the 7-game battle with the Kansas City Royals in 2014. This makes a perfect size for a spiral bound Scorebook, there are 40 pages in all, including the series stats pages.I’ve also designed some other rewards using the Scorecard cell style.  You can get bumper stickers, magnets and window clings with the critical winning hits in each Series.  I will also make the digital content available.  If you use iScore, I can share these games will you thru the app.  If you don't use the app, I can post pdf and spreadsheet files on dropbox for you to download.There are a lot of great plays and memories in this book. Here are some highlights from 3-in-5 World Series Championship Scorecards:2010 Game 1 in SF: A big 5th inning for the Giants: 11 batters, 6 runs on 5 hits capped by Juan Uribe’s 3-run HR.Freddy Sanchez opens the 2010 series with three doubles, and almost gets a fourth as Vlad Guerrero boots the ball around for his second error of the eighth inning. 2012 Game 1Sandoval homers in his first three at bats, enough said. The Giants rout Detroit 8-3 to start the series and give Barry Zito a win over Justin Verlander.2012 Game 4 Romo closes out the series sweep and clinches the Giant's second championship by striking out the side in the ninth, fanning Miguel Cabrera (triple crown winner) to end the game. Strike-out looking.2014 Game 1 First inning starts fast, with the heart of the Giants order showing their offensive skills, highlighted by Pablo's double and Pence's 2-run home run.2014 Game 7The Giants score two in the 2nd on successive sacrifice flys by Morse and Crawford.  Morse gets a second RBI in the fourth with a single, which turns out to be the winning run.After the Giants take the lead in the fourth, Bochy brings in Bumgarner on 2 days rest.  He dominates, giving up only 1 hit until the ninth.  The Giants made it interesting with an error by Blanco in the ninth, putting the tying run at third with two outs.  Bumgarner put the game in the history books by getting Salvador Perez to hit a pop foul to Pablo Sandoval for the final out, and give the Giants their third World Series title in 5 years. 3-in-5!Here's what a complete page looks like, the game scorecard (visitor on the left page, home team on the right), along with batting, fielding and pitching stats, and game box score:So why Kickstarter? The samples you see in the video are digitally printed, basically on an industrial sized laser printer. They look really good. But they are not as durable and they are susceptible to water damage. Offset printing quality is also slightly better than digital printing. The difficulty is that offset printing requires four metal color plates for the Cyan, Magenta, Yellow and Black inks. Because of the cost of these plates, the minimum quantity run is typically 250. So I need the funding to justify going to an offset printing process. If this project fails to fund, I will just get 10 digital printed versions for myself, but I'd love get the word out and share this booklet with other Giants fans.Other Rewards:Here's a bumper sticker, it's 3"" x 9"" vinyl, UV coated. It shows the three game and series winning hits. 2010 Edgar Renteria's 3-run home run, 2012 Marco Scutaro's 10th inning RBI single, and 2014 Mike Morse' 4th innin RBI single:A slightly smaller version for the fridge magnet at 3.5"" x 5.5"":And the Window Cling, coming in at 3"" x 4"":OK, if you made it this far, you are interested and probably sold on this Scorebook already. So here's my blooper reel from the Kickstarter video (it's harder than it looks, really!):Thanks for the support!Joe","I have verified all the stats from the official DVD and baseball-reference.com, but I could still make a mistake, I’m human.  I won’t be able to reprint anything if this happens, but if you find a mistake, you’ll have the knowledge that you found it, and you’re smarter and more meticulous than me.  I could have issues with the printing, but I’ve printed 10 copies of a digital sample run and all looks good.  I will verify the final print with hardcopy proofs to ensure it all looks great before the job starts on the 4-color plates. Worst case risk there might be a delay.  I could have delivery or shipping issues, that could delay delivery, but those issues won’t stop my success.Scoring controversy: 2014 Game 1, Pablo Sandoval is on fire again (remember 3 HR?), with an RBI double in the first, and an RBI single in the seventh.  In the ninth he gets his third hit....or does he?  The defense is shifted, with Moustakas playing short.  Pablo hits a hard grounder just to his right.  Like any good third baseman, he tries to backhand the ball, and it bounces off his glove and into left field.  They announce a hit, but during Pense' AB Joe Buck announces it's been changed to an error, ""No 3 hit game for Sandoval, but he is on base three times"".  John Miller also announces the scoring change, stating that there are three official scorers, and they must have talked about it, saying ""Pablo lost his third hit, it's an error on Moustakas"".  Then Mike Krukow says, ""I think it's the right call"". At the end of the inning the graphics show the box score with the error posted. And yet MLB and Baseball-Reference both show it as Pablo's third hit. I initially scored it as an error, changed it to a hit on the first announcement, then changed it back to an error at the end of the inning.  My stats show this play as an E5, which I think is correct.",https://www.kickstarter.com/projects/113864007/digital-flowers-python-code-generated-artwork?ref=discovery_category_newest,113864007/digital-flowers-python-code-generated-artwork,"Using Python code to draw Digital FlowersI needed to learn Python for work, and it made me wonder if I could use code to create abstract art. The great thing about coding today is you can google anything and find help.Not only did I learn how to create art, I created a program that generates a unique drawing from any special numbers. I'm using Python running with Processing.py to draw colorful digital flowers, that are unique drawings each time I run the code. I set ranges for many of the drawing parameters, and then I can feed it your special seed number to choose random combinations of those parameters, resulting in a unique artistic digital flower. It's pretty mesmerizing to watch it draw, a throwback to the 90's screen savers, resulting in a completely unique artistic creation every time.The rewards focus on sending you the digital files only, giving you the ability to print and mount as you see fit. This is your most economical route. I can seed the code with any numbers you want, up to 18 digits. Or I can just let it run random. If you really don't want to print the file yourself, I can do it for you, but realize I have to limit the options to make this simple. If you are a control freak and want to tweak everything, just order the jpeg files and have fun. Print as many as you want, and share as much as you want. I offer a large 18"" x 12"" print mounted on foam core for you to frame, and one on premium metallic photo paper (also on foam core) because they are super cool. If you want to print it on metal or glass, get the digital file and order that yourself, you'll save money over me doing that for you, and have all the control. I'm not going to share my code, it's only about 120 lines long, because I want to use it to create my gallery.If this project funds, I'll be posting a collection of my favorite digital renderings to an online art gallery, making them available for anyone to download or order prints. There are many online printing services that host artists and provide a way to allow customers to order reprints, mounted prints, or fully matted, mounted and framed renditions on metallic paper.More samples...Here are more samples so you get an idea of what they look like. These three were from consecutive runs. Flower StemNotice there's a straight line at the bottom of these samples? That's the discontinuity in the Perlin noise at the start and end of each three-loop cycle. I've rotated it to the bottom, to give the flower this vertical spine. Some are very obvious and prominent, some are hidden in the undulating shapes.The six examples I show here are pretty representative of the results I am getting, you should expect similar, but completely unique results.","The Python code is done and working in Processing.py, see the sample files.  The ""digital file only"" rewards will be emailed directly, no risks.  If you provide a seed number for a custom output, there's always a chance something blows up the code. If so, I'll make slight adjustments to fix it, and you will get pleasing artwork.  For the printed artwork, I could have issues with the printer which might delay the project, but there are lots of printing companies available, so it won't be an issue, you will get the print you order."

https://www.kickstarter.com/projects/impactagendamedia/silent-screamers-full-color-character-guide?ref=discovery_category_newest,impactagendamedia/silent-screamers-full-color-character-guide,"From Concept To CreationHave you ever wanted to create a fantasy world built around your own imagination, beliefs, and even speculation? I've always had a vivid imagination, and in high school I wrote a short story about several riders on horseback that weren't exactly what they appeared to be. This short story became the inspiration for a novel called, The Fall: Rise of Lucifer. Shortly after beginning the project, I realized that my universe was growing and a single novel could never tell the complete story. It was then that I decided that I was going to tell all of the stories the occur within the universe. This led to the renaming of the series and the writing of the first novella, Book 1: The Rise of Bacchus. As the book was being written, I realized that there was more that needed to be said, and out of necessity, David's Journal was created. It contains an additional 20 short stories that can be read for free online.Because I'm a dreamer, I want to take this series to the next level, and you have the opportunity to make this dream a reality, by helping to build this series from the ground up. Sixteen year old David has just had a fight with his father about attending the first open contact between earth and an extraterrestrial race. After storming out of the house, one mishap after another leaves him stuck in a bar with a strange man, watching the event on TV. Little does David know that these aliens have something sinister up their sleeves. David becomes an unlikely hero as he is forced to choose between hiding or saving his dad and his best friend Cassy. On his journey, he must survive vicious animal hybrids, satyrs, witches, and even a giant in order to save his loved ones. The Silent Screamers UniverseThe concept for Silent Screamers is an ever expanding universe that explores the invasion from many different perspectives. The possibilities are literally endless. As new characters and locations are added, the world becomes more complex, much like the Marvel Universe, except the heroes are normal every day people with normal lives. To give you an idea of what's in store, the first four books consist of heroes that were: a chess playing sci-fi fan, a former car thief, a drug addict, ex military, a bar owner, and computer hackers. Each character will have a rich background that will connect with readers from all walks of life. Why Concept Art Is Needed...The goal is to turn Silent Screamers into much more than a series of novels and novellas. The vision for the series is to add the following: I know that these goals are ambitious, but getting all of the concept art completed is an essential first step in the process. Now let me walk you through the character creation process.The Character Creation ProcessAn Interesting Cast of CharactersThe Silent Screamers Universe consists of many different heroes and villains scattered throughout the galaxy. After the end of The Second Great War, powerful B'nai and Benoth dedicated to protecting Shamayim from the forces of evil, take refuge on Earth, and serve as the universe's last hope of stopping the coming onslaught. Rich Cultural DiversityOne of the best things about Silent Screamers is that everyone will likely find a character that they can relate to because of the rich diversity represented in the series. Here is just a taste of a few of the cultures that are drawn from:Because the goal was to create a realistic world, characters reflect the look and ideologies from their cultural background, and not just the stereotypes pushed by some projects. There is a genuine effort to convey realistic representations.Social and Political IssuesAnother aspect of the Silent Screamers Universe that was necessary to capture, in the event of an alien invasion, are the various social and political issues that would need to be addressed. These include but are not limited to:While these issues are important to many of us, the series does not seek to take one side or the other based on how things are, but attempts to present them as things might be, given the invasion scenario.Sneak Peek - The Furies Sneak Peek - The GarudaSneak Peek - The Serpent Elite Goal #1: $1,000Upon reaching this goal, the money will be used to finish the main concept art for the series, and complete the full color character guide.*Shipping and concept art totals may increase, depending on how many pledges are received.Unlockable Art To Be Added To Character GuideGoal #2: $2,500Upon reaching this goal, the money will be used to start production of a graphic novel based on Book 1: The Rise of Bacchus and Book 2: The Rise of David.This will be the first step in getting the Silent Screamers series into comic book stores and comic book inspired conventions. Goal #3: $3,500Upon reaching this goal, the money will be used to start production of a graphic novel based on Book 3: The Rise of Yorgensen and Book 4: The Rise of Robert Jr.Goal #4: $5,000+Upon reaching this goal, the money will be used to start production on the animated short film project. Any funds raised over $5,000 will go toward the production and completion of the animated film project.Book 1: The Rise of Bacchus - $5.00+Sixteen year old David has just had a fight with his father about attending the first open contact between earth and an extraterrestrial race. After storming out of the house, one mishap after another leaves him stuck in a bar with a strange man, watching the event on TV. Little does David know that these aliens have something sinister up their sleeves. David becomes an unlikely hero as he is forced to choose between hiding or saving his dad and his best friend Cassy. On his journey, he must survive vicious animal hybrids, satyrs, witches, and even a giant in order to save his loved ones. Book 2: The Rise of David - $5.00+David, now eighteen has proven himself to be a fearless leader in the face of danger. For that last two years, he and Ziek have been waging a personal campaign of revenge on the satyrs for the death David's biological mother, and it's starting to get under Azazel's skin. Unfortunately for David, Satyrs, linocerous, and hybrid giants were just the beginning of his problems. After Azazel gives Bacchus the order to have David ripped limb from limb, things take an unfortunate turn for our hero. Separated from his family and friends, he must fight his way back to the safety of the underground city, while making new allies and enemies in the process.Book 3: The Rise of Yorgensen - $15.00+Now that the alien invaders have disclosed their existence to the entire world on national TV, Yorgensen, a spiritual guru to the stars is attempting to put a positive spin on their arrival. As the world becomes infatuated with the fact that “we are not alone” in the universe, they began to hand over control of the entire planet to the Galactic Federation of Light. Millions of Fae wait for orders to march through the streets and enforce Yorgensen’s new Peace Plan.Unfortunately for the invaders, David and his crew aren’t ready to give up their guns or the fight just yet. As the invaders push forward with their plan to disarm the planet, David must decide if he’s going to sit back and watch it happen, or if he’s going to make a decision that could have global consequences. No matter how it turns out, things will never be the same again. Book 4: The Rise of Robert Jr. - $15.00+ Now four years into the invasion, David finds himself in prison after failing to assassinate Ambassador Yorgensen. As our hero awaits his televised execution, an unexpected visit from a powerful enemy, presents him with an opportunity to escape his fate, but only if he publicly renounces his new found faith. No matter which path our hero chooses, his life will be changed forever. All PDF books will be sent out in batches of 50 at a time. Please be sure to check your spam folder if you do not receive your order within 90 days after the close of the project.The only exception to the 90 day rule will be the character guide. It will go out as soon as it is finalized. Estimated delivery date for the character guide is March - April 2015.Books 1 - 4 (PDF)For those of you that are expecting to receive PDF copies, those will begin going out immediately after funding has been completed. Because I don't yet know how many pledges this project will receive, it is possible that delivery could take a few weeks up to a couple of months.Books 1 - 4 (Paperback)For those of you that are expecting paperback copies, those will be ordered within a few days of receiving the pledged funds. Because I'm not sure how many will be printed, I have no idea how long printing will take. However, standard shipping from the company to me will be 5 days after printing is completed.Fulfilling paperback orders will begin the Monday following the receipt of the printed books, and every Monday after that to allow time for autographing. Full Color Character Guide (Paperback)It takes about a week to complete a character. To help lessen the time until completion, characters are being funded out of pocket until funding is complete. Printing and shipping time to receive the books must also be taken into consideration. The total time from completion to delivery is estimated to be around June 2015. You can keep up with where we are in the process by going to the Silent Screamers website and subscribing to updates.","There is very little risk involved. Unless an actual alien invasion happens, you should receive your rewards on time.

I've lived in Vegas my entire life and I've been gambling for the last 11 years. What I've learned in that time is that there are two main ways casinos make their money:Let me explain what I mean by breaking these two mistakes down for you:Inconsistent Betting: Most players walk into the casino and just hope to get lucky. They increase and decrease their bets without any strategy. This leads to big losses and small wins. My book shows you how to fix this problem.Chasing Lost Money: I've seen people lose $200+ trying to win back the original $50 that they lost. As the hole deepens, they lose even more money over time. My book shows you why keeping your bets consistent will help you win big long term.I won't lie to you and tell you that these results are typical or that you'll walk out with boatloads of money every time. What I will tell you is that I started with $100 last year and ended the year with a $25,000+ profit!!!These games offer some of the highest bonus payouts and some of the best odds around, and hitting the right bonus hand can net you as much as $8,000 to 1 (Flush High Poker).I know you want to see some proof of my claims, so I documented some of my biggest wins. Let me also note that pulling out a cellphone at a table game and taking pictures is highly frowned upon, and can get you kicked off of the table. However, there were a few cool Pit Bosses and Dealers that let me get a few pics of my big wins.At the beginning of the year, I sat down to play Paigow. Since my starting budget was only $100, I had to play consistent. I placed $5 on the bet and $2 on the bonus. This 4 of a kind paid out $25 to 1.Over the course of the year I've had several more 4 of a kinds and a couple of straight flushes, which pay $50 to 1. I also managed to hit 1 royal flush, which paid out $150 to 1.If you have a bigger bankroll to start with, you can afford to bet more, and as a result, win a lot more. My book will show you why placing consistent bets on Paigow can result in big rewards in the long run. This was the result of a $5,000 poker tournament. There were 5 players left, and I had the chip lead. We decided to do a 5 way split, with each of the other 4 players giving me an additional $100 for doing so. I walked away with $1,400 and they all walked away with $900 each. Not too bad for a $50 buy in.In my book, I'll show you exactly who to look for at your table, and how to relieve them of their chips. I'll give you a hint: Its not always the worst player at the table.Here is a picture from a Bounty Texas Hold Em tournament. The 4 pink chips to the left represent players that I knocked out of the tournament and earned $10 for each one. Again, not bad for a $50 buy in. I also came in 3rd place, netting me a little over $300.I did this using the same strategy as the one above. Recently, I won another tournament in 1st place, paying out just over $500, and came in 5th place at a bigger tournament, winning $250.Sometimes it helps just to be lucky. I couldn't get the focus or flash or light to act right in this photo. As you can imagine, lights were going off all over the place. That was a $12,000 win.The first royal flush was dealt out, and all I had to do was save it to win all three poker hands. Automatic maximum payout.The book doesn't cover machines at all, but I thought this would be a pretty awesome picture to share anyway. I don't play slots often, but glad I did this day.This book won't guarantee that you'll win anything, but over the last 11 years, I've figured out how to win more often and not walk out of the casino hating my life (it's happened on more than one occasion).Membership Has Its Rewards - Upon reaching this stretch goal, I'll add a section to the book that reveals which casinos offer the best player rewards, and how to get free food, rooms, and more just for playing.No Money Like Free Money - Upon reaching this stretch goal, I'll include a section in the book that tells you where you can get $25 - $500 in free and match play coupons, which means you automatically increase your starting bankroll. I'll also tell you where you can enter to win up to $2,000 in promotional chips that you can use at the tables.Get More Advice Online - Upon reaching this goal, I'll put up a website that offers tips and advice on making money at various table games in Vegas. I'll also tell you which games to avoid if you don't want to lose your money.Because self publishing is a lot cheaper these days, it won't cost an arm and a leg to get this book published. The money will be used to do the following:","The risks for this project are almost non existent. The biggest risk would be shipping time, but at the moment, fulfillment on time shouldn't be a problem. The book has already been written and is ready for publication."
https://www.kickstarter.com/projects/cathyvincevic/amazing-international-performance-exchange?ref=discovery_category_newest,cathyvincevic/amazing-international-performance-exchange," Ten artists from Bosnia and Croatia and five from the USA are meeting and collaborating on an international, cultural, and artistic exchange. Our theme is an examination of the issues of returning home after great trauma. The title “The Return” refers to the great diaspora of Balkan residents who were forced into exile by the war. Our process is experimental, our ideas fleshed out via Skype, email, and Facebook, involving all the artists. We are very excited about making a work that crosses boundaries of space and time. Though international cultural exchanges occur quite frequently our project is different because we are creating an entirely new work together. We will be united by our work. The primary mode of presentation will be a collaborative performance, including dance, performance art, sound, and musical score to take place in Sarajevo, Bosnia in September, 2011We want this particular exchange to be a real exchange of ideas and performances; a true collaboration that begins and ends with communication between the artists involved to create an independent piece, rather than many artists bringing their work to a festival and remaining solo. We feel there is a core structure that does not get addressed in the festival scene--who are the people involved and how do they improve or illuminate their place in the world--without having any real interaction before or after an exchange? Too often the perceived abyss between two cultures never gets crossed, the artist come, do their work and then leave.How would we do this? The performances are going to be fully documented, and with your patronage, shown to the world. Thank you.",,https://www.kickstarter.com/projects/cathyvincevic/sarajevo?ref=discovery_category_newest,cathyvincevic/sarajevo,"The Return' 'The Return' (a collaborative performance): an examination of the issues of returning home after great trauma. Ten artists fromBosniaand Croatiaand five from theUSAbade the question, “How do fractured communities reconnect?”. Through concerted collaboration over a 10 month period spanning global waters, air, and land masses; the participating artists propose “The Return” to be performed at the International Contemporary Dance Festival ZVRK Sarajevo in September 2011.There are many modes by which we communicate. We do this in order to connect andreturnto that sense of holistic community. The body’s expression, sound, verbal and text language, technology, computers and electronics have provided fractured communities various abilities to reconnect and un-fracture.Our theme is an examination of the issues of returning home after great trauma. The title“The Return”refers to the great diaspora of Balkan residents who were forced into exile by the war. This is a collaborative, improvisational piece situated on the bridge as a metaphor, for joy, for rebirth, connecting--for coming home, for returning. The fifteen artists present over the span of 3 hoursThe Return. The performance occurs during late afternoon on and near one of the bridges in downtown Sarajevo as the sun continues its descent. It involves sound, poetry, musical score specially created for this occasion, dance and other performative actions. The exploration of fractured communities continues with the divide between audience and performer. The connection a spectator has toThe Returnis integral to the over arching questions and theme of the piece in the festival. The “bridge” occurs through directing and guiding the audience to move in a gentle piece using pedestrian (everyday human gestures and motion i.e. hands waving in the air, heads nodding up and down—yes, etc) actions beginning from simple images that elicit those movements from the audience. These will continue to grow and fold into the collaborative experience on the bridge. With this, the line between the moment of “performative action” and ordinary street activity will be blurred developing a separate reality throughThe Return. The performance will be photographed, recorded and documented on a website. The piece reflects Sarajevo’s history and is not aggressive or confrontational tactics to draw the audience into their gentle moving expression and experience.",

Larger prints are available as well.About The ProjectHello everyone, my name is Destiny Nowicki, I am a junior college student majoring in advertising at Kent State University. For a hobby, I love drawing animals, my favorite to draw was foxes ,since I have a busy agenda as a college student, many times the only chance I get to draw is between classes. I draw digitally, on a drawing tablet using Photoshop and Sai as a tool to bring my artwork to life. One day as I was looking at my artwork, I realized that each one had a story when I created them, but I had never written it down. When I tried to write down these stories, at first, I had a difficult time. I decided to write them as poems, which made me feel less pressured, and the words seemed to come naturally as I let each story unfold. Once I wrote one story down, others followed , and before I knew it, I had written down stories for each of the foxes I had drawn, and really wanted to share these stories and illustrations with others. Each story incorporated a life lesson that I had struggled with, or helped others deal with in the past, and the resolutions that came from each difficult moment. I cherished that I could tell others these stories about through these cards. I told my mother about my idea and she was thrilled, I told her all about my idea but that I could not think of a name for it. She then responded that I should call it fox fables, since my short stories were about animals and taught life lessons, and so the name stuck. My goal was simply to make these card decks come to life, be able to share them with others at conventions within my community, and the best help I could as for was from the people around me.","Printing these out front and back at a local print shop near me and cutting them carefully to the right size is time consuming, That's why I gave myself at least a month in advance just in case I need extra time to complete things, better safe then sorry!"

(where she lived one street further)I was immediately fascinated by the architecture and structure and complexity of this wooden building. Since my childhood I have been building models and so I set myself the goal of constructing this temple as a 3D puzzle.For 6 months I visited the temple again and again, measuring the temple and analyzing the structures and proportions and using it to construct an paper model.In the beginning, the model had around 300 parts. After the third optimization in the 3D drawings, I reduced the parts to 198 pieces so that it was easier and better to assemble.With our small laser cutting machine, I cut out the first prototype temple from kraft paper and assembled it. But not only our Circle of Friends so also the monks were excited with the result and that's why we want to bring the temple to the market as a 3D puzzle.The state of development...We also designed a folding box for packaging (but it can perhaps be worked out even more elegantly). We also have drawn up the step-by-step mounting instructions independent of language (with the circle, triangle and square orientation) so that the manual can be understood worldwide.Now our goal is that we can use the crowdfunding revenues to buy the cutting tools for the series production and, in return to our backers to produce a small series that they will receive as a reward.",Risks? The prototype is already made and it works... so the only risk I see is that with the Corona problem in some countries the delivery is very slowly in reason of the transportation regulations (in the last months I also was waiting long time for the delivery of my orders) I hope that when we start with the serial production that the international deliveries be same fast like we know it from the past years.,https://www.kickstarter.com/projects/oliverredl/3d-printed-retrocruiser-build-your-own-motorbike-model?ref=discovery_category_newest,oliverredl/3d-printed-retrocruiser-build-your-own-motorbike-model,"Hello I am Oliver from the Retrocruiser shop. Native I am from Austria an at the moment I live in Thailand.We are distributor for motorized bicycles but since the corona crisis start our local business go totally down and I have a lot of time to stay in our office.In our office we have two 3D printer and one day I get the idea to design a small Retrocruiser model. After some weeks design and printing and painting and a lot of fine tuning this is the first prototype and it is not only a static model, it has a fully functional engine and turning wheels and pedals.And the next step what we want to do is to developing a compatible set of different frames, forks, tanks, rims, tires, handlebars, seats and engines, so that everyone can build with the combination of the parts his favourite motorbike. (from classic shapes to sportive cafe racer)Technical details: the size of the model is 35 cm long and 17 cm high an the scale dimension is 1:7 and the biggest part is 12 cm x 13 cm so you can print it with every small 3D printer (FDM and SLA) and the model is build with 50 printed parts and they are connected with M2 screws (2mm).Notice: we just sending the 3D printing files (STL) and the assembly instructions as PDF not the physical product.",In the next weeks we design the set of different parts where all of them are compatible with each other. After the work is done all our backers get the 3D printing files (STL) and the assembly instructions as PDF.

My name is Ryan Silberman, and for a good while now, I've been an aspiring independent game developer. Every year, I try doing something different and make my projects interesting by switching up my ideas for development. It's been one experiment after another, and this is my latest.Space Bloxxer is a game that comes off as a variant of games such as Breakout, Arkanoid, and whatever other brick 'n ball game there is, but for this one, I wanted to add a distinctive atmosphere and make the gameplay more robust by adding new mechanics in various levels.While I may lack video footage explaining all this and the game itself, I do have a playable demo that includes eight of the FIFTY levels that will be in the full game, as well as ""Hungarian Rhapsody No. 2"" as background music.Since my projects are still small-scale in comparison to bigger indie lineups out there, both the price for the game and the funding goal are just as small.Don't be afraid to ask me any questions!","There are really no true risks, as my method of crafting my games are nowhere as costly as the processes for bigger indie games out there.

I'm Ryan Silberman, and I'm a small indie game developer that wishes to continuously expand. For this game, I want to try and aim directly at the digital world and shop commonly known as Steam (Greenlight)!Missileman Origins is an oldschool-esque platforming shooter starring the title character, Missileman. Say what you want about his name (And I do know what would be said about it when looking at the gameplay), but the game will provide plenty of two-dimensional fun with varied and action-packed stage designs.And when the game doesn't focus on the action and gameplay, it will bring various characters and personality to the spotlight with dialogue exchanges and cutscenes all utilizing text boxes.I don't have gameplay footage at the moment, but I have something even better: A fully playable demo with a complete level and hallway with characters to meet!You can download the playable demo here:http://www.mediafire.com/download/m6e0ymrf2e3ye52/Missileman_Origins_%28DEMO%29.exeSince I consider myself and my projects to be small-scale in comparison to ""bigger"" (for a lack of a better word) indie lineups out there, both the price for the game and the funding goal are just as small. Missileman Origins will cost just $2 if all goes according to plan, and the $105 (as Kickstarter takes a 5% fee) goal for this Kickstarter is intended to fulfill the Steam Greenlight cost!However, since this will be a new direction, I will be striving to create the best game I can to separate it from my batch of smaller projects and prove it worthy as a Steam title.........unless if I make another project that's even bigger! I don't just plan on bringing this game along onto Steam - I'm planning to have my whole development process leap on board, which includes anything I'd make in the future after this (In fact, you could even gather a couple sneak peaks in the reward containing a collection of games I previously made)!Also, there is a nice selection of rewards to choose from! Here's what this little kickstarter has to offer!","Since my games are developed merely on my very own computer, I have no risks regarding anything external or anything like that.

Though it's had slightly over 8.6 thousand readers over multiple platforms, It's been dormant for almost a year due to lack of funding. The artist and I have been working on this for absolutely free this whole time, just out of love for the project. We'd love to keep Lantern Peak free to read, but it'd be impossible without some sort of funding. So we'd like to make physical versions here on Kickstarter for the more dedicated fans, this would also help keep Lantern Peak going! We'll be touching up some of the pages to make them look prettier too. If there's enough funding we'll even release a new never before seen issue!As for the original Spirits Among us Fans; Don't worry, the online web comic version will still be free as well as the updates. But you still might want to consider getting the physical versions since they'll have the updated pages first~Alex, A young boy with healing powers lives in a small town called Lantern Peak. Though his power is special, his life is still mostly normal since about ten percent of the population are also born with some sort of power.Spirit sightings are becoming much more common these days, Many of them are also very violent. In response to this, The government formed a special task force called The United Vanguard Agency. Their duty is to protect all citizens from any super natural dangers.At the age of thirteen, anyone with powers is obliged to join the The United Vanguard Academy to prepare them to eventually join the battle against the violent spirits. So in the meantime, Alex will enjoy his childhood with his friends and family until his call of duty arrives.For helping us out, You'll be getting lots of really cool stuff you can't get anywhere else! All the rewards were made with the idea of bringing out your inner child, Just in time for Halloween! This also fits the theme of the comics, As it's about the wonders of childhood and growing up.The funding will be used to print the Comics, make the rewards and depending on how much we get, we'll even make new never before seen chapters! We'd also be updating some of the art from the original Comics and even adding a few pages~We'd love to make more!

The safe haven in a world of fantasy and terror. Angel is the bearer of the Light Element and Kairi holds the Element of Darkness. The two young sisters will begin an adventure that will change the world forever.Gemini Twilight is free to read and we'd like to keep it that way. But in order to keep it free, We need help from you. The funds from this Kickstarter will go to making new pages and maybe even a full chapter depending on how well things go!If you would like to support this comic in the long term, We also opened up a Patreon! The rewards there are the same as here, Except on Patreon you'll get rewards every single month! Click on the image below to follow through our Patreon Page.Gemini Twilight #0 was originally released as a physical comic a few months ago alongside another series of ours called Element Soul. We're very happy with the way things have been turning out so far, But making a physical comic takes longer to make than a digital one and is also more expensive. For those reasons among others, We made the decision to make Gemini Twilight a free to read online web-comic.Gemini Twilight was chosen because its story takes place before Element Soul, So having its story chapters release faster makes more sense. The series being free is also a great way to gain more fans! We love our small dedicated fan-base, But we need to grow if we want to make this project our full-time job.We're on Kickstarter for a few reasons. The main one being that our Patreon for Gemini Twilight currently only has one supporter, While we're extremely thankful to him (Our amazing fan: Edward Prescott!) $5 a month is not enough to keep this series going, Especially if we stick to the Free-to-Read format.Element Soul pretty much funded issue #0 of Gemini Twilight so that one has slowly been posted on webtoons while we've been trying to make the pages for the next issue. So that's why we're here, We'd like to guarantee more pages for issue #1!The goal is low because we've been working on this specific chapter for a very long time, So most of the work minus the art itself is done. This campaign is to help us cover some of the costs for said art, If we reach the goal that'll cover a couple of pages. If we surpass the goal then that'll be used for even more pages!Music By: Ross Bugden","The only risks are delays.Whether they be the artist being too busy to have the art done on time or if for some reason I'm too busy to write the next chapters.For physical rewards, The printing company may delay or USPS may have some difficulties with shipping."

I want to make my masterpieces in the form of Ball Joint Dolls.A ball joint doll (BJD) is an articulated doll with ball and joint sockets, cast in resin and strung in tension. BJD’s are very life-like and differ in size from a few centimeters to about two feet tall. Most of all, these dolls are a beautiful artistic form. They allow an artist to create a character and bring it into the real world. Then it allows others to take that same form and customize it to become their own, completely new character.Ball Joint Dolls speak to me especially since I am colorblind. This is a form of art that I don’t need an understanding of color to excel at.Modern BJD’s usually have a sort of “anime character” quality to them. Most are made in Asia, where collecting them is most popular.I want to make dolls with a twist of the imagination. That is why I started Dark Matter Dolls (darkmatterdolls.com). These are dolls that take the originality and beauty of modern BJD’s and stretches them to the furthest corners of the universe. Possibilities are literally endless; they could be mythological, fanciful, futuristic, etc.The first doll I designed is a prime example. It is a human-dragon hybrid female.

Photos chosen that are added to the book will be selected in a manner that would allow the most dynamic experience for the backer to enjoy. Most photos will come with GPS co-ordinates. All photos will come with a short description of where and when the photo was taken, and a commentary of the subject in the photos if possible.","There are no risks in printing one book.

I am professional locksmith by trade, studied geography, GIS, energy systems engineering, in school and spent my 20's in the military. Each job got me thinking about ways to decentralize power generation. After about a year of tinkering I worked out each of the ""why not's and what if's"" I was really surprised by the results. The fifth generation of the design was durable, scalable, and really really effective. I trimmed down the function equation to as simple as I could get it, and tested a few wiring setups. I'd like to throw this idea out there open source. Please forward me questions, I'm still doing a lot of testing and I have a demo video up posted.To the best of my knowledge, the Power Flower is the worlds first amplifying co generator.  The prototype has a lot of room for improvement, but the fifth variation of the design has been able to produces a surprising amount of usable current.  The principle of amplified co generation is to combine two independent sources of electricity to increase collective output.  A ""solar turbine"" is a solar panel array that functions as a wind turbine, while a ""Power Flower"" is a solar array that spins a wind turbine, in a looped circuit for amplification.  By conducting the current of a solar array through a spinning turbine, the resulting wattage is greater than the sum wattage of both sources separately.  Each current source can function independently or in coordination depending on the weather.  What makes the Power Flower possible is the patented ""Elastic Turbine Array Axle,"" which allows for the consistent conduction of current around a spinning axle, with an elastic pivoting motion.  The elastic pivoting motion allows for the array to tilt while spinning without disrupting the circuit.  Amplifying co generation is my own concept and as far as I know it is completely novel.  I have been tinkering with the idea for about twenty years and this device is the first functional demonstration of the amplified co generation principle.  Not only is the Power Flower amplifying and co generating, it is doing so with only solar and wind power.  The goal of my fund raising is to build a suitable workshop to develop the device.  Once the device has reached the point of being a consumer product I plan on marketing it to medical and scientific institutions who's work requires electricity in remote locations.  Being able to demonstrate the principle of amplifying co generation has been a  personal goal for many years.  Now that I have a working prototype, my goal is to refine its function and appearance so that it can be more appealing to the scientific and medical community. Anyone can make one. The demo in the picture is designed to be made by someone with no technical expertise and a budget of $100. ","The goal is to create a standardized platform for decentralized power generation.  This is a lofty goal, that will take many more years of work.  What I can do, is keep the ""soap box racer"" demo up online, with updates for improvements.  With funding I will be able to create a consumer product for scientific and medical work in remote locations.  	By wiring multiple solar panels, in an array, and wiring them for a specific output, a solar array was able to act collaboratively with a wind turbine. the solar array can function without wind spinning the turbine and vice versa.  When the solar panels are producing a maximum amount of current and the turbine is also producing a maximum amount of current, the two sources looped through one another produces more output then the sum of both sources separately,  	Beginning with a lot of duct tape, the device was eventually effective, compact and durable.  My goals are to continue testing and redesigning for efficiency through diverse areas and climates.  The most socially conscious use I can think of is to use the trickle of power the ""Power Flower"" can reliably produces is to run refrigerators used in medical and scientific work in remote location.  	While constructing the device I considered several names,  Ultimately, I set it up in the park and asked people to vote on what to call it.  Power Flower won over several other options, and the voters often found the idea feasible.  In creating the Power Flower I made sure that all the components were commercially available and under one hundred dollars.  I think small scale power production at the appliance level has a demand in scientific and medical work around the world.",https://www.kickstarter.com/projects/155208900/solar-array-wind-turbine-integrated-circuits?ref=discovery_category_newest,155208900/solar-array-wind-turbine-integrated-circuits,"With sun, the array conducts.  With wind the turbine conducts.  With sun and wind, a turbine coil is a charged for an electromagnet, rotated by the wind. The video shows the current of a solar array flowing through, and around the spinning axle of the wind turbine. The solar array effectively spins the wind turbine by pivoting while rotating.  The array produces usable power when the turbine is stationary. The turbine produces usable power when the array is not energized.  The two functions together are a  Solar Array Wind Turbine. When the array and the turbine are both producing power, the array energizes the coils of the turbine for greater electromotive force. The array and turbine are integrated renewing circuits.  The integrated renewing circuits amplify one another for increased output. What makes the functions possible is the patented axle.  The demonstration model is ready for testing and use. I am developing this into a consumer product for medical and scientific work in remote locations. This is the first use of integrated renewing solar/wind circuits for amplified output.","There is a running prototype, ready for testing and use.  Demonstration models with instructions, requiring assembly, are ready to be shipped."
https://www.kickstarter.com/projects/406912226/writing-in-the-park-and-everywhere?ref=discovery_category_newest,406912226/writing-in-the-park-and-everywhere,"I'm a boundary-crosser in terms of genre...I write prose poems, creative nonfiction, quasi-fictional musings, and mythic-mystery-action-science-fiction stories as a matter of course. I'm also interested in the ways writing is performance...the way writers present themselves as characters, including blithely making things up about themselves, as well as ways they attempt to bridge the gap between themselves and their audience, all while publishing is in flux and our very concepts of authorship seem to be changing. I'm interested in the ways technology mediates this process and sometimes obstructs it, and how the bigger obstacle is often our own perceptions. I noticed, for example, how MANY writers use social media such as Twitter, Facebook, Livejournal, etc....and how the appeal of that for a writer is the feedback you get in near real-time, but how few think of that as ""writing"" in the same way that their published work is ""writing."" My response to that was my Twitter poetry project, The Traveling Bobcat Poetry Show. But Twitter, though advertised as ""social,"" is still isolated in the way that writers often are, and invisible, even when you post pictures. What if the writer was right THERE? What if people could walk up, ask questions, read your poem hot off the keys, offer ideas...do all of those interactive things we do online, but in person? How would that break down our image of art and the artist, and most especially that elusive and rarified beast, the Author?So...this is the next level, or the next iteration, or maybe just my next weird idea. I am going to get a manual typewriter and some paper (I already have an old typewriter table) and go out and write. In public. Scandalous!I mean to do this both as part of a formal, announced, pronounced and presented Art Thing and also just...for the hell of it. Stealth. You know, sit out in the park with a typewriter and a sign that says something provocative (like ""WRITER"") and see what happens.The money I raise will go towards supplies...a manual typewriter, paper, perhaps a dry-erase board so people can write their own thoughts or prompts, a canopy, that sort of thing. The amount I stipulated will get me what I need to get started; more will allow me to get an antique typewriter in good working order, such as an Underwood Standard Portable, which is the kind that both Carson McCullers and William Faulkner used. (That's him in the photo, or rather the statue of him that sits in the square in Oxford, MS). Being able to visually evoke our cultural notions of ""writer"" with my clothes, typewriter, and other props will make the whole thing more interesting and fun.",,https://www.kickstarter.com/projects/406912226/writing-on-trains-do-it-yourself-version?ref=discovery_category_newest,406912226/writing-on-trains-do-it-yourself-version,"When you heard about Amtrak's new residency for writers, did you jump up and down with glee? I did. My earliest memory is of my father playing Johnny Cash on the stereo and carrying me around to get me to sleep. I still know all the words to ""Folsom Prison Blues.""  I love trains. I love traveling. I love writing. This is all three. I applied, of course. But then it crossed my mind...I bet LOTS of people are applying for that residency, because it is an inherently cool idea, and writers are inherently cool people. They might not pick me. And yet...I could ride from here to New Orleans and back for about $150, an eleven-hour trip each way. Enough time to write a short story, if I put my mind to it, even with some gazing out the window and having dinner in the diner. (Nothing could be finer!)So, that's the plan. One train trip. One short story. Some field reports, of course, in the way of Tweeting, but mostly...fiction on the train. I have some short stories I'm currently working on: ""The Rose Run Round the Brier"" asks 'why did Barbry Allen have to die?' ""Malefactor"" is a version of Faust set in 1989 Atlanta. ""Metamorphology"" is about a secretary who turns into a werewolf and starts eating her way up the corporate ladder. ""The Baby Clinic"" is set in a future where genetic manipulation of humans isn't just possible, it's considered a parental duty, and ""family values"" takes on a whole new meaning. Any one of these would be a good project to finish, or I might start a whole new one, inspired by the rhythm of the train and the landscape floating by. ","I am a published writer who teaches college for my day job; the biggest challenge I have is taking time away from the rest of my life to write.  This is why a residency is ideal.  And there's something about the sense of obligation that a crowdfunded project entails that will put me on the spot in a good way; I'll spend my time writing rather than dithering around working on one non-writing project or another, because I know people will be watching.  I plan to take this trip after the academic year is over, so that I won't have other obligations to distract me.I write poetry, fiction, and creative non-fiction, but for this project I want to focus on fiction.  My work appears both online and in print in various places:  Magpie Magazine, Moon Milk Review (now the Dr. T.J. Eckleburg Review), Jabberwocky 3 and 5, Datura, The Dead Mule School of Southern Literature, Right Hand Pointing,  Luna Station Quarterly. I have one novel in second draft and another in first draft; those are ongoing, but for this project I wanted something that could be completed in the time frame available.

As for the original drawings, I have seen other Kickstarter creators who send out random pieces to the backers as this seems to be a more efficient way of doing it. While I think the best I can do is to offer a first-come-first-serve system where if the same piece of work is chosen, I will reward it to the backer who replies the survey first. Therefore, I will notify all the backers who pledge for the original art before sending out the survey.In order to reduce shipping fee, all the rewards will be posted with Economy shipping without tracking function. Where the print and/or original drawing are added in the shipping, the fee will be slightly higher as the size matters. Please let me know if you would like to add on the parcel tracking function, I will let you know the additional cost. In regards to international shipping (outside Australia), customs duties may be applied to art/print shipments in some countries.

Welcome to our project! We are a mother-daughter team, Dustie and Emma, bringing our love of theater & My Little Pony to you through these cute little hard enamel pins in ""My Little Pony"" Broadway original characters (OCs).I grew up on the original My Little Pony (MLP) and still have the toys to prove how much I loved them. Emma started watching the new version a few years ago and loved the new stories and updated animation.Emma has been designing her MLP OCs for years using her own artistic style. I have been admiring her works of art for years. In between the designing and admiring, we have been touring the Midwest to see our favorite Broadway musicals. Our top 3 favorites are Phantom of the Opera, Wicked, and Hamilton.So, after mashing all this love of stuff together we came up with this project!We would like to use this campaign to help fund a production of My Little Pony OC pins from our 3 favorite Broadway musicals.As you know there are production minimums to be met. This campaign will help us meet the minimum production costs. Any extra pins will be sold on our Etsystore.Once we hit our funding goals (and stretch goals) we will be able to invest in a batch production of the 5 original characters (OCs) and if we are lucky we can add a few other supporting actors that are in the works.We will be able to produce the Exclusive KICKSTARTER Pony and the Phantom Pony if we meet our $750 goal.Each hard enamel pin will come with a backer card (printed by Grandpa Dave-this is a multi-generational family project) and metal locking butterfly pin.We will ship internationally but the shipping rates (which we cannot control) and any taxes &/or tariffs will be at your cost.$950 Unlocks Elphaba Pony - We would be defying gravity if we hit this goal!$1400 Unlocks Hamilton Pony - Don't throw away your shot at getting this little guy!$1800 Unlocks Christine Daae - Say you love this project and help us get all 5 ponies produced! That's all we ask of you.$2000 Unlocks? - If we reach $2000 we will think up something really awesome for our Backers. Maybe a sparkle finish, a new original character (OC), glow in the dark?It will be quite a production that will deserve a standing ovation if we hit our stretch goals!Any extra pins we are able to have produced will be retailed on Etsy for ~$10 depending on the complexity of the design and costs to make.Any extra funds will be reinvested in our business to purchase editing & art software and marketing tools.The artwork will be matched very closely to what you see. Remember that color varies by computer. So the color on your screen may not be exact to your pin when you receive it. We use the PMS color guide and relay those colors to the manufacturer.","With all projects there are risks and challenges. We are working with a very experienced company for producing our pins.  We know from what they have produced for other Kickstarter projects, and  what they do commercially, they can handle this project with ease. Once Kickstarter releases funds and surveys are turned back in (you will pick the pins you want based on what funding goals were met) the pins will go straight to production.

They live here on Earth, alongside us. They’ve created a life for not only themselvers but their children as well. Deep in the heart of Normal View, CA is a school for the rare children that are gifted with powers but don’t know how to use them. However, there is a downside to every tale of heroism. These powers are not what they seem. While on the outside the powers seem useless, only a true hero can see them for what they truly are. These 6 children will either excel to the next course of their life in the advanced super hero class or become the greatest side kick of all!This is the summary of my audio play called Sidekicks. I have already written the finale episodes of season one and am currently working on season 2. It is basically School for super kids. What makes this different from everyone else? Some may ask. Some might even say Oh so its like that Disney movie... I know, I know. Yes it may very well be. However, I don't feel like there is enough podcasts out there for kids to be able to listen to which is why I created this, cast it, and have even acted in it myself. All the material is written by me and all of these actors have been recording for a year with no pay which makes me feel horrible. ""That's great but why should I support you?"" First off all, as I said all the actors are working pro-bono (with no pay) and I want to be able to give something back to them. The primary actors in this cast are children and while it's great to teach them to do something they love for free there is nothing better than being able to get paid for what you love to do. Most of the actors record from their home and with technology now a days, it's easy to do so but sometimes the recording quality isn't so great. With your donation we will be able to afford studio time to give the best recording quality for our listeners (you!) to enjoy.I’m also trying to find a good animator to turn this audio drama into a original cartoon on YouTube but to do that it costs money that I just don’t have. I’m already in the world of having a mini comic series featuring the protagonists Captain Whirlwind and Lightning Bolt. ""What do I get out of it?"" Well, in the next few months I will be ordering t-shirts with famous catch phrases from the show. As well as lanyards, blooper reels, and artwork for two of the protagonists in the show, and you will get full access to episodes before they are posted. No matter what you give, any amount will be one step closer to helping us continue with our production",The biggest challenge is finding a good mixer for this season and making sure all of my actors have the ability send the best quality recording of their lines that they can. Most of the actors are kids so it makes it a bit harder for them to purchase high quality mics or any type of recording equipment.,https://www.kickstarter.com/projects/sidekicksrus/sidekicks-season-2-redux?ref=discovery_category_newest,sidekicksrus/sidekicks-season-2-redux,,One of the challenges that could be faced is an actor quitting mid project but that is easily solved as I do have actors on standby in case such a situation happens.

I've put a lot of hard work and research into the project andI believe the results do and will speak for themselves. The drums are bigger,the vocals more alive and present, the guitars far more defined, and the basshas a new growl to it. I've also made it a rule that there will nosampled/sound-replaced drums on the album. TheCD will be packaged completely professionally. At home CD duplication neverlooks as good as the real deal and I want this to be like the real deal. Theplan as of now is to include a 6 page book with some liner notes, pictures ofthe Coexist gang, and whatever else I can dig up. (Note that the cover artshown is not the final design)I'vealso been in the process of putting together some audio from the earliestCoexist rehearsals and at present have found at least one unreleased song thatwill definitely be on the CD.

I'vealso been compiling some footage from VHS recordings of some Coexist shows aswell and will include that in with the orders for those who pledge $22. In thiscase, the extra $10 is further helping to get toward the goal that gets theCD's manufactured and you get the benefit of seeing us throw ourselves around ahot and sweaty stage.

What you hear are the sounds we recorded with minor edits (they could be counted on one hand) 15 years ago with Miah at Dwell Studios (now Sound Lair). The guitars had to be re-recorded because the sound quality and quite honestly the playing/intonation was very off.

https://www.kickstarter.com/projects/pentamantis/craneo-the-ultimate-head-armature-for-sculptors?ref=discovery_category_newest,pentamantis/craneo-the-ultimate-head-armature-for-sculptors,"It's fascinating to learn about the structures, bones, organs, muscles and tissues that make up who we are. From the very oldest sculptures that have been discovered to the most recent productions, the human form has been one of the most moving and impressive subjects of art throughout the centuries. Humans can recognize even a partial image of a skull when other bones in the body may look like bits of stone. We naturally recognize faces and facial structure. Studying the head as an artist can be a great resource to increase anatomical knowledge, capture likenesses, work on symmetry and proportion and much more. Here's a video about the process of Craneo.As artists we have the ability to create something from nothing. Craneo is another tool to help enable you or the artist in your life to be able to create, invent, and learn. Whether you're an artist, illustrator, in the medical field or if you just like to create things with your hands, Craneo can help you improve and grow. Or use it as simply an impressive piece of desk art that will stun your coworkers. As a sculptor I've found it very difficult to find a realistic and anatomically accurate head armature to sculpt on. It seemed like theywere either a simplesphere or they already had too many details that limit creative possibilities. For example much of the armatures that I saw already had the mouth, eyes, skin, and were already either male or female.Here's some of the armatures I found that didn't really work for me. Craneo however, is a uniquely designed skull that is perfect for using as a base that you as the sculptor add the skin, muscle, fat, hair, neck or whatever you want.Craneo is made so that you can make a head that is thin and bony or that is fat, thick, male, female, alien, monster, zombie or anything that you can imagine. It has all the basic forms of the skull without limiting your creativity as an artist. The Craneo armature fills up the space that otherwise would be clay and therefore you can do more with less clay. Craneo is about 1/2 life size in scale which makes it small enough to be conveniently storedyet large enough to be able to add detail.Chavant NSP is an ideal clay for this project. It comes in a variety of hardnesses as well as different colors. Soft clay is good for working on a larger scale and hard clay is good for small intricate details.For this project Chavant NSPmedium hardness would work best.Helpful hint: If the clay is too hard simply place it in a bag and place it in a bowl of hot water and the clay will become much more malleable. You can also cool it down to work on detail or to finish the surface.This is a professional grade modeling clay that is oil and wax based and that will not dry out over time. It is also ideal for making silicone molds if you create a work of art that you want to make into a more permanent plaster or resin. (This is the process that I used to create Craneo with this same clay) Though we see many faces daily it is very difficult to correctly draw the head and face in perspective without some kind of reference. The project started with the purpose of being a reference for artists and illustrators to see the basic structures of the human skull. Intended for art collectors, artists, designers, illustrators, those in a medical profession or studying the medical field, or for people who just want to have a unique plaster skull.It all started with the simple sketches that I would do of a small plastic skull. While studying the human skull I noticed how a world renowned artist named Burne Hogarth simplified the head into basic planes (see ""Drawing the Human Head"" by Burne Hogarth). I then decided to come up with my own 3D way of simplifying the forms of the skull to be able to use as a reference.I began working on prototypes in clay.After making hundreds of changes we finally came up with a design that we were happy with. This design takes all the natural structures of the skull and simplifies them to a more geometric and stylized form that gives a newly designed way of looking at the human skull.After the first head study that I did with Craneo it became abundantly clear that Craneo would need a neck to stand on. Because Craneo and the neck stand are two separate casts you can put Craneo on flat or at an angle and use some clay to attach it.The neck will give support and allow you to use more clay in other areas. Try to find ways to do studies from life. Photos are great but to really get the feel of a 3 Dimensional person you want to be able to see them in 3D! Professional models can be expensive so have a friend, sibling, spouse, or even use some mirrors to do a self portrait! (I often pay my little sister to try to hold still for 5 or 10 minutes at a time and it's cheaper than hiring a professional and she loves it) Clay hardness. This clay can be hard to work with if you are not used to using tools or if you don't warm it properly, especially in the early stages. Have a ziplock bag that you can put the clay in and heat up some water (remember that this clay will melt at about 185 degrees so don't heat the water with the clay inside the pot) once the water is hot tern off the heat and let the clay sit in it for a few minutes and it will be much more manageable. Also as you work consider having a blow dryer near by to heat up the clay if it starts feeling too hard. When you are getting close to finishing you may want to cool the clay down to work on the details and surface quality. •Sketching can be very helpful. Especially if you are doing concept art or characters and you don't have a live reference. Consider doing a few sketches from different angles (at least front and side) and refer back to your sketches often! •Remember that you are working in 3D and you want your sculpture to look good from every angle. Don't get so caught up on only one part that the rest looks unfinished or out of proportion. Constantly be looking at it from all angles! •creating a likeness. This is one of the hardest things in drawing or sculpture. Every person has the same basic features (eyes, ears, mouth etc) and yet we all look so different from one another. Differences that can be measured in millimeters can make your sculpture look like someone  completely different. Because of this consider what makes the person your sculpting different from ""the norm"". What makes them unique? Think of how a charecature exaggerates the elements that make a person different so that the silly drawing is almost more recognizable than if you were to trace over a photo. This can be used in a much smaller scale in your sculpture. Find what separates them from the average person and try to ever so slightly emphasize those traits without making it too obvious. Pay special attention to the eyes. The eyes can make or break what may otherwise be a mediocre sculpture (or drawing).  •The anatomy of the face. There is a reason I included some references for the skull and the muscles of the neck and head in some of the rewards. As a sculptor you can do a lot from life and some from drawings or photos but if you are serious about sculpting the human figure and especially the head then you need to think about what's going on under the skin. If you purchased the reward with the anatomical muscle reference use it! Consider trying to copy it for your first sculpture on Craneo. You can add the muscles one by one. Having a sound understanding of the facial muscles and bones is especially important if you want to be good at creating faces from your imagination. If your only interested in zombies, vampires, or anything humanoid this knowledge will help you immensely and your work will simply look better because of it. •As with anything there is no sound substitute for practice and time spent doing and sculpting. I am by no means the worlds best sculptor or anything close but I really enjoy sculpture and I will keep improving and learning as should you if it is something you enjoy! Facial features:Hair: it can be easy to become overwhelmed when it comes to hair but don't worry. It's impossible to get every strand of hair and even if you did it would probably look terrible in clay. Think instead of the hair as a collection of 3D masses. Break it down into forms that you can replicate with relative ease. Start with the general shape. Then you can make your tool marks going with the grain of the hair. This way you can add texture or you can leave it more simplified and abstract which might look better and go more with the rest of your sculpture. Experiment! The eyes: the eyes are perhaps the most important feature when it comes to truly capturing a likeness of someone. Perhaps it's because we spend so much time looking at people's eyes while we talk or the idea that the eyes are the windows to the soul. Whatever the reason if something is off about the eyes it is noticed. Because the eyes are so tricky yet so important you might take some time to watch some YouTube videos on how different sculptors represent the eyes. There are so many plane changes and subtle differences in shape, distance, size, and line when it comes to the eyes. Try breaking it down. It is basically a sphere (the eyeball) covered with the eyelids. The eyelids have mass! They are not just lines drawn over the eyes. They have thickness and that is important to represent. The majority of the funds will go toward buying the supplies in bulk. We would also like to purchase the resources necessary to finish this project as well as future projects involving metal cast products so stay updated to future projects. Every bit helps and we appreciate any and all contributions to help make Craneo a reality. ","I have tried to calculate the time that it will take to make the skulls and fulfill the orders with plenty of cushion. I worked with someone who ran a successful kickstarter and started their own business from the product. He was always willing to give me suggestions on how to improve and fulfill the orders as best as possible. If there are many orders I already have people that are willing to help make the molds, cement casts, plaster casts, assemble, and ship the orders. I hope that this experience will be most rewarding to everyone who participates.  Thanks for your support.",https://www.kickstarter.com/projects/pentamantis/curvilineal-beauty-figure-sculpture?ref=discovery_category_newest,pentamantis/curvilineal-beauty-figure-sculpture,"If bullet points are more engaging than this video I've got them too!If this goal is reached you will be able to choose a black sculpture on a light wood base or a white sculpture on a black stained wood base. By changing the color of the base it will ensure that there is enough contrast in the sculpture. I believe that no one should be a part of any business transaction that does not benefit all who are involved. I want everyone who supports this project to feel they have participated in something worthwhile. I've worked with creating molds before and am confident in my ability to create a beautiful work of art ready to be displayed.The base is approximately 3 inches by 3 inches and it's a little over 6 inches tall. 3""X3""X6""I can't do this without you guys. Even if you don't contribute financially every share will help this project and future projects become a reality. There are thousands upon thousands of artists that deal with the human figure. As a sculptor I have developed my own unique style of representing the figure that separates my work from the rest. I like to use realistic proportions of the body while abstracting the details and giving them a plainer quality. The line work created as different plains meet is an intricate and important part of each sculpture. As I abstract various parts of the body I like to keep in mind the anatomical structures under the skin. It is easy to abstract and simplify the figure in order to hide ones lack of anatomical knowledge but my goal is to abstract the figure while showing my understanding of anatomy so that it still feels natural, realistic and beautiful.Curvililineal Beauty is a maquette (small model for sculpting) done of the female figure. The pose is a contraposto (shoulders and hips at apposing angles) as well as a twist from the rib cage to the hips. Though the sculpture is stationary you can feel the movement of the body in this pose.As you can see I have no shortage of ideas for new sculptures. All I need now is some funds to buy more stone, tools, and education to create each idea. If this project is successful I will definitely share more sculptures with you in future projects!If you are interested in the design process here are some videos I made as I worked through this idea. I am currently recreating this maquette in a 500 pound block of Yule marble. The finished marble piece will be slightly different than the maquette due to the original proportions of the stone but hopefully it will be just as beautiful and elegant as this maquette. Only one person will be able to purchase the finished stone piece but I want to share the design and inspiration of this piece with everyone through this Kickstarter.As an artist I recognize that a huge part of each artwork is the name of the artist that produces it. As a beginning artist I want to keep my prices reasonable and I want all people interested in art to be able to participate in this campaign. In the future as the work of Andrew Joseph Keith becomes more well known the value of these casts will actually increase and future projects will reflect where I am at as an artist. I set the goal low in hopes that it will be quickly met and passed several times. Stretch goals will be the motivation to reach higher throughout the campaign.I recently started a YouTube channel to help motivate and inform other artists. It has over 20 subscribers so... yeah... I'm pretty good. If you are interested in art please subscribe to stay updated on future projects! https://www.youtube.com/channel/UC13s94-r_k0G5TGX1npZ_ggIf you enjoy art check out this video on some tips for building your own maquette for sculpting. Profits will go toward buying more sculpting tools, marble and other types of stone, as well as resources to help me become the best artist I can be. Every little contribution is greatly appreciated!",The first and most important thing to get right is a good mold with high quality silicone that can be used and reused through hopefully hundreds of casts without loosing important detail. One of the good things is that this design is simple enough that I should be able to do a single mold that doesn't have to be broken up. I have cast before and I feel confident in my ability to create beautiful art that is ready to be displayed. As I have trained as an artist I have pushed myself to be detail oriented and create works of art that are above reproach. If there are more orders I will simply hire people and make more molds to create more casts to fill all the orders.

When she was little, she would read and talk aboutplesiosaurs. Once she even dragged me to a 1:00 AM panel at Dragoncon because it was about cryptos. Over the years, I would look for plush toys of her favorite prehistoric creature, but everything I would find was not well-made or was cast hard plastic. Nothing on the market reflected what I would want for my child.My daughter is now grown, but she still loves these long necked aquatic creatures, and this love grew in me.13 years ago, Kickstarter did not exist, and the idea of hiring a factory to create my designs was beyond what I could do as a young newly divorced mother. Now, after 2 years of going back and forth on the pros and cons of large scale production, I have decided to jump right in and get my flippers wet starting with a creature that is so special to me because of my daughter.Updated: Because of the flu, I never filmed myself with Pleasie to talk about her. She is 8.5 inches tall, 5 inches wide and 9 inches from the tip of her nose to the tip of her tail. Pleasie also is weighted with belly beads so she does not flop about. She is made of super soft minky and her face is embroidered.I have been sewing dolls, dragons, and teddy bears for about twenty years professionally as well as sculpting dolls for the last 2 years. In 2009, I won an award for best textile/fiber in the Dragon Con Art Show and more recently, I won second place in the fantasy division of the 2017 ROSE International Doll Show. Bringing these things to life from my imagination is my passion, and I take great pleasure in what I do.The main reasons: time, cost, and production levels.The only true negative of going this route? That even when using the best manufacturing company, there is a chance that 10% of the plushes sent to me will have flaws and imperfections. This means I have to make a larger order to insure that everyone gets an adorable well-made Pleasie.But don't worry, even this negative Pleasie can turn into a positive. All the slightly flawed Pleasies will still find homes. I plan to donate them to various charities depending on their want/needs for new plushes: Toys for Tots, St. Jude's Children's Hospital, Shriner's Children Hospital, and a reputable Houston area child/family charity group that isLGBTQ friendly.Via KickstartersFAQ: To change your pledge amount, visit the project page and click the “Manage your pledge"" button that appears next to your pledge amount and then select ""Change your pledge"" on the following page.

Therefore, I only need a few hundred more to reach my initial project goal and get this project rolling! Thanks to everyone who donated in the past and I hope you'll donate again.Regards - AlexAbout The Game:Fat BRAT Cat is a straightforward yet addicting game for both Android and iPhone users. The object of the game is simple: eat as many mice as possible without being attacked by a dog. However, the more mice that FBC eats, the larger he becomes and the more difficult it is to avoid the attacking dogs.  How to play:This game will be a one handed vertical game with Fat BRAT Cat positioned at the top of the screen. Mice and dogs will fly towards FBC from the bottom of the screen. You (the user) must move FBC to the left or right in order to eat the mice or avoid the dogs. FBC is controlled by the yarn at the bottom of the screen.

The video is the debut of the next adventure and character played by CAT and is about what happens once pop has been forgotten.Without your help, we can't make this world exist. If you love pop music and helping creatives... this project is for you.The kickstarter will help:ChoreographyCrew and rental equipmentLocationsFuturistic and coordinated Wardrobe for CAT and dancersAnd most importantly, food and coffee for cast and crew.A little bit more information:CAT is a New Wave junkie who can’t drink black coffee. With her sultry songbird toneand dark synth, CAT Identifies as an Art Pop Singer/Songwriter.Influenced bypop culture and style, CAT uses elements of classic pop and rock. Her songs are expressive and playful with lyrics that romanticize everyday life.Previous Music Video: NOAHhttps://www.shescat.com/https://www.instagram.com/thegreatcaatsby/https://soundcloud.com/thegreatcaatsby","This is all or nothing. If we don't reach our goal, we can't do the music video. Without this campaign, there wouldn't be a chance to create a video for CAT. Part of what is so vital in this production is the world building. The budget goes towards location, dancers, equipment, wardrobe. If we don't reach our goal, we cannot create the futuristic pop world in mind. We absolutely cannot do this without your help.",https://www.kickstarter.com/projects/thegreatcaatsby/y2k-pop-music-video?ref=discovery_category_newest,thegreatcaatsby/y2k-pop-music-video,"STORYLost In My Head is a song about getting wrapped up in your insecurities and crying in public - disguised as a good, old-fashioned pop song. Just as the song’s main influences come from early 2000’s pop icons like Britney and Madonna, the visuals and story for the video are rooted in the same vein.The music video follows Kit as our protagonist, as she escapes her pod in space to come down to earth and save pop music as we know it. The narrative elements are a nod to the world-building and storytelling that came to define the music videos of this particular era - most notably Joseph Kahn’s work with Britney Spears in near future-esque videos like Toxic and Womanizer (a style revived recently in 2015 with Taylor Swift’s Bad Blood).In her mission to restore “pop as we know it,” Kit finds herself up against the lovable tropes of this genre - henchmen in trenchcoats, a laser security system, and more. Kit’s final destination is a command center that broadcasts vibes out to the human race - but just as she pulls a CD from her walkman to place in the console, she finds herself surrounded by the bad guys, or the “Enemies of Pop”. Kit tosses the disc in the player, ready to battle it out the only way she knows how: through iconic choreography.VISUAL STYLELost In My Head hearkens back to the cultural infatuations from the beginning of the millennium. From the rise of cyber culture and the shockwaves of Y2K, to the new wave of spy flicks like Charlie’s Angels, Spy Kids, and MI:2 - the video seeks to embody this nostalgia in a way that calls attention to the changes pop music has endured in this time, and perhaps some of the levity it has lost along the way. The homage to the early aughts also serves to remind us of another figure that pop has lost in time, which is the value of a “triple-threat”. In using this tried-and-true formula that fuses music with story and choreography, the video encourages viewers to draw comparisons between Kit Major and the multifaceted artists that brought this genre of music video to a head - such as Madonna, Justin Timberlake, Britney Spears, and more.The cinematography that comes with this style is sleek and energetic. Camera moves compliment choreography, and the use of low angles and dolly moves work to perpetuate the high-energy that is characteristic of earlier pop music videos (such as Oops! I Did It Again). High key lighting on dancers in crisp, white atmospheres echo the style of tech-obsessed videos like Leave It Up to Me by Aaron Carter, while the style of grungier story pieces in the warehouse could be compared to videos like Tearin’ Up My Heart by *NSYNC (or Die Another Day by Madonna). The wide angles of the boy-band era are welcomed back to accentuate choreography, as are the coordinated outfits to match. The set pieces for many of these references are fairly simple - the energy and excitement comes from the life of the light and the camera, as well as the creative, sweeping coverage of performances.By resurrecting some of the staples of 2000s pop culture, the video creates a world that can ascribe its own original dance moves, fashion, and moments to a song that so richly deserves to be iconic.THE SHOOT:Our shoot will take place over three days, and we will be fortunate enough to have a small crew of about 15 students working on this project. Unfortunately, as with any student production, our budget is very low.Food for crew about $10 a head, it costs $200 to feed the crew every day. If you were to donate even part of that, we would gladly appreciate it. All donations will be given a special preview showing and given a special thank you credit. If you donate, you will receive a sneak preview of the video, plus a special thanks in the credits.KIT MAJOR:With her sultry songbird tone and dark synth, Kit Major is an Art Pop Singer/Songwriter. Influenced by pop culture and style, Kit Major uses elements of classic pop and rock. Her songs are expressive and playful with lyrics that romanticize everyday life. Her music is heavily inspired by 70's and 80's pop culture, artists and musicians such as Prince, David Bowie, Blondie, The Carpenters, Fleetwood Mac, Nancy Sinatra and Van Halen with modern influencers such as Charli XCX, Carly Rae Jepson, Tennis and Angel Olsen.Currently attending The University of Southern California, the 23 year old released her single""Strawberry Milkshake"" in Fall 2018, was the special guest to perform at Dance Yourself Clean at The Satellite, and was named a finalist in the University of Southern California's Battle of The Band.Kit Major SoundcloudKit Major InstagramKit Major Official WebsiteKit Major Facebook PageKit Major Bandcamp","Part of what is so vital in this production is the world building.

https://www.kickstarter.com/projects/legomoviestudios/lego-movie-studios?ref=discovery_category_newest,legomoviestudios/lego-movie-studios,This is an adventure story by using Brick animations were the characters will get to experience many things on there travels like an RV trip a space launch to anouther planet where things are not as they were expecting as well as body transfer where the older couple gets a second chance at life Lego sets will be mainly used as well as some green screen and lighting effects. All the sets will be hand building each set and doing everything by hand with little digital effects. I am disabled and don't make a lot of money and Legos are expensive but priceless for more adults use them then kids and become collectors items. I use photoshop and iMovie along with my DSLR which I spent 1000 dollars on to do these projects. I am works hard to make a script and making the motions smooth that the Legos I will be filming at 30fps also I need to buy anouther lens that I need for shooting certain scenes. I can use all the support I can use to do this pass it along.,It takes many hours to film stop go animation we use wires computer editing and must build everything by hand. We us dry ice for fog and different lighting for the sets. We hope to have the movie out by next fall the project is all I do. I have been building Legos for 15yrs and filming Brick Films for 8 of those yrs. The challenges I will face after funding is received will be getting the Lego sets and other things needed to complete this film. Also i will have to film edit and come out with a final product the more help i have from bacckers the sooner i can shoot the full movie,https://www.kickstarter.com/projects/legomoviestudios/the-great-lego-adventure?ref=discovery_category_newest,legomoviestudios/the-great-lego-adventure,This is a Lego adventure that will take place in many places from the deep depths of the sea to the vast expanse of space. There will be age changing and people will get to live lives they always wanted to and never had the chance to. The main characters will experience many different settings that will surprise everyone on the way.Legos are a great way to produce stop animation and I want to show people this. I am autistic and I am good at building and making lego animations. I have a lot to show people what legos can do with them. My storys are complex using traditional sets and lighting going as advanced as using greenscreens to produce backgrounds and effects not able to with legos. i need all the help I can get to produce this film. The film will be a full length stop motion movie not a short film but one that you can sit back and enjoy.,"The challenges to produce this is both legos being valuable and hard to get as well as getting everything I need. I had to find all the people to voice the characters as well as write a script. One of the biggest challenges will be to make the Legos move as smooth as possible on screen but I am up to the challenges. The techniques I will use took a long time to learn and tons of practice. I am qualified by the fact that i have been working with legos and stop animation for 8yrs as well as taking class on the subject as well as practicing. I also have great knowledge of photo editing, cameras and legos as well as script writing, lighting and animation techniques. I believe the Lego films made with stop animation needs to gain more attention then it has had over the years. I also hope to enter a film festival once the film is complete."

https://www.kickstarter.com/projects/christiancore/cmb-praise-metal-revolution?ref=discovery_category_newest,christiancore/cmb-praise-metal-revolution,"I am raising money to launch my next EP ,""Praise Metal Revolution."" Praise Metal Revolution is exactly what it sounds like, modern christian worship songs taken and remade into brutal, heavy metal instrumentals, and is for the Christians out there who enjoy music that is a lot heavier and more Passionate!I normally do metal instrumentals, but with this project I want to step things up and add vocals! So there will be two versions of Praise Metal Revolution, one with vocals and an instrumental version.When I was first getting into metal music, the Christian metal bands I listened to inspired me in so many ways. Christian Metal isn't just music it is a community that encouraged me and welcomed me in. As a heavy metal guitarist you can kinda figure that when I wanted to play in church people didn't like the idea, they got over it though and I started playing in church just nothing super wild. The more I served with my talent as a guitarist the more I felt God calling me to building a ministry and a career in music. I have been making music since, and the reason why is I want to inspire you with my music the way my favorite bands reached out and inspired me even in the ashes of defeat.This is why I am making Praise Metal Revolution, it is not just for my career, it is more for the ministry and I will give it everything I got to make it the best I can, and trust God to step in and do what only He can do. May God be glorified with what happens with this project!So let's talk about some of the rewards, this will be FUN!!!Here is a video I did to explain the rewards.Here is my Latest Album Metalcore Symphony Volume II. I just released it on the launch day for this fundraiser, and the first 10 backers will get a free download of this!If you guys are wondering about my previous EP Metalcore Symphony here it is so go ahead and headbang to it!Here is my Ep FollowCore Standing Alone! You can Jam to it as well!!!","The main thing I am not sure about is how long it will take to get everything done and shipped out and how long that will take to ship, so I put December of this year as the shipping date, it could be sooner and I will do everything I can to make sure it's not later!",https://www.kickstarter.com/projects/christiancore/cmb-metalcore-symphonies-cds?ref=discovery_category_newest,christiancore/cmb-metalcore-symphonies-cds,"Help me make Physical CDs! Last year I released two records, Metalcore Symphony, and Metalcore Symphony Volume II. These like all my releases are self released and I do not have the funding to make physical cds but I asked all of you my fans about doing a fundraiser to make some and had many people who wanted to have physical cd's!So I am putting the two symphonies put into one cd compilation as well as a few other releases that will make a 20 track cd. Doing this as a compilation cd would also help to save on costs of making the cd, so if 8 people pledge 25 for the physical cd we will reach our goal of 200 very easily! If we make it way past that if God is willing, I will have merch made like t-shirts and jackets made, definitely beanies!If you haven't heard my music before here are the releases that will be on the cd's.Here is my latest EP Deathcore Symphony that will be a bonus to the two symphonies!This is a Christmas song, a cover for Carol Of The Bells.","I am sorry that the shipping costs are kind of high for those not in the U.S. I am unsure how much it would be having the cd's sent in different parts of the world, that is the only reason the shipping costs are high, I plan on doing all the packaging and shipping myself so I want to make sure I can get it to you guys!"

Using ancient documents like the Bible and the Book of Enoch, reality and fantasy converge with blurred lines. The Hybrids are the genetic ancestors of the ancient Nephilim! Though this lends to a very action packed and massively overpowered heroes, it's the humanity of the story that takes center stage. Our characters deal with love, loss, and faith in a very real, very human way. Hybrids is just one part of the epic shared universe being created by Star Cross Comics. Over the next few months we have slotted to release issues 4 and 5 of Hybrids to wrap up this first arc. ","With this current issue, the risks are low.  After the release of the first issue, we changed publishers and did a soft release of issue 2.  Our biggest challenge is getting the comics into the readers hands.  That is where things like Kickstarter come into play.  Through this platform we will be able to distribute the first 3 issues.  The next 2 issues are currently being produced right now!  If you support this Kickstarter, you will be able to do so with confidence.  Production is done for all three issues and the rewards.  All we will be waiting on is the printer.

It's free to use and modify (MIT License).You could just solder manually 8 wires to the tiny RFM75 radio, that's true. But Raspberry Pi looks so pretty with the rapidradio and we all love working with beautiful designed devices, don’t we?Isn’t it just beauty? No, it’s not. It is beauty and it works! How cool is that?rapidradio means the simplest wireless connectivity for your Raspberry Pi.It’s a half-duplex 2.4GHz transceiver based on the RFM75 module (made by HopeRF). It’s a perfect solution for any kind of home automation, robotics, DIY projects, Arduino-to-RaspberryPi projects etc.You will be surprised how much you can reach using rapidradio.

I have self-produced 2 CDs in the past and want to make this my 3rd. I am planning on walking the Camino de Santiago (the French Way) in April and May of 2014.When i return i will be producing a CD about the experience as well as including a number of pieces of music i have already written. Each song will have a ""travel"" component to it, and the CD's working title is ""Camino de Santiago"".Thus far i have composed the following pieces that will almost certainly be included on the CD1. On the Road to Glen Ullen (a silly happy song that i wrote inspired by the name of a town in North Dakota2. Deus Vult (a song written in the style of 12th century crusade songs) you can hear a amateur recording here:http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hVDPM8ppFrI3. He Sailed Away (another troubadour style piece) http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6yzc3xWBZHM4. Roll Ye Waves short clip here:http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v9cAOlXsFpk5. Camino de Santiago (the background to the video and title track)6. Come Back to Me (a song about a man going to war)7. Home (a song about traveling and finding home far from home)8. Welcome (a song welcoming travelers)Plus 4 songs that i have not selected yet. i hope to write several additional songs while on Pilgrimage, and would include these. There will be a minimum of 12 tracks...I will be working with several local musicians including my adult daughter and son, who i have worked on extensive harmony with and several other vocalists as well as a guitarist. we will be working accompaniments and more.by way of backgroundI was diagnosed with Chronic Myelogenous Leukemia in Sept. of 2011. Since thenI'vehad various health problems including having my gallbladder (an issue that was probably the result of my leukemia) removed inAprilof 2013. It's been hard not to let CML and my health issues be the center of how I live my life.Shortly after I was diagnosed, I heard about the Camino (Rick Steve's travel show had an episode that mentioned it) and thought, someday... if I get healthy enough, I would like to do that. I want to walk in the footsteps of medieval people...make a pilgrimage. But i wasn't healthy enough.Almost 2 years later I'm finally pretty healthy. I've switched medications from one daily oral chemotherapy to another, I've had surgery, a couple of bone marrow biopsies, etc. My chemo meds have pushed my leukemia into as much of a ""remission"" as those of us with CML get. And life really is short. so,....For thousands of years people have gone on pilgrimages to change their lives. some years ago i quit performing music professionally because it became too much for me, with a toddler at home. i play harp, bodhran, and guitar as well as several wind instruments but am primarily a vocalist. now that my toddler has grown up and i have realized how short life is, i want to go back to finally produce the 3rd CD that i always intended to.I am be working with a local studio that charges about $50.00 an hour. the last CD that i recorded took about 60 hours, with the addition of more musicians, i expect this to take longer. so i am estimating about 100 hours to record and master the CD. the resulting cost should be approximately $5000.00. For the production of CDs i have located a manufacturer that .will produce CDs for a unit price of approximately $5.00 each. ($500 for 100 CDs)i will be using a local artist to do some black and white artwork as well as photographs from walking a pilgrimage. the artist is willing to provide the work for free as a means to build his portfolio.There are a variety of further costs that will add up to close to $3000 to actually walk the pilgrimage, but since kickstarter is all or nothing, i am asking for enough to make the CDs and hoping that i might get pledged enough to cover those additional costs, but plan to cover the cost myself if i do not.a bit about the pilgrimage itself: i have belonged to the SCA for years and intend to walk in clothing i will make myself in 12th century styles. (i will be wearing commercially made shoes tho). i will start my pilgrimage Saint-Jean-Pied-de-Port, walking approximately 460 miles to Santiago. while this sounds like an insurmountable task, thousands of people of all ages complete the walk every year. the pilgrimage is intended to be a mile marker in my life, the CD will be my return to the thing that i have most loved doing. life is simply too short to do something that you are less than passionate about.","in general i have found through the last 2 CDs that the major impediment to finishing is adequately rehearsing before beginning recording. The thing that most caused delays and other problems related to being able to get into the studio and lay down tracks in a timely fashion. spending lots of time in rehearsal so that the pieces are ""cold"" when i walk into the recording studio is the best solution. also being willing to come up with creative solutions, including changing the accompaniment, and harmony. these are most easily worked out with flexibility and a willingness to reassess things at the time. being willing to do the hard work is honestly the best way to complete a project. and having faced much harder in the past few years, i am simply not afraid of facing the hard work. especially not for something i am passionate about.walking the camino typically takes 30 days, so while there may be delays, i have allotted 45 days to complete it. the biggest delays are caused by weather and blisters. with extra days, if the weather is bad i can wait a day, and with extra days, i should be able to walk slower making blisters far less likely. additionally i have several people that would be available, if necessary, to come and walk with me.",https://www.kickstarter.com/projects/808193390/castle-fibers-goes-global?ref=discovery_category_newest,808193390/castle-fibers-goes-global,"Castle Fibers is my Yarn/Pottery Company.

Lets bring this to life!",There should not be any challenges to this project. There is already a printing company that is willing to work with us during the project. The shipping and delivery of this project will be on schedule.
https://www.kickstarter.com/projects/amandafaye/saturine-one-womans-evolution-as-poetry?ref=discovery_category_newest,amandafaye/saturine-one-womans-evolution-as-poetry,Saturine is a poetry collection I started a couple years ago in preparation for my 29th birthday. The idea was to write a collection of poems about various people I’ve met over my life who have influenced the person I have or have striven to become. The title Saturine is derived from Saturn and the astrological theory of the Return to Saturn that takes place around a person’s 29th year. As I approached that period I couldn't help but be retrospective about the people/places/events that played a significant part in my becoming the young woman I am as opposed to the one I envisioned myself being when I was a child.The money raised via this Kickstarter funding campaign will go towards the cost of printing/binding the chapbook.,,https://www.kickstarter.com/projects/amandafaye/bespoke-vintage-t-shirt-subscription?ref=discovery_category_newest,amandafaye/bespoke-vintage-t-shirt-subscription,This project is inspired by two of my current obsessions: subscription box services and vintage shopping/antiquing.Let me use my passion for searching out unique statement pieces at the plethora of vintage clothing shops in Northern California (and occasionally Southern California) to update your wardrobe with perfect vintage t-shirts that fit your lifestyle and personal style ethos.Vintage t-shirts are essential statement pieces with some rare shirts selling for up to 4 figures.https://www.newyorker.com/culture/on-and-off-the-avenue/the-ephemeral-appeal-of-the-four-figure-vintage-t-shirtLet me save you time and money by handpicking a new to you vintage t-shirt each month.,"I've researched similar projects to see what worked and didn't work during their execution/delivery stage.  I've set my reward tier pricing to account for the most common challenges (shipping, actual cost of product acquisitions vs pre-launch cost estimates, packaging costs which is why I'll be shipping in padded envelopes instead of boxes to reduce shipping costs).The only potential risk I can not guarantee I've safe guarded against is delays in delivery due to life events. If at any point I anticipate that life circumstances will result in later than expected delivery I promise to clearly communicate this to all backers the reason for the delay and anticipated delivery dates immediately."
https://www.kickstarter.com/projects/1639195067/black-raspberry?ref=discovery_category_newest,1639195067/black-raspberry,"A desktop computer case for the new Raspberry Pi 4. Featuring SATA hard drive support, an oversized power supply, a power button, and a cooling fan all neatly housed in a 3d printed case.Makes a great server too!I've always found the Raspberry Pi to be a little bit clumsy to work with because the ports are on all sides of the board, and using wimpy cell phone chargers as power supplies makes the Pi very sensitive to even the smallest power glitch. Also the micro SD card is prone to wearing out and going corrupt over time with repetitive read/writes. I've solved all of these problems with the Black Raspberry!A 2.5"" laptop size hard drive (not included) mounts easily under the lid. A USB3.0 SATA adapter is included with each reward. If you have a lot of data to store you can add a serial ATA hard drive as big as you like. I recommend a solid state drive.Each Black Raspberry includes a 5V 5A external power supply. I find that the small power supplies typically used with a Raspberry Pi are not very robust and can't ride out even the slightest power glitch. I've solved this problem with a big oversized 5 Volt 5 Amp power supply.All of the Raspberry Pi's ports are located on the back of the case, including two HDMI ports, Ethernet, audio, two USB 2.0 ports, and the power. The front panel also has one USB 2.0 port.A 50MM cooling fan is included and fits nicely inside the case to keep the Pi and the hard drive cool. The fan blows directly on the CPU so a CPU fan is not really needed. I still recommend a heat sink.The fan turns on when the Raspberry Pi is powered on.I designed a custom printed circuit board to control power to the Raspberry Pi. One press of the backlit power switch on the front turns the Pi on. When you press the switch a relay closes and latches. There is a time delay circuit that holds the relay closed until later in the boot sequence when a GPIO pin goes high to keep the relay latched. You'll need to configure a GPIO pin to go high in the boot sequence and low in the shutdown sequence in order to make this work. This can be done by editing /boot/config.txt, and adding the following at the top of the file:dtoverlay=gpio-poweroff,gpiopin=23,active_lowThe assembly instructions will include step by step instructions on how to do this. The first edition of Raspbian Buster was did this beautifully by switching the 3.3 volt pin of and on at exactly the rite time. Just before the launch of this project I updated to the latest version of Raspbian Buster and I discovered that the 3.3 volt pin and USB power stayed on after shutdown, keeping everything powered on. Apparently they changed this on purpose because it was causing a problem with some hats. Supposedly you can change this behavior, but it's a complicated process and I haven't tried it. I think it's better to just use a GPIO pin to keep the relay latched closed. You can read more about this here:https://www.raspberrypi.org/forums/viewtopic.php?f=117&t=246027The Black Raspberry will likely be compatible with all future revisions of the Raspberry Pi, and it's competitors. This is because none of the ports protrude directly from the side of the case. So if the form factor of future Raspberry Pi's is different, this shouldn't matter.I have established a relationship with several manufacturers in China that are ready to manufacture all of the custom parts required for the Black Raspberry. Once funding is successful I will immediately order these parts, and begin 3D printing the cases. Once all of the parts have arrived from China, I will begin shipping the rewards shortly thereafter.You will notice one small difference between the prototype and the Black Raspberry you will receive. The HDMI cables will be custom manufactured HDMI cables instead of the FPV cables shown in the pictures of the prototype. The HDMI cable shown in the picture below is what you will receive. The sample cables I had custom made in China were too long and they were difficult to fit into the case, so I used some FPV HDMI cables I already had to build the prototype. The HDMI cables you will receive will fit perfectly.","The biggest risk to the project is that an overseas manufacturer could fall through and not delver, or deliver later than the agreed upon date. I will make every effort to mitigate this risk, by thoroughly vetting each supplier. I expect everything to go smoothly.",https://www.kickstarter.com/projects/1639195067/the-raspberry-pi-and-electronics-printed-circuit-board-ruler?ref=discovery_category_newest,1639195067/the-raspberry-pi-and-electronics-printed-circuit-board-ruler,"The moment I learned about PCB rulers I had to have one. But no PCB ruler that I could find on the internet was quite what I wanted, so I made my own! I put quite a bit of time and effort into perfecting this ruler, and I think the end product is really nifty. So, it seemed like a shame not to share it. These rulers are rather expensive to manufacture in small batches, so I need your help! At minimum, I can sell the prototype batch that I already have manufactured, but I would really like to manufacture 1000 or more rulers.I crammed every piece of information about the Raspberry PI and electronics that I could onto the ruler. My goal was to put every pin out, and formula that I use from time to time but I don't quite remember in one easy place. It's exactly the rite size to fit into a shirt pocket, and it's very attractive. The finish is lead free ENIG (Electroless Nickle Immersion Gold.) The circuit board material is FR-4 with green solder mask.I intend to ship the rewards more or less in the order that the pledges are received. If everything goes perfectly I'll get the early bird special rewards out the door the day after the project ends, and the rest of the rulers will all go out a few weeks to a month later. If the campaign turns out to be wildly successful, it may take longer to get the rewards out the door, especially for international backers given that I will have to fill out a customs declaration form for each reward sent overseas. For simplicity, I plan to ship the rulers in an envelope with a postage stamp, so there won't be any tracking. I plan to use a circuit board manufacturer that I have used many times in the past, and they have proven to be very consistent and reliable. They should be able to manufacture several thousand rulers in about a week's time, and ship them to me via airmail without any problems.You may get a ruler with a faint logo from the manufacturer of the raw FR-4 circuit board material.They are very faint and I don't think they take away from the aesthetics of the ruler. There's a chance you'll get one of these logos on your ruler.","I see this project as being very low risk. The rulers consist of one part, made by one manufacturer that I've used on many occasions. Your ruler could get lost in the mail. If this happens I'll make it rite, guaranteed.The biggest challenge that I foresee is shipping all of the rewards in a timely fashion in the event that the project is wildly successful. If this is the case You'll still get your ruler, but possibly later than planned. That said, if I do end up with more orders than I can manage I anticipate utilizing a shipping service or hiring some help to fulfill the rewards."

For those that want the longer story, here it is: We,Glenn Grigsby and Evan Butler, just want one thing, to thank people from the bottom of our hearts.This book, when published, will just be filled with heart-felt thank you's to our friends, family, backers, and people who have influenced us in our life. We don't want to be book rock-stars.We just want to make a simple paperback book - 9x7 inches and about 200 pages. It'll feature just be a simple thanks from us, the creators, to you, the backers.To self-publish and to make the book affordable, I need to put in a bulk order with the printer. It will cost me about $200 to order 20 books.With this Kickstarter campaign, you can pre-order the book, which will help us decide the right amount of books to get printed, and give us some of the cash up front to make it all happen.There are a few different rewards on the right of this page to choose from, but the most popular will be to order a paperback, thank you letter, and e-book copy of the book.It'll be cheaper to pick up the book(s) in person, but shipping is an option too.The books will be shipped to us at the end of March and we're planning a release party / book signing at the beginning of April (more details to follow on that).I really feel the Thank You project has been a community project from the beginning --- from those we've known since birth and grown up with, to our newer followers and supporters online (hi Facebook fans!).Together, we just want to thank you for just existing. Thank you SO much for your support. I'm truly #blessed.- Evan& GlennP.S. Wanna help? It's pretty easy and I think you know what I'm going to say:1. Look at the rewards on the right and make a pledge.2. If you enjoy this project and want to see this book succeed but don't have any cash to put down at the moment - share the project. Tell your friends, share this page on facebook, shout it off the roof-tops. Your friends may not listen to me - but they'll definitely listen to you.You rock. Thank you! :)BTW: If you miss out on the initial run of books, they will be available for purchase at a later date for about $15+S/H.","The only real challenge that I see will result from friends, family, strangers, and backers who doubt our sincerity.Evan and I truly do want to thank each and every one of you - you all mean so much to the both of us. Cynics out there will tell us - and tell you - that this is all just some scam for a few quick bucks: don't believe those jerks for a second! Evan and I stand to make no money from this project. The money raised will go solely to the production of this book of thanks - thanks to you. In addition, Evan and I both live with our parents, so we have no real living expenses and thus don't really need money. This book is for you, our cherished ones.Thank you for your support (even if you choose to not be a backer). We love you.Thanks again,Glenn"
https://www.kickstarter.com/projects/441570786/around-the-world-in-80-washing-lines?ref=discovery_category_newest,441570786/around-the-world-in-80-washing-lines,"From the concept of the Jules Verne book ‘Around the World in Eighty Days’, this ambitious and original project will focus on 80 people and their varied heritage from around the world, all showcasing their lives through the medium of art as its powerful communicator. Ultimately, the project will highlight something we all have in common: washing lines, but also a great deal more. This will be conveyed via a mini-blog produced alongside each piece of art telling us about the person and their washing line; an interesting detail about them, their life and culture.The project aims to educate and alert us to people and the world around us in ways we wouldn’t ordinarily think to link ourselves.By showcasing the work in the immediate community, at a local level, residents are able to engage with the art in laundrettes - without having to attend somewhere fancy or far and having to pay an entrance fee. In a laundrette, anyone can enter to appreciate the life of another human and their culture, through art and stories. Laundrettes and washing are also very topical at the moment with a recent Guardian article publishing an article on the ‘reinventing the humble laundrette’ to Ariel India’s ‘Share the Load’ ad campaign looking at gender stereotypes in the household surrounding washing and chores. Laundrettes have this retro edge and vintage appeal, and as an integral part of one’s community, it’s important to remind people of them and to continue to support and add value to local businesses – particularly the places where social exchanges and interaction between people take place.The creative aim beyond this project is to then take the exhibition ‘on the road’ to visit schools and exhibit in other towns – again increasing people’s exposure to the art, stories and overall social messaging and ethos behind ‘Around the World in 80 Washing Lines’. I would also like to produce a children’s book containing photos of the 80 people and their stories alongside pictures of the final art piece and use the book as an educational vehicle to further spread the message.I would like to invite the *TREMENDOUS*Kickstarter community to help support my efforts and goal to make ‘Around the World in 80 Washing Lines’ a reality. Through this campaign, I am aiming to cover costs for the community workshops to take place with local residents, art materials for 80 pieces of art work which includes the production, printing of photographs, framing costs, as well as promotional material.The result of this project being successfully funded is a well-resolved exhibition of 80 pieces of art, which can be viewed by a wide audience through laundrettes across Reading with the view to tour the exhibition to schools and other towns. I hope that this exhibition will help capture the imagination of Reading residents from all backgrounds and to celebrate cultural inclusivity, as well as bringing together demographics that may not typically engage with the arts to do so. ","As with any project that engages a cohort of creative input, elements of the project might shift and evolve, however, the core of it remains a tribute to cultural diversity and inclusivity - and all of its stories.Thank you so much for reading :)",https://www.kickstarter.com/projects/441570786/around-the-world-in-80-washing-lines-0?ref=discovery_category_newest,441570786/around-the-world-in-80-washing-lines-0,"This is anautism-friendly, social art project featuring 80 washing line photos from 80 different countries; depicting the lives and heritage of these 80 people. Each washing line image will be bought to life with a blog written about the person behind the washing line; to get a glimpse of their life and to learn about them. The images will be printed out onto 80 separate laundry items (e.g. a t-shirt, apron) and then hung up as an interactive art installation (e.g. visitors can touch and smell the clothes) that resembles a launderette. More info can be found on the webpage: http://www.mahliaamatina.com/project-washing-lines Educational workshops with children will be run. The exhibition will take place in Reading (16-30 Sept), Slough (16-30 Oct) and London (20 Nov–2 Dec).As a neurodiverse (autistic) person, I have extraordinary sensory sensitivity, and I want to create an exhibition that is accessible to audiences from across the autistic spectrum. I will be experimenting in making the exhibition fully immersive and interactive to encourage participation from the autistic community (i.e. people can pick up clothes – touch and smell them – put them back somewhere different). I want to test the logistics and limitations of this approach, as well as to see whether this approach attracts and engages other types of audiences; for instance children and the elderly.As an artist from a diverse background (with parents from Asia and Africa), I wish to use this factor along with the international nature of the exhibition to appeal to ethnically diverse audiences who may not typically engage with the arts, and to encourage attendance – and consequently other art and heritage events in general. So far, a small sample of the exhibition has been shown in 3 launderettes in Reading as part of its ‘Year of Culture’ celebrations (2016). Workshops have been run with cultural community groups to help inform the art; so I could learn about the laundry process in different countries, as well as engaging the groups in art-making by getting them to decorate their own recyclable laundry bag.Members of theworkshops also contributed photos of washing lines (from their native countries) towards the project, and told their stories. The groups were hugely successful and this project has been in a minority of those taking place (in Reading) that engages with communities of diverse backgrounds.All 80 photos of washing lines from around the world have been collated, and the exhibition has been displayed in small pop-up formats at various events and exhibiting opportunities to raise awareness of the project and its profile.The background to this project comes from my previous social art project, ‘Kathmandu Calling!’(Art on Nepal, for Nepal), which exhibited in Reading in October 2015, and raised funds for Nepal’s earthquake victims. The art was based on Nepal, which was informed through my time spent volunteering and travelling the land. One painting in particular; “Look! They Also Dry Their Clothes” captured the hearts and imagination of the public, as visitors realised what we all share with our global neighbours; yet on a really pure and simple level.This overwhelming human reaction to, and engagement with the painting and its concept spurred me to make ‘Around the World in 80 Washing Lines’ a reality by using the simple concept of the washing line to deliver a social message that through our cultural differences - on a day to day level – we are not so differently pegged together. *** CALL TO ACTION! ***Iwould like to invite the *AMAZING* Kickstarter community to help support my efforts and goal to make ‘Around the World in 80 Washing Lines’ a reality. Through this campaign, I am aiming to cover costs for the 80 items of clothing; the printing of each washing line image and story onto the various pieces of clothing. This is the core part of exhibition, without which; there is no exhibition.The result of this project being successfully funded is a well-resolved exhibition of 80 pieces of installation art, which can be viewed by a wide audience through exhibition spaces across Reading, Slough and London with the complementary educational workshops taking place. I want to make this exhibition as accessible as possible. The long term goal is to take this exhibition further afield, as once it's setup - there's no reason why it can't tour to various venues and reach multiple audiences and carry its incredible social message.I truly hope that this installation will help capture the imagination of people from all backgrounds and across the spectrum, to celebrate inclusivity, as well as bringing together demographics that may not typically engage with the arts to do so. ","As with any project that engages a cohort of creative input; elements of the project might shift and evolve, however, the core of the exhibition remains a tribute to cultural diversity and neurodiverse inclusivity - and all of the stories it encounters along the way.Thank you so much for reading :)"

As for fulfilling requests on individual photos, it may be a challenge to fulfil this in which case I will do the closest approximation of the request or wait until the request is possible to fulfil (i.e a band may need to tour the UK before I can send a print of them)To fulfil my photo shoot promise, I will expect to fully plan this day and arrange a mutually convenient date and time we'll in advance. I will exchange contact information so there is no chance of one of us not being there! I hope to share honest and polite communication."

Ever since then Light saber battles have not been the same. We want to transcend light saber combat better than it has ever been. From Star Wars to Mortal Kombat, I want to make combat videos for each genre of fighting out of respect for these great series that have inspired us. Call it an homage to these great series as we show our appreciation. With your help, we can afford better cameras, software, studio rentals, equipment, and much more to help us reach our goal of excellence to make movie quality fights and effects. ","The risk that we have come across are time and money.  Since we all are all so busy it is hard for us to find time and make these videos.  However, for the past year we have been able to produce 4 videos and are confident we can balance our hectic lives with this cause.  Secondly, these videos cost a lot of money but we have stood the test of time with this as well.

My name is Adam and my friends and started WhiteStar Productions. We make fan films and want to become filmmakers at some point in the future. We are still beginners but we are trying to get better with each video. We love star wars, game of thrones, the matrix, video games, anime, and other mythologies and want to pay respect to them the only way we know how and want to do these beautiful series justice by paying homage to them in our films. But we cannot do this on our own, we have the passion but not all the resources. If everyone who viewed this would just give 1 dollar to our cause we would be funded and could continue and follow our dreams and hopefully inspire others to do the same.  It would literally mean the world to us if you could help us follow our dreams and our promise in return is to create the best films we possibly can.

I will start in Southern California and travel to Arizona, New Mexico, Texas, Oklahoma, Missouri, Illinois, Indiana and possibly a few others. I want to offer images taken on this trip into a special book to be delivered in October 2014 called The Summer 2014 Book of Images. I also want to offer images I have taken in the past in the book The Journey So Far.I will be using Blurb to create and print the books The Journey So Far and The Summer 2014 Book of Images.About MeHi My name is Marissa Turner.

They visited big towns and places that many people know about. What about small town USA. The places you never heard about. The places that are not on a map. That is what Photography Across the United States is about, seeing the beauty in the places not found on the map. Photography Across the United States is being done by a photographer who grew up in a small town an hour or two away from the big city lights of Los Angeles and Hollywood in Rosamond, CA. Originally a one stop light town with miles between your home and a grocery store. While we have added a few stop lights and homes are closer together, Rosamond, CA still embodies small town USA. Many people do not see the glamour in small town USA and Photography Across the United States is aiming at changing that through the creation of the Summer 2014 book of images and the Journey So Far. Photography Across the United States is traveling across the United States by car for three to four weeks to see the places not on the map, in an effort to show people the beauty of small town USA. To show people places they have never heard about before. Come join us on the journey to see the beauty you did not know existed outside the big lights of Los Angeles and Hollywood.

The second trip I traveled from Southern California though Arizona, New Mexico and Texas. I also traveled through part of Northern California. Along the way I took many photos to create my first photography book.I took mostly nature and landscape photographs. I took a few portraits and architectural photographs as well. I will be using these photos to create my first photography book. I plan on the book being about 100 to 200 photographs.I have finished editing the photos. All pictures are available through my website marissaturnerphotography.com and I am releasing them through my Kickstarter Project Page.I will be using Photoshop CS6, Adobe Lightroom and Blurb to create the photo book.There are lots of ways to can help support the project.

I consider myself very lucky being able to do something I love every day! Over the years I've produced many pieces with different themes such as Toothless, Disney characters and rainbow designs, as well as offering commissions. My most recent project is the My Little Pony Cutie Mark Line which I launched around a year ago and has been more successful than any other project I've undertaken. It's been a very slow process building up the business as equipment in this field is pretty expensive. The most expensive being a kiln, which is needed to fire each ceramic piece I paint to lock in the painted colours and make them all waterproof, food safe etc.Until now I have been borrowing a kiln and (I'm pleased to say) I've outgrown the arrangement and now the time has come for me to purchase my own kiln! I plan on using any funds raised with this campaign to purchase a large industrial kiln that retails for roughly £4000. I already have some of the funds saved so now I just need the rest within the next few months to prevent my little venture from grinding to a halt D:","As I've been in the ceramic field for so long, I have a strong relationship with all of my suppliers, including the firm I am planning on purchasing a kiln from. There are no potential obstacles that would crop up after the campaign is over as everything is in place to purchase and install the kiln safely.",https://www.kickstarter.com/projects/1858381552/mugsonas-your-fursona-becomes-a-ceramic-mug?ref=discovery_category_newest,1858381552/mugsonas-your-fursona-becomes-a-ceramic-mug,"I'm Alice!

Getting to flex my artistic muscles over a custom design is what really gets me going! I thrive on challenge and the greatest satisfaction for me is producing something that my client falls in love with :3 Although being a ceramic artist is fun and challenging, it does have its pitfalls and sources of stress. It's been a very slow process building up the business as equipment in this field is pretty expensive. The most expensive being a kiln, which is needed to fire each ceramic piece I paint to lock in the painted colours and make them all waterproof, food safe etc. I have yet to come across another furry artist who uses paint and ceramic as a medium (which is pretty cool that my art is unique) but it means that what I do is fairly misunderstood and my work tends to be overlooked in favor of digital art. I really want to be successful in my venture and I want to share what I love with all of you! So with that in mind -I am super excited to share with you my newest project which I'm calling 'Mugsonas'! These are mugs painted to look like your fursona! The example shown in the project photo is a Mugsona of my furry character, Starla. I use reference sheets and existing art of a fursona to create colorful and unique renditions of your character!I am offering a few different pledge options including matching fursona coasters! All pledgers and I will plan a design together to make absolutely sure that you are all happy with your Mugsona! I will livestreaming most of the work done so you will be given the opportunity to watch me working on this project, as well as posting regular photo updates to my various social medias :D I am so very grateful to all of my lovely pledgers - your support is massively appreciated and keeps me able to do what I love, every day. Thank you so much all!","Physical art is not a sure thing and the ceramic world can be volatile! The only real risk for this project is the same risk I run every time I pop a finished piece in the kiln to be fired - it may not make it out in one piece. However, as this is a risk I have endured for my whole career as a ceramic artist (and ceramicist), I have a strict policy - anything that breaks gets immediately remade. So you as pledgers have nothing to worry about whatsoever! Regardless as to what happens on my end of things, pledgers will be well-communicated with and will receive their gifts!"

Anyone can buy a Ready To Fly quad without really knowing whats inside the frame, this project provides a better understanding of quadcopters over ready to fly versions.Final Frame Design 2014This is a strong, light weight, agile high flying drone!Flying high with LEGO3D Printed GoPro mount added3 Designs you can pick from:Disclaimer:This is a custom creation that is built with LEGO® bricks, not a reproduction of any LEGO® creation. We do not reproduce any LEGO® bricks, all are official LEGO® brand. We purchase, whenever possible, directly from LEGO®. Sometimes a 3D part is needed like for Motor mounts that will be able to be glued firmly to the bricks. We want to give everyone a chance to learn about robotics flight, programming and much more.LEGO® is a trademark of the LEGO® Group of companies which does not sponsor, authorize or endorse this site.","The main challenge is getting the bricks. Sometimes we can not get them and have to wait for stock.  Top and bottom plates are discontinued but we will make every effort to find them for everyone, If we can not find the top and bottom plate in a reasonable timeframe we will 3D print make something that will work, but we will never make a duplicate of a LEGO and sell them as they are trademarked, ours will look different but still work great.Nick is in charge of 3D Printing and working with Ed Scott to create a motor mount for the most stable flight possible. Together they are working on better GoPro and battery holders that will attach firmly to your quad."

It's twisted...I know, I know, but, it has done exceptionally well and sells like wildfire over the Christmas season. It makes quite the brow raising impression on the gift receiver, and you couldn't ask for a better stocking stuffer or Secret Santa gift.

I felt like my studies at school lacked a bit of zest and creative aspect, so I felt like I needed to channel my writing abilities into something fresh and relevant to the technology available to us today. I decided to start a project that involved two of my favorite things to research in my spare time, Poetry and technology.This project will be a month long journey for me to write an E-book for publication. The pricing of the book is yet to be decided, but I do not intend for it to be super expensive, as the length of the book is not yet determined.I will write over 40 or so poems regarding technology and love and maybe even a mixture of the two. Each poem dedicated to a backer will feature custom art. Other poems may or may not have art to develop the feel for a science fiction romantic ambiance.I plan to complete this project with or without the help of a:","This is a low-risk project for me personally, as I do not intend to procrastinate on this.

These two contrast with other in a fusion of beauty and sadness, self-reliance versus madness.I will utilize some of the poems on my poetry blog as you can see on my website link. With your support, I would be able to find a good graphic designer for the cover art. Most of the funding is for the cover art, but part of it might be for an editor more experienced with editing poetry books.I intend to complete the body of my poems by the end of December of this year. I will complete the cover and book editing by the end of January 2020. I will publish the e-book either January or February 2020.If you have experienced unrequited love before, either on the receiving or giving end of it, please feel free to back my project.

Back then it was called ""ADream Music"", and worked only as a 2 hours long weekly podcast, that would be uploaded to a very simple website and aired on a couple FM radios from Argentina as well.Life would happen and things would stay the same for many, many years, but I never lost track of what I wanted to achieve and exactly where I wanted to take the project to. In 2010 I gather a new staff and re-name the podcast to ""BeatLounge"", and 2 years later, in March 2012 and as a result of an excessive explosion on our social networks I decide to take the next logical step: transform the weekly podcast into a 24/7 Online Radio, offering a unique and original product where different styles as Deep, House, Ambient, Trip Hop, Progressive, Tech, Trance, Chillout and Lounge blend exquisitely.It's been a lot of work and a steep learning curve, but in just a few months on air, we managed to expand our network even further, meet amazing artists and Industry folks and above all, do what we love every single day! And because we never stop working, in parallel to the radio growth, we decided to push things even further: ""BeatLounge Chillout LifeStyle"", the first compilation album by BeatLounge, released onSchalldeluxe label in August 2012, marked the beginning of a dream, one which inevitably headed us towards the creation of our own label: BeatLounge Records in March 2013!Today, we are releasing the second part of what promises to be a successful and beloved series within the BLR catalogue:""BeatLounge Chillout Lifestyle 002""and which continues to generate unique andspecial atmospheres, from angelic voices, to dark trip hop melodies, passing through somewhat friendlier groovesand experimental sounds, this album clearly puts in evidence the evolution of the BeatLounge brand in general: ourradio, our label, and of course our productions!""BeatLounge Chillout Lifestyle 002"" includes 14 tracks + a Continuous DJ Mix by Tim Angrave.More than 13 THOUSAND Facebook fans can't be wrong!! :) https://www.facebook.com/beatloungeradioYou can visit our website here: http://www.beatloungerecords.comBeatLounge Chillout Lifestyle 002 – Various Artists (Compilation)01.

DesignRelease 20 Dec. 2013 ","We had a bit of a a test run with our first kickstarter project, and it was unsuccessful. We believe that it was due to 2 main factors: 1) Although we have thousands of fans, we found out that people are usually not that prone to 'donating' money, especially fans of our radio from other countries. This can stem from a variety of things, but mainly, online purchasing is not as common as it is here in the US. Our label is still too small to have it's own following. We thought that we would get our vast majority of contributions from our radio fans but it hasn't worked that way.2) We believe that the contributions we were asking were not in line with our albums market value. For example: for someone to feel encouraged to contribute, they need to know and feel that they are getting so much more than just dropping  by our website and purchasing our releases directly. We have now reviewed that, and are giving YOU a lot more for your contributions!Our main problem with our first project was probably setting the bar too high. $1000 was not a realistic goal for us, at least not to start with. We believe that a much lower one like this one will not only hit the mark, but will also encourage more contributions.There's absolutely no risks involved. All of our albums are released already. The 2 that are not for sale, will have hit all major stores by the time this campaign is over, all of our albums are finished albums and can be sent to backers as soon as the 30 days period of our campaign is over."
https://www.kickstarter.com/projects/jlplive/sensual-nude-by-jlp-tattoo-edition?ref=discovery_category_newest,jlplive/sensual-nude-by-jlp-tattoo-edition,"Well I don't suspect at this point this particular project is going to meet its goal. I would like to invite you to have look at our other current projects. Both of which have had more success and are really close to being funded.If you have already contributed to this project and would like it to succeed please keep reading.With the failure of reaching our goal for this project we decided to come at it from a different angle in raising the money. Instead of trying to raise all the money needed for the book in one go we decided to break it up into smaller more manageable projects. Essentially what we are doing is raising the money for each models shoot for the book individually. This allows us to make the goals much smaller and more likely to be reached. We will be creating three projects/additions a month featuring one model a project. (Each project/addition will have its own rewards) There will be 25+ models in total and we hope to wrap up the last project/addition late September early October. Our hopes are to start work on the book so that it can be ready before next Christmas.To make a long story short ""sensual nudes tattoo addition"" is not going to succeed so feel free to pull your funding and if you like spread it amongst the new project title ""The Naked Pixel"" series. It is the same project but coming from a different angle. Minus some of the tattoos. There are currently two projects online and a third coming online in the next day or two. The links below are to those projects. Thanks for your supporthttp://kck.st/1yEPkYk  http://kck.st/1z4vDbcSensual Nude. ""tattoo edition"" is the first in a series of artistic nude photo books I hope to assemble. This particular edition is focused on the beautiful, sensual and erotic tattooed and pierced female form. Accompanying these beautiful tattooed and pierced women will be the stories and the meanings behind their tattoos and piercings to bring you back much closer to the art within the art.Book DetailsSensual Nudes. ""tattoo edition"" is a 100 page art photo book that will be published early 2015 it will contain 25+ models showcasing their nude pierced and tattooed bodies. The book will be self published and available online as a 10x8 print on demand or as a enhanced e-book.Three formats will be produced.Funds raised will be put towards studio time, stylists, makeup artists, props, paying models, and producing books for the backers. The books will be printed in full color (some images may be black and white for artistic effect. All hardcover books will have an acknowledgment page listing major contributors of over $100 unless the individual wishes to remain anonymous.Past worksBonus round. For every $1000 we go over funding goal three random people will get an invite to the release/launch party.For every $3000 we go over the funding goal one random person will receive an invite to one of the shooting sessions.If we go over our the funding goal by $5000 all contributors will receive a bonus 8 x 10 signed print of an unpublished piece from the project.If we go over the funding goal by 10,000 all contributors will receive a free enhanced e-book of the next installment of Sensual Nudes.I have had the great opportunity of helping so many others immortalize their memories through photography, now I would like very much the opportunity to do so for myself","I have 10 years experience as a wedding photographer and model photographer.  As a wedding photographer I have had to produce high-quality photo books for many clients.  As a photographer for models doing portfolio work I have acquired many contacts with models and agents that will assure I can acquire the amount of quality models needed for this project.  I am fully aware of the risks and challenges  and I believe The risk is relatively low. If we don't reach the funding goal, then your credit card is not charged. If we reach the funding goal, then it is just a matter of printing the book and distributing it.Fortune sides with he who dares",https://www.kickstarter.com/projects/jlplive/the-naked-pixel?ref=discovery_category_newest,jlplive/the-naked-pixel,"The future of ""the naked pixel"" As you know this is a collection of tasteful and artistic nudes.  The collection will contain images from 25 different models. The timeline for the 25 installments are lined up for three new projects per month between now and October or until we complete the last of the 25 additions. Each addition has its own rewards that will be completed with that specific projects timeline. We also plan on publishing a coffee table style art book with never before seen images from each shoot. We will start work on this book shortly after the last photo shoot for the naked pixel collection.  The book will be released in three formats a 10 x 8, enhanced e-book version and a high quality limited edition 13 x 11. You're probably wondering why we decided to go the route of 25 individual projects instead of one project with one goal.  Well we did, our first attempt was to raise the money all in one go but we failed to reach our goal.  We learned a lot from the first attempt and have since changed our approach to what we are now currently seeing as individual projects.  We have had far more success proceeding down our current path.  Essentially what we have done is spread out the burden of large investments allowing those with different financial means to participate.  It also has created a nice side effect of receiving more rewards in total over the entirety of the 25 installment project.   Where your money is going.The money will be used to offset the cost of paying the model for gracing us with her nude form, studio time and of course fulfilling my obligations to our very gracious contributors.help us make this happen, it's a small goal to reach and if you can't donate spread the word Plz.Update: the second edition is live http://kck.st/1yEPkYk","The only risk to this project is of the model doesn't show up to her shoot or changes her mind. But we have that covered,  in the event that the model doesn't show or changes her mind we we will post three replacement candidates on our website and let our contributors choose the replacement model.   We have a long list models wanting to participate in this project so finding a replacement will be done with ease."

This unique voyage is organised and carried out by the well established and much respected Clipperton Project who have many years experience in leading research and exploration trips to many of our world's last remaining and increasingly fragile wild places.http://www.clippertonproject.com/about/I have been successful in my pitch to join the Clipperton vessel in December, based on my work as an artist in the ocean over the years, but now I am actively looking for support to find my passage on board and to creat new works in this extraordinary context and environment.This unique trip will enable me to explore the Southern Ocean for the first time and make new work while travelling through the wild corridor where the Pacific merges into the Atlantic. I aim to spend the three weeks on board the vessel and the occasional land fall explorations on Antarctica to explore and make new works on paper, film, video, sculpture and writing. I will record and document through non stop drawing, making videos and writing what I see and observe each day and night in this part of the world which is largely absent and unknown to our daily lives and our modern world, and through drawingand writing and using video night and day I will reveal, expose and explore how our beautiful and fragile, rapidly changing world is to people through showing my work on future exhibitions and events following the trip.This is a unique opportunity to support one man's epic hope and vision to explore a sublime and vastly mysterious part of the world, and to then own a unique and profoundly authentic and rare piece of contemporary art which was found and revealed, exposed and brought to life in a place and in a spirit which is entrenched and magically imbued with beauty and wildness.You will also be supporting me on my quest to bring back to the art world something from pure nature, something loaded in meaning and history and spirit and character while also supporting how the arts can be a powerful and original and poetically charged catalyst to promote new thinking and renewed interest and passion for our earth both today and the future we make for ourselves as a global community.Thank you for any support you can give.","I will make the journey to Antarctica with several environmentalists and marine scientists and will travel with a fully professional and very experienced crew so I am fully confidant that the project will be a great success.

Since 2007, when I began drawing in the Pacific Ocean in Mexico, I have pushed and led my practice as a contemporary landscape artist working in the ocean while working in Taiwan, England, Brazil, Costa Rica and Hawaii. I am equipped and ready for the weather and challenged artistically and personally, and I have been training and keeping myself in good physical condition for the last three years. I have a strong track record of embracing ambitious creative drawing projects in the ocean, and have subsequently sold the resulting drawings to collectors around the world, from noticeable exhibitions such as the Drawing Center, NY, 2010, the James Cohan Gallery, NY 2011 and Mendes Wood DM, Sao Paulo, 2011  - see past drawing projects on my website for press releases and installation photographs from these shows.

The goal I've set will fund 100 pins plus shipping supplies, card backings and fees.These would make a wonderful gift for the Bat or Cat in your life or would look stellar in your pin collection.Follow me on Instagram @heremeow to view my other pins and to connect.","Last month I successfully funded another kickstarter and the hardest part for me was getting Shipstation to print all the labels! Once I figured it out everything was a breeze and all pins were delivered in time for the holiday season. Pin Quality/Turn Around Time:I have used this pin manufacturer several times now and they produce wonderful pins with very little flaws if any. Once the project is funded, I will receive the pins 8-12 days later and ship upon arrival worldwide."

It is important for the shared future of humanity!12 MonthResidencyHello and welcome to my Kickstarter page!My name is Michael Stevenson Jr. and I'm an artist living and working in Alfred New York. 12 Month Residency is a project I have put together comprised of my various art practices and educational volunteer opportunities. The general premise I am working with is to make work that is socially, environmentally, and economically responsible. In addition to managing my own gallery I currently make work with waste plastic, bonsai, performance, business (apparel and coffee), food and farming. Within each of these bodies of work, I strive to make the viewer aware that we are all sharing the same socio-environmental space. I intend to teach viewers how to share that space best, healthily andhappily, while creating as little negative impact on the environment as possible. In many of my works there aremechanismsin place that exist as an active means to encourage social and environmental change.No Shoes GalleryThe No Shoes Gallery is aninstitutionof art I have built in my own home. I curate and exhibit shows here as often as possible. The space is also open to other artists to participate in my curated shows or to display their work on their own. I was also able to help Kickstarter fundedperformance collectiveSix and Four Articulationsby opening the gallery space for them to have an art auction (members of the touring dance troupe can be seen enjoying a celebratory, pre-tour send off, tofu curry dinner served in my home/gallery). Building my own gallery space allows me to free up the idea of what aninstitutionof art can be. Bringing art one step further out of the exclusive spaces it primarily inhabits; exposing viewers to artwork they may normally have missed. This past year I have curated the shows: WASTE and Movement (the first in a series), a show inspired by drawing movement; I have also opened the gallery for professors to exhibit work. As owner and curator of the gallery I amresponsiblefor not just curation and show management but also everylogistical need from promotion,to cleaning and catering, to fundraising; you name it, I do it!SculptureBoth my plastic and bonsai sculptures are meant to be physical images as well as compositions of ourculturalrelationships between material and nature. I try my hardest to use as many second hand materials as possible, lessening the impact of the production and bolstering the impact of my concepts. The full funding of the residency would enable me to expand the operation of my sculptural practice; allowing me to extend my indoor bonsaigrowing space and increase the total volume of sculpture I am able to make.PerformanceA newly developing area of my work is public performance. Making work this way is ofinterestto me because it is helpful in getting my art and ideas out of the gallery and onto the streets. I have begun to experiment with making appearances at art openings and a local primary school budget hearing as a regalia cladcrusader. The intention being to make others see, and question why, I choose to wear what I am wearing. This also sets the stage for people to take what I do and what I say as seriously as I take myself in that moment, despite my seeminglyridiculousattire. I do this to bring the elements I'm dealing with directly to the viewer; going where people are and putting myself directly in front of their gaze.The inspiration behind this work is deeply tied to indigenous culture, their cultural relationships to material, and modern societies' relationship to material and indigenous culture. When I appear out in public I draw attention with my colorful handmade garb; mostnotablymy psychedelic purple headband made from a sock I found on the side of the road. The rear of the headband is adorned with other road side treasures: the nock end of a yellow plastic arrow with red and white rubber fletchings, remnant of an orange ground service flag, and a bird feather all tied together with orange heat shrink tubing. I think about these materials and the relationships between them all the time; what they are, where they come from, how they are used, and most importantly wherethey go once people are done with them. The materials I choose to use to make my regalia are to make others questiontheirrelationship to material and materialwaste. I also want people to see what it means to take waste and celebrate the material, building a new culture out of ourcultural waste.The appearances I have made are inspired by the the Belo Monte Dam which is now being constructed in the Amazon region of Brazil. The Dam has been resisted for many years by indigenous groups living in the area of the Dam (video). My aim is to be like the indigenous Brazilians, to dress in regalia that is culturallysignificant and to dance and chant in opposition of the way modern society grows - steamrolling all that the eye can see. It is my hope that throughimitationI can illustrate that despite the unmistakable goal of their protest the rights of indigenous peopleconsistentlyget ignored when it comes to the needs and expansion of modern man. If my residency is fully funded I will be able to spend more time researching the lives and cultural practices ofindigenouspeoples, further influencing both mysculpturaland performative art making.ar.ti.clesBusinessToday, practicallyeveryone living in America is a consumer of some kind. Knowing this, I began to make consumable products that can be immersed among the plethora of commercial goods available today, through a company I collaboratively created, called Oxygen3. Oxygen3 is a platform for branding original artworks and artisan goods in a way that allows them to be consumed the same way commercially produced goods are. Consumed in a way that art and complex ideas are not typically consumed - wholesale. The desire to make work in this way began 3 years ago when the bulk of the work I was making was traditional sculpture. I wanted to be making work as effective and far reaching as goods that are found commonly across the nation; something solitarysculpturalcompositions that live in seldomly attended white roomsare incapable of doing. So with the help of Evan Sforza, Grant Figura, Paul Gannon and, other collaborators accrued along the way, Oxygen3 came to life. The products being produced by Oxygen3 are as environmentally and socially responsible as can be found, including apparel manufactured from bamboo and USDA organic, fair trade coffee packaged and roasted by a small business. I am using the opportunity to brand these consumable products in a way that challenges the viewer to contemplate the imagery being used and how and why the product came to exist. The sale of these original products are conducted as economically responsibly as possible, both compensating the artist for every unit sold using their design, but also raising money for an aid organization associated with the design sold. Currently, Oxygen3 has apparel designs related to, and raises money for, four different organizations: World Wild Life Fund, Energy ActionCoalition, UNICEF Tap Projectand theArbor Day Foundation. Community Coffee, upon production, will donate money to a rotation of local non profit organizations chosen by the community. It is my objective to make people viewers of my work by way of consumption. I want people to want my work like they want everything else money can buy - badly. By making work in this way I feel as if I am able to sculpt with economics: putting a product of original design on the market, channeling the flow ofculturalcapital, and having thatculturalcapital find a place where it can improve the socio-environmental landscape. All of my business related projects were built with an initialmonetaryinvestment made by myself, but are now fully self sustaining. Funding of the residency will grant me much needed administrative time for these projects; as I am in charge of everything including but not limited to making orders, web enterprising and 100% of production and sales!Oxygen3 website: www.oxygenx3.comFollow our blog here: www.oxygen3.tumblr.comFoodI have found food to be the most sustainable medium for me to make work with as food must be produced and consumed regardless of circumstance. There are many environmental and health issues (human and otherwise) related to golbal food production and consumption. Using conventional materials, that usually have a large amount of waste associated with production, is not the best wayto bring attention to the current state of our food system. Eventually I came to the conclusion that making meals that play with some of the same complex ideas I deal with in my more traditional work may be the best way to go about being effective. The only waste related to this work are the scraps of food that would come from any meal, which I am careful to make sure get to a compost pile.The model for a healthy human being includes consuming multiple meals daily: this requires food -- healthy food at that. But people don't eat ashealthilyand as regularly as they should, whether it be less or more frequently than ideal. And, there is less easy access to food that nourishes the body than there is to food that is of detriment to the body. In America, especially, there seems to be a competition for marketing the most appealing, leastnutritious and least expensive meal solutions. This sickens me. I am making work that aims to combat this trend insocietyand offer (literally) an alternative solution to the public's food needs.This body of work produces expertly prepared sample-ableproducts to the viewers, by way ofguerrilla street food and more refined dining experiences.During my cookingescapades, Ialso produce external research material for the viewer here at mycooking blog. And whenever I can, I enjoyeducating through hands on experience in the kitchen, anyone welcome, any time. The reason I make this work: to enlighten others as to how they too can accomplish a healthy food living for themselves and others. With the money funding the residency I will be able to make much more of this work; both because of the surplus of money I will have to purchase food from local food stores andindependentfarmers, and the time gained from working less. The expansion of this body of work includes making a food cart from which I can more easily dispense morsels of thought provoking, body nourishing food stuffs!FarmingFarming is one of the most important trades that sustains life on this planet for the human race. And America is where the most arable land that belongs to one national geographic region exists. The neglect of the arable land in this country is growing, along with the average age of farmers; which rises every year, with no resurgence of interest from younger generations. Farming practices have had to operate on a commercial scale just to survive, rarely resulting in a positive monetary return to land owners. Commercial scale farming is also subservient to corporate and political influence and control, resulting in subsidized use of genetically modified seed, chemical abatement, and the prohibition of traditional practices, such as: seed gleaning and production and sale of raw milk.To influence the nature of ouragriculturallandscape I am working on various projects aimed at furthering my own education andenlightening others with what I have learned so far. To dateI've helped to brand and encourage sales of local various local food distributors by producing promotional material such as posters and t-shirts. I practice and experiment with numerous indoor and outdoor agriculturaltechniques to further my ownhorticulturaleducation; including but not limited to growing with compactflorescentbulbs, large scale cultivation of nutritional weeds, portable growing methods and making my own nutrient teas. I educate the public on food issues, sharing articles and what I know from word of mouth or first handexperience. I support local food suppliers with my personal and professional patronage and share with others where to find the local food I am feeding them.I am endeavoring into these projects with the hope that I will be able to encourage more people to embrace and celebrate sustainable agricultural practices, and for all members of society to seek out and discourage less pure methods of cultivation.A greatforum for sharing what I've learned and offering others exposure to the various otheragriculturalpractices employed by local farmers ismyvolunteerposition as market manager for the inaugural year of theAlfred Farmers Market.The market is a growers only market, meaning there is absolutely no reselling allowed; ensuring that each vendor has personally produced the product for sale. A growers only market enables customers to hold the farmers directly responsible for the growing practices they use. The market gives people access food they can be informed about before purchasing andpreparingin their homes, the first step in responsible food consumption. During the residency I will have more time to work with and learn from local farmers in the area. I will also be able to devote time to the farmers market, encouraging its growth, making sure to build a strong foundation so that the institution stays strong for years to come. You can monitor my progress in this area at my blog Alfred Agriculture!Art & EducationIt's my feeling that in the field of art specifically, targeted education about dissemination of information is key. I would say that making art possible of clearly transferring an idea to the viewer is my specialization, but I was never taught to make art in this way. I believe that often the teaching of art is done by encouraging a creativeimpulsefirst, whether inmaterialor method of making. The way I like to make work is to start with the complex idea the viewer is meant to realize, then let the material and process meant to accomplish this goal become dictated by that idea. During the course of the next academic school year I will study education of art as a volunteer teaching assistant for the Alfred University School of Art and DesignFoundationsprogram. I wish to learn and understand how best to teach in a way that puts a particular response from the viewer ahead of any other criteria for making art. Art is the way I have come to understand how tosynthesizeall of the above, seemingly unrelated, ideas. This synthesis of ideas is the resolution I reached in searching for sustainable media to make work, work capable of making change,capableof education and true, realpermeationof an idea. I intend for my work to serve apurpose, for it to help, to be of use, useful in ways that no one knew there was any need for. The ultimate goal of the work I'm making is to improve the human condition. I want a chance to make my work and to teach others how to successfully make work with similar objectives. I have committed to working with the Foundations class if theresidencyis fully funded or not. If I take advantage of this opportunity on my own, without your help I not be able to make much artwork inadditionto working various paid opportunities that fit around my new schedule.What I Will AccomplishDuring the next 12 months I will endeavor to produce as much of the aforementioned work as possible. Some of which will go to my generous backers; most of which will go out directly into the public sphere aimed at social change. At the end of 12 months I will have acomprehensiveshow putting on display various new works and documentation of works produced throughout the year, including a bulletin thanking each backer individually. Documentation of the comprehensive show and all the work produced leading up to it will be available to view at MichaelStevensonJr.comSummationI have taken personalresponsibilityfor making a difference in our socio-environmental landscape. The only way this is possible is to teach others to take a similar personalresponsibility. I am asking you, as a potential backer, to consider taking on some personal responsibilityyourself. Only portions of this work can exist without your help, none of which to any significant capacity. If you or anyone you know can see value in the work that I produce, please help me make it by donating to help fund my 12 Month Residency!Thank you for your time and attention, lovingly,Michael Stevenson Jr.Artist",,https://www.kickstarter.com/projects/1564699662/the-urban-shaman-zine?ref=discovery_category_newest,1564699662/the-urban-shaman-zine,"I’ve been visiting and learning about the Anacostia community for going on a year. My process began with hearing about the state of the community from friends and seeking more information through research and direct engagement. Interactions with residents developed into attending community meetings, and eventually responding to content shared in that space. This zine is a tribute to my ongoing relationship with Anacostia, a calling card to help inspire future contact and interactions with the community, and a formal introduction to the Urban Shaman.The zine is published and ready for distribution right now!I purchased 100 copies of the zine and am prepared to share it with whoever wants a copy. I will be giving away free copies to residents of Anacostia D.C. This kickstarter campaign is to help defray the costs of distributing free copies of this content.Support for my work is greatly appreciated, however if I do not meet my minimum goal, I will still be able to distribute the free copies of the zine. The primary reason for using kickstarter as a platform for this project is that if I don't sell enough I will not incur any fees for attempts to sell the zine digitally.","This production phase of this project is entirely complete. I am now beginning to distribute the zine to Neighborhoods in Anacostia. Given that the zine was produced using out of pocket funds, fiscal support is greatly appreciated."

Lynch, which will first be performed at Rutgers University's One Act Festival. The play is currently in one act form, but is in the process of being written into a full length, 3 act play. The purpose of this fundraising campaign is to raise enough money in order to pay for venue space at Philly Fringe Festival in September. The play is about Tracy, a Transgender woman who is a makeup artist in a traveling circus in 1980's America. The protagonist of the play, she is a strong female character who gradually reveals her troubled past to her friend and fellow performer, Gina, throughout the course of the events. This is a character driven play and a realistic drama with some surreal elements that are represented through experimental sound and lighting. By the end of the play Tracy admits horrible secrets to both Gina and herself that she would never admit to before, and has to make a choice of how to deal with the reality of her situation and confront the horrors of her past.A letter from the director, Alexis Marie Cabrera:I remember at 5 years old, I asked my mother why my cousin dressed “like a girl.” At 10, my mother told me he was gay and I asked “yeah but why does he dress like a girl?” Later on, my cousin changed her Facebook name to Kayla and started taking hormonal pills. After a family wedding, we all gathered around a table and I heard for the first time the stories of my cousin being beaten up and bullied even by other family members. Before that moment, I had never appreciated Kayla still being with us as much as I did then and now. Though this play is a work of fiction, I hope it encourages everyone to read and listen to the stories of people like Kayla, to witness those struggling to stay alive because they can’t afford or are refused to live as the gender they are. We are launching a Kickstarter to take this play to Philly Fringe Festival, and we kindly ask that if you like this play, please contribute any amount of your choosing in order to help us. Thank you and I hope you enjoy the premiere of Vestige. ","One of the challenges we've already faced is finding the right actress to play the main character of Vestige. We went through a long audition process, and unfortunately, even though many people auditioned, they all happened to be cisgender. We do not have the budget of the makers of ""Dallas Buyers Club,"" who could afford to find a trans actor whom could play what would end up being Jared Leto's role. We'd honestly prefer to have a transgender person playing a transgender role, but we do not have the resources to hire a casting director in order to find the right trans person. However, we've cast an amazing cisgender actress to play the role of Tracy. That all being said, this play may cause some controversy with those who think that a play about a transgender woman cannot be written by a cisgender man, played by a cisgender woman, and directed by a cisgender woman. We hope that our audience watches the play to see for themselves whether we have done justice to the trials faced by the trans community. We already have the knowhow, personnel, and equipment in order to pull this off, all we are asking for is the money to pay for the venue space. Profits generated off of ticket sales will be used to pay our actors and director.",https://www.kickstarter.com/projects/seanlynch/whirlwind-issue-4-war-and-veterans?ref=discovery_category_newest,seanlynch/whirlwind-issue-4-war-and-veterans,"Our fourth issue will be our biggest and best yet. Poems, stories, memoirs, art, photography, and more from veterans and non-veterans on their experiences with war and death. Out of the darkness of these topics appear so many rays of light; it's absolutely inspiring.We have veterans of the wars in Iraq, Vietnam, and even World War 2 appearing in this issue. The diversity and triumph of our contributors' creative writing and artwork makes for a stunning array of voices. You will not be disappointed.Here's a ""Letter From the Editor"" excerpt for the 4th issue.""How remarkable is it, that in the year 2015 we can still hear the voices of those who’ve experienced World War 2? 90 year old Hal O’Leary, a West Virginia native and veteran of the Allied campaign against the Nazis in Western Europe, wrote an enduring and reflective memoir piece that we have the honor of sharing with you in this issue. Other highlights from veterans in this issue: Cold War era Army vet Alex Marshall imagines the view of an ancient Chinese soldier from his Meditation Tao series of poems, Iraq War vet Alecc Costanzi emits a pungent warning in his poetry, Jon Turner, another veteran of the war in Iraq, shows us a glimpse of the “enemy’s” perspective, Doug D’Elia, who was a medic in Vietnam, shares with us the difficulty of reassuring a dying soldier,  Lisa Van Wormer, an Iraq War veteran, accomplishes the near-impossible task of expressing the sorrow and bonding that occurs after a fellow soldier’s death, in second person mind you, Jay Dardes, a Vietnam era vet, describes an encounter between a vet with ptsd and a therapist, and James Smith, a veteran of the 25th Infantry Division in Vietnam, gives us an outstanding and at times humorous look at the hypocrisy of those who say they support our troops, yet are not sincere.""The date for our magazine release party and poetry reading is May 17th at the Pen and Pencil Club on Latimer Street in Philadelphia. We will be keeping this page up to date with news about the event.Thanks so much for reading, and even if you can't spare the extra cash to contribute to our fourth issue's printing, please comment with your thoughts and spread the word!","Depending on how much money we raise, we will be printing a minimum of 50 copies for this issue through Moonstone publishing. Thanks to Larry Robin and all the wonderful workers at Moonstone Arts Center, we are certain that the magazines will look just as gorgeous as they did for the third issue.The only significant challenge we faced for our third issue was the awful ice storm that happened to coincide with our launch party.

I was a full-time working mother of a two year old, in the education field.  I loved my job, but days stretched long and I found myself longing to invest more time into my little girl, while still bringing in an income.  The idea of being an entrepreneur was the only real idea that made sense.  One sleepless night I started brainstorming.  I thought of the things I absolutely love...all things good smelling, that brought back memories of the beautiful things in life!  I invested the little savings we had into research, supplies and building up the perfect product to market.   A product that was hand-made by me, using high-quality ingredients, sustainability in mind, and would outshine the other competitors in our market.  Aromas Candle Company was born and we have created a quality product our customers love and I am proud to call my own!","Thankfully, being that my product is produced with sustainable materials, it is unlikely we'd have any risks or challenges to actually manufacturing these candles.

This extraordinary Double Bill brings together two powerful plays that resonate boldly with our contemporary socio-political backdrop, and revivifies Barker for a twenty-first century audience whilst also delivering a pioneering programme of associated outreach events – including the Arcola’s first ever touch tour and fully professionally audio-described performance for blind and partially sighted audiences – at a prestigious Off West End Arts Council England National Portfolio Organisation, led by a team of high-calibre creatives, including emerging Director Robyn Winfield-Smith, trailblazing Producer Rosalyn Newbery, Linbury Award finalist Designer Rosanna Vize, double OffWestEnd Award nominated Lighting Designer Christopher Nairne and leading Sound Artist Iain Armstrong.""Really impressive, brilliantly judged, and altogether classy; I was knocked out by the clarity of the direction and acting"" (Lucy Bailey on Robyn’s 2012 staged reading of ISONZO starring Nicholas Le Prevost) “A stark, brutal piece of stage poetry from the pen of a writer who is shockingly under-performed” (Whatsonstage on Robyn’s 2011 workshop production of JUDITH starring Catherine Cusack) “Winfield-Smith’s shrewd, searching production is full of light and dark and boasts a quartet of terrific performances"" (Lyn Gardner, The Guardian, on Robyn’s 2012 UK Premiere of Barker’s LOT AND HIS GOD at the Print Room) For further information and to book tickets, please clickhereAnd take a peak at our brand new trailer below!THE PLAYSThe London premiere of THE TWELFTH BATTLE OF ISONZOIsonzo, blind, witty and mischievous, is 100, and has been married 11 times before. Tenna, blind, beautiful and wise beyond her years, is 17, and has never been married before. Today is their wedding day. And so commences the twelfth ‘battle’ of Isonzo, in which bride and groom each discover that the other is far more of a match than they had bargained for.Set within the purgatorial unreality of a sightless world, this wittily seductive and darkly comic one-act play is a fearlessly imaginative look at a taut battle of wits played between an unlikely couple, placing the experience of blindness literally and metaphorically centre-stage in a powerful and pioneering way. As Age and Youth chase each other through fantasies and lies to get closer to the truth, we see them move inexorably towards their only possible consummation…ISONZO will be staged using ground-breaking 3D Binaural sound techniques, giving audiences a radical immersive experience off blindness. The play also acts as the stimulus for a major outreach programme accompanying the DOUBLE BILL, which will actively reach out to people with little or no previous experience of theatre, or who may face obstacles, financial, disability-related or otherwise, in accessing theatre opportunities.A thrilling revival of JUDITH: A PARTING FROM THE BODYThe night before battle. The country will fall to Assyria in the morning. A beautiful widow, Judith, infiltrates the enemy camp with her comically back-chatting Servant, with the intention of seducing and killing the Assyrian general, Holofernes, to save her country from invasion. But nothing is as it seems, and soon we become entangled in a gripping double-seduction: a web of truth and lies between a man who has chosen murder, and a woman who has chosen love, culminating in the transformation of Judith into the very thing she has set out to destroy.This apocryphal story has fascinated artists for centuries; Barker’s radical re-telling pulls back the dusty sheets of Holofernes’ tent to reveal what really happened inside this mythic tale. Theatrically enthralling, emotionally charged and brimming with political potency in the context of the ongoing violence between Israel and Palestine, JUDITH’s fearless trawling of love and grief probes relentlessly into the human experience, the nature of war, and the cycles of hate that are nurtured by radical ideology, revealing a dark and astonishingly timely truth: that the victor so often takes on the vices of the vanquished…“Dynamic, intensely-imagined, and chilling” (Howard Barker on Robyn’s workshop production).THIS DOUBLE BILLThis Double Bill began simply as a staged reading of ISONZO starring Nicholas Le Prevost at the Print Room and a workshop production of JUDITH starring Catherine Cusack at the Cock Tavern Theatre. Now it is an “outstanding project with fantastic partners, high artistic quality and audience appeal” (Clive Lyttle, Arts Council England), launching brand new company REND Productions, and inaugurating a new strand of audience development at the Arcola through its access programme for blind and partially-sighted people.THE ROLE YOU CAN PLAYThe vision and ambition of this production and its team of exciting young creatives has so far gained it a generous grant from Arts Council England (ACE), which must now be matched in order for our project to go ahead. With 59% of our funding in place, and a further 14% expected in ticket income, we must now raise the rest in order to meet the conditions of our Arts Council grant, and to cover our overall production costs.We are therefore in need of your support to help us raise an urgent and essential £3500 towards outstanding production costs for development of the production and its 4-week run at the Arcola Theatre.We are looking for fantastic people, committed to supporting bold, independent-minded and socially conscious theatre, to come on board, get involved and help us mount this daring double bill!WHAT'S IN IT FOR YOU?In recognition of and contribution you are able to make, we've developed a series of pledge rewards that reflect the unique nature of the production and our immense gratitude! Rewards range from supporter accreditation and thanks, free tickets, signed play texts and meet and greet opportunities with members of the cast and creative team, to exclusive workshops on 'Working with Barkerian Text' with Director Robyn Winfield-Smith and much more, because we're determined to recognise and celebrate your generosity and build a creative community around the project.WHAT WILL YOUR SUPPORT GO TOWARDS?We want to achieve the highest production standards possible, and every contribution will serve a distinct and very important purpose in making this happen.Here are some examples of what your generosity will make possible and directly support:WHO'S INVOLVED:Here's a roll-call of the excellent creative team making this project happen!(You'll find more about many of those listed above within the Risks & Challenges section below)ABOUT THE DIRECTORRobyn is an exciting young director who is passionate about creating thrilling theatrical experiences that will stimulate, challenge and move audiences with truthful, powerful stories that ask incisive questions about what it means to be human. She is based as Associate Director at Omnibus, where she directed the inaugural production - an ACE-funded and Off West End Award-nominated centennial WOYZECK - and as Assistant Director at the RSC on the Swan Summer Season, where she is currently working alongside Erica Whyman on Marina Carr’s searing new adaptation of Euripides’ HECUBA. In 2012, she directed the multi-Off West End Award-nominated UK Premiere of Howard Barker’s LOT AND HIS GOD at the Print Room, and assisted on the Donmar Warehouse’s Trafalgar Season. She previously trained as a Resident Director on the pioneering Edward Bond season at the Cock Tavern and as Assistant Director to Lucy Bailey on KINGDOM OF EARTH, having worked for a year as Community & Education Officer at Chichester Festival Theatre.ABOUT THE PLAYWRIGHTHoward Barker is one of the UK’s most controversial and significant living playwrights and has achieved international renown; his plays challenge, unsettle and expose with a vital energy, poetic language and vivid imagination – and yet his work is “shockingly under-performed” (Whatsonstage) in this country: THE TWELFTH BATTLE OF ISONZO has never been seen by an English audience, whilst JUDITH – an iconoclastic reimagining of the apocryphal tale with breathtaking socio-political resonance given the recent intensification of violence in the Israel/Palestine conflict – has not been professionally revived in the UK since its TMA Theatre Award-winning premiere in 1997. Following the 5-star extended run of the National Theatre’s first ever Howard Barker production – SCENES FROM AN EXECUTION in the Lyttelton in 2012 – and the simultaneous acclaim of the pioneering UK premiere of his LOT AND HIS GOD at the Print Room, it is more crucial than ever that British theatre seizes the moment and lays claim to one of its most significant playwrights, celebrating the extraordinary imagination of his work...THANK YOUOur sincere thanks for all the support you are able to offer.Any donation you are able to make will have value far beyond its financial worth and directly help us to achieving our vision and ambition for this groundbreaking production.

Arcola is popular with established theatre literati as well as young innovators. It has become well known and has earned a large, diverse and loyal audience, for the variety of its programming – from new writing to classic drama, music and comedy.This production will also offer a pioneering programme of associated outreach events – including the Arcola’s first ever audio-described performance. To ensure we deliver this to the best possible standard, we are working with VocalEyes, a leading nationwide audio description charity, who provide access to the arts for blind and partially sighted people.By its nature theatre is a human and live art form, so inevitable things will go wrong, however our team, partners and collaborators have the know how to handle it when they do and take on the challenges we will face head-on.Thank you very much again for taking the time to look at our page and for your fantastic support in helping us reach our goal.

Two women, one half the age of the other, take wildly different paths in response to precisely the same events in this powerful short play about the stories we tell to get through life…GREY MAN was first produced by Shakespeare in Shoreditch Festival in an atmospheric found location, where it was praised as a ★★★★ “gorgeous, haunting monologue” by The Stage. REND Productions now transfers this highly successful production starring Jasmine Blackborow, to the Olivier Award winning Theatre503, and combines it with a contrasting interpretation of the play starring Kristin Hutchinson, for a limited one-week run.This innovative production takes precisely the same script and presents it in two divergent interpretations – one dark, sinister and emotionally devastating, the other light, playful and infused with hope for the future – so as to interrogate the play’s principal themes of mental illness and storytelling whilst playing with the form of what is possible onstage:Haunted by her past, Maya is a 50-year-old woman compulsively revisiting the site of a terrible family tragedy to re-tell the stories of her childhood. Filled with possibility for the future, Maya is a 25-year-old woman returning to the family home to help her sister recover from a debilitating mental illness.1. Supporting mental health service users in the Battersea area. At its heart, GREY MAN is about the way in which a young woman (Maya) is affected by her sister's battle with depression. We will be using themes and techniques explored in the play's rehearsal process as a stimulus for outreach workshops with mental health service users in the local Battersea area. Your support will be instrumental in providing these workshops to those who will most benefit from them. 2. Fair pay for up-and-coming artists. The team behind GREY MAN have been working hard to deliver this exciting production, and this transfer is a vital step in their careers. Your support can help further the career of an upcoming writer, actor, producer or creative - for example, rising-star new writer Lulu Raczka, whose recent CLYTEMNESTRA formed part of the Gate’s critically acclaimed THE IPHIGENIA QUARTET, or REND Productions’ Artistic Director Robyn Winfield-Smith, whose ★★★★ “exhilarating and provoking” (The Stage) HOWARD BARKER DOUBLE BILL at the Arcola last year garnered glowing reviews. Other GREY MAN creative team members include emerging Designer Natalie Parsons, sought-after young Lighting Designer Jamie Platt and up-and-coming Sound Designer Daffyd Gough.3. Supporting high-quality and powerful groundbreaking theatre. GREY MAN's concept is a thrilling new venture and one that builds on the success of the site-specific premiere whilst truly experimenting with form. This week-long run will see the fruition of the team's R&D on this concept, and has the potential to attract further industry interest in the piece.This Kickstarter campaign is part of a carefully developed fundraising strategy, which includes £5,625 already raised, along with several gifts in kind, and an Arts Council England application currently under consideration. The £250 from this campaign is essential for us to deliver the GREY MAN project to the high artistic, ethical and social standards we intend.It's worth saying that, if we go so far as to exceed our modest £250 target, then we will also be able to start reimbursing the many people who have generously gifted their time and resources to us over the past 5 months of the project's development!","There is no risk that this project will not happen, as we have already raised the minimum funds required to deliver the production. Our main risk is that, if we do not reach our Kickstarter target, we may not be able to achieve the full scope of our outreach project or pay our artists at full industry minimum rates. This Kickstarter campaign is part of a carefully developed fundraising strategy, and is essential in order for us to deliver the GREY MAN project fully, and to the high standard we intend. We therefore hope that you will choose to support! However big or small your donation, it will make a real difference to our project..."
https://www.kickstarter.com/projects/blee/cosplaying-in-san-diego?ref=discovery_category_newest,blee/cosplaying-in-san-diego,"So what is this campaign all about? Well, it's about the SAN DIEGO COMIC-CON!I've been very lucky, and very fortunate to have made the trip to the geek mecca the last few years, but this year it looks to be a little harder. What's changed? Well, in 2015, I quit my job, and started chasing the dream of creating comics & stories full time. And part of that journey is incorporating a company called, BIG HEAD PRODUCTIONS, to produce the work.Why is that relevant? Well, like any new/small business venture, my income took a hit, and as a result it's gonna make the trip this year immensely difficult. So I'm here, hoping to gain support.But why should you be interested in off-setting a cost of a vacation? Well, you probably shouldn't. But I hope I can give you a different perspective. I won't deny that there's always a lot of geeking out on this trip. But the main focus has always been getting my work out there. Be it meeting with companies to show my work, or line up meetings with persons of interest... the goal always being to show my work with hopes to get work in pop-culture & entertainment.So if there's a part of you who would want to help a guy chase a dream, I hope you'll support this campaign. Even if it's only a $1 or a share. Every little bit helps, I truly believe that.BUT I most definitely want, and would love, to give you something back for your philanthropy. In addition to a handful of geek-centric reward tiers that I hope you think are awesome, I think the big incentive here is that I will cosplay as WHATEVER YOU WANT!See, in the years I've gone to SDCC, I've never cosplayed. Be it time to get something together? Logistics of getting something to San Diego? Or just the anticipated difficulties of wearing a costume meeting with companies, I've just never done it.But none of that seemed to matter to my friends. They would always be like, ""DUDE! IT'S SAN DIEGO! YOU HAVE TO COSPLAY!!!"" That got to the point where I told them, ""Hey, you provide the costume and I will wear it!""And there it is. The top reward tiers for this campaign is a chance for you to dress me up like your Ken doll at SDCC! Pretty much, you pick/provide a costume, and I will wear it on the show floor. I'll snap a pic with a sign with your name or social handle for all to enjoy. I only have 2 rules:Short of that? Yea, I'll probably wear it. Haha.But ultimately how will this campaign help me create things? Well, building my brand will hopefully increase sales of my work, and obviously increase my income, that will let me make more things like you can find on BIG HEAD PRODUCTIONS, and YELLOWRANT.So I do hope you'll back this campaign. But whether you do or not, thank you so much for your time.—BenPSIf you wanted a closer look at some of the rewards, read on friend!Get a blind box of a handful of 1"" buttons pressed by me, featuring art by me. I might have a little bit of a button pressing problem. ;)Get a original, random, crappy (not-so-crappy) drawing of pop-culture goodness!Get an 11x17 print of pop-culture/fan art goodness!","The major risks and challenges to this... well, more challenges than risks, is if cosplay rewards are claimed, how to sort the logistics of changing on-site at the convention center, and making sure all of those tier backers get their photos. But to solve this, there is a plan in place to make everything mobile-ish, so I'm not carrying a big luggage bag around filled with costumes.Other than that? The other big challenge, probably even moreso than the cosplay, is getting exclusives for those reward tiers on this campaign. Well, getting exclusives is not necessarily hard... well, not as hard as exclusives for some companies than others. So exclusives will be purchased for those tiers.",https://www.kickstarter.com/projects/blee/skulltrooper-a-soft-enamel-pin-series?ref=discovery_category_newest,blee/skulltrooper-a-soft-enamel-pin-series,"So where did the idea for SKULLTROOPERS come from? Simply, vinyl toys. You know, the art toys more and more indie artists are tapped to design. If you're not aware, modding those toys has become a popular culture in it of itself, so much so the manufacturers would sell blanks of their forms for hobbyists to mod. And for the LONGEST time I've wanted to mod a toy, but I couldn't for the life of me think of what to do!Then it hit me.I've come to find that a lot of artists in this space have Stormtroopers or skeletons in their personal work. And I thought that would be a fun mash-up. And with that, SKULLTROOPERS were born!After meetings with companies and what not to show the work, variants sprang from the OG Trooper, and next thing I knew I had a whole line.Which brings me to Kickstarter. I would love to give this idea form. And while this sprang from an idea for idea for toys, I would love to see this happen as an enamel pin set.Each pin will measure approx. 2"" high. And you can see the collection below.I hope you dig the idea. And I hope you'll become a Backer.But if anything, thank you for your time.—BenUPDATE 6/4/19UPDATE 6/5/19","I can't think of any immediate risks or challenges, as all the art is done. It's just a matter of funding and fulfillment. If there are any unforeseen issues, I would imagine they would happen in the manufacture and/or shipping stage.

Ottenbacher, who has worked in the film industry for over a decade and with such studios as Dreamworks (Real Steel), Dimension Films (Spy Kids 4D), and Exxodus Pictures (Jinn) to name a few.The production will be of the Short films for a series Collection: The Fall, Harmless Monster, & Marguerite.Log Line - One man's devotion to a lost love — a devotion that results in the ultimate sacrifice of one life for another. 	""And like the dark flowers she grew behind the pale woodshed, I was to plant her in the earth so I could watch her grow from the grave.""                             – The Fall, Brandon F. OttenbacherLog Line - Some people can't escape their past, and as one man will soon find out, some histories are darker and more haunting than others.""Cold and broken he was now, as he was as a small child – The darkness had now caught up with him and cradled him, having mothered the boy from birth.""                       – Harmless Monster, Brandon F. Ottenbacher&Log Line - An obsessed man, driven by unanswered questions and emotional trauma, blurs the lines of reality and opens himself up to the unknown when he reaches out to the other side and his lost Marguerite.""The green porcelain tiles were close to the green of her eyes, the same green that coated the back patio awning under the stars that night, the same green that still shown under the water's surface.""                              – Marguerite, Brandon F. OttenbacherIf we succeed in reaching our funding goal we will be adding an additional 4th film to the collection.Log Line - A young overworked secretary comes home alone for Christmas break to her empty one bedroom apartment; but after getting the phone call she desperately desired, her night gets a little more interesting.Previous films we have worked on have been in film festivals (nationally and internationally), won awards (including Telly's and Humanitarian), played on the big screen in theatres, been available on Netflix,and had massive media success. We take pride in bringing new concepts to our audience while continuing to think outside the box when it comes to our visual storytelling methods – because of this, we are excited to have you be a part of our productions.Brandon F.

I chose to make thank you cards to experiment with choosing my own paper from a warehouse and using the paper as a color important to the design rather than just a background. This will help me further my own exploration in my final year of study. I am hoping that this experience will help me decide on the medium (print or digital) for my thesis project based on my findings.Using my typographic skills, and some free art, I created an elegant set of thank you cards in Adobe Illustrator.
