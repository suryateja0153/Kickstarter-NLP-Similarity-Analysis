SouthernSoul Blues Criticwww.reverbnation.com/billyjonesbluezIt's a long way from the rich, fertile delta lands of North Little Rock, Arkansas, to the Netherlands where he records for Dutch blues label Black and Tan Records, but for Billy Jones it was a route of which he never lost sight.Born into the segregated south, he was exposed to the driving beat of the Blues when he was still an infant. In the crib, he could hear it as it permeated the walls against which he slept. This sound which spoke to him gave him an early direction in life which he has pursued to this day.His early memories are of a juke joint from where he would draw inspiration; the images, and the folks he knew then are the stuff of his song. They gave him a mind-set that would drive him to perfect his craft as a guitar slinging blues man.Billy Jones is betting that the Blues can experience a revival of interest. What is needed is a fresh infusion of imagination. And to capture a bigger share of the Black music market, what is needed is for the Blues to once again become relevant to the African American experience.Before we talk of how a Delta Blues artist gets signed by a Dutch-owned label, ie Black and Tan Records, let's talk of how you started in this business. What was your first exposure to the Blues, and what are some of your earliest memories of this music?I was raised from the age of six months in my grandfather's cafe and boarding house, The Cedar Street Cafe - 903 Cedar Street - North Little Rock, Arkansas. The room that we lived in was directly behind the wall of the main ballroom where the juke box was. My crib was on the other side of that wall, so as a baby I would be laying there listening to Elmore James, Big Joe Turner, Jackie Wilson, B. B. King, Muddy Waters, Sam Cooke and all the blues and soul greats while the cafe customers played records and partied well into the night. My bed would vibrate on the bass notes. That was my first exposure to the music. I absorbed the music as I could literally hear it in my sleep. One of the first thoughts that I remember having was that I wanted to be like B.B. King and Elmore James.There was this dangerous juke-joint/nightclub place down the road from my grandfather's cafe called Jim Lindsey's Place. Many of the big ""chittlin' circuit"" stars of the day used to perform there like Howlin' Wolf, Sonny Boy Williamson and Bobby Blue Bland. Sometimes at night when everyone else was asleep, I would sneak out of the room and climb up high in an old chinaberry tree and watch what was going on over at Jim Lindsey's Place. I could hear the band from there and pretend that it was me onstage.All the pimps, players, dealers, whores and gangsters used to hang out there and someone was always getting shot or stabbed on a regular basis. Remember that this was the segregated south, so whenever someone would call for an ambulance for a shooting, or fight, at a the club, they would send a hearse from the black owned funeral home instead of an ambulance. If the victim was still alive they would take them to a black doctor. ...If not, they would take them to the funeral home.Of course I thought that these were the ""beautiful people"" and I wanted to be just like them when I grew up. Especially the musicians, with their tight-legged, sharkskin suits and Stacy Adams shoes, their jewelry and the way they wore their hair in a process. And the women! ...the way they used to dress back then was so glamorous! And of course Bobby Blue Bland's Cadillac. ...""No medical school for me dad... I'm gonna be a blues star.""The house band for Jim Lindsey's Place lived in an upstairs room over the club, and during the day I would go over there and try to hang out around them. They could tell that I really wanted to be a guitar player.There was this one musician who played at the club named Red Harpo... he told me that he was Slim Harpo's brother. I believed him. Whether he was or not, one thing is true, Red could play the hell out of a guitar! ... There was an air of excitement about him. Women would fight over him. He would let me come up to his room sometimes and talk to him while he would sip ""Golden Rod"" wine on ice and play and sing for me and show me how to play the new hit songs of the day, while I soaked-in all the information that he was giving me about being a real musician.By the time I was fourteen years old, I was hanging out at 'Williams Pool Hall.' One day this older guy pulled up in a 1957 Chevy station wagon packed full of amplifiers, microphones and drums He came in. He had that same air of excitement about him that Red had. He said that he was in a band and he had a gig booked in Lonoke, Arkasas that night and that he heard me play guitar and they were looking for a guitar player. He said that his name was Hosea Levy and that he and his younger brother Calvin Levy would pay me $6.00 if I played with them and Willie Cobb, Little Johnny Taylor and Larry ""Totsie"" Davis that night. I didn't tell him that I had never played in a band before. I was fourteen years old and I was going on the road! I was trying to be cool and I agreed to go with him. But I was so excited to be going to play with a real band!That was the first day that I went on the road with the Levy Brothers Band, and the beginning of a lifetime journey into the world of the blues . I've been on the road ever since. So it was ""on the job training"" for me.Now, how old were you when you first picked up the guitar? How did you become this accomplished musician that you are today?It's hard for me to remember when I didn't have a guitar... it's just something that I've always wanted to do.Because I loved guitars so much, around age four, or five years old, my uncle Vernon had given me a little plastic toy guitar with a music-box handle that played 'Pop Goes the Weasel' when you turned it. It was instant love. I used to stand in front of the juke box with that little guitar and pretend that I was every artist whose record was playing. I was always running around holding that guitar. I don't think I ever put it down.I think I really started getting serious about it during the summer between the 5th and 6th grade.I didn't play with the other children in my neighborhood that much. I hung around adult musicians and spent most of my time learning songs from records and trying to sound like the guys on the recordings. Sometimes I would hang out with the winos and perform for them. Some of my family thought I was weird. But music is both my occupation and my recreation. And I spent almost every waking moment playing it and studying and imitating the artists that I idolized. ...I guess that I was kinda weird.How did you start to playing gigs traveling from military installation to installation entertaining military members and their dependents? Were you in fact in the military at the time?No. I was not in the military. I always regretted that I didn't join the Air Force. I think that I would have liked it. This was during my twenties, after I had started my own band and was playing a lot of Rick James, Cameo, Funkadelic, Stanley Clarke, Hendrix, Bar-Kays, Commodores, Gap, Zapp, and that kinda thing. At that time I was being booked by this big-shot ""Clive Davis"" type guy named Gene Williams, who was really hooked-up with the Grand Ol' Opry and the Nashville scene and was managing Ferlin Husky, Claude King and Donna Douglas, who played the part of Elly Mae on the television show The Beverly Hillbillies.Since he couldn't book a black band in the Country Music Capitol of the World, he started booking me into NCO and Officer's clubs on Naval Stations, Air Force Bases, Army Posts and military installations all over the United States. I lived the military lifestyle without actually being in the military. GI women are great!I learned a lot and made a lot of friends... to this day I have the highest respect for military personnel. They are great people. They work hard and they play hard... and they love hard.Where did this traveling take you?To over 42 states... countless times. And to many clubs and shows that were booked off-base when we were in whatever city. I did that for ten years. I loved it!So you weren't traveling to Europe. It wasn't while traveling like this that you first met Jan Mittendorp of the Black and Tan Record label? How did he come to sign you for his label?I met Jan Mittendorp in 2004 when I sent a promotional CD of my music to him. He liked what I was doing and flew me over to Amsterdam to record some of my songs for Black and Tan Records.A few months later, after the 'tha Bluez' CD was released, I went back to do a month-long tour of Europe to support the release. We liked each other instantly and have been the best of friends ever since.He is a great guy to work with, and we still collaborate on various projects to this day. ...but the time has come for me to do my own thing.And this project is personal and special, and I am coming to all of my friends on Kickstarter to help me fund what I am hoping will be my greatest effort yet. ...an authentic contemporary funky southern soul, git ya' freak on blues rock recording funded by the people for the people and free of corporate obligation. ...I'm so excited ...it's all I can think about.According to sources you have a unique take on the ""corporate game"" as it pertains to the music industry. Can you share your ideas on the recording industry in general? How did you develop this perspective on the record industry?I was young and I was stupid and I was desperate for people to know me.Let me be the first to say that I have said a lot of senseless crap in order to get attention in my time. I'm not sure which particular proclamation you are referring to, but it may be the time that I said that some labels have chosen to force feed the public old ideas rather than offer them new ones. And that the response of the youth audience has been to ignore the music in droves. ...that pissed a lot of people off! ...damn! ...I'm sorry ok?What I want to do is to re-introduce the young urban audience to the music of their heritage by presenting it in a format that they can appreciate.I think that one of the reasons that the blues industry is becoming stagnant is because many labels discourage original ideas and many label owners are basically ""wannabe"" artists and bookkeepers, business guys who want to ""handle"" and ""direct"" their artist's careers in order to live out their own musical fantasies by dictating to the artist how the career ...and the music should go....sometimes before it is even written, instead of allowing the artist to be fully creative. That makes for mediocre songs. Some want to impose their own musical limitations into the creative process. They want the artist to be the ""idiot savant"" like Blind Tom, and create these musical masterpieces on demand, but let the label owner make all the business decisions and of course ...handle all the money.I have musician friends who sign with these carpet-bagger type of record labels who have them out touring all over the world and making records. The artists never see any reasonable amount of income for it and don't have what they need to get by on, while the record company guys screw them out of most of the money with the promise of those mysterious mechanical royalties that never seem to appear. If they do appear, then it's just enough to pay back the advance that you probably didn't get from the record company in the first place. The artists are like slaves to these guys. Now that's blues tradition!Some want formulas and repetition of familiar patterns and mimicry that they can re-package into neat little categories and sell to the public, much like the rock guys keep re-packaging Jimi Hendrix, and the Rasta guys keep re-packaging Bob Marley, or the blues guys keep re-packaging Muddy Waters and Robert Johnson. That has nothing to do with art or creativity or even music. It's just standard snake-oil sales tactics.When I first started sending my songs out to labels in order to shop for a recording deal, one of the biggest blues label owners in the game wrote me and said that I had no idea about what the public, especially the black audience wants to hear on a blues record and that I really needed to decide if I was going to be a bluesman, or a soul man, or a rock guy and to stick to that one thing, because if I released a recording with all those musical styles on one cd, the audience would be confused and wouldn't buy it. I think that he seriously underestimated both the musical tastes and the intellect of the general public.The ""my Hometown"" cd is exactly that. It's the biggest project that I have ever been involved with. The songs on the cd are being well received by people who listen to all types of music... not just blues.It was recently chosen by KLM Royal Dutch Airlines, Continental Airlines, Czech Airlines and 25 other international airlines to be included in their in-flight audio entertainment listings. If you are traveling by airplane please check it out on your in-flight audio player. The songs became available for passengers to listen to in the month of November. (...""that's a commercial!"") This recording has been gathering very positive critical reviews from music writers and getting high rotation international radio airplay. The ""my Hometown"" cd has been featured in several music publications. Has been #1 on XM Satellite Radio, and is presently #6 on the Real Blues Magazine Top 100 cd's charts. ...and I'm just getting warmed up!As much as this applies as much to the existing Blues labels, I am certain that this take applies more to the Big Four labels of the recording industry. How does Jan's approach differ?In any business situation there is gonna be negotiation and compromise. Jan is a pretty straight forward and honest guy. He's open to new concepts and ideas and I like working with him. ...He's cool.I'm sure that if I were signed to one of the big four that you mentioned, that 'my Hometown' would have never seen the light of day. I would have had to release a cd that sounds just like every other blues cd out there. The only thing that ever changes about some of those products is the name of the guy singing.Now recording for Jan's label and having toured Europe, you can certainly answer this: do you feel that the record industry is different in Europe than it is here in the States?Yes... In America the record industry has become an assembly-line, one-beat type of thing.All the rap songs sound the same. All the blues songs sound the same. All the subject matter sounds the same. If one song is a hit, then there is a rush to make every song after that sound just like that one.In Europe the music is not shaped by trends and fads.. It's shaped by talent.. ..and it just has to be good.Not that I'm down on corporate American music companies, but they are about numbers, not music. There is plenty of great music in America, but it is coming from the home studios and independent artists. There's some fantastic stuff that's coming off the streets that is re-shaping the dynamics of the industry.Do you find the audiences here and abroad different? In what ways?Yes... The European audience seems to listen to a wider spectrum of music than the American audience. They are open to all types of music and will listen to anything based on whether they like the song or not.I find that Americans tend to see music in the same way that they see fashion and fads.There is a ""herd"" mentality involved here where everybody wants to do what everyone else is doing.It's like musical segregation. If jazz is in vogue, then everyone in a certain peer group wants to listen to only jazz. Anyone who listens to anything different is considered un-cool by that group. Same with blues. Same with Hip-Hop. I think that this makes for a poor musical diet. There is something to learn from every musical genre.I once had a friend who gave me an album of Iranian sheep herder songs. At first listen, I dismissed it as illogical noise because I was not familiar with the scales and melodic patterns that were being played on what sounded to me like a banjo... I'm sure that it was an instrument specific to the region that the music came from and not a banjo, and I didn't understand the language that the songs were being sung. But by the third listen I had discovered that the music was fantastic!; the passion and intensity of the singer's delivery was amazing... and I found myself listening to it all the time. I ended up writing one of my most popular songs, 'Reconsider Baby', based on what I learned from that experience. Some music critics and scholars theorized that I had crafted the song by combining blues with hip-hop and Latin music. I don't suppose that they have ever heard much Iranian sheep herding music. I still have that album... it's one of my most treasured possessions.How did you come to refer to your music as ""Bluez""? Is this to differentiate your music from the music created by the ""record industry""?https://www.facebook.com/billy.j.bluezYes, it is...I have studied many types of music, including jazz, country, rock, funk, R&B, punk, new wave or whatever, and I wanted to incorporate some of the elements from all of these styles into my original music.I didn't want to use the standard term ""blues"" because I realized the to the youth audience blues equals old. I didn't want to align myself with the ""old blues guy"" stereotype because this music anything but that.There is no mention of the mule or the cotton or the tractor on this project. Those are issues of today's audiences grandparents. While most blues music is focused on the past...this is music for the 21st century. And while most blues music is written by men for men, many of my songs are directed to the female listener. They address some of the social concerns and romantic intricacies of modern-day urban existence. This music is something new and different and delivers social commentaries and messages that the urban audience can relate to.How long have you worked to infuse an urban element into your music? How has it been received by your audience?I never intentionally set out to ""urbanize"" my music. I just wanted to learn everything that I could about my craft and how to please the audience that was in front of me that day. It was just natural evolution. The reception has been overwhelmingly positive from the general public... not so much by the blues purists.Can we hear more of this influence on this latest CD of yours, than on your previous?Definitely on the ""my Hometown"" cd. On previous releases you can hear hints of the influence, but I had to ""dumb it down"" a little in order to appease the label owners and record songs that were a little more predictable in order to get them to release the recordings. However, when I met Jan Mittendorp and signed with Black and Tan records, part of our agreement was that I would have complete artistic freedom; I would write the music the way that I thought it should be... If it wasn't too ""artistic"" to release, then Black and Tan would release it. This has been my most popular recording ever! Although my ""Prime Suspect for the Blues"" cd did well, there's no comparison to the response that ""my Hometown"" is receiving.Presently a number of Black artists are working to merge Blues music with Hip-hop. This would include artists such as Billy Branch, Russ Greene, Chris Thomas-King, among others. In fact, R L Burnside even did his take on this cross-infusion of the Blues, which was met with mixed reviews. Do you see your music going in this direction?What these artists understand... and the reviewers and ""experts"" probably don't, is this:Hip-Hop has evolved from blues and is very much a part of it.... Hip-Hop is the blues of today.If you analyze the greatest hip-hop songs of all time, like ""The Message"" by Grand Master Flash and The Furious Five, or ""How Do You Want It?"" by Tu Pac Shakur ...(which is based on the hook from ""Body Heat"" by Quincy Jones), ...it's easy to hear that these songs are pure blues with African/Jamaican bass lines and drum beats. Of course, the stories that these songs tell are undeniable blues themes that reach deep into the heart of the African American experience. I love a little ""gangsta"" in my blues.Do you agree with the assertion that the white artist has been more closely bound by tradition, whereas the Black artist has always been more progressive in their approach to the music, looking for the ""next big thing""? This, perhaps, can be seen more in Jazz than in Blues.Are these attempts at cross-infusion done more for the music, or is it being done for the rewards that the urban artist seems to be enjoying, the ""bling""?Definitely for the music. I don't think that it has very much to do with the ""bling"".... little if anything.Of course any artist wants to be well compensated for their work... I certainly do.But the battle between the blues purist and the blues artist has gone on long before now. The artist wants to be artistic and create and innovate.... the purist doesn't want anything to change. No new instruments, no synthesizers, no drum machines, no new nothing. If Muddy didn't do it... it's wrong.But when Bob Dylan and Muddy Waters switched from acoustic to electric guitar the purists said that they were ruining the art-form. Look at all the great classics that were created because they ignored the ""experts"". I have concluded that the purists are just a handful old guys who's opinions don't really matter.What the artist is trying to do is stretch the boundaries of the music and infuse elements that will appeal to a contemporary audience and to bring something new and relevant to the table.However, if the ""experts"" want to tell the artist what the song should sound like before it is written, there probably won't be much ""bling"" forthcoming. They won't sell many to people who buy cd's today. If an artist can reach the public and they love the music, then the ""bling"" will be just a pleasant side-effect.As far as the musicians that are bound by tradition, I don't think that they are so much bound by tradition as maybe lacking in imagination and a working knowledge of modern beats and rhythmic patterns.In order to compete effectively in the music business you have to stay on top of current events. That means that you have to have an understanding of contemporary musical styles and trends.I remember reading in a biography of Elvis that no matter where he was he was always listening to the radio in order to monitor musical trends and to hear what his competitors were doing. And he was Elvis!Music is about constantly learning. Some guys don't like to put out that extra effort to stay on top of it. They want to play the same old stuff that they already know and pass it off as ""keeping the music alive"". Many of them are taking the safe road of mimicking artist of the past and sticking to a pre-determined formula or constantly re-recording old songs for an old audience instead of reaching out to draw in a new audience. Kinda like a boxer ""laying on the ropes"" and making easy money and waiting for the bell.There's nothing wrong with that, I know many who make a decent living doing it... for a long time I did it. But now I think have something that I want to say, and I want my music to appeal to a mass audience.Is this image (the rewards) a creation of the ""corporate entertainment business""?No, it is not... it's a creation of the hip-hop industry and the age of music video. It is an expression of what the young black audiences wants to see. What they want to be.One of the biggest obstacles to selling blues music to young blacks is that the blues industry projects the images of poverty and ignorance and servitude as part of it's selling points, and young black people overwhelmingly reject that picture.There is an overseer mentality to the whole scene.If you have ever had to be poor then you probably wouldn't want to buy products that imply poverty.Young black people want their heroes to be successful, tech savvy, dress well, have money and nice cars. Not so much ""workin' for the man"" and ""moseyin' on down da road."" The blues industry needs a major image make-over in order to connect with young black America.Do you feel that these urban images as it is depicted in Hip-Hop more closely reflect the Black condition as it exists today?Yes... black people have worked hard to escape that lifestyle and better their condition.The other images have nothing to do with this century.Do you feel that the urbanization of Blues music is an effective way of reaching a younger market? To what market are you ultimately hoping to appeal?Definitely... it's the only way to reach the younger market.I want my music to appeal to everyone. That's what seems to be happening. The stories that I tell on this cd are true and universal. People across all genres are embracing the music.https://www.facebook.com/pages/billy-jones-bluez-offical-fan-page/376369371116?ref=notif¬if_t=page_new_likes",...I don't forsee any risks at this point.

This system is simple, minimal costs, and virtually no upkeep, and so fun to be around that questions come in “how often can I open the hive up and look inside?”Help Eco Bee Box further develop this system buy helping support the new clear honeycomb containers. A mini frame can be placed into this container right at the hive, and immediately it is ready for market. ·Storing and selling mini frames of natural combhoney prepared 100% by the bees·This Container can be used by the consumer toseparate honey from wax·Smallest inexpensive mini observation hive possible,ideal for classrooms·Can be used as an incubator for hatching queensnaturally·Ideal sharing frames of bees, eggs and larvae tobeekeepers that need emergency resources·A clean way to store finished frames of honey inthe freezer to prevent damage & crystallization·Can pour liquid honey into the container forsale instead of plastic bottles·Great display case show-casing the perfect frame·A simple way to contain a potential diseasedframe for transportation and inspection.This container completes our system, from beginning to harvest. In addition to the container, help is needed to publish the first in depth historical book on how bees migrated to the western Territory of Deseret (now Utah). I have spent considerable time researching and documenting this era and discovered many facts previously undocumented.Some interesting facts include: Brigham Young was a beekeeper as early as 1851; first commercial importer of bees into Utah and also later exported to Idaho and Montana; details of the early bee being described as a black bee later Italian bees replaced them; the types of beehives viewed as best for beekeepers in 19th century; sale of swarms in 1860's selling for $13 each; first documented importing of queens from Pennsylvania; in 1871 18,000lbs of bees were brought to Utah via rail car; excerpts of a beekeeper's diary from 1870;l early names in beekeeping and problems that vexed them; symbolism of the hive and it's relationship to a community; facts about how bees came to the west and by who; and so much more.The publishing of this historic bookis too high to cover alone.

These hives have found their way to countries all over the world and every US State and most Provinces in Canada.Spring is soon here, so it is essential you get ready for honey bees now. Saving honey bees begins with the beekeeper. The equipment designed and made by Eco Bee Box is perfect for learning and is made to last a lifetime. No longer does a bee-hive have to consist of white painted and repainted deteriorating boxes. Have a bee-hive in your yard that speaks highly of what is housed inside them. The lessons of beekeeping are easy with a bee-hive made to be easy for the bee colony to grow in AND ideal for the beekeeper to learn with. Dubbed as ""training wheels"" for new beekeepers of almost any age. Nowhere will you find a hive, other than the Mini Urban Beehive, that gives slow hands-on training and instead of the first problem ending in failure can repopulate and go again. Watch the video for how this system works and judge whether it is perfect for you.Other systems can be expensive to start, other systems suffer regular failure with additional costs when honey is to be harvested. This system has no extracting costs, no maintenance costs, no plastics which the bee hate, does not need to be painted, is held together with patented hardware which prevents warping of panels, and on it goes. Imagine raising a queen bee of your own? Giving your queen a name? The honey you produce can be harvested with the help of a sandwich baggy instead of expensive equipment that takes space when not being used. Small frames of honey can be removed throughout the season instead of all at once at the end of the year. By taking honey at random times of honey cultivating, the end result is honey flavor varys throughout the season. Each time a new flavor can be tasted, depending on what was blooming. It is essential the beekeeper learns what is happening inside the hive. Just like knowing what is happening in a child's life - good or bad, this time provides learning insights otherwise lost. Inside the bee hive is an amazing world. The following is taken from an article I recently wrote called ""The Honor and Art of Being a Mentor"",""Understand a bee colony is a world-in-itself. A queen exists, with attendants, nursery and caregivers known as nurse bees, custodians and engineers, cooks, wax producers, dock workers, disaster clean-up and restoration personal, inventory control with supply trains with food, water and medicinal supplies, some are undertakers, marines, scouts with messages and others as support staff. Each active colony has drone immigrants from the surrounding area to support their own male fraternity. The hive is also populated with thousands of support organisms. These can live symbiotically within the bee and inside the hive. Bees create a hive envelope on the inside walls of their hive, that is populated with numerous microorganisms. The beekeeper is the guardian to this developing world and can assist but needs to learn what helps and what does not.""Not only does Eco Bee Box create amazing hives, but Albert Chubak also teaches through mentoring and produces short fun articles regularly to help the learning beekeeper. No need to be standing at the hive with your jaw dropped with questions streaming through your mind like a news broadcast. The magazine listed in the rewards began with 450 questions people ask that were organized and made into a colorful magazine a child can enjoy. It has NO ADVERTISEMENTS, 40 pages of fun colorful learning. Ideal for a waiting room table in any office. Add to the magazines about cars, beauty, popular celebrities, movies and on the list goes, add this award winning magazine about bees and beekeeping. Please help Eco Bee Box launch and grow by funding this American dream.https://www.ecobeebox.com ","Labor disputes, shipper strikes, natural disasters, explosions related to locations hives are traveling through, and any number of other horrible challenges can occur and exist.  Despite the challenges, the hives will be sent with insurance.  If a delay occurs, all involved will be notified."

He is here to judge you based on your perils, not save you from them. The land of the living is a testing bed to see who is truly worthy of Heaven.Saying you are sorry isn't making right with God. Truly being sorry deep in the depths of your soul is how to make things right with God.The Book of Revelations should have foretold the prophesies without issue. At a certain time which is covered in the New Book, Mankind's use of freewill thwarted the fate and consequently the Return of the Savior was compromised.The Original and New Testaments, handed down generation to generation, are not exactly as they were originally written. The hand of mankind through freewill edited the Holy Book and perception foretold by the preachers became the reality to the congregations.All that is unclear shall meet its clarity. All that was left up to perception is now concise. The Final Testament has been written and shall come to be known to Mankind through your faith and generosity.The Terminating Testament is coming in October. Perversion of man's hand has been removed and the untainted reality of God, Lucifer, Jesus, Mary and other descendants shall be recognized and known throughout the pages of the New and Profound Testament... and through the storm she will rise.. a moment where time will stop and eternity will begin. Swift yet subtle, she has intention without remorse.. and the world will forever remember her name.Perhaps one of the most unnerving things that may create controversy with this book is this passage. Jesus, The Son of God, died for Mankind's sins... and She, on the contrary, will live for them.",The book itself came together in pieces and at random times and order. It is being placed into the chronological order currently. It will need to be brought to a printing company so that the documents can become a physical book.Depending on orders the books may be shipped earlier but October is safe to assume as the writing has already been completed. I cannot assume a press would take more than a few months to produce this once the order is in at the end of the Kickstarter. Assuming obviously that it is backed with the faith and generosity of the people.,https://www.kickstarter.com/projects/164646305/culminating-testament-of-the-holy-bible?ref=discovery_category_newest,164646305/culminating-testament-of-the-holy-bible,"We have lost faith in so many regions.Maybe it was loved ones passing away, others due to stress in this world without relief, and even some simply because the evidence of God is not here.This testament explains the status quo that the mortal world views from the eternal world.

The answer is found within the pages of the new and final book.Other questions such as reincarnation, sexuality, evolution, karma, and deja vu are answered within the pages.God, Jesus, Mary, Lucifer, and his son take us to the current day with explanation of recent times and the changes it brought. A dive into the second coming of Christ, The use of freewill, how mankind changed and redirected the world which is seemingly in status quo, and if a new redeemer is coming and what surprises have happened. Has the governing authority in any place changed over time?The word should be a hard pill to swallow and it will be. Faith and humanity will be restored as this book reaches people. A Princess and Empress may be on the horizon, but will either help bring us to our salvation? or maybe our damnation.The book takes us from the mid 1900s when freewill crushed the fate of the world and redirected it on a new unpredicted course. It will cover the adjustments, issues, and solutions. This book will show you where we are today, what it means, and how we got here.This Kickstarter is to distribute the third installment of The Holy Bible. A book of clarity that sums up questions humanity has had and offers information and views which were deleted and edited by freewill throughout ages.The money will produce the book, bookmarks, and the medallions. The additional funds received are going toward the distribution of it to bookstores and places of worship along with press releases in the attempt to spread the word.This is the second attempt to kickstart this. The price per book has decreased from $29 to $10 due to the book now being offered as a soft cover vice a hardcover.","Risks will simply if the medallions, bookmarks or books are delayed.

Important for this are the use of local agricultural products and the cultivation of niche raw materials for the production of healthy and innovative products. In this way I create tasty food without any additives and flavourings, edible cosmetics and toiletries like shampoo, shower gel etc. The basics for all products are home-grown herbs, vegetables, fruits and cereals. For the cultivation and production of all ingredients I´m using for the moment a relatively small area, which is big enough to live of it and to sell my products from a small shop in Gmünd, Carinthia, Austria (www.genuss-kunst.at). It´s so easy that you do not need middlemen and organisations behind you. After one year I started professionally my business I was able to establish my own income, started an Online-Sale and opened a shop in the middle of my home town. Finally, I´m an active integral part of the local and regional tourism of my town a region because tourists love “local products” as a small gift for their families and friends back home. Such a small business is also a pull-factor for a sustainable local tourism and only sustainable tourism constituted a safe way to the future.To extend my knowledge and business in the cultivation and production of local herbs I studied Phytotherapy for the use of extracts of natural origins as health-promoting agents. Phytotherapy is distinct from homeopathy and anthroposophic medicine, and avoids mixing plant and synthetic bioactive substances. Traditional phytotherapy is a synonym for herbalism and regarded as alternative medicine by much of Western medicine.I do love my work by my heart. It is so fine to sow and see how the plants will grow. And I want to give my motivation to other interesting women. Every year practioneers have the possibility to get knowledge of phytotherapie with regional, organic herbs and learn how to produce natural cosmetics, toiletries and homemade remedies.Local – handcrafted – pure nature.My first aim is to encourage especially women living in rural areas with high unemployment rates and to present and to train them on how to cultivate home-grown herbs, vegetables and fruits, how to produce and how to use such products. In this way I can support them in getting an own income, to achieve a greater independency and to develop small business and regional markets. The second aim is to establish a know-how-transfer-centre for the development of small business in the field of urban farming in other countries for the development of local tourism. Every region in the world has a something “region-specialty”, is famous for something and has enormous potential for a sustainable “local and urban farming” development for future generations. Especially home-grown herbs, its biological diversity are a local wealth and most of the people are not informed at all about that richness and ignored its value but this region´s biological diversity represented exactly a big advantage. Performance Goals:1. Establishment of a sustainable livelihood2. Know-How-Transfer on how to do it (by using modern management and marketing knowledge and tools)3. Drafting a book for practitioners (local – handcrafted – pure nature)This project is also dedicated to preserving nature respecting, the natural cylces in the area. As all our products are grown organically, our work will preserve nature in the region and help increase other farmers´ awareness of the necessity of producing according to natures laws. In addition to that I will put up additional beehives in my fields and meadows which are free of pesticides and GMO seeds with the intention of creating bee sanctuary. Everything will be presented to interested persons in practical workshops in my farming centre and on-the-spot. Also all products will be available online so the urban buyer gets 100% natural quality directly from source. Without intermediaries the consumer buys at a virtual farmers´market at neighbourhood prices. The direct sale online and in the corner shop through markets demand for all my herb products is huge and I am now on a cross road. Therefore and for the next steps to my vision I need your help for:1.	take the facility to the next level to continue this way2.	expand into offering more innovate, healthy products3.	co-working women, traineesTo date I have financed my business 100% myself and without dept. If you consider that natural, local, handcrafted products are imortant for all of us, then please join the way with me. If you are also fascinated about the spirit and the power of our local herbs, vegetables, fruits and cereals, than please give me the chance to continue the way.  If you also think that is very important to save income in rural regions, than please join in and help saving women indecency. I´m so grateful for any support I receive!","For three years I have lived by my farming and its direct marketing. What could be happen during the project implentation? Well, I am working with and in the nature, so when the weather is bad or there is too much sun in the next season, then I have less herbs.

Seit 5 Jahren gibt es regional das Oberkärntner Landladl. Alte bäuerliche Hausmittel mit dem Wissen von Heute wurden kombiniert und werden für natur- und gesundheitsbewußte Menschen direkt ab Hof zugänglich gemacht. Ich gehöre zu einer neuen Generation von weiblichen Landwirtinnen. Eine Generation, der es wichtig ist, gesund und nachhaltig zu leben und zu arbeiten. Wichtig dafür sind die Verwendung von regionalen Produkten und die Möglichkeit zu schaffen mit Nischenprodukten eine gut gehende Landwirtschaft aufzubauen. Dafür baue ich alte Sorten von Kräuter und Gemüse an und sammle regionale Wildkräuter, um diese zu gesunden, innovativen Produkten zu verarbeiten. Gesunde Genussmittel ohne jeglicher Zusatz- und Geschmacksstoffe, essbare Kosmetik und Pflege mit den machtvollen Wirkstoffen heimischer Kräuter.Ziel ist es so gut wie möglich alles, was man zum täglichen Leben braucht, selbst herzustellen und zu verwenden (Lebensmittel, Genussmittel, Hausmittel, Putzmittel, Naturkosmetik, Dünge- und Pflanzenschutzmittel). Das ist mein Weg, den ich gefunden habe, um damit in den Vollerwerb zu gehen. Dazu habe ich mit einem Kollegen gemeinsam einen kleinen Naturprodukte-Laden in Gmünd aufgemacht (unser beider Hofladen), der sehr gut angenommen wird. Parallel dazu gibt es alle Produkte auch online zu bestellen. In meiner kleinen Kräutermanufaktur werden alle Produkte nach strengen Kriterien hergestellt und direkt ab Hof (online und im Laden) verkauft. Dazu habe ich mir selbst die Landladl-Kriterien und Wertehaltung erarbeitet: professionelle Permakultur – mit Gärtnern ohne Gift, Kreislauf auf Grund und Boden aufrecht erhalten, alte Sorten wieder beleben und hohe Hygieneauflagen bei der Verarbeitung.•	Ich habe jetzt 5 Jahre Erfahrungen damit gesammelt und bin auf einem sehr guten Weg. Jetzt geht es um die nächste Stufe – den Ausbau des virtuellen Hofladens.•	Dann geht es darum regionale Partner ins Boot zu holen, um den Nachhaltigkeitsgedanken weiter zu tragen (Bäcker, Gärtnereien, Sämereien, Handel, Gastronomie…)•	Wichtig finde ich auch, sich um die ländlichen Strukturen Gedanken zu machen und anderen Frauen zeigen, wie sie sich Unabhängigkeit und ein eigenes Einkommen sichern können.Dazu ist der nächste Schritt ein kleines landwirtschaftliches Zentrum zu entwickeln, wo Erfahrungen ausgetauscht werden können, neue Produkte entwickelt und getestet werden können und dies auch grenzüberschreitend passieren kann.Realisierung dieses Projektes: Abhof-Produkte aus der KräutermanufakturNachdem ich in einer ländlichen Gegend im Süden von Österreich zu hause bin, wo es nur begrenzte Jobmöglichkeiten und finanzielle Absicherung gibt, möchte ich anhand meiner Kräutermanufaktur zeigen, wie es in den verschiedensten ländlichen Gebieten möglich wird, sich selbst ein Einkommen zu generieren. Ich möchte meine Erfahrungen und Erkenntnisse teilen und aufgrund meiner 25jährigen Selbständigkeit als Marketingberaterin die notwendigen Werkzeuge und Wertehaltungen dafür mitgeben. Ich bewirtschafte derzeit alles alleine. Es ist ein kleiner landwirtschaftlicher Betrieb mit 2,83 ha und damit bin ich trotzdem im Vollerwerb. Meine Spezialisierung auf alte bäuerliche Hausmittel und die Zusammenarbeit mit regionalen Partnern zeigen, dass ich auf dem richtigen Weg bin. Die Nachfrage online und im Hofladen sind enorm und bringen mich gerade an eine Kreuzung: Expansion und Know-how Transfer für andere, um sich ebenfalls den Lebenstraum zu erfüllen nachhaltig zu leben und zu arbeiten. Bisher habe ich alles zu 100% selbst finanziert (ohne Kredite).Für die nächsten Schritte und zur Absicherung des landwirtschaftlichen Betriebes brauche ich bitte Eure Hilfe:1.	Um die kleine Kräutermanufaktur weiter zu entwickeln, brauche ich ein Glashaus und weitere Geräte zur Feldbearbeitung.2.	Alle Möglichkeiten zu schaffen, damit auch Stadtbewohner die Gelegenheit haben, direkt ab Hof (online) einzukaufen (dazu gehört: Lagererweiterung, Webseitenausbau, Werbemittel und Verpackungsmaterial).3.	Praktikanten und Frauen einzustellen, die bei mir lernen möchten, um sich dann selbst ein Einkommen zu generieren.Ich bin so dankbar für den Weg, den ich gerade gehen darf. Wenn Ihr ebenso denkt wie ich, bitte ich Euch mir weiterzuhelfen und meine kleine Kräutermanufaktur auf die nächste Ebene zu heben. Dies beinhaltet auch die Schaffung des landwirtschaftlichen Zentrums für innovative Nischenproduktentwicklungen, um anderen Frauen zu helfen sich eine Unabhängigkeit aufzubauen. Mir liegt eine nachhaltige Lebensweise sehr am Herzen und wenn sie Euch auch so wichtig ist, dann bitte geht den Weg mit mir.","Die letzten 5 Jahre haben gezeigt, dass das Wetter und der Boden für den Erfolg meiner Landwirtschaft die wichtigsten Faktoren sind. Mittlerweile weiß ich die Produktionsmengen und kann gegebenenfalls reagieren, sollte in einem Jahr die Ernte etwas schlechter ausfallen. Wildkräuter ergänzen meinen Anbau und können zum Teil auch ersetzen (z.B. der Giersch ist ein toller Ersatz für Petersilie). Die Herausforderung der nächsten Zeit ist es, mit der Produktion nachzukommen. Dazu hatte ich bereits heuer im Sommer eine Praktikantin zusätzlich und meine Familie unterstützt mich hervorragend. Ich werde aber sicher noch weitere Mitarbeiter benötigen, um die Nachfrage zu schaffen."

The learning and the experience was well worth the 9k, however it would not be good for the company to pay that for every show. After doing research, for $25,000 we could buy the equipment required and produce a live stream ourselves. The other $25,000 would be for traveling expenses, promotion, and marketing.

IHeartTRC started as a couch conversation between Ben and a few of his Marine Corps buddies. While dreaming of how good Taco, Rice, & Cheese would have tasted right then and there, Ben thought to himself, WHAT! I have been to culinary school, I love to cook, I have business education and experience! Why not me why can't I be the start of something awesome! After making TRC and perfecting his recipe Ben decided to focus all of his energy on starting IHeartTRC!Ben's TRC Story:While serving a two year tour in Okinawa Ben and his buddies discovered TRC during many, many nights out on the town of Kintown partaking in alcoholic beverages. After many drinks were consumed, and balance had become a challenge Ben and his buddies needed something to soak up all of the alcohol, so they would not be hung over in the morning when they had to do PT(Physical Fitness), which included a 3 mile run! So they stopped by a hole in the wall taco joint called King Taco. King Taco served tacos, burgers, fries, and of course taco, rice, and cheese! Ben and his buddies would devour all of the TRC in minutes and then pile into Hanchos (Japanese for Taxi) and head back to base to sleep off the alcohol.The next morning Ben and his buddies would hop out of bed throw on their PT gear, and off to run they went, with out a hang over! Why did they not get a hang over because of the TRC! The combination of carbs, protein, and the calcium from the cheese would fight those dreaded hang over symptoms, and return them to regular human status.After going in to town during the day Ben and his buddies decided to see how good TRC was when you are not intoxicated. They went to their favorite spot, King Taco, and discovered that TRC was even more delicious and you could get it in different flavors! Chicken, Pork, and Mystery Meat! They tried all but the mystery meat and decided that one day they would bring it to the states! That day ladies and gents is now, now is the time to unleash the TRC beast and share it with everyone!IHeartTRC is going to bring TRC to the Dallas-Fort Worth Metroplex first and then expand from there to share the love for TRC with all!

After we are fully compliant, we need to procure all necessary supplies (Groceries, cups/utensils (hopefully with your name on them), kitchen supplies, and all of the necessities to run the truck.4. Finally after all the important stuff is out of the way, we will have a grand opening event with music, food, and prizes to show all of appreciation to all of our backers!","After we are funded some of the risks that we might run in to are:The Truck fails because:1. Money runs out and nobody comes to support us. Booooo! I would never let this happen, I am making sure that there is a following that will prevail and make TRC a staple food in DFW and throughout the country once we become a big enough company.2. Food costs rise out of control! What is this world coming too! If this happens I will combat these food costs with a slight rise in over costs of the TRC. I will also find ways to save money without degrading the quality of food or the integrity of IHeartTRC! One way to combat food cost is to grow your own produce, this is a goal of IHeartTRC to be able to grow our own produce in a the most natural and organic ways possible. 3. Economy goes into the crapper!Oh no! This is not good, but I am Marine and do not retreat. I will make the necessary moves to ensure that IHeartTRC remains profitable and continues to grow as a company. I am an innovative and resilient individual who always finds the positive even in a negative situation.4. The IHeartTRC followers do not like the food!What!

It can vary depending on the mood of the viewer or even the environment it was watched in making it difficult for an objective review that applies in all situations.  There are many review websites, but one thing in common with most of them is that the review is reduced to a single number or measurement.  This is single dimensional and doesn't encompass the complex reaction of each individual. MoodyCriticuses an extensively developed method for capturing an accurate emotional assessment of a movie known as the MoodMap.  This will give the movie go-er a better sense of whether it will be a positive or negative experience depending on the current mood viewer. The larger the emoji displayed on the MoodMap, the more votes that emotion has versus other emotions.The MoodyCritic website has been live for about a couple weeks and the visits aregrowing.The website is fully functional with only a few minor updates needed. The primary improvement will be a reward system for doing reviews. This is critical for increasing the reviewer base.Once the website visitor numbers increase to about 10000, we will start monetizing the website through advertising.The majority of the funds raised through Kickstarter will be used for advertising in the following locations:We at MoodyCritic believe that the current methods of reviewing movies and consuming reviews is inadequate and we have the answer. The MoodMap is trendy, functional, and plays well with current social media practices. Please support us in making MoodyCritic a success.","The most significant risk is the MoodMap is not an accepted form of a movie review or marketing is insufficient to get the word out.

Is the a/c in your car broke? The vision of my invention is to produce a product to effectively provide air conditioning to small vehicles. According to WebMD Allergic rhinitis, is a condition that affects 40 million to 60 million Americans. Allergic rhinitis is commonly known as hay fever. Allergic rhinitis, like skin rashes and other allergies, develops when the body’s immune system becomes sensitized and overreacts to something in the environment that typically causes no problem in most people. Most people do not realize that while their windows are close environment is still entering into the car through the vents therefore trigging the consumer sinuses.While owning a Chevy Cavalier and having the A/C break down I could not afford the cost of repairs. As a result I traded in my vehicle for a new car, however soon learned that at allergy peak season I could not use the air in my new car because of my allergies that would make me continuously sneeze which is very dangerous while driving on the highway.The concept of my invention in form as well as its functionality is simple.Suggested Dimensions for universal fit •	A/C system 8.1 x 2.2 x 6.4 inches (2.6 lbs)•	Vent towers 11.2 x 8.2 x 6 inches (2 watts), (2.6 lbs) •	Central remote control air vent clip 2.4 x 0.5 x 4.4 inches (4.5 ounces) • Key-chain remote (1.8 ounces)Benefits• Automobile does not have to be running, as unit system is battery operated.• Consumers with allergies can use system during peak season.• Battery is replaceable","Since the photo is a concept representation for prototype for further research and development, more time on developing consumer education resources will be required."

It is about freedom versus slavery. It is about the courage of the elves.Risky Waters is a project I started 8 months ago. It began as some concept art for a shipwreck simulator app, inspired by the story of a Mexican fisherman, who, due to his faith in God, survived for 13 months adrift in the Pacific Ocean. But it later changed into something different as I drew some dragons and wanted to incorporate them into the program. It continues to evolve, and the flying hearts which replenish health were only added a few days ago.You may have noticed the video is a bit slow at times.The app is heavily optimized and runs smoothly at 60 frames per second on an android smartphone and emulated on my 300 dollar laptop, which I also am using to create it, but the laptop's integrated Intel graphics card struggles a bit when recording videos. I want to pay Derek Fiechter, the creator of the music behind Risky Waters, enough that he continues to make inspirational elf-themed music.Funding will help this game get publicity, keep me on my feet for a while, upgrade my laptop, avoid the Russian Mafia, and help me to continue designing things. To the people who pledge $100, I will release the early android beta test in December, and some time later I will release the basic version of the game to everyone. With enough resources, I would like to add:-Apple iOS compatibility-Good compatibility with a myriad of mobile devices-Stages with variety and a rich storyline rather than repetition-Land exploration-Animals, non-player characters, allies, skeleton warriors, zeppelins-Sailing across seas in addition to rivers-Docks to stop at, with boat repairs-More sea creatures-Other races, such as Dwarves",Sometimes projects get the wrong kind of attention.

https://www.kickstarter.com/projects/759684284/safety-aware?ref=discovery_category_newest,759684284/safety-aware,"In the beginning of my creation journey forSafety Aware, I reflected on my own childhood experiences, and how things have changed from the 50’s to the 21st Century teens. Autism was first used for diagnostic purposes in 1943, and has become a term most people are familiar with today. Child abuse is also a familiar social problem all adults know about; some throughexposure to the negative experience itself. The Australian government ‘Child Abuse and Neglect Statistics’ reports a steady increase in notifications made for child abuse and neglect in recent times (2011-2016) which could represent an overall increase in prevelence of child abuse. The Australian institute of Health and Welfare also note an increase in Autism in recent years. Although these statistics could be more representative of differences in diagnostic criteria for autism and reported vs. actual abuse in child abuse statistics, everyone seems to agree that both of these problems have steadily increased over time.With technology’s booming growth curve, it was only a matter of time before it could be used as a tool to address these problems.The invention of the i-pad/tablet, provides a new engaging platform to showcase numerous Apps that inspire, entertain, and educate the masses. Its’ visual-friendly platform shows great promise for children with autism who process visual information quickly and effortlessly. What was (and continues to be) disappointing is the asence of Apps designed for children in any subgroup to teach them the skills required to help avoid or escape abuse. For this reason, I set out to develop a child protection App specifically designed for children with autism which could also be used for all children between the ages of 7-14. As a teacher of 30+ years, and a survivor of child abuse, this project is an important part of my life’s work. If I can help one child; then my App has achieved success. If it can help thousands of children all around the world, I will take great pride in having shone a prism of light through a storm to reveal a rainbow; thus, making something beautiful out of something ugly.Throughout my experiences as an educator and leader for students with Autism and their “neurotypical” peers (students who are not on the autism spectrum), I have been privileged to get to know hundreds of children. I’ve witnessed each student’s journey throughout the teachings of the ‘village’. The village I fondly refer to includes my colleagues, the community, and my student’s families. I have never been so ego-driven to assume that their learning is exclusively the result of my teaching. I’ve welcomed others to join the ‘team’, as everyone has unique skills and something personal to offer.Extending my teaching beyond the classroom has resulted in some very rich instruction which has provided opportunities for my students to achieve the best educational outcomes possible.I now invite you to become a member of the village to help fund Safety Aware as I can no longer do this on my own. Yes.... my vision is big; but a village can do amazing things together! In the big picture, I envisage making a positive impact on the age-old problem of child abuse. I plan to address this by providing the knowledge and skills required for kids to recognize grooming and abuse, employ strategies to keep them safe, or escape situations that are potentially dangerous through the App.For those entrenched in abusive situations who have normalized the actions of their perpetrator, I’d like them to question their predicament, understand that they are being violated and trust a safe person enough to disclose what is going on rather than keeping secrets that perpetuate the cycle of abuse.It’s such an amazing yet daunting goal! How could a small team possibly take on what appears to be an insurmountable task? My solution is by providing information in an unobtrusive way (through games and activities) to alert kids of danger and encourage them to engage their primal fight/flight instincts rather than looking to others for protection.This blind faith in others can sometimes be a warning sign. An unfortunate truth about child abuse is that perpetrators are more often people in positions of trust than ‘strangers’. It must be so confusing for kids who could be violated by trusted people across all social groups! The only way we can we protect the most vulnerable members of society is by empowering them to trust and believe in themselves.That is the foundation within which this entire App has evolved— self Trust! Kids need to learn to reconnect with their primal need for protection and awaken their ability to read cues, identify abuse and consider safe strategies to protect themselves.Please help me turn my vision into something that has the capability to make a positive change in the lives of our most vulnerable members of society. As a village, we can maketheir world a safer and happier place! The reason I have chosen this population is because they are the most vulnerable sub-group of children on the autism spectrum in terms of being ‘Safety Aware’. Why, you ask? Unlike their lower functioning peers, they are expected to develop a high level of independence. With this comes a multitude of opportunities including higher exposure to community access (e.g., travel training, employment, independent or supervised living situations, social events, shopping etc.). My target group will be expected to make decisions and to navigate the world by themselves. Even when given the very best educational training in child protection, these students often struggle in social situations. Their decisions can often be tainted by misunderstanding social cues, experiencing the trauma of a sensory overstimulating community; all of which can escalate their level of anxiety and interfere with their ability to think proactively and make good decisions around safety.What you see below is a compilation of all of my ideas ... what the 'seed' has become today! I truly hope I have shared my vision and story in a way that inspires you to want to join me in my effort to make the world a better place.I have collaborated with a lot of people who have been kind enough to share their expertise with me.Artist: John HallThe purpose of the Avatar is to allow children to develop characters and file them into ‘social group’ categories which can be accessed for Reflections. Children can choose a friend to guide them through the App by:Artist: John HallSeveral books teaching various safety concepts which are taught through Safety Superheros. In the first wave of Safety Aware, at least three of these titles will be included:Books have been written by Sally Jones, illustrated by John Hall and edited for appropriate child protection content by Jan Sansom (T.A. Psychotherapist).Safety scenarios will be presented within ‘reflections’ activities which will follow each story or meditation. The concepts represented by the Superhero’s will be reviewed and children will have the opportunity to relate and reflect on concepts through structured activities such as writing, drawing or interactively responding through iPad activities.With Daniel Warples (https://youtu.be/G07xAbHnM7Q)hangdrum track as background music (Hang in Balance by Daniel Warples, used with permission from the artist), Yvette Doudle takes users through two (possibly 3) meditations (developed by Yvette Doudle – Meditation Teacher,  and Sally Jones) to help them reconnect with their feelings, inner voice and gut reaction.Following meditations, users will have the opportunity to engage in a drawing or journal activity.  Users can keep these in a password protected area of the App or save them in their camera roll.  If chosen, they can send them to a Trusted Helper or therapist via email.Kids relate to music, so this had to be part of Safety Aware!For the first wave of the App, Kiera Smith (a well-established South Australian Singer/Songwriter) and Sally Jones collaborated to create and produce three songs that go along with the concepts of the App.  These songs are as follows:For a sample of Kiera's work, please see:https://youtu.be/M-47FUi9Fm0There are endless possibilities for expansion of the Safety Aware Project! With funding, the project can proceed as described above. If we exceed our goal, Safety Aware will receive the marketing and promotion it deserves to reach its intended audience and start empowering children to learn the skills required to identify and avoid/escape abuse. Once this occurs, we can plan for the second wave of Safety Aware! I have worked with the Appster team to plan exciting new additions to the App for the second wave! Stay tuned and follow our progress! Thank you for your time and support for a project that promises to support children on the Autism Spectrum to find their Superhero within and engage their primal instinct of self protection.","Risks and ChallengesChallenges:1. I have to ensure that the content of the Interactive books is appropriate to: (i) the sensitivity of the topic, and (ii) the complex needs of my primary target audience (children on the autism spectrum).   Accommodations: (i) I have had Jan Sansom, a psychotherapist read through the stories to ensure that the child protection approach is appropriate for the target group.  (ii)I know from my experience as a teacher who has worked extensively with children on the autism spectrum that I have differentiated the APP on several levels to accommodate a wide variety of needs specific to this population.  2. It has been challenging working with people in different states (Melbourne, Sydney and South Australia), and countries (the UK and USA) to ensure that we come together as a cohesive team who work towards the common goal of delivering a high-quality product that fits the brief I’ve provided.Accommodations:  The Safety Aware team consists of a group of very talented individuals who have been carefully chosen to contribute their expertise to the project.   I have also spent two full days workshopping with the Appster team to ensure that their brief and full understanding of the project is consistent with the vision outlined in this fundraiser.  Although there could be slight alterations (for example, colours of screens and clothing will vary as we have discovered that children with Autism perceive colours differently, the project will look similar.  I communicate with other members of the SafetyAware team through social media, emails, phone and face/real time.  I have worked for years to frame the concepts, and team members have been excited to be part of a project that attempts to make life better for the vulnerable members of society. This incentive has motivated members of the Safety Aware team to produce their personal best, and I am proud of the work each member has contributed to the cause!John Hall, the design team at Appster and I have joined an App called Basecamp to communicate on all aspects of the project.Overall, I believe we have an amazing team who has each made valuable contributions to the project.Risks 1. That I have not set my tipping point well.  If I overestimate costs, then I could get nothing as Kickstarter is an all or nothing platform.  If I underestimate, I won’t have enough funding to cover the costs of having the entire App Developed.To ensure that I get the appropriate reach I am working with a marketing and promotion team who is supporting me throughout the fundraising process to ensure that the above issues do not occur.  Hopefully, this lowers the risk and enables me to reach and surpass my tipping goal which would support me in recovering personal costs incurred prior to fundraising; and give me the money required to release the entire App following the campaign.  If I reach the tipping goal but do not raise enough money to produce the entire App, I will release the App a little at a time.2. I risk the chance that people won’t find the App. I will work with the marketing and promotion professionals  to help find and contact backers who have the common interest of:  reducing child abuse and mental health issues that result because of this issue (e.g., those who suffer from anxiety and depression); family, friends, professionals, philanthropist groups who support children with autism -- or victims of abuse -- educational institutions).  They will be informed and directed towards my website or social media to locate the App.  Ads will also help people locate the App.",https://www.kickstarter.com/projects/759684284/safety-aware-app?ref=discovery_category_newest,759684284/safety-aware-app,"The Safety Aware StoryWhat’s the problem?There is a world-wide child abuse crisis happening, and quite simply there isn’t enough resources to reach those who need help. The hard-hitting facts:· The number of children substantiated as abused or neglected in the past 2 decades has doubled (26,000 – 49,000)1· On average 5 children die every day because of child abuse2· 90% of child abuse victims know their perpetrator in some way4· 68% are abused by a family member4· 1 out of 3 girls and 1 out of 5 boys will be sexually abused before they reach 18.5· 70% of parents do not know the importance of teaching children the skills they need to stay safe.6Although children aren’t responsible for their own safety, they can be put into situations where they have no-one to turn to and need to access their primal responses to stay safe.So how do we help them?We need to teach children to access their primal response to danger as a natural instinct, and to empower them to make safe choices. Kids cannot turn to others during these times because perpetrators do not usually violate, groom or lure children in the presence of trusted helpers. The best defence children have is to become empowered themselves.Modern day technology such as smart phones, and devices means we can reach children who in the past could not be reached. Being able to teach children through technology means we can teach them to act when they feel unsafe.What is Safety Aware?Safety Aware is an interactive learning application (App) that will teach children to evaluate unsafe situations through knowledge, their gut feelings, their inner voice and or emotions. Our aim is not to make them responsible for their own safety, but to empower them with knowledge and decision-making abilities to provide them with the best opportunities to stay safe.Who is it for?Safety Aware is for all children between the ages of 6-14, including those with Autism or learning difficulties.How does it work?The goal of Safety Aware is to be implemented into government, health, public facilities where children from all backgrounds can access it. It will enable them to learn in a safe and interactive way. Currently there is no other app similar to this out there.· Children choose pre made Safety Superhero characters or develop their own characters that will guide them through the app. They will be able to modify and personalise them.· There are different books or videos within the app that teach various safety concepts using the characters the ‘Safety Superheroes’ for example:o Pay Attention to your emotions: Superheroes EMO and GRANTo Trust your inner voice: Superhero IVYo Trust your feelings: Superhero PHILo Don’t Keep Unsafe Secrets: Superhero STELLAo Who are trusted helpers and what they don’t do: Superhero Story· Safety scenarios and quizzes – children will practise using their safety skills by testing their gut reaction, inner voice, feelings and emotions using various strategies (feeling thermometers, alarm clocks etc)· Meditations –Children can reconnect with their feelings and inner voice.· Reflections – Children can draw, voice record or write how they feel, it will be a place that they can express themselves. This section would be password protected and if chosen, can be sent to a trusted helper or therapist using an app sharing component.· Songs – As an educator I have always said, ‘if a kid can’t tell you a concept, they will be able to sing you one if there is an appropriate song’. Learning through music is an extremely important way that children can express themselves. We will bring onboard Kiera Smith (a well-established singer/songwriter) who has written songs for the app such as:o Tell, Tell, Tello Safety Scripto Safety HeroFuture Components· A real-life SMART device designed and developed by engineers as a communication device connected to two trusted helpers disguised as a game watch. It will be equipped with an SOS that will be sent to trusted helpers along with GPS coordinates to locate the child in danger.· Safety Aware Game will allow users to use their characters to navigate several environments and situations using the skills they have learned from the app.ProgressEvery day I am contacting people who can help make Safety Aware a reality. I already have the support of Child Protection Ministers in Australia and have met with Child Psychiatrists, educators and other experts in this field for their advice and support. I am in contact with App Developers, Video Production companies, Technology and Innovation teams who all support and praise the project, but now I need your help.ConclusionSafety Aware is my fight song. It’s a way of taking the bad things that happened to me as a child and finding an effective way to make a difference to the lives of children today. I want to let them know; they are not powerless. Many of the experts I’ve met with believe this application could make real difference in the prevention of child abuse. Safety Aware provides great potential to provide viable solutions to help young people learn what they need to know about safety.None of this is possible without your support, so click pledge today, and help a change a child’s life.References[1] https://familiesaustralia.org.au/greater-national-effort-required-to-safeguard-children/[2] ChildHelp.

I have worked for years to frame the concepts, and team members have been excited to be part of a project that attempts to make life better for the vulnerable members of society. This incentive has motivated members of the Safety Aware team to produce their personal best, and I am proud of the work each member has contributed to the cause!Overall, I believe we have an amazing team who has each made valuable contributions to the project.Risks1. That I have not set my tipping point well. If I overestimate costs, then I could get nothing as Kickstarter is an all or nothing platform. If I underestimate, I won’t have enough funding to cover the costs of having the entire App Developed.To ensure that I get the appropriate reach I am working with a marketing and promotion team who is supporting me throughout the fundraising process to ensure that the above issues do not occur. Hopefully, this lowers the risk and enables me to reach and surpass my tipping goal which would support me in recovering personal costs incurred prior to fundraising; and give me the money required to release the entire App following the campaign. If I reach the tipping goal but do not raise enough money to produce the entire App, I will release the App a little at a time.2. I risk the chance that people won’t find the App.I will work with the marketing and promotion professionals to help find and contact backers who have the common interest of: reducing child abuse and mental health issues that result because of this issue (e.g., those who suffer from anxiety and depression); family, friends, professionals, philanthropist groups who support children with autism -- or victims of abuse -- educational institutions). They will be informed and directed towards my website or social media to locate the App. Ads will also help people locate the App."

One guy was party hard and next day discoverded that has tattoo. Another person was in prison and was so bored and did tattoo (very ""chaotic"" pictures drawn like by 5 year old kid). There were many romantic stories as well. Many hidden tattoos etc.Would love to find place where i can read such stories everyday. Hope our portal can do it.Everyday people decide to have tattoo. Picture/design that will probably stay with them whole life. Why? How they came up with such idea?We would like to build social platform where people can share story of their tattoos. Share their tattoo plans, ask community for opinions. People can upload photos and description. Every story will go through verification process. Community may promote stories to main chart (visible on homepage).This is initial plan and i would like to ask for 20 000chf to achieve it. It should be enough to develope web portal (mobile friendly) - 9 000chf, promote in social media 8 000chf, 1 year hosting and maintenance 1000chf and 2000chf for rewards.Our aim is not future profits but platform that will live own life.

Someone is blackmailed, other experience physical and mental violence. People have problem with their addictions.The biggest drama starts when they close themselves. Cannot share their story to family, friends. Become disconnected from the world. Slowly getting into desperation and looking for most radical solution (like extremism, violence, suicide,  etc)What if we could prevent it?What if we could bring them hope?It is very common to share moments of joy. The biggest challenge is to encourage people to share their darkest experience and open to help. People should feel relief after posting their story. There should be no fear during communication between victims and supporters.Second challenge is to build community that will take action online and in real world. Help should not limit to sending support message. Physical and financial support should also take place.Every case should have phases(workflow): ",This project is not commercial venture. The goal is to make world better place. We want victims to share their stories anonymously. There are many compassionate people ready to help.Half of of the money will be spend on development of web/mobile portal and hosting of server and domain for next 5yearsThe rest of the money we would like to spend on social media marketing. We would like to reach many people and create in their mind space impression that sharing problems is not something bad and shameful.Initial phase will be run in one country (not decided yet where).

For gifted latino and Hispanic artists to display their gifts and talents either lyrically or musically. A chance to have their music heard worldwide. Different genres by both male and female artists. I can have a thousand CD's recorded for $800 and this will include the CD Jewel case and covers. I will need to copyright each individual song, both the lyrics and music, so they won't be stolen. This will cost extra, but I have artists with original songs already written and the beats to them. I need to buy better recording devices such as an Apple computer and Beats headphones. I have a recording studio in my house, but I wish to be able to rent a separate room or office to do the actual recording. There is a wide audience in Texas, as well as in Mexico, for this type of Spanglish (Enlish/Spanish) music. I would also like to creat a website for this label, so I can sell the CD's online, in order to reach a wider audience. The amount I'm asking for would be enough to finance this project. I work, but my paycheck isn't enough to cover this project. I have two children and a wife to support. Thank you for your time and interest.","It may be difficult to pay for the copyrights for all original songs and music. So, every donation will be greatly appreciated. I can continue using the room in my house as the recording studio and all musicians I've contracted are willing and able to record with no personal payment to themselves.

https://www.kickstarter.com/projects/880370133/lost-and-found-3?ref=discovery_category_newest,880370133/lost-and-found-3,"I want to create a web site where people who loose personally valuable items or even sometimes companions (pets) can get word out to the entire world of their loss. I think that this would dramatically increase the chances that whatever has gone astray may be re-united once again with the individual whom lost it! It will need plenty of funding to advertise it well. The more who are aware of the site the more chance it gives the one who lost something to possibly get it back. The site will need you to become a member where all your personal information will be safe and secure. The next stage of the membership will explain all the ins and outs and the terms and conditions you must agree to in order to post on the page. This section will highly reflect the details of privacy disclosure options that will be available and state the release of all liability and responsibility of the site when choosing to be contacted or provide personal information between one member and another outside the web page. There are plenty of legal disclosures I will need to remind my members of the caution that should be made when dealing with persons they may not know. There will be a questionnaire form to fill out the details of your missing item including but not limited to photo upload area, timeline of the item noticed missing, locations you may have been up to at least 2 weeks from the day you last remember having the item in your possession, price value, item model and/or brand, estimated age, etc... These details about the missing item or loved one are to give as much needed information out to the public as possible. In turn there will be an area where persons who have stumbled upon items or found lost pets can describe in detail of there findings. That is where the magic happens. The individual posting a found item or pet will fill out forms to answer questions uniquely to what the found. This part of the site will only be view-able by me and my team members, keeping the precious items that had been located from being vulnerable towards the greed of man kind, so any persons whom may falsely claim to have lost an item in which they never even owned will not have the knowledge of the items and could not create memberships to claim what is not rightfully theirs. We can cross reference the database between the lost and found and hopefully be able to match up a member who has lost something they cherish with a member who had found something matching in description. There shall be a small section for lost pets, however I am certain no one will be reporting the iguana they found dead in the road I will have to be sure to give advice which I will gather from animal agency's and local shelters on what should be done or avoided when a personmay find a stray animal. We want to keep everyone as safe as possible, including the poor lost animal.I am sure I will need to invest in some legal backup as well as get the word out there as widely as possible. There are still a few details I am brainstorming on with this project but overall, I see it in good nature and hope to get funded so we can all start picking up some pieces we may have lost along the way!","There will be memberships to keep all personal information private but the members will also be given the option to communicate directly if both agree to, Ill have to make them agree to terms and conditions and release all liability of keeping there discretion in the event that both members agree to contact each other through any other means then the website. This will keep from any future problems arising with privacy issues I am surer. Creating member questioners and coming up with the average variables to cross check for matching lost to found items will be time consuming and must be detailed  precisely to give the most accurate possible match. Keeping the page all legally sound and creating with caution to not allow any defects release private information. I will do extensive research and get professional consultation from lawyers as well as create a few test drives in pretending to loose a few of my own items while allowing a friend to act as a finder just to see how far my item may travel within a set time in order to get location to time duration ratios to include in the overall calculation that will determine the final percent of a match being made.  Building a dual sided page that will include great detail and demand rich descriptions as well as location information around the time the item was noticed missing and keeping all privacy terms met and legal standards kept is gonna be quite a challenge but I believe if look hard enough I will find the perfect combination of both getting the word out and keeping personal details for within team evaluators only and be able to reunite some dearly valued things with the ones who had regretfully lost them.",https://www.kickstarter.com/projects/880370133/blngo?ref=discovery_category_newest,880370133/blngo,"A Bingo app game that you can download from the play store or even Apple iTunes and play Bingo amongst friends that also have the same app. One that allows you to participate with an actual ""buy"" in with an in-app purchase and play online through a live feed resembling something like the facebook games users can both play with eachother at the same time and see the same results on each users screen.

I spoke to people about my other ideas and the one the loved the most was MIXed NUTs. So I began to work on that idea. Along with an a cast who offered their talent for free, there was a young boy named Josh. Josh was a hiphop dancer for the New York Knicks and has been on Americas Best Dance Crew. He resigned from the Knicks organization to be a part of this show. I also met a man/ordained minister named Lennie. Lennie had the lead of GRANDPA. A few days before the shoot, Lennie said he could get funding. Because of this, we postponed the shoot with excitement. To make a long story short, the so called investors for this show and PREACH PASSA PREACH, never came through. All of the cast was hurt but most of all I was hurt from their dedication and JOSH leaving the KNICKS and this didnt happen.I AM trying this again because its a good show (In my opinion) and to fulfill my plan to work with Josh on this project!The funds will pay for the local cast and to get Josh here from New York to be in the show.",Our risks are no different than any other show.

Set in a Silicon Valley world, Samantha Michelle creates an app that enhances whatever app is out there today. Backed by some of her greatest coworkers, this app is destined for fame.Unknown to Samantha, the cohorts steal the app and make millions, leaving her broke, pissed and crazy. She tries to take them to court but it backfires, leading her into a spiral downfall.. and eventually killing herself is the only option.The best way to do so is through THE APP.Years later, this app is launched, seeks out the ten(10) people responsible for Samantha's death. Through the app's flickering, it sends them subliminal messages, causing them to commit suicide.As with all APPS, if you don't want it anymore, CLICK the UNINSTALL button. But is this creation that easy to stop? I wouldn't think so! So how do you stop an app without an uninstall mechanism attached? Do you reprogram your phone? And is that enough? THE APP.. Subliminal Messages,. can KILL!WHO IS BEHIND ""THE APP.. MOVIE""?THE APP's original idea was giving to Terrence Smythe by Leonard ""Storm"" Warren"", with permission to put his twist into the story.  In addition to creating ""THE APP.. MOVIE"", Terrence aka T Alyze Smythe or TEE has worked with the likes of Lou Candelaria (Orange County Choppers TV Show), assistance from Michael Franklin (Law & Order SVU) and guidance from John Grimaldi of ""8 Hats High"" (Disney, School House Rock and more) to create sketch comedy, a sitcom and youth education commercials for the city of Middletown NY and the Middletown Cares Coalition on the east coast.As a hiphop artist, Tee has opened for L.L. Cool J, Kid Frost and All 4 One on the west coast.His script has also made it to the finals 2nd stage of the NexTV pilot TV show contestHOW IS THIS PROJECT FUNDEDMaking a feature-length project or even a short film, can be surprisingly expensive - there are numerous costs involved with doing a project legit, including production insurance, location permits, actor and crew salaries, and legal paperwork. In addition, the scale of the project means we'll have to hire on additional post-production personnel, such as editors and visual effects artists.Over the months of creating this trailer, we've learned to be flexible and resourceful and to live within our means. We've incorporated actors for free as well as the location from a non-profit organization called Gangplank (Gangplankhq.com). But the idea has erupted into a large scale feature film but each individual who sees the script. To do that, we must go big or go home. Every cent raised for this project is going into the production, so the more we raise, the bigger we can go with this project.Also to put things in perspective, we're asking for 40 times less than the $3,000,000 budget for the upcoming The Purge 2 movie.The quality of the film increase with the awarded budget. In return we can hire:A better crew (producer, Cinematographer, Director, larger cast) makes for a better movie.Also with the campaign making it's targeted amount we can add on a celebrity name. I like Matt Damon, Orlando Bloom, Amanda Seyfried, Justin Timberake, Zoe Saldana and Jennifer Lawerence to name a few.* (from below) = We are also creating a app with behind the scenes material, and a secret suspenseful plot AFTER THE MOVIE ends.Why a Short Film or Feature Film?We strongly believe the foundations for this subject will reach an audience of suspense thriller watchers, people with apps, those who have had their ideas stolen and all those who have watch THE SOCIAL NETWORK movie. That right there is an audience who will enjoy the movie on a big screen, talk a bout it after and be afraid of the apps AFTER MOVIE effect*. We don't see a webseries as a stepping stone but we are negotiable to sites like Youtube Space, Netflix and Amazon Studios to name a few. The webseries format just wouldn't fit a movie of this magnitude.What's the status of the production?THE APP.. MOVIE is currently being revamped due to it's remarkable liking. The script is almost complete.

She finds different things on the ship and that leads her to ask about their uses through out history. She even finds an old square plastic brick, which turns out to be an old mobile phone. She is intrigued because her mummy and Daddy communicate by telepathy. Aimed at the very young to watch witha parent, guardian, or teacher,this three part web based series, with each episode 10mins long, is designed to educate and entertain at the same time. The finished series will be available on the web. Because of the genre of the film the finished pieces will be available to syndicate in all areas of the world, both English speaking and other languages, should the series take off. Film Festival distribution will also be looked at. All funding will be used for Production, Post Production, Colour correction, v/o artists, publicity and design materials. To keep within timeframe and budgets all personel working on the project are locally scorced, with the producer using existing freelance music producer, and voice over artists. Throughout the three part series we will encourage the young viewer to think about the future and their future to discuss with mummy and daddy, family members, and friends,using the past as a benchmark. e.g. the moon landings leading to space exploration, and the changes from the mechanical revolution to the rise in IT and communications of the past, present, and future.","The challenges come from the initial script processing.

A solution to this ever growing problem is nature, specifically, WORMS! It may appear silly or simple at first, but upon review, worms can be an instrumental tool in the fight against Global warming and, in addition, alleviating deadly toxins from entering our food system.I have access to large amounts of waste generated by supermarkets and farms. Waste that would normally end up in our landfills. What I need are the tools to process the waste. I need totes, screens, and other such tools to gather the castings generated when the worms eat the waste, and then generates the most beneficial organic fertilizer that there is.I plan on starting with one supermarket,and then growing to more as the farm grows.",The risks involved with this project are minimal. Competition being the biggest. I offer a quality product at a modest cost. The product will sell itself. I have the drive and desire to see this project is successful.  I have 20+ years in manufacturing that gives me an advantage at problem solving and innovations to see this project to be  a tremendous success.,https://www.kickstarter.com/projects/1192336529/organic-fertilizer?ref=discovery_category_newest,1192336529/organic-fertilizer,"Each year, millions of tons of produce waste enters our landfills. Waste that should never reach that point.This taxes our planet in different ways.The gases it produces, that harm our environment. Methane gas is produce during the decomposition process. This methane contributes to the Greenhouse gases affecting our planet.The loss of space that each landfill takes up.This is a regional concern. Some areas have abundant space, while others are clamoring to find space. In either condition, the waste is being shipped to locations further away, then they were 20 or 30 years ago. Again, adding additional Greenhouse gases to further hurt this blue marble.According to the AdCouncil, about 40% of our food enters landfills. The sources of this waste is farms, grocery stores, and consumers.This is preventable. It is possible to take this waste and turn it into a rich, effective, and ORGANIC fertilizer. That fertilizer is produced by worms. This is referred to as VermicompostingAs the compost works on the plants and they become healthier theneed for pesticides is reduced. The reduction in pesticides helps the area torecover faster and can start an improvement cycle that will run on. This compareswith the typical cycle when chemical fertilizers are used. The chemicalfertilizers might increase plant yields but they do nothing for plant health.Continued use of chemical fertilizers inevitably leads to a breakdown in thesoil. Ammonia and salts build up which attack the plants making them less ableto withstand disease.I am raising funds to gather the tools I need to accomplish this mission.For the homes for the worms.The waste is put into the containers, the worms eat, then excrete the castings which is a rich fertilizer. 3200 containers will be required to maintain a 3 month rotation schedule. This will allow me to process 2000 pounds of waste daily. The cost is appx. $25,000.Screening the castings from the worms is the next step in the process, after the worms have excreted their dinner.The cost of the screen, loading conveyors, and rollers is appx. $15,000.Of course, the main labor in the entire process. The worms.I need an additional 500 pounds of worms @ $15.00 per for $7,500.I have access to waste generated from farms within my area. I have the possibility of additional waste generated by local grocery chain, depending on my ability to process the large volume generated.So I seek visionaries who will take the steps of saving our planet. Is this the end all and be all to that? NO. Is a step in the right direction? YES! Every journey begins with the first step. Let's take that first step together.","Every endeavor has challenges. Fortunately, this one has limited problems, that can be overcome with proper planning.Disease - Every living organism is susceptible to disease. That is why my storage facilities for the worms are self contained. This limits the ability of one colony to affect another.Permits - No permits are necessary for this endeavor. Because this is an Organic fertilizer, regulations are minimal. It is not dangerous to the environment or community.Weather - While it isn't possible to perfectly predict the weather, it is possible to prepare and fortify against it. I will be able to adequately protect our invest, through climate controls."
https://www.kickstarter.com/projects/thirty2give/a-new-mentoring-model-for-the-new-world?ref=discovery_category_newest,thirty2give/a-new-mentoring-model-for-the-new-world,"thirty2give, LLC is developing a new version of their ground-breaking mobile application that enables anyone with a smartphone to find or become a mentor anywhere in the world. The new app version—features a business to business (B2B) version of the tool developed exclusively for corporate enterprises or member organizations. Within the private confines of the organization, the mobile app connects members together to create a global framework for transferring knowledge, information, and support.The new tool is designed to benefit any organization, profit or non-profit that seeks to encourage members to form mentoring relationships and engage each other. “This new tool creates a private environment for mentors and mentees in organizations such, but not limited to: educational, 12 Step Recovery Programs, social services, and general business institutions,” said thirty2give representative David Cain. Organizations can choose to use anonymity as the foundation for the relationships or they can choose to use their real identities. Since the use of the tool is limited to only members that are granted access by the hosting organization, users are assured of organizational privacy,” said Cain.Like the business to consumer app, the new version allows some customization of the baseline virtual matchup criteria and five themed public chat rooms. Here’s how it works: organizations complete an intake form detailing their selection criteria and their themes for the public chat rooms. The thirty2give team will create a tool based on your organization’s branding and provide an annual use license as well as the ability to grant access to members of their organization, wherever they reside in the world. Like the first version, mentors simply complete a profile describing their experience. Mentees complete a similar profile and create a request detailing the type of support they are seeking. Then the mentee can query the list of available mentors and request the person who best matches their specifications. Thereafter, the mentor and mentee can access a chat room where they can interact in private. With thirty2give, mentors and mentees can engage in a professional mentoring relationship that benefits both parties. Mentees can increase their productivity, competency, and performance, while mentors can receive an opportunity to give back, personal satisfaction and new ideas.The conceptual framework of the thirty2give app is based on the 1952 study by the Boston Symphony Orchestra’s use of a curtain to conduct blind auditions that shielded musicians from interviewers in an attempt to increase the recruitment of female artists. The interviewer’s evaluations were based solely on talent, resulting in an increase in the hiring rates of female musicians. Consequently, other symphonies began using the same tactic. Now thirty2give is using a similar strategy to benefit mentees and mentors who are taking advantage of its innovative application. ","Risks include the following:   1. Funding may not match the talent and expertise required to reach target market.   2. Growth may not occur at the project rate of planned growth.    3. Initial business model may fail, forcing the team to generate a new model.Challenges 1. Virtual mentoring is new and disruptive and may require significant early adopters. 2. Faster than anticipated growth could outpace organizational growth.  3. The revenue model may not support the organization in the time frame projected.  4. Will have overcome the naysayers that are convinced mentoring can only occur face to face.",https://www.kickstarter.com/projects/thirty2give/thirty2give-two-people-giving-each-other-30-days?ref=discovery_category_newest,thirty2give/thirty2give-two-people-giving-each-other-30-days,"Creativity is doing something that’s never been done before. Innovation is doing what’s been done before but doing it differently. Thirty2give, LLC has developed a tool that may not meet the definition of creative, but it definitely meets the definition of innovation by combining mentoring/advising, employee engagement, and the smart phone.Thirty2give's leadership team consists of 5 professionals with more than 100 years combined mentoring experience. The team formed sharing the common desire to make the world a better place by connecting people together for the express purpose of transferring knowledge.Mentoring has been around since the beginning of time. Even Jesus’ 18 months with his 12 disciples was a form of mentoring and the approach hasn’t changed since. Employee engagement may not have been around as long as mentoring, but most people would agree that its core definition remains the same – themes around how satisfied employees are with their work and the pride they have with their employer (Vance, SHRM 2006). According to Gallup, the 13% engagement indicates that there is a worldwide crisis with employee engagement. The first cell phone was created in 1973 by Motorola. Today, the planet has more cell phones than it has people and 78% of the phones are smartphones. It’s not a problem, but a growing fact is that people use their smartphones more than their computers to connect to social platforms and other sites on the internet.Thirty2give, LLC has developed an innovative smartphone app for companies and organizations that are interested in improving their productivity by encouraging them to engage with each other in mentoring or advising relationships. It’s a safe, secure, and cost-effective way to raise their employee engagement metric and improve productivity.How does it work?After agreeing to lease the app for their exclusive use, employees and organization members download their company/organization branded app from Google Play or Apple App store. An HR rep or administrator is appointed and will assign employees/members to a mentoring tree. A mentoring tree is a fixed number of employees/members led by a member of management/leadership that serves as a proctor or facilitator of conversations in a dedicated group chat room. Employees are free to ask questions and get advice from each other and can also schedule one on one discussions with the tree leader. Communications can occur either in asynchronous or synchronous forms. Additionally, through the use of emojis submitted by users, administrators can gauge employee/member engagement on an individual basis, on a tree basis, or on the basis of the entire program almost on demand.What Type of Company/Organization Can Benefit?The Thirty2give app is a perfect tool for any sized company or organization, but works best for companies that have a presence in multiple geographies where employees are not exposed to the main office other employees. Not only does the app benefit companies, but it will also work for organizations that have many members across a large geographical footprint. These organizations include but are not limited to churches, education, self-recovery programs, and many others. The B2B version of the app is nearing completion and Thirty2give has secured more than a year's worth of cloud database storage that can be accessed anywhere in the world using a smartphone.Backers that donate $500 or more will receive an ebook from one of the founders entitled, ""Know Ye Not this Parable"" - an inspiring story about a fallen angel. Backers that donate $100-499 will receive a black or white wrist band that states ""I am reaching back - I am paying it forward.""Funds raised will be used to complete the development of the app and cover the cost of marketing.",Risk associated with the project include normal software bugs that are unknown or have to materialized yet and having the technical resources to minimize the response time when problems arise. Some of the funding will be used to hire talent. One challenge facing the app currently is that it is only available in English language at this time. Funding raised and growth opportunities will provide a vehicle to expand it to other languages.

Nos inspira el saber que hay jóvenes con hambre y sed de conocimiento y nos motivan las ganas que tienen de seguir adelante. A continuación un poco de cada integrante del equipo.Karolina Zepeda: Soy fundadora y escritora del proyecto. Me inspira el saber que hay personas con el interés de conocer sobre las ramas de la ciencia y la tecnología y me motiva que realizan un cambio para mejorar nuestro mundo.José Luis Barragán: Me inspiran las ganas de hacer mas y dar ese Plus que no siempre doy. Me motiva rodearme de.personas diferentes con hambre de aprender y de enseñar.Belem Ruiz: Lingüista y literata por formación universitaria; correctora, traductora, redactora y periodista-divulgadora de ciencia por amor al lenguaje y el conocimiento. Me motiva contribuir a la generación de sociedades más críticas y participativas a través de la divulgación científica.Aldo Sebastián Parra: Me encargo de escribir un poco de divulgación científica. Me motiva a colaborar el deseo de acercar las personas a la ciencia despertando su curiosidad y asombro. Me inspira la idea de lograr un mundo mejor a travéz de la ciencia y la tecnologia, ya que si solo se deja en manos de pocas personas el futuro será incierto.Flor P. Araiza: Me inspira que Sólo es Ciencia es una comunidad que se enfoca a la difusión de ciencia y tecnología, promoviendo la curiosidad y el aprendizaje. Me motiva ser parte de este equipo como colaboradora escribiendo artículos que despiertan el interés hacia otras áreas.Armando Cifuentes: Escribo notas relacionadas a la computación. De repente comparto tutoriales en el sitio, hace poco me tocó hacer entrevistas (lo cual me gustó mucho). Me gusta enseñar a los demás lo que sé y aprender de ellos. Si sé algo, no me quedo con las ganas de compartirlo. Lo hago. Me gusta mucho la divulgación científica. Siento que junto con la enseñanza, siendo yo maestro en ocasiones, van de la mano. Es padre poder enseñarle a los chavos experimentos sencillos que explican cosas que ellos consideran imposibles o difíciles de explicar.Yessenia Espinosa: Lo que más me inspira es poder hacer visibles a todas y cada una de las personas que dedican su vida entera a la ciencia y tecnología, me inspiran sus historias y sus triunfos. Solo es Ciencia me motiva hacer realidad aquella inspiración porque hace que pueda dar ese salto a través de la redacción y la entrevista y ser el medio que conecte a esas personas con el resto de la sociedad.Esaú Ortega: Saber que a través de textos puedo ayudar a otras personas me llena de motivación para hacerlo con mayor frecuencia.Sólo es ciencia es esa parte que falta en la nación para avanzar en el aprendizaje de ciencia y tecnología.Idalid Ávila: Me inspira el hecho de saber muchas cosas fuera de mi círculo.No siempre uno está relacionado con todo pero al estar en un medio de comunicación podemos saber de otros temas que uno pensaba que no le interesarían. Otra cosa es que puedo llegar a conocer gente que ni idea que podría estar cerca de ellas.Amaury Hernandez: Soy Ingeniero Industrial y colaborador del proyecto. Me inspira el saber que estamos siendo parte de la diferencia en México dando a conocer la ciencias y difundiendo el trabajo de científicos Mexicanos, por que creo que es ahí donde se marca un precedente en este país. Me motiva el trabajar con tan excelentes personas que en un principio fuimos colaboradores y ahora somos un grupo de amigos que lucha por dar a conocer la ciencia mexicana alrededor del mundo.Martha Ulloa: Yo me encargo de escribir artículos. Me inspira el poder hacer algo que contribuya de manera positiva a la sociedad científica y cultural de mi país, así como me motiva el ver cómo con el paso del tiempo todo el esfuerzo da sus frutos.Erasmo Acosta: Me inspira el ejercicio intelectual de investigar y producir. Cada vez que se hace un artículo, que se elige un tema, comienza un proceso intelectual que enriquece la perspectiva de quien hace el artículo. Crear y generar información no es un trabajo de ""copy paste"". En estas aventuras entre libros, documentos y artículos, la elección de un tema no sólo se convierte en un ¿Qué voy a escribir ahora? sino en un ¿Qué voy a conocer hoy?  De igual modo, el sitio web tiene áreas de oportunidad para mejorar la calidad de los artículos y la experiencia de usuario en el sitio. Me gustaría poder ir mejorando el sitio y presentar un mejor formato de información. Siempre optimizando y buscando las mejores prácticas.Idan Andrade: Soy un joven interesado en difundir, amenizar y humanizar el conocimiento científico, para que muchas más personas conozcan los avances que se han hecho y se hacen en la ciencia. Por lo tanto, me encargo de redactar y  colaborar en redes sociales. Me inspira la gente perspicaz, inteligente, trabajadora y emprendedora que forma este equipo, motivándome a la labor de la difusión del conocimiento científico que sea accesible y entendible para todo el público.Miguel Salazar: Soy escritor por naturaleza, forjado por la experiencia y el ansia de conocer mas. Escribir sobre ciencia es apasionante y lleno de color; explosivo y poderoso. La pasión de escribir es de lo mejor en el mundo, y el reto es enorme, es conocer y ser parte de la técnica que domina el mundo.Nicolas Mera: Me inspira el tener que investigar noticias y lo último en tecnología. Me motiva el colaborar con un grupo de personas maravilloso que están unidas por un propósito y amor común.Roberto García: Soy ingeniero mecatrónico y escribo sobre alta tecnología y robótica. Me motiva el hecho de poder pertenecer a un grupo que tiene una visión nacional para contribuir a nuestra sociedad y país escribiendo sobre la ciencia y lograr transmitir un mensaje moderno sobre cómo la ciencia transforma a la sociedad y su importancia. Me inspira a hecho de que con nuestros artículos estamos llegando a impactar de manera positiva a las personas y su perspectiva sobre la ciencia, creando una mejor consciencia colectiva.

La ciencia y la tecnología influyen en las estratégias industriales y las transforman, modifican las economías nacionales, actúan sobre la demografía de los países, superan las diferencias fronterizas utilizando las comunicaciones por satélite y por banda ancha, facilitando los viajes y el turismo. En una palabra, todas las actividades humanas han sido y siguen siendo transformadas por la actividad científica y tecnológica, y casi siempre en beneficio del individuo y de la sociedad. A pesar de todo ello, el gran público, esa mayoría que en los países democráticos influye en el poder público y en sus cambios, vive relativamente alejado de estas posibilidades. Todo lo dicho hasta ahora permite insistir en la necesidad y en la urgencia de hacer partícipe a la sociedad del conocimiento científico, de sus beneficios y de sus riesgos, y de promover un diálogo razonable entre quienes tienen a su cargo la actividad científica y el resto de los ciudadanos.Los investigadores y periodistas deben entablar dialogos para educarse los unos a los otros sobre cómo satisfacer sus necesidades y las del público. La comunidad científica debe capacitar a los comunicadores para que sean portavoces de las distintas disciplinas científicas y a los investigadores para que se habitúen a la comunicación de la ciencia al público. Por el momento, ni los políticos ni la generalidad de los docentes ni de los propietarios de los medios informativos manifiestan la sensibilidad de considerar la divulgación de la ciencia y la tecnología como un reto de nuestro tiempo."

The narrative is poignant with some small touches of humanity and lighthearted comedy, although the shift from a more humorous tone to a more serious one is quite apparent.DEVELOPMENTThe screenplay for From Adolescence came about quite quickly. In March of 2018, director Mallori Powell began the search for the rest of the characters: Paul, Eve, and Lydia, Sam's best friends, Craig, Sam's dad, Rachel, Sam's primary love interest, and other characters, including college students Eric and Amanda.OUR GOALOur primary goal is to release a touching, real, and insightful view on maturity, adulthood, and love in new adults. How heartbreak and maturity, in any situation, can have a long-lasting factor in how the rest of life can play out for an individual. The best way for stories to be told to mass amounts of people is through cinema.The $30,000 goal is to pay for the actors' time, equipment, the production and principal photography, post-production, submission to festivals, and to pay for the rewards.The film is intended to be sent to the Telluride Film Festival for the August 31st to September 3rd Festival Dates. Submissions end in July.WHO ARE WE?Mallori Powell, directorMallori Powell is a future student of the Los Angeles Film School. She has extensive training in cinematography, digital film-making, and photography.Stephen Forster, screenwriter and actorI, Stephen Forster, have had many years of acting experience. In my years in high school theatre, I've won over 10 awards for my performances, and even directed a tragedy in my last year in high school. My first musical was when I was 11, and I don't intend to stop now.WHY THIS PROJECT MATTERSMost teenagers deal with a lot of emotions through their years, especially as they get older. They deal with their first love, their first heartbreak, their moving out of home and onto new, exciting--and sometimes tragic--experiences and adventures with new friends, old friends, and people they don't even know. From Adolescence highlights these subjects, and it deals with them in real, raw, and moving ways. There are moments that adults will understand, and there are moments that teenagers will understand, as well as moments where only one group of people will understand over the others. It all comes together in a story that is worth telling.","Our biggest risk is that we will be unable to do this film. The screenplay is there, and the actors are out there; but the production is what worries us. The good thing is that, with your help, we can secure the production in the green light and keep heading forward. With the right equipment, we can gladly make a great cinematic experience to tell an important and wonderful story.And that starts with you. With your help, we can buy the proper equipment, software, and secure the rights for locations. Without your help, none of this will be possible, and the dreams of a future cast and crew will end up shattered and lost, especially for those who want to be in this industry for the rest of their lives.",https://www.kickstarter.com/projects/565384952/feature-film-will-your-name-change?ref=discovery_category_newest,565384952/feature-film-will-your-name-change,"As a filmmaker, it's a duty to showcase ideas, themes, and emotions on an extremely powerful medium. Cinema is vital to reflecting the real world that we live in, identifying topics covering race, gender, sexual orientation, class, and religion.Let's look at journalism: a platform that can be jumbled with perspective and bias. Let's look at music as well: it's a celebration with every song, a form of expression, and a way to evaluate those expressions vividly in a universal language.In most ways, film encompasses every vital medium to artistic expression, showing everything, whether glorified and gorgeous, or ugly and shadowed. However, in recent years, film has lost it's viable touch; it's become a factory for money, a way to only entertain audiences who have become numb to the importance of film's power.Will Your Name Change? presents the concept of both entertaining and culturally reflective in more ways than one...or, maybe, even two.The film is about a young gay man, Bray, who is a singer-songwriter in Los Angeles, hoping to make it big with his talent. Bray's music is influenced through his real-life experiences, and he finds himself stuck on writing his first studio album, attaining the support of his boyfriend, Adrian, and another songwriter, named Jay. The experiences he has throughout the film influence the writing, production, and overall voice of his album.Will Your Name Change? isn't just a film. It's also not just a music album that is being released, recorded, and produced as an influence on the film, or even vis versa. Will Your Name Change? is an experience. 50% of the work is the film. 50% of the work is the music. 100% of the work is art.The narrative is delivered by mesmerizing, dizzying imagery of male sexuality, sex, romance, happiness, loss, desire, heartbreak, insecurity, and artistry. The music is delivered by an R&B album that incorporates many genres, including pop, rock, blues, jazz, soul, electronic, and alternative, with the music stretching its arms across every artistic genre to help represent the amount of work that influences today's pop culture.But even then, Will Your Name Change? isn't even just that. It's a universal story about love, heartbreak, sex, and expression. It's representative to everything pop culture is today. And the best way to do that is to spread our arms across everything people want to watch, not what we're forcing them to.The film hopes to reinvent the idea of experimental film, as well as reintroduce the power of cinema, hopefully showing the breadth of her beauty. It uses old-style musical moments, dizzying fantasy-like imagery, and real-life emotion to capture a fundamental form of expression. In more ways than one, Will Your Name Change? can easily introduce an essential form of storytelling in a world shadowed by factory-stamped entertainment.There are some things we really look up to as humans in this world. But the things that we feel, the things that move us--those are really special. And Will Your Name Change? feels just as special as those things. It comes from love of it's form, inspired by real emotions and real experiences, and delivered with care and quality.We hope that you show interest in Will Your Name Change?, and if you do, we hope many others do as well. We hope that Will Your Name Change? will stand as a salute to those who pioneered and came long before us. We hope that we can present a classic (yet fresh!) form of entertainment that will change the way people see art...a way for us to say ""Thank You"" for keeping emotion alive.","The true risk with Will Your Name Change? comes with being able to produce the material that I can envision myself. Ultimately, we have a great team of actors and crew that are working on this film that can make this happen, and the only hurdle that we have right now is finding that support from people who are wanting to be on this journey with us."

Lioness film Productions presentsDUCKLINGSynopsis:Life couldn't be better for senior student Kalisha Atwood. She's drop dead gorgeous, dates the most popular guy in school, and her totally rich parents are over-seas 9 months of the year...leaving her in the care of excessive amounts of their money...(in her parents eyes), the perfect parental substitute. In their absence, Kalisha is given word that a great Aunt of hers has passed away, and left Kalisha an excessive inheritance. This inheritance will be issued to her on the condition that Kalisha attends a public school for exactly 3 months. Greedy for her OWN money, Kalisha agrees. As such Kalisha is required to wear (whenever in public)…a full body suit and latex mask that turns her beautiful looks into something to the contrary. Kalisha conforms, and attends the new school wearing the body suit and mask. As Kalisha is ridiculed harshly for the way she looks, she begins to discover what lies within herself, and her own peers. Even with millions of dollars within her reach, Kalisha can only take so much of being treated - the way she normally treats others. If Kalisha gives up, it will all end...literally in vainSO IS HESynopsis:After KAYD FORRESTER breaths out curses on his notorious and ruthless School Bully STAFFORD, Kayd soon after attends Stafford’s funeral -the Bully having suffered an untimely and tragic death.

An ordinary man with an extraordinary battle, Kayd must decide whether or not he and his family are worth fighting for... after all...as a man thinketh..SO IS HE.Watch this space...Please join us on this journey!.....Time to meet our cast:Kym - Dana LowreyDana Lowrey is a singer songwriter pop artist hailing from Queensland, Australia.

We have earned this title through innovation of design and functionality of products used mainly for controlling holiday decorations.  During the fourth quarter, Timer and Remote sales spike by as much as 75%.  This fact has forced us to always be pushing the envelope by developing cutting edge technology.  Back in 2006 we partnered with a small factory to be able to control out proprietary technology and further develop the category.  Today, we have over 85 of our own unique remote and timer models as well as our own programming.  This is what continues to set us apart from our competition.Over the last few years, the home automation segment has grown at an astounding rate. SmartLink has been following this growth every step of the way.  Two years ago we had a vision, to bring a home automation solution to market that was not only feature rich but was affordable and easy for all. In addition to bringing the cost down, we understood that a user friendly experience was equally important.We are proud to introduce, SmartLink ™ Home Automation. ","One of the greatest challenges in the home automation category is creating products that need minimal interaction from a customer support agent.

We at EB Audio recognized a void in the Bluetooth speaker category.. We were tired of listening to music with a single mono Bluetooth speaker. What happened to the years of speaker innovation? When did we decide to move backwards and re-introduce mono sound to replace stereo? Where is the gorgeous deep rich sound I have grown to love.  With all the innovation in the Bluetooth speaker category, it seems that almost all manufacturers have ignored that void. Our system allows you to move your satellite speakers anywhere around the home without sacrificing sound quality. Our solution.... is EB Audio's  ""wireless"" satellite speakers where the Bluetooth signal is transmitted from the High Powered Subwoofer to the two (2) Satellite Speakers and in addition with the feature of built-in Lithium-Ion rechargeable batteries that allow you to move them from room to room. The Bluetooth High Performance Subwoofer, which is powered by a standard electrical outlet, continues to fire away in the background and in addition gives your satellite speakers a concert hall sound, just as your wired satellites would. In conclusion.... we here at EB Audio would like to bring true stereo sound back to Bluetooth and back into your homes with the introduction of the first TRULY wireless stereo Bluetooth Speaker System. No more settling for inferior sound. Give us a chance. You will not be disappointed.

That was the year of enlightenment. Marie's mother Helen discovered an opportunity to audition for scouts and agents in the neighboring town, in the hopes that Helen and Marie's son Alexander's lifelong dreams of acting would come true. The company was legitimate and invited Alexander and Helen back to move forward with the process of potentially ""getting in front of"" talent agents and scouts in California.Thousands of non-existent dollars and miles later, the family was off to California. Alexander and Helen were gone all day, while Marie waited back at the hotel doing research about the business, in case they were both discovered. After several days in California, only one was signed by an agent, and it was Helen.Once home in Massachusetts, Marie had a deep sadness for her son, but also for the thousands of people who were also in California from all over the country with similar dreams. Since Marie worked in human services all of her adult life, she couldn't help but to wonder about those who had to sacrifice money and time to support their loved ones as she had. Marie understood that nothing is promised, but wondered about the emotional and financial toll it takes on aspiring artists, athletes, and their families. It made her wonder if there was a better, more affordable way to get seen?OUR PARTNERYougetscene.com was fortunate enough to collaborate with Relyon Solutions, LLC in Colorado, who believed in Marie's vision. Graysan, LLC was formed and began to work on the platform. Graysan, LLC's mission is to give a percentage of profits from back to historically underfunded or ignored initiatives within communities. Yougetscene.com was created to support those who have genuinely worked towards, and desire a career in the performance and sports performance industries. It is a selective and powerful alliance that helps aspiring performers and athletes create and sustain a career, focused on emotional, behavioral and practical support and tools.Needless to say, Marie's younger daughter Anisa felt she too may have a shot at stardom and began to contribute to Yougetscene.com.WHAT MAKES US DIFFERENTYougetscene.com aims to support those who face financial, emotional, geographic challenges to getting seen. Our research found (Dept of Labor and Statistics, 2016) that most paid actors are located either on the West Coast, East Coast, and South East. The rest of the country with talent has to figure out a way to to get seen and how to pay for it. During our surveying of agents across the country, many stated that a digital tool for use as a first layer of connection is needed and would be helpful. Yougetscene.com is also in support of agents and recruiters who wish to minimize barriers, travel and expenses when seeing someones talents for the first time. The filtering feature will allow specificity and access to agents and recruiters during their search for talent.This feature will be created from direct feedback and research from agents and recruiters.Yougetscene.com WILL NOT use cliches or promises to garner the attention of artists or agents, rather WILL use common sense, practical, real, and necessary feedback to dictate the platform and performance. Yougetscene.com will also have expert contributors in primary and secondary industries, such as set set designers and sports psychologists, who will enhance the user experience. THE NEEDYougetscene.com has done hours of research and created many hypothesis' of customer behaviors. One of the next steps is to create and evaluate experiments. In order to carry out the experiments, funding is needed. The experiments will validate or disprove emerging theory's and create a user-driven platform. The funding will be used to:1. Move from Alpha to Beta2. Market and sign up users to test theory's and provide feedback3. Build platform with feedback directly from users and continue to test, monitor and evaluateTHE PLATFORMThe platform starts at the core with configuration of a virtual private cloud in a US-based, secure host.

Both equally talented and believed in themselves and their dreams. Through various connections, they found an opportunity that could lead them to real, tangible success.This opportunity took them to California, which was not CHEAP! This trip wasn't a guarantee to success, however, it was the beginning of their journey in the professional entertainment industry. HEADSHOTS were purchased not once, twice, but three times by well-meaning professional photographers in our local town as well as the travel and accommodations for us all. Although the trip was eye-opening, only one was signed (mom) and my son's dream went dormant.Knowing what it took financially to support this trip, I began to think deeper about how others were able to make this journey and what they may have had to sacrifice to get there.This was especially true of a family I observed: mom, dad, and five young children all gathered together eating bagged lunches in the lobby of the Westin Hotel during this large showcase. This family intrigued me to the core, likely because I have worked in the human services field for all of my career.

Other platforms exist but are not making the mental and emotional health of their Talent a PRIORITY.Yougetscene.com is also in support of agents and recruiters who wish to minimize barriers,travel, and expenses when seeing someone's talent for the first time. The filtering feature will allow specificity and access to agents and recruiters during their search for talent.This feature will be created from direct feedback and research from agents and recruiters.Yougetscene.com WILL NOT use cliches or promises to garner the attention of artists or agents, rather WILL use common sense, practical, real, and necessary feedback to dictate the platform and performance. Yougetscene.com will also have expert contributors in primary and secondary industries, such as set designers and sports psychologists, who will enhance the user experience.THE NEEDYougetscene.com has done hours of research and created many hypotheses' of customer behaviors. One of the next steps is to create and evaluate experiments. In order to carry out the experiments, funding is needed. The experiments will validate or disprove the emerging theories and create a user-driven platform. The funding will be used to:1. Move from Alpha to Beta2. Market and sign up users to test theory's and provide feedback3. Build a platform with feedback directly from users and continue to test, monitor and evaluateThank you in advance to those who have supported me and my family and believed in my vision. ","Challenges include getting the word out and testing our hypotheses. It is difficult to reach folks when there is so much to distract you online. The funding will help further research about the customer experience while allowing the customer a platform to create change.Risks include poor customer engagement with the platform and low feedback submissions.  In addition, large, financially established platforms that have historically omitted behavioral and emotional supports, could opt to add those supports to their platforms wiping our small company out of the water."

Odd combination? Maybe not... I climbed Long's Peak in Rocky Mountain National Park late this summer. Night-time lows were in the 40s (degr. F) so I thought I could get by with a minimalist bivvy sac and a sleeping bag liner. It worked, but after 2 hours of ""sleep"" I had to start moving again to raise my body temperature to be comfortable. It was late August, elevation between 11,000 and 12,000 ft, and constant wind. At night, this felt cold when not moving to keep body temperature up. I remembered the Andean mummies (funny how the mind occupies itself while hiking). The Andean mummies are naturally preserved, and are often found in the seated position wrapped in wool blankets. Theorizing that the mummies were put to rest in a sleeping position like the Egyptian mummies were, maybe the seated body position could be used for sleeping. The high altitude shelter/bivvy is based on this idea: resting in a seated or squating position to conserve body warmth. The goals are to make a bivvy that can conserve body temperature at high altitude and moderate to high wind chill conditions for 1 person. This provides a shelter for minimalist backpackers, and an emergency shelter for outdoor enthusiasts and safety minded day hikers.","The risks for the project are that it takes a lot of time to sew a bivvy!  I am working on prototype #1 and I will be testing this bivvy when it's completed.

This is usually termed electromagnetic interference (EMI) where electronics are generating interference or are being affected by interference caused by electromagnetic energy which is either conducted or radiated.I wondered, could the strategies used in electronics to minimize EMI also be used to protect people from microwaves that are intentionally directed against them?My intuition says yes, these same strategies could be effective. However, I need your help to prove that these strategies can protect people from the harmful effects of weaponized microwave radiation.This Kickstarter project is to initiate simple experimentation to develop strategies that will protect people against the use of weaponized microwave radiation.","The primary challenge is that a very small number of people are at risk of exposure to weaponized microwave radiation.  The events reported in the media occurred outside of the U.S.  So, the need for any shielding device or mitigation strategies developed may be very small.  However, U.S. citizens that might be targeted are likely to be influential and important- for example, managers and employees of corporations that are seen as being representative of the U.S.  This is in addition to the U.S. State Department employees that may continue to be targeted when working abroad."

The main producing areas are Sichuan, Yunnan, Hubei, Hunan, Shaanxi and Anhui. The black tea used in traditional black tea has a higher maturity and is the main raw material for pressing pressed tea.The black tea tea process generally includes four processes: fixing, rubbing, stacking and drying. Black teas are geographically distributed and are mainly classified as Hunan black tea (茯茶, 千茶, 黑砖茶, 三尖, etc.), Hubei 青砖茶, 四川藏茶 (edge tea), Anhui 古黟黑茶 (安茶), Yunnan Black tea (Pu'er tea), Guangxi Liubao tea and Shaanxi black tea (茯茶).CookingBefore the Tang dynasty, tea was used for boiling, and its functional ingredients were absorbed by the body. From the beginning of the Tang Dynasty, tea was popularly brewed for drinking and reached its peak during the Song Dynasty.While conforming to the needs of society, tea deduce a lot of tea culture or interesting things about tea, gradually transitioning tea from a line of plants equivalent to medicines to the use of imaginary things like blowing their noses, comprehending reason, and playing their rhyme. Drinking Chinese orthodox “Chinese tea” in the ocean is definitely a method of cooking, commonly known as “cooking tea”, which is also the imprint of “tea” that has been left in foreign countries.In Tibetan areas, because of the harsh natural conditions and the requirements of the human body, thousands of years have always been linked to the old-fashioned tea drinking habits, that is, the tea is boiled before drinking and drinking, not only the taste of the charm is better, after the end of cooking After the black tea, its various health effects on the human body is even more prominent, can only make other tea brewing drinking class feel ""poor heat"".The cooking of black tea is actually very simple. When the water temperature is heated to the open, put the appropriate amount of black tea (do not need to add a lid at this time), boil boiling for 2 minutes, turn off the heat, cover the lid, and soak for 3 to 5 minutes. After drinking it.Because of the characteristics of the black tea's Chen and alcohol, the tea is poured into a bottle of water for 1 to 2 hours. The taste of the tea is more mellow, and the cooked tea can be placed in a warm water bottle every night before going to bed. On the second day of drinking, the deeper fermentation process of the tea is more fulfilling, the health care cost and taste are better, smoother, and the soup color is more beautiful and red.Drinking methodThousand two cake teaThousand two cake teaThe production process of black tea is generally focused on fermentation or post-fermentation, and some are pressed tightly into brick tea, cake tea and loose tea. Black tea is generally selected for brewing in teapot teapots and can be cooked under conditions permitting.Black tea needs to be brewed with boiling water. Specific brewing methods are as follows: take teaThere are three types of black tea in general, one thousand two cake tea, grain tea, two thousand tea.Thousand two cakes take teaUse a black tea knife and follow the tea pattern. Tilt the whole tea.Granule tea take teaSince the black tea in the granules has been cut well, take the dark tea out of the package. Thousand two tea take teaWhole thousand teaWhole thousand teaUse tools such as shovels and hammers to take tea. Be careful when taking two thousand teas. Do not hurt your fingers. Tea first stepsCast tea Put about 15g of black tea into the cup. Ruyi Cup is a special cup for dark tea, it can achieve tea moistureTeaTeaFrom, better soak black tea.The second step of teaBrewingBrewingBrewing Take boiling water at a ratio of about 1:40 tea. Because black tea is relatively old, it must use boiling water of 100 degrees Celsius when making tea, so that the tea taste of black tea can be fully brewed.The third step of making teaTea separationTea separationTea separation. If you use the Ruyi Cup to brew black tea, directly press the cup button, you can achieve tea separation. Then bring the tea in the Ruyi Cup directly into the teacup and drink directly. Alternatively, you can directly use the Ruyi Cup to drink tips: Do not stir the dark tea or squeeze the black tea leaves when making the dark tea. This will make the tea turbid.Five ways to drinkBlack tea is mainly produced in Hunan's Anhua County, Hubei, Sichuan, Yunnan, Guangxi and other places. The main varieties are Anhua black tea, Hubei bian flat tea, Sichuan Tibetan tea, Guangxi Liubao loose tea and so on. Black tea is no different than green tea, and there are no restrictions on different teas with different foaming methods. Five dark teas can be used as long as they like to brew.First, the traditional way to drink: Take 10 to 15 grams of tea, with a pot or other container filled with 500 ml of water, cook until a boil, put the tea into it until the kettle of water and then boil, switch to slow fire Cook for one to two minutes. After the ceasefire, remove the tea residue and drink it.Second, the Kung Fu tea drink: Kung Fu tea set, according to Kung Fu tea drinking method of drinking.Third, cover the brewing drink method (the most common in the South): Available lid purple or ceramic cups, bowls, take tea 5-8 grams, first with boiling water rinse once, after the cup is poured out, then into the boiling water, stamped Stir for a minute or so, wait until the soup is red, drink it.4. How to drink herbal tea: Use a ratio of 1 to 60, match well with tea, cook the tea according to traditional methods, filter the tea residue, let it cool, drink it, and put it in the refrigerator. The flavor is better.Fifth, milk tea brewing drink method: the traditional method of cooking tea soup, in accordance with the tea and milk ratio of 1:1, transferred to milk, add a little salt, Serve with Western characteristics of milk tea.Health functionDietary nutritionBlack tea contains richer nutrients, the most important being vitamins and minerals, plusPicture of black teaBlack tea pictures (20 photos)Proteins, amino acids, carbohydrates, etc. For the residents of the northwestern region who have no choice of vegetables and fruits in their diets, such as cattle, lamb, and cheese, long-term drinking of Hunan black tea is an important source of essential minerals and various vitamins for the human body.Digestive oilBlack coffee in the caffeine, vitamins, amino acids, phospholipids, etc. help the body digest, regulate fat metabolism, caffeine stimulation can improve the secretion of gastric juice, thereby increasing appetite and help digestion. Japanese scholars have proved through scientific tests that dark tea has a strong oily greasy, digestion and other functions, which is why meat-eating people particularly like this type of tea.The food structure of ethnic minorities in northwest China is cattle, mutton, and cheese. Therefore, there is a saying that “it would rather eat for three days and not have one day without tea”. This has the effect that tea can be “de-fat” and “decompose”. Big relationship.In addition, black tea can also improve the intestinal microenvironment, has a gastrointestinal function. Chinese folks have used the old black tea to treat bloating, dysentery, and not to eat.Lipid-lowering dietHigh levels of lipids can cause lipids to deposit on the walls of blood vessels, thus causing atherosclerosis and thrombosis. Black tea has a good degradation of fat, anti-hemagglutination, profibrinolytic activity and significant inhibition of platelet aggregation, but also to relax the blood vessel wall, increase the effective diameter of blood vessels, thereby inhibiting the atherosclerotic plaque and the coronary artery form. To achieve blood pressure, soften blood vessels, prevention and treatment of cardiovascular diseases.The tea polysaccharides rich in black tea have the effect of lowering blood lipids and peroxide activity in the blood. From May 1990 to May 1991, the General Hospital of the Chinese People's Liberation Army observed 55 hyperlipidemia patients in 155 veteran cadres at a retired institution after taking continuous black tea for 180 days (3 grams per day). In 50 cases of drinking dark tea, blood lipid levels and peroxide activity in blood decreased significantly.anti-oxidationThe theory of ageing free radicals believes that under normal physiological conditions, free radicals in the human body continue to be produced and are constantly being removed and are in equilibrium. Black tea contains not only rich antioxidant substances such as catechins, tea pigments, flavonoids, vitamin C, vitamin E, and D carotenoids, but also contains a large number of trace elements with antioxidant effects such as zinc and manganese. Copper (a constituent element of SOD) and selenium (a constituent element of GSHPX) and the like. The catechins, theaflavin, theanine and tea polysaccharides in black tea, especially the more complex flavonoids, etc., have the function of scavenging free radicals, and thus have the effects of anti-oxidation and delaying cell senescence.AnticancerCancer is one of the diseases that cause high human mortality in the world.Since the late 1970s, scientists all over the world have discovered that tea or tea extracts have inhibitory effects on the occurrence of various cancers. Hunan University of Agricultural Science and Technology adopts cutting-edge high-throughput screening technology for modern drug screening to conduct high-throughput screening studies on black tea in tumor cell model SGC7901, demonstrating that black tea has a significant inhibitory effect on tumor cells.hypotensiveThe role of tea in lowering blood pressure has long been reported. Japan reported that theanine, a unique amino acid in tea, can activate dopaminergic neurons and inhibit blood pressure. Here, it has also been found that caffeine and catechins in tea can relax blood vessel walls, increase the effective diameter of blood vessels, and reduce blood pressure through vasodilation. China Lou Qingqing found that tea pigment has significant anticoagulation, promotes fibrinolysis, prevents platelet adhesion and aggregation, inhibits proliferation of arterial smooth muscle cells, and can also significantly reduce triglyceride and low-density lipoprotein in serum of high-fat animals. Serum high-density lipoproteins, and ACE enzyme has a significant inhibitory effect, with antihypertensive effect.HypoglycemicThe tea polysaccharide complex in black tea is the main component of hypoglycemia. Tea polysaccharide complex is often referred to as tea polysaccharide and is a complex and highly variable mixture of componentsBlack teaBlack tea. The results of determination of the content of tea polysaccharides in several kinds of teas show that black tea has the highest tea polysaccharide content and its component activity is stronger than other teas because of the glycosidases, proteases, and hydrolases in fermented teas. The effect of the formation of a relatively short length of the sugar chain and peptide chain is due to the short peptide chain longer peptide chain is more easily absorbed, and biological activity is stronger, this may be fermented tea, especially black tea polysaccharide polysaccharides excellent hypoglycemic effect One of the reasons for other types of tea.Sterilization and anti-inflammatoryThe main components of black tea color are theaflavin and theaflavin. Studies have shown that theaflavins are not only effective free radical scavengers and antioxidants, but also have significant antibacterial effects against botulinum bacillus, enterobacteriaceae, staphylococcus aureus, capsular bacillus, bacillus cereus. In addition, theaflavins have a certain inhibitory effect on influenza virus infection and rotavirus and enterovirus infections.Diuretic detoxificationThe diuretic function of caffeine in black tea is achieved by the kidneys promoting the filtration rate of water in the urine. At the same time, the stimulatory effect of caffeine on the bladder can not only help diuresis, but also help sober up and relieve alcoholism. At the same time, tea polyphenols in black tea can not only precipitate nicotine in tobacco, but also be excreted with urine, and can also remove free radicals in smoke and reduce the toxic effects of smoke on human body. For heavy metal poisons, tea polyphenols have a strong adsorption effect, so drinking more tea can also alleviate the toxic effects of heavy metals.Black tea healthBlack tea is different from other teas in the choice of raw materials, processing technology (fermented flowers), etc., resulting in the composition and proportion of the biochemical components of black tea and the resulting pharmacological functions.The tea formed by the participation of microorganisms in the dumping process has very different functions from the red and green tea contained in the tea, and its functions are different. l It has significant effects in reducing blood fat, lowering blood pressure, reducing blood sugar, losing weight, preventing cardiovascular diseases, and fighting cancer. Studies have shown that the special health benefits of black tea are related to its richness in tea polysaccharides.PrecautionsCold drink Anhua black tea can only suddenly reduce the surface temperature or local temperature, can not be persistent antipyretic, thirst-quenching. Properly drinking hot tea is more beneficial to relieving heat, thirst, and cooling. Because drinking hot tea can dilate blood vessels, promote secretion of sweat glands, so that perspiration is fun. A large amount of sweat oozes out through the pores of the skin surface and volatilizes, which takes away a large amount of body heat and can lower the body surface temperature by 2~3°C. In addition, theophylline in Anhua black tea has a diuretic effect, and urination can also take away some of the heat. Anhua black tea is also rich in tea polyphenols, tea pigments and amino acids, etc. It can also stimulate the secretion of saliva and react with saliva to nourish the mouth and produce a cool feeling. This is an anhua black tea in cold drinks. The effect is not obvious. In the hot summer days, it is a rare pleasure to enjoy a cup of Anhua black tea during leisure time. However, in the state of water shortage, eager to drink herbal tea can not only not understand its unique flavor, but may even cause harm to the body. At this time, drinking hot tea is a better choice.Magical life1, have a certain effect on the treatment of habitual constipation. The advent of spring is a time when gastro-intestinal diseases are prone to occur. Hot-drinking black tea, especially aged black tea, has a good effect on the treatment of chronic enteritis. At the same time, drinking dark tea can eliminate bloating and have the magical effect of treating indigestion.2, black tea shampoo can stop itching hair. Black tea (chan tea) is rich in protein, tea polyphenols, tea polysaccharides, and vitamins and minerals. Among them, proteins, tea polysaccharides, vitamins, and minerals are essential nutrients for hair growth, and tea polyphenols and other substances have antibacterial, anti-inflammatory, and anti-allergic effects. Therefore, the black tea (Zencha Tea) tea juice is a natural nutritional hair care shampoo that has the effect of removing itch and itching hair. Long-term use can make your hair clean and shiny.3, black tea can quickly relieve fatigue, deodorant antibacterial. Black tea (Channa tea) is rich in tea polyphenols, tea polysaccharides, vitamins and minerals, tea polyphenols, tea saponins, etc. have antibacterial, anti-allergic effects; black tea (chan tea) Aromatic substances also have deodorant, anti-inflammatory and other effects. Moreover, the black tea (Zhan 洱茯 ) ) )) has a strong compatibility, or can choose appropriate Chinese medicines such as safflower, eucommia, etc. to be formulated with it to make a medicinal tea foot bath, which acts on the foot meridians to achieve the purpose of systemic regulation. If you need to boil the appropriate concentration (1:25 to 50) of black tea (Chan tea) tea juice or Chinese medicine, soak your feet at a water temperature of about 35 to 40°C, you can quickly relieve fatigue, restore stamina, and deodorize. bacteria.We want to build a company that’s for our customers and our culinary interests, not just some investment fund’s bottom line.

The crowded up in the brain is the unfinished work. This is the normal state of the city. .This normal state is still not completely relieved for the old Song who lived in Shenzhen for more than 10 years. Often, he will miss a taste, from the wilderness and summer long field wilderness, from the white rice hot dishes after school, from his other expectation to ease urban life.Lao Song tried to understand the surrounding thoughts and found that whether it was a miss of his hometown or tired of a thousand working meals, most urban people were very enthusiastic about the taste of the country. Finally, he made up his mind to let him bring the natural flavors of the country to the city, let the wanderers in the city find a familiar, healthy taste; find the soul that can comfort the tired, the familiar power from home. As a common favorite in the north and south of China, hot sauce can evoke the memory of the five lakes and four seas, while the purple garlic sauce is the spicy taste of the old Song childhood memories. This familiar taste has a more unique feeling.Now, the old Song Yu hopes to bring the good things of his hometown into the city, let the fast-paced city feel the rustic taste of the country.The high territory is a forest microclimate with an average annual temperature of 16.8 °C - 18 °C and annual rainfall of 1573.6 mm. It is very suitable for the cultivation of ""three spicy"" purple skin garlic, horn pepper, and red bud ginger.Based on the superior geographical environment, the CHONGQING MIX SICHUAN CHILI CRISP brand owns the traditional planting base of the national landmark agricultural products “high-purple garlic”, and produces and produces the purple garlic sauce series. The taste is pure and natural, with fresh, fragrant and spicy entrance. Etc.From the planting base to the integrated management of the table, the farmland implements the organic planting standard. The sauce production never adds preservatives and pigments, and the aseptic packaging line strictly controls each process to ensure healthy and safe production","We have worked tirelessly for over a year to perfect the process of scaling and manufacturing our sauces, overcoming many obstacles and setbacks along the way. We have waited until we have absolutely secured the right facilities and ingredients before we committed to launching CHONGQING MIX SICHUAN CHILI CRISP internationally via this Kickstarter campaign. We have already produced several large batches of our sauce with our co-packing partner in CHONGQING and SICHUAN , achieving a level of quality and consistency that satisfies our extremely high standards.As we are importing the sauce into the world, there may be unforeseeable delays at customs, although we have already worked some buffer into our timeline. We will work with a bottling facility in the world to package our sauces and our fulfillment partner to ship the products once they are ready.As we are shipping some of our products to customers internationally, there may be delays and customs fees that we cannot control, please keep that in mind when placing orders outside of the hongkong."

As a society, we teach kids to Stop Drop & Roll if they catch on fire and as a result only 135 kids die from catching on fire each year in the USA; However, We teach these same children nothing about how to Help the Bullied or just be someones friend and as a result over 4,400 teens take their own life each year. Another 440,000 tried to take their own life last year. (2010 census).Our goal is to create a video game which will teach important life savings techniques & tips to our children, parents, educators, work place and community.This is a for profit company.Our new game will be a superhero based game and will allow play at a multitude of grade levels including a teacher edition, a parent edition and eventually a work workplace edition thereby teaching live-saving techniques and tips using real life situations at the appropriate time during an individuals life. This life-saving game is needed by our youth, our parents, our educators and our community. By combining corporateamerica together with a bully prevention organization then adding kids of varying ages, we create a game that is extremely fun, educational and, most importantly, life saving!Bye Bye Bullies will be owned by Mind Palace Games. Mind Palace Games will pay royalties to the following: Sweetheart and Heroes (Non-Profit) & Free College Fairfax VT (Non-Profit) which splits funds into three invention clubs:Free College for Me in '23 (4th Grade), 2020 Visionaries (7th Grade),16 in '16 Free (10th grade),These are all Local Invention Clubs whose participants are helping to design the game and will using the monies to fund their college education.A LARGE portion of the profits will be given to Sweethearts and Heroes. We have teamed up to design a game that is fun, educational and, most importantly, LIVE SAVING. A free version will be available with Screened Ads in the Game or purchase the Ad Free Version for only $2.99.Schools zero tolerance anti-bullying environments can work but only if we educate our youth how to obtain this goal, not however by simply saying it is going to be so. That's just not working!Here are just a few of the great videos that Tom Murphy, owner of Sweethearts and Heroes did: www.youtube.com/watch?v=lPXCH0FF9IY","The risks are extremely low.  Getting the game into the hands of teachers  and parents will also be relatively easy as sweetheartsandheroes.org talked to over 900,000 students in the last 3 last years about helping the bullied.  This game is designed to instill the educational material delivered by this organization over and over again though-out the year. As far as educational materials and learning situations, these were obtained using real life situations. Sweetheartsandheroes.org deals with these trials and tribulations every day, everyday working to save a life.",https://www.kickstarter.com/projects/762691461/cow-paddys-snack-bar-and-funny-farm?ref=discovery_category_newest,762691461/cow-paddys-snack-bar-and-funny-farm,"It will be a seasonal snack bar that will be a truly memorableexperience combining amazing food and utterly ridiculous desserts with a fun and exciting barnyard like play area allowing for the enjoyment of a great meal and, more importantly, providing a fun place for family and friends to bond.Let's start with a overview of the project.A school bus will be converted into a shack bar then painted and customized to resemble a cow (NOTE: This is not the bus we will be using, it is an image we found on the internet and we plan to dress our cow up a whole lot more than this one... ours will be utterly amazing). Our cow snack bus will be located in Fairfax Vermont next to the town's municipal building with visibility from the highly traveled Vt Route 104/Main Street. Fairfax is a bedroom community with approximately 5,000 residents. There is only one small restaurant, a pizza place and three convenience stores.Food will be ordered from the side of the cow and picked up at the rear of the cow (utterly ridiculous I know...and disgusting right.. that's part of the draw.... the kids at school love the idea). An outdoor play area will be constructed to include the World's First 'Cow Tipping' game (that we invented), an Invisible Farm Animal Barnyard (free, that we invented), A 'Cornhole Mini-golf Bean Bag' game (that we invented), standard cornhole games (free) and a farm themed playground (free). We plan to open our Fairfax location this year and expand to multiple fleet minibus version for use at fairs and festivals... and then three new locations in Vermont next few years.Franchising will soon follow.Food and Desserts:Cow Paddies are our signature dessert! They are fried bread dough cover in chocolate sauce with ice cream on top then it's all covered in more chocolate sauce, whip cream, confectioners sugar, chocolate sprinkles and, of course, a big, fat cherry on top.Choose either the Jumbo size or mini, either way they are absolutely disgusting when served out of the back of a bus that looks like a cow but they Taste Utterly Ridiculously Delicious!Another signature dessert will be Stinky Sticks. They are cooked corn on the cob dipped in brownie batter and then baked for a short period. They too, of course, are served out the rear of the cow. They look absolutely gross but Taste Utterly Delicious!Our menu will also include Cow Patty Burgersand Junior Cow Patty Burgers (smaller version)are thick, juicy burgers that can be customized with secret sauces and unique options.Fried food such as fired shrimp, clams and chicken tenders. Our french fries will be hand cut and we have found a great pre-made onion ring which when combined with a custom line of three (soon to be 4 we hope) different kinds of onion ring sauces and we found a real winner. We have also found a great veggie burger and will offer a few option to keep the who prefer to eat from the garden happy.Wait until you try our coleslaw...it's amazing! A kids menu will offer smaller burgers, smaller chicken strip portions, smaller grilled chicken options... you get the point. We do not want to charge a ton of money for a huge meal that a kid can't possibly finish and over charge the family. We plan to keep our menu simple but customizable. Our snack cow will ensure you leave as happy as a cow leaving the barn for the first time in spring!Ice Cream...Ice Cream...Ice CreamOur Jumbo cree-mee's (soft ice cream for those not from Vermont) will be so tall that you will need to get the wheel barrow from the barn and have someone hold the cone in order to eat it (okay, that may be a little exaggerated but you get the point). We will offer kids sizes and real maple Cree-mee's as well.Our higher end desserts will feature premium hard ice cream and be pleasing to the eye and scrumptious in the tummy! They will truly be utterly ridiculous!Fun and Games:Our Cow Tipping Pasture is a custom designed pasture with cut-out wooden cows attached to cement filled buckets using hinges.Each cow has a sensor on its nose that detects movement within a few feet and if movement is detected, the cows eyes light up waking the cow and the cow moo's. The object is to sneak up undetected in a pasture of these cows (a maze) and tip over as many of them as you can without waking up the cow. Cow Tipping... only available at Cow Paddy's Funny Farm and free with the purchase of any item from our snack bar other- wise it's $1 a person for four mazes or $2 for a family. An utterly ridiculously low price but we want to keep it as affordable for families as possible.Our Invisible Farm Animal Barnyard (free)is a fenced in area which will include a feeding yard, a bedding yard, a grooming yard and a walking pasture. It is intended to get kids (and adults) creative minds working. Pretending is a great thing for a mind to do and we hope to allow humans of all ages pretend together as a group... as a family! We'll let their imaginations can run wild as they pretend to train the animals how to eat, let them sleep, take them for a walk and even care for their animal.This is an invisible dog on a leash. We plan to create invisible cow & calf ropes, invisible horse and mule harnesses, pig leashes, cat leashes and varies other invisible farm animal leashes that the kids and adults can play with in our barnyard... all free! We will also a create a huge elephant and a dinosaur leash that the staff will bring out on a regular basis to entertain the young ones.Our Cornhole Mini-Golf Bean Bag Game will be a fenced in area that will offer even the most advanced corn holer a challenge.Nine holes of cornholing with bean bags through a custom designed mini-golf style game field with things to spin and obstacles to avoid. Can you become a Cornhole master? Our Cornhole mini-golf bean bag course will have you laughing and smiling the whole next week and beyond. One free round with any food purchase or $1 a person or $2 for a family round.An area will also contain some standard cornhole games for those who prefer to play regular cornhole.It's a family friendly game that encourages conversation and laughter. Stop by and throw a few cobs of corn (bean bags) into a hole and see if you can win a game or two.Our Barnyard Playground will include an old tractor for kids (and adults) to pretend to drive an old tractor (like the picture but not that exact tractor).It will include a few different tractor slides (like the ones in the pictures but not exactly these),and a few log balance beams and a half buried tractor tire course to climb on. Again, these pictures are just for an example, not the exact items.In closing, let us thank you for reviewing our project... no... our dream... of creating a place where families can come to eat, play and most importantly... Bond! As we grow into a thriving business we are excited to help our youth learn how to work in the business world, excited to watch the families come and enjoy the great barnyard we have created and excite to create more and more additions to our barnyard allowing families to play, laugh and enjoy each others friendship.","A big challenge... Yes... but a challenge we are ready to succeed at.  We estimate that it will cost  $46,525  to properly set-up our Snack Cow.  We have obtained verbal approval from the town of Fairfax and verbal contract has been established with the land owner regarding leasing issues.  Once funded, a signed contract will be obtained from the land owner and paperwork will be filed with the town and state.We have found several buses and have been in contact with a local company the sells restaurant equipment to equip the bus properly. We have not filed required paperwork for town permits or State licenses but we have reviewed all State laws & rules and the required paperwork and have completed it for submission when this project get funded.  As for building the Playground  Barnyard, the Cow Tipping Pasture and the  Cornhole Mini-golf Bean Bag Course, we are excited to start building it. I have been inventing for many years amd have built everything from cabin to houses and from decks to solar panel stands. so I knew how to build and I build well. The site work such as parking lot, driveway, landscaping will be complete be myself as I own a dump truck and have access to a backhoe.  I have completed many such projects, not a snack bar but driveways and landscaping, and look forward to setting up a professional yet inviting space. We plan to set up tents to start over the tables then, within the next year or so, build a barn type structure over the bus and a pavilion for the tables. The project will require no sewer work as a port-a-let will be rented. As for water, we will not have access to water directly so the bus will be equipped with a stainless steel tank. The owner of the land has water access rights to the towns water supply from the non-working farm next door.  When needed, the tank will be refilled (probably every day). The water will be used for cleaning. Bottled water will be used for food preparation and also available for sale as drinking water.    One of our biggest obstacles will be find the right help. As for servers, clean up crews and the like that part will be filled by the local highschool students looking for well paying local summer work. the hardest part of any restaurant is the cook staff. Fortunately for us, the community is loaded with people looking to make extra money during the summer who know how to cook plus George has been a short order cook before so will also be a cook. What we are preparing is not had to prepare but it does require individuals who are trustworthy and reliable.  I am confident we can find the right individuals (I have two already who want the summer work) to fulfill our needs.Please feel free to ask any questions and we'll try to answer them in the FAQ's section. We have a complete business plan and financials showing the business will be profitable; however, we are not willing to release said documents."

Its about supernatural beings living in the modern world. It will follow the creatures and how they view humans, the world, and how they choose to live. Some will struggle with morality while others thrive on mayhem. The story follows a vampire named ""kavin"" and his struggle to hold on to the last bit of humanity he has. Redemption is a hard road and kavin will certainly have a lot of challenges along the way!","Getting this project off the ground will be complicated when it comes to funding. Need the right camera, and funding for visual effects as there will be many!",https://www.kickstarter.com/projects/bloodbound/among-us-0?ref=discovery_category_newest,bloodbound/among-us-0,"Among Us is a TV series concept that will be released on YouTube. Episodes will be 40-45 minutes long and there will be 12 episodes per season. The entire story has been written and the story is about the world of the supernatural. It focuses on the perspectives of these supernatural beings rather than humans' perspectives. The series will mainly follow a vampire named ""Kavin"" who used to be an assassin for hire. Kavin would only take jobs if he agreed that the target was a bad person. Eventually Kavin decided that it wasn't his place to take lives so he retired. The series begins with Kavin settling down in a small town as he's retired now with the intentions of just living a simple life or as simple as a vampire can.Kavin learns that there is a vampire in this town named ""Elijah"" who is incredibly power hungry, manipulative, and controlling. Elijah makes it a point to know all the vampires in this town and attempts to make them follow him. Kavin is not on board with this idea, especially due to some of the very bad things Elijah does. Even though Kavin wants to lewd a simple life, he gets pulled back in to the drama of the supernatural world. Because of this, Kavin decides that he and ""Miguel"" (Kavin's) human best friend and caretaker, should leave this town. However, Kavin decides that Elijah will never stop coming after him so Elijah needs to be stopped.Kavin learns that there is a group of rogue vampires in this town that are against Elijah. Kavin goes to this group with hopes of getting them on board to help planning to take Elijah down. Along with meeting this group, Elijah also meets and befriends a werewolf named Jeff. Werewolves and Vampires do not get along but these two unlikely friends share the same viewpoints that everyone should be treated equally.The biggest problem with fighting Elijah, is that Elijah somehow has the ability to control people. He can make them stop moving and talking and other things as well. Kavin seeks a way of getting around this problem and meets an ""Inspired"" named ""Stacey."" The Inspired are good in nature and absolutely hate vampires due to their evil natures and souls being damned. Stacey realizes that there's something different about Kavin and agrees to help. She casts a spell enchanting Kavin with immunity of being controlled.Elijah eventually employs the help of ""Damius"" (an old and strong vampire) to track down and bring Kavin to him. At this point, Kavin and Elijah have their fight which Elijah being on top of the fight for most of the battle leaving Kavin all but crippled on the floor. Kavin as a last ditch effort is able to kill Elijah.That is the summary of Season 1. There are side characters and other small plots going on to help develop more of the story.","Due to the the type of show we are making, finding, selecting, and hiring the right vfx artists will be challenging. We are also changing a lot of how these known supernatural beings operate and introducing a new type as well."

Developers will be more agile across multiple languages and have more time to focus on the complex code that robots cant solve (yet)...The stimpack ecosystem currently holds three mayor repositories We pledge to keep the stimpack repository (the client) licensed with MIT to ensure product growth and a fair usage for anyone across the community.The data repository (deployed at data.stimpack.io) is our platform to capitalize on. It will provide additional services associated with a fee or subscription model. (Somewhat like the free distribution of Laravel powers spinoff products like Forge or Envoyer)Things you can expect from such a stimpack.io subscription might be featured content and access to advanced plugin manipulators. Note we will not define the exact nature of these features in this campaign.We hope you like it. Coding abstractions of abstractions is complex business and we will certainly apprechiate input from you. If you dont have the cash to contribute right now we encourage you to contribute to our repositories instead because we pledge to give all contributors the Free-Forever-License as well.",Theft of the MIT basis. Please join us instead.,https://www.kickstarter.com/projects/anders-jurisoo/pipe-dream?ref=discovery_category_newest,anders-jurisoo/pipe-dream,"In fancy wordings: By giving Pipe Dream a minimum input in form of a sketch/entity list it will predict your application schema and feed it into a set of language specific file factories of your choice. The factories, delegating to pipes, will generate all the files needed to get started really quick with your web project.We are now raising funds to continue develop and broaden the Pipe Dream open source platform beyond PHP/Laravel. In parallel we are building an online implementation pipedream.ai (currently in beta)If you are new to Pipe Dream, here is the first release video:The original repo reached github trending #1 for JavaScript and was featured in a Laravel News article and their podcast. Much thanks to the amazing community contributions and suggestions the code have been almost completely overhauled since then.Below you can see a list of proposed features, somewhat sorted by priority.We are stoked to keep working on the improvements in the list above. Each expense and produced result will be published for full transparency. Please note, the list is not to be considered a set of fixed pledges, rather a general direction in which the funds will be put to use. In addition to some server costs, the funds will mostly be used to sustain the founder + 1 other dev with an hourly salary until december.By backing this project, you will receive a subscription valid for a variable length. With your subscription you will be able to do more with pipedream.ai. Initially the benefits will include:At a later time, as new features are added, that might also include more advanced capabilities. We highly recommend getting the lifetime subscription right away at a bargain price (in this context, the word 'lifetime' refers to the lifespan of the product not any persons lifetime).You can also submit a pull request (must get merged) to one of the pipe-dream repos to get a free subscription equivalent to the LIFETIME award.","The complexity of the project is kind of though especially for new contributors. We plan to remedy that by easier installation, smoother build process and better test coverage.Another challenge we are working on is how to sustain the work effort financially, hence this campaign.A final concern is how to balance proprietary code vs open source code and security. Our doctrine is open source first. Eventually we would like to open source pipedream.ai, but we don't want to compromise user security."

Markets can serve as gateways to different cultures, and a market with diverse participation canserve as an accessible bridge for cultural exchange. And let’s be honest, they’re really alot of fun, and filled with tons of great food and art.Night Markets are prevalent in Asia, Africa,Latin America, and Western Europe. Some of these markets have hundreds, if not thousands, ofyears of history, but successfulnight markets have recently popped up in North American cities, including LA, SanFrancisco, San Diego, Chicago, Philadelphia, Seattle, Honolulu, Vancouver, and Toronto.Sure, this city has no shortage of day-time markets and one-off events, but it’s about time NYC got its own NIGHT MARKET! That’s where you, me, and this project come in!Whereas existing night markets tend to be fairly monothematic, reflecting one or only a small set of cultures,NYC is uniquely positioned to support a truly international, multicultural, and inclusive affair. And Queens, as the most ethnically diverse area in the world, is the perfect place for it.WHAT: The Queens International Night Marketwill be a large, family-friendly, open-air night market featuring 100+independent vendors selling merchandise, art, and food, andshowcasing performances and entertainment, all celebrating the rich culturaland ethnic diversity of NYC and Queens. WHEN: 6pm - Midnight on most Saturdays from April 25th through October.WHERE: The Night Market will most likely take place at the NY Hall of Science in Flushing Meadows Corona Park. It will resonate with the legacy of the World's Fairs, and be an event where ""international"" and ""local"" truly go hand-in-hand.Finding a space in NYC to sell goods, art, or food can beprohibitively expensive, especially for the kinds of culturally authenticfood and merchandisewe want tofeature at the market. That’s why, instead of profiting off vendor fees by charging vendors an arm and a leg -- or a wing and a drumstick! --we want to subsidize our vendors and chargeas little as one-half or one-third of what existing markets charge. We think this is the only way we canattract a real, authentic diversity that truly represents the cultural and ethnic tapestry ofQueens and NYC.This means you can expect to find affordable and casualstreet foods you might not see at other markets. Think momos, arepas, steamed buns, empanadas, fish balls and fish cakes, tacos, takoyaki, sticky rice, skewers, curries, crepes, jerk chicken, roti, bahn mi, Bolivian sandwiches, knishes, pig feet, pizza, pastries, desserts, coffees and bubble tea, and so much more. Instead of finding slews of the same sunglasses, socks, t-shirts, and kitschy goods, you can find culturally inspired arts, crafts, and merchandise.We also want to feature small-scale cultural performances. Dance, music, and theatrical performances will contribute to the international flavor of the market and make the shopping and eating that much more enjoyable.Producing the Night Market will cost well over $10,000 a night inexpenses alone -- but if we can prove the concept to vendors, sponsors, andNYC in 2015, it will become self-sustainable.Funds from our initial goal will beused to pay for1) the myriad permits and professional services we need toactually produce the Night Market;2) the tents that will protect ourvendors and their goods from the elements and for the other equipment that willgive visitors a place to sit and enjoy food and be mesmerized by the featuredperformances; and3) the venue rental fees for the first five dates to prove thatQueens and NYC can sustain a Night Market. After that, if we can dream a little dream, stretch goals will help finance the venue rental fees for additional dates. Every dollar will help us create anawesome, and hopefully permanent, addition to the cultural landscape of NYC andQueens. Open to all, free to attend, and filled with the diverse cultures andtraditions that make NYC the Best.City.Ever.I’ve spent the past year completely devoted to paving a path for the QueensInternational Night Market. I’ve been emailing, calling, and meeting with as many people and stakeholders as I possibly can, including politicians, community leaders, cultural institutions,economic development organizations, and tourism advocates... I’ve been speaking to countless companies and suppliers about providing insurance, security, power rentals, lighting, medical support, sanitation, and waste removal. Nowwhat’s left is to fund this thing and make it happen!And don't worry, I’ve bootstrappedthis project since the beginning and haven’t paid myself a dollar for well overa year. I plan to keep it that way until we (this really is a “we”) canprove that the Night Market represents a real opportunity for visitors,vendors, sponsors, NYC, and, ultimately, the organizers (me!).So, please spread the word to help us hit our funding target, if notblow past it! The more we raise, the more and better vendors and performers we can feature.ALSO, send any potential vendors and performers our way… they are critical to the experience, so the more themerrier!THANK YOU!","There is a fair amount of risk and uncertainty, some which cannot be even remotely planned around.While a meticulously organized market can easily be colorful  and exciting, at the end of the day, our vendors will need to make money – this means we need attract a consistent swarm of hungry visitors and visitors with the aim to shop! On the other side, there may also be other events or other conflicts that prevent us from featuring the ideal mix of vendors. We will do everything in our power to curate the vendors that best fit our mission and goals for the Night Market. As an outdoor event, despite the tents, we are the mercy of mother nature. Rain, rain go away.7-train reliability – 'nuff saidWe have been meeting with the NYPD, the FDNY, the local politicians, and other city stakeholders to ease the path for the Night Market, but there is no assurance that we won't inadvertently get caught in politics or red tape along the way.And finally logistics -- reliably getting equipment (electricity, sanitation, tents, seating, etc.) delivered and set up every Saturday afternoon and getting it out by Sunday morning will be a real challenge. A lot of things could go wrong on any given night. We will roll with the punches.

We scrambled -- and luckily managed -- to raise enough private funds at the last minute to enable us to launch and prove that a Night Market would be a welcome addition to the cultural landscape of NYC and Queens.Since then, well over 30,000 people of all ages and from all backgrounds (including oodles of families) have visited the Queens International Night Market in just the past six weeks.But, in order to keep it free to enter and uniquely affordable (for visitors and vendors), we need to raise money to bring it back in July.Markets can serve as gateways to different cultures, and one with diverse participation can be an accessible bridge for cultural exchange. That's why QINM strives to tap into NYC's unparalleled diversity and to represent a truly international, multicultural, and inclusive affair. And Queens, as the most ethnically diverse area in the world, is, and has been, the perfect home for it.Sure, this city has no shortage of day-time markets and one-off events, but now NYC finally has its own Night Market! Somehow we'd been trailing LA, San Fran, Chicago, Philly, Seattle, Vancouver, and Toronto... not anymore! What: The Queens International Night Market is a large, family-friendly, open-air night market featuring over 80 independent vendors selling merchandise, art, and food, and showcasing small-scale performances and entertainment, all celebrating the rich cultural and ethnic diversity of NYC and Queens. We will grow to 100+ vendors and eventually add fun games for everyone to enjoy.When: 6pm - Midnight on at least nine or ten more scheduled Saturdays this year, starting again on July 4th. Where: The Night Market takes place in Queens, at the NY Hall of Science in Flushing Meadows Corona Park. It resonates with the legacy of the World's Fairs, and is an event where ""international"" and ""local"" truly go hand-in-hand. If we can raise enough funds, we may find additional locations to fill out gap dates when the current venue has a scheduling conflict.THE EXPERIENCE: Finding a space in NYC to sell goods, art, or food can be prohibitively expensive. That’s why, instead of profiting off vendor fees by charging vendors an arm and a leg -- or a wing and a drumstick! -- we have been subsidizing our vendors and charging as little as one-half or one-third of what existing markets charge. We think this is the only way we can attract the diversity that truly represents the cultural and ethnic tapestry of Queens and NYC.Have you ever wondered why 90% of the food at QINM is priced at $5 or less? This isn't by accident, but depends on our ability to continue to subsidize vendor fees. We’ve had casual street food from all over the world, including Spam musubi, takoyaki, pig parts on a stick, traditional Trinidadian shark sandwiches, Yibin fire noodles, obleas, crawfish boils, anticuchos, Burmese palatas, and so, so much more. And we will continue to curate diverse street foods (and the stories behind them) from around the world.Another significant benefit of subsidizing vendor fees is that the majority of our food vendors (and even some of our art and merchandise vendors) are doing this for the first time. We’ve managed to encourage about 30 brand new vendors to share their stories and their food with us, and hopefully QINM will represent the first step in many more entrepreneurial stories to come.While food vendors currently outnumber our art and merchandise vendors, we are campaigning to tip that scale so that this continues to be a thoroughly cultural event, and not just a fun place to eat. We also feature small-scale cultural performances each night -- dance and music have made the shopping and eating experience that much more enjoyable.USE OF FUNDS: Although producing the Night Market costs well over $12,000 a night, we want to keep the Night Market admission-free and want to keep our vendor fees uniquely affordable, which allows us to impose low price caps on food offerings.I firmly believe we will find the sponsors to support QINM's cause and mission... but until then, all Kickstarter contributions will help fund the nightly production expenses. Specifically, funds raised here will be used to help pay for the venue rental fees, which are by far our biggest expense every night. Any stretch goals will help us find a new venue for additional dates. Every dollar we raise will help ensure that the Night Market remains free to attend and features representatives of even more of the diverse cultures and traditions that make NYC the Best.City.Ever. THE ROAD THUS FAR: It's taken over 15 months to reach this point. I've met with countless stakeholders and politicians and negotiated with countless companies and suppliers about providing insurance, security, power rentals, lighting, medical support, sanitation, and waste removal. I’ve spent the last three months recruiting and coordinating vendors, assembling and moving tents, filling sandbags, moving light towers, moving steel barricades, assembling and moving picnic tables, pushing portapotties, and getting massively sunburnt.I haven’t paid myself a dollar since this project began -- I plan to keep it that way until we (this really is a “we”) can prove that the Night Market represents a real opportunity for sponsors. So, PLEASE SPREAD THE WORDto help us hit our funding target, if not blow past it! Also, send any potential vendors and performers our way… they are still the most important part of the experience, so the more the merrier!THANK YOU!Some select QINM press coverage:DNAinfo (2/27)Metro NY (3/20)Gothamist (4/27)NY Times (4/30)The Village Voice (5/29)","For anyone who came to our ""opening"" night, you probably witnessed many of the risks and challenges we face. That night, we dealt with far more visitors (many more thousands) than we were prepared for. And far more people drove their cars than we anticipated, which contributed to traffic congestion and impacted the local residential community. Since then, we've also dealt with a deluge of a rainstorm that forced us to close early, winds that trashed many of our tents ($$$$!), and a few malfunctioning light towers. We are focused on attracting a critical mass of local art and merchandise vendors, and encouraging our visitors to support them, so that QINM does not just become exclusively a weekly food festival. There may also be other events or other conflicts that prevent us from featuring the ideal mix of vendors.At the end of the day, our vendors will need to make money – this means we need attract a consistent swarm of hungry visitors and visitors with the aim to shop and eat!  And finally, while we have developed and fostered relationships with the NYPD, the FDNY, the local politicians, the local community, and other city stakeholders, there is no assurance that we won't inadvertently get caught in politics or red tape somewhere along the way.ENDLESS THANKS AND CREDITS TO:Each of our vendors and each of the Queens and Flushing Meadows organizations, companies, and individuals who generously donated rewards to the campaignKevin Clancy, for graciously producing the video on such short notice and despite my supreme awkwardness and reluctance to be on camera: http://www.kevinclancymedia.com/IdS/R Architecture for their architectural work to date, and for any design work yet to be done for future venues.Greg, Linda, Laure, Stephane, Yang, and Jeff, for believing in me and the project and for the financial and moral support to help the project launch.

And I did, this past Thanksgiving Day, 2014. I would like to hire a highly talented piano player and book a recording studio somewhere around Vail or Aspen to record it. I am just a cook, and simply need your help in recording it with the highest quality available. It's a damned good song I wrote, if I may say so. ","The recording studios around here charge around a hundred and fifty an hour with the engineer. A studio musician (piano player) is around eighty an hour.  I think that 1,200.00 will lock it in  with a great Thanksgiving song for us all to enjoy, if not for just one day a year.",https://www.kickstarter.com/projects/culinarygrad/the-national-parks-cafe?ref=discovery_category_newest,culinarygrad/the-national-parks-cafe,"The National Park Cafe is a small theme restaurant with a ""National Park"" feel to it in the heart of the city. The funds will go to either paying and leasing out an existing outlet that is ready to go or to buy all new commercial equipment and lease a new place. The funds will also go to buy and frame national park posters from all of America's national parks. The seating will be wooden picnic tables. The music will be the sounds of nature and birds and wolves and bears and elk and so on. It is a great alternative to the usual quick-casual places we all know and love/hate. The timeline is simple: if I reach my goal of 50k, I will set up the restaurant within 30 days of funding in either Denver or Portland or Los Angeles or Fort Meyers, Florida.","Most new restaurant concepts come with many challenges. Will people come? Will they come back? The answer to both of those questions for me is ""Yes"".  I believe in my heart that people who live in the city are dying for an escape to a national park environment. That is what I will be providing, along with good food."

Sure, it is cliche to state that, but it is really true. There are few movies that, when I first saw it, I connected with it. This is the only one that has a craving for more to come of it, and now it is time for it to happen.Be a part of the funding, and in some cases the production, that makes one of the most badass movies possible to make it back on screen!OH YEAH, this IS a working-title of the film and production, so stay tuned for the official name of the movie at a later reveal date! And there will be several locations used during the production of the film, but only one could be listed at this time.Some Tidbits on the Movie: In the form of WILLs and WILL NOTsThis WILL NOT be a sequel, but a continuation. This will make sense as we continue to update on production.The movie WILL have badass action and development that expounds on the story laid out from the original.This WILL NOTbe a reboot!This WILL be the movie you want to see if you love The Game, Juggers, Slashes, Qwicks (or Quicks), Backcharges, Drives and people swinging chains.This WILL NOT be the movie you want to see if you are hoping for a love-story with actors who just so happen to be wearing leather.This movie WILL be bloody, brutal, vulgar, intelligent, sexy, intriguing, daring and raw.This movie WILL NOT be a cookie-cut.About Being a BackerNow, with that all out of the way, if you want to become a backer there are a few things needing to be addressed.FIRST: THANK YOU SO MUCH!! This is a long road, and we're not even close to the end yet, but it has become clear that getting there won't be possible without you, the backer and fan interest/support. So, for just considering on being one, thanks. For becoming a backer...THANK YOU VERY MUCH!AND don't worry about the Tweets to thank you, everyone will get several of those, trust!SECOND: This project is still in flux and elements are still being developed as this is being typed. So the more support received the quicker we get out of the start-up mire and into the production...mire (which is better, since production mire is part of the development process).Since things are as stated, the dates to when things truly get started, may change. Backers will be updated on this change and how it effects them and possible rewards.Just figured it is best to be upfront with that now. Also rewards will be made once a backing has been confirmed...that way 1005 extra buttons are made and laying around.THIRD: With that being said (or typed), look at all the rewards! Pictures of the items will be posted at a later date, in the description and as an update.Backers have a selection of things they can received based on the level(s) that contribute. Everything is available from previously mentioned buttons, caps, beanies, hoodies, posters, sketches, secret grab bag items, video chat time, production updates and more. There is even room for craziness to where additional items might be thrown in...with little forewarning...just because there was another means to say THANKS.FOURTH: There will be random items included in the packages for pledges that aren't listed. This is an addition THANKS! Yes, will be random (not all of them will be the same per pledge or the same in the same pledge category), and no, you will not receive a hint as to what it might be.In Summation about the GoalJust to be clear, the goal that has been set is more for the initials (first round funding) and not the complete cost of the film. If the goal is met, then there is a better chance to getting things going in the right direction. The more this goes over the goal, then the more awesome things become, and then maybe the first round becomes the ONLY round.We want this to be the best damn film ever done, and that is why getting fans of the first Blood of Heroes involved seemed to be the best thing to do.So, please, if you can, support, back, fund, love this film and the production of it. You will not be forgotten and will be appreciated and rewarded throughout the entire process.Thanks again to everyone for the consideration and the support. Looking forward to getting in contact and updating you all along the way.BoH Team","Risk - if the project flops there is a lot at stake. Credibility, future projects with the results of an unknown degree of poverty and woe (not exaggerating with this). Knew it would be risky from the beginning but continued on for the love of the project.Challenges - these are happening every day. It has been a challenge just getting this going; which has been in the works for over 5 years. Finally got it to this stage and definitely want to see it all through. Another challenge is actors and other staff. Hopefully as the project builds it will interest some really favored actors and actresses to join up.The biggest risk of all is finding backers. Enough backers to make this possible. Coming to grips with how much can be done initially and when help is needed is a big thing in regards to dropping ego and going for what you know.Thanks for reading and please support the next part in the Blood of Heroes."
