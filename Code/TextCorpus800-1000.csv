I'm David Gregham, French photographer of the male nude outdoors (mostly)... Now based in Paris, I grew up on the French Riviera, in the 80's... A time and place of MUCH freedom!... [see the rest in my bio, all the way up this page, underneath the title and cover picture, click on ""PLUS"" (and above the ""rewards"", for the computer version!)]To view more of my work, you may also consult/ pour voir plus de mon travail, vous pouvez aussi consulter:FRAN: Bonjour! Je m'appelle David Gregham, et je suis un photographe français spécialisé dans le nu artistique masculin, en extérieur (principalement)... Actuellement basé à Paris, j'ai grandi sur la Côte d'Azur, dans les années 80, un lieu et une époque de GRANDE liberté!... [plus de détails dans ma bio, tout en haut de cette page, sous le titre et la photo de couverture, cliquez sur ""PLUS"" (et au-dessus des ""récompenses"", pour la version ordinateur)]ENGL: I am really happy to FINALLY be able to submit this project to you, because it has been building up in my mind for so many years!... This project is absolutely ESSENTIAL to me, as it is my very first coffee-table book, and a turning point in my career. In effect, a book, for me, represents the ultimate accomplishment, the consecration for a photographer... After many trying years, and several publishing companies mishaps, I decided to self-publish... I now just achieved the final layout, added poetry (and translated it into English!), found a great printing company, here in Paris, so now I need to get this thing going, and that is when YOU come into play, my friends! The goal seems high, but in fact it barely covers:I cannot make it without you!...And what if... let us dream a little, that number would ""explode"" and reach €26,000, or even €30,000, I could maybe buy myself a really great camera, with a couple lenses, to make new and even better photographs!...FRAN: Je suis très heureux de pouvoir ENFIN vous soumettre mon projet, car je l'ai à l'esprit depuis de nombreuses années!... Ce projet est absolument ESSENTIEL pour moi, car c'est mon premier album de photos, et un pivot dans ma carrière. En effet, un livre représente pour moi une consécration, un accomplissement ultime pour un photographe!... Après des années difficiles, et quelques mésaventures ""maisond'éditionnesques"", j'ai décidé de m'auto-produire... Je viens maintenant d'achever la mise en page finale, j'y ai inclus des quatrains (que j'ai aussi traduits en anglais), ai trouvé une belle imprimerie d'art, à Paris même, et maintenant, je dois continuer sur ma lancée, et c'est là que VOUS entrez en jeu, chers amis! L'objectif de la campagne peut paraître élevé, certes, mais en fait il couvre à peine: Je ne pourrai pas y arriver sans vous!...Et si, par bonheur, ce chiffre ""explosait"", soyons fous... à 26000 €, ou même 30000 €, cela m'aiderait sans doute à acheter un très bel appareil photo, un ou deux objectifs, pour faire de nouvelles, et d'encore plus belles photographies!...ENGL: Simply by choosing among the several rewards offered, or just by making a donation, you will be able to effectively contribute to make me reach my goal of €22,000! :-) Look at what I've prepared for you now:FRAN: En choisissant parmi les différentes récompenses proposées, ou bien en faisant une simple donation, vous m'aiderez efficacement à atteindre mon but de 22000 €! :-) Regardez un peu ce que je vous ai concocté:My first coffee-table book will contain 112 rich-colored pages with 20 gorgeous men (none of whom were models) of all origins and colors. It will feature frontal nudity, and poetry. It will be printed in France (a token of quality!), and greatly prefaced by Mr. Mark Henderson, American photographer of the male nude! Its dimensions will be 21x29,7 cm (~8x11 in), with a coated matte 170g/m² paper. If the fundraising goes well, it will be available also after the campaign, on my future Internet site and in a special bookstore in Paris, but of course at a higher price... The book will be available in its ""classic"" form, but also in a special limited edition, numbered and signed, uniquely through pre-order during the campaign! [THE ""DELUXE PACKAGE"", THE ""ULTIMATE PACKAGE"", and THE ""CONNOISSEUR'S PRIVILEDGE"" rewards]Mon premier album de photos comportera 112 pages richement colorées, avec une vingtaine de magnifiques hommes (dont aucun n'était modèle) de toutes origines et couleurs... Il y aura de la nudité frontale, et de la poésie (quatrains). Il sera imprimé en France (un gage de qualité!), et magnifiquement préfacé par M. Mark Henderson, illustre photographe américain de nu masculin! Ses dimensions seront de 21x29,7 cm, avec un papier couché mat à 170g/m². Si la levée de fonds se passe bien, le livre sera également disponible sur mon futur site Internet, et dans une librairie spéciale à Paris, mais, bien sûr, à un prix plus élevé... Le livre sera disponible en version ""classique"", mais aussi dans une ""édition de tête"", numérotée et signée, à pré-commander uniquement pendant la campagne! [récompenses THE ""DELUXE PACKAGE"", THE ""ULTIMATE PACKAGE"", et THE ""CONNOISSEUR'S PRIVILEDGE""]First released in 2011, the ""2012 Caribbean Men Calendar"" is a comprehensive collection of my earlier work (2009-2010), and features 12 hot nude men, genuinely Caribbean (I'm the only one in the world who EVER did this!), in wild tropical settings on five different islands. Please do not mind the fact that it is outdated: the ""calendar"" format was, then, just a mere pretext for the young unexperienced and unknown photographer that I was, to create a ""mini-book"", and introduce my photography to the world! :-) Dimensions: 20x30 cm (~ 8x12 in). 28 color pictures! Frontal nudity on almost every other page!... It is my very first professional production (also self-produced!) and holds a special place in my heart.

S'il-vous-plaît, ne vous arrêtez pas au fait qu'il ne soit plus d'actualité: le format ""calendrier"" était, à l'époque, pour le jeune photographe inexpérimenté et inconnu que j'étais, un simple prétexte pour créer un mini-livre, et présenter ma photographie au monde! :-) Dimensions: 20x30 cm. 28 photos couleur! Nudité frontale presque toutes les deux pages!... C'est ma première production professionnelle (auto-produite également!), et elle occupe une place à part dans mon coeur.

You will discover ALL there is to know about the hows, whats and whys of my first coffee-table book, Nature Men...If, before the 21 set days, I can reach my goal (€3000), it will help me finance 50 (fifty) deluxe books, and finally realize my dream of releasing this LONG-OVERDUE artistic achievement! To do it on such a small scale wasn't part of the plan at first, but such is life, sometimes, and we all must adapt to cope with the unexpected... So let's rejoice and make it happen, this time! And it's only the beginning!! I've got so many other surprises in store for you all :-)FRANÇAIS:Chers amis et followers,si nous sommes réunis ici aujourd'hui, c'est grâce à votre engagement et à votre enthousiasme pour mon projet de livre Nature Men!Pour ceux qui découvriraient à peine mon projet ou même tout simplement mon travail, je vous invite à faire un tour sur la page de ma première campagne Kickstarter, ici-même: https://bit.ly/2MD8sH1. Vous y découvrirez les tenants et aboutissants, et la genèse de mon premier album-photo Nature Men!...Si, avant les 21 jours fixés, j'atteins mon objectif (3000€), cela m'aidera à financer 50 (cinquante) exemplaires de luxe de mon livre, et réaliser mon rêve de produire enfin cette œuvre, cet accomplissement artistique, DE SI LONGUE DATE ATTENDU! De le faire à si petite échelle n'était pas prévu à la base, mais ainsi va la vie, parfois, et il faut savoir s'adapter et faire face aux imprévus... Alors réjouissons-nous, et rendons-le possible, cette fois-ci! Et ce n'est que le début!! J'ai beaucoup d'autres surprises pour vous!!! :-)ENGLISH:The campaign will be three weeks long. I REALLY want it to be over before Christmas, as promised! That way, I'll be able to send out all the books by early February, if everything goes smoothly...As a token of my gratitude, and to sort of ""make up"" for the fairly high-priced item in question, I decided to join a copy of my dear calendar (totally self-produced in 2011, fresh off the boat from Saint-Martin [West Indies] where I had spent 2 years), and which is, therefore, my little ""baby""... If there are any books left once the campaign is finished, well... they will be available til the last, on my future Internet site, but without the calendar, and at a higher price, that goes without saying... :-)FRANÇAIS:La campagne durera trois semaines. Je voudrais VRAIMENT terminer avant les fêtes de Noël, comme promis! Ainsi, je pourrai vous envoyer tous les livres vers la fin janvier/début février, si tout se passe bien...En signe de gratitude, et comme pour ""atténuer"" le prix quelque peu élevé de l'ouvrage en question, j'ai décidé d'y joindre un exemplaire de mon cher calendrier (totalement auto-produit, en 2011, à peine revenu de Saint-Martin [Antilles], où je venais de passer deux ans) et qui est, de ce fait, mon petit ""bébé""...S'il reste des livres une fois la campagne terminée, eh bien... ils seront disponibles, jusqu'à épuisement, sur mon futur site Internet, mais sans le calendrier, et plus chers, cela va sans dire... :-)","The only challenge that comes to my mind is the amount required for shipping and handling. I realize a majority of my audience is outside of Europe (and as far as Australia!), and in order to provide a good service with a nice and safe packaging plus a tracking number, it is, alas, a bit pricy... But I swear you will not regret it! I've put all my heart and sweat in this book! And it's a high-quality item that will gain even more value with time. You're making the right choice, and I want to thank you for it!"

https://www.kickstarter.com/projects/mikestickler/generous-life-radio-takes-flight?ref=discovery_category_newest,mikestickler/generous-life-radio-takes-flight,"Generous Life Radio started roughly 18 months ago as a fun Blogtalk Radio show to highlight individual people and full-blown ministries practicing ordinary and extraordinary generosity. We really didn’t know what we were doing. The show was too long, not very consistent at once a week (sometimes) and a bit scattered at first.  Nevertheless, the shows resonated with those who found the program. And WOW, did they find it! We had over 45K downloads and a loud cry for more! Honestly, we really didn’t know what to believe, thinking that somehow the reporting we were receiving was incorrect. Being a Christian-focused program, we called upon the leader of online radio programing OnePlace.com and asked for help. Along the way, they revealed how we could take our show and make it really fly. From their counsel, we cut the show to 25 minutes, began airing it 5 days a week, and we invested in having at least 30 pre-produced shows ready to air, all a requirement to induce sponsorships.  But, then our big break came. The big boys of Salem Media, the largest family-friendly talk show network, came knocking at our door and used the “s” word. Syndication. Now before us is an opportunity to air our show on hundreds and hundreds of stations over the next 12 months, telling the story of lives lived generously. Reaching an audience of nearly 60 Million listeners!We have all seen the shows Extreme Home Makeover and Undercover Boss.  Who doesn’t love these shows? What makes us different is we have tapped into ordinary and extraordinary people being generous everyday! Generous Life is built on the belief that God cares deeply about the generosity His children display. God has loved His children generously through the work of Jesus Christ; therefore we seek to reflect that generous love to each other and the world.Because the act of generosity is often thankless and difficult to live out, we desire people to be encouraged in their daily acts of generosity. We want to equip each other by sharing their stories—including both their triumphs along with the challenges. We pray that Generous Life will be a blessing to you as you seek to love one another with your generous life!This philosophy has attracted so many with stories to share.These shows spotlight fun, inspiring stories of what God is doing all over the world through His people. Examples of previous guests include Anne Belier, Founder of Auntie Anne Pretzels; Ron Luce, Teen Mania Ministries; Arch Bonnema, philanthropist; Mike Weaver of Big Daddy Weave; and many, many others. You can listen to it Here. Plus, you can find us on BlogTalk.com, iTunes, Spreaker, SoundCloud and iHeart. With these resources - plus your help - we can reach nearly 60 millionlisteners by the end of the year!""In his concise and potent guide to a generous life, Mike Stickler offers a very practical and biblically faithful tour of the fundamental principles of a life that invests in eternity by transmuting the lead of what is passing away into the gold of what will endure forever.""-Dr. Kenneth Boa""This devotional program has challenged me in a most refreshing way on my journey of learning to be ""generous on every occasion"". These daily readings are fantastic reminders to rely on the truth in God's Word and to be led by His Spirit in generous living!"" -Mike WeaverBig Daddy Weave, Christian recording artist""The church in America needs many things. A generous spirit and life is near the top of the list."" -Dr. John Jackson, President of William Jessup UniversityAuthor of six books on Transformational Leadership and Personal Renewal.""Generous Life tells you step by step how to find the joy, responsibility, challenges and rewards God has for giving generously. You will find it also gives you a happy heart when you think about giving!"" -Arch BonnemaPhilanthropist""The word ""generous"" originally had the meaning of a person from ""noble birth."" What it meant was that generous people were a cut above the crowd and because of their charity it seemed that they were from nobility. If you want to change your life and change the lives of others you need join Generous Life. And then watch as you change the world one day at a time."" -Mike Holmestithehacker.com""Discipling generous givers is one of the most pressing issues facing the church. Credible giving stats confirm that we need to recalibrate and evaluate what we’ve done and how to disciple generous givers more effectively.""Chris McDanielAuthor, Igniting a Life of Generosity","Most of all our production needs are in place. Outside of those, our biggest challenge is feeding this beast of 260 shows per year. What if we get sick, have a snow storm, or some other issue comes along where we can't produce? There are many external risks in producing five show per week.  The question is how do we mitigate this challenge?We have 30 top-notch shows already produced in to a 60 minute format. But, they need to be edited into 25-minute programs.  This means additional editing and studio time is needed by our producer. In part, that's where you come in. By producing 60-plus new programs, we are allowed a cushion of the extra time to book and schedule guests and produce the additional programing needed to get us up to full speed.",https://www.kickstarter.com/projects/mikestickler/cliven-bundy-american-patriot-the-next-edition?ref=discovery_category_newest,mikestickler/cliven-bundy-american-patriot-the-next-edition,"Sitting in Federal lock-up on a cold metal stool, I looked across the smooth stainless table that separated me from this aging, weathered man, Cliven Bundy. I asked him why he wanted his story told.He paused for a moment. Then looked me right in the eyes and smiled that big grin of his.“Ya know, I asked that same question to a reporter who was a pestering me for a interview,” he paused, reflecting on the moment. “You know what he said? ‘Some people love you and some people hate you, but they all want to know your story.’” He paused again, “I guess they are trying to figure out if I’m a terrorist.” He laughed.It was then I realized that Cliven Bundy’s story needed to be told. The book, Cliven Bundy American Patriot, is the true story of a man that has divided the West. His famous “Stand-off,” as reported by the media, has become a flashpoint with people who strongly believe in property rights and against government overreach.In opposition are the proponents of multi - land use and environmentalism. It’s also become hotly debated among those pitted against one another regarding what really happened in April of 2014, each holding on to his “own truth,” at times in complete disregard as to what actually happened during the 25-year battle Cliven Bundy has had with the power of the federal government. Biographer Michael Stickler delves deep into the life and beliefs of Cliven Bundy, spending 60 days in Federal lock-up with him, documenting Bundy’s view. Stickler also does exhaustive research into Bundy’s claims and the actual forces that moved to arrest the swelling discontent of American’s that began to follow the Bundy’s. One reader acclaimed:“I loved the book as everything I had read so far even by supporters of the Bundy family tended to have their own narrative and bias. This was just very factual and well researched and read as if Cliven himself was telling the story with all the documentation to prove what actually happened. Thank you so much, Michael, for your dedication to making the truth be known.” --Cynthia HStickler endeavors to treat Bundy fairly, telling the story of Bundy’s life without judgement, carefully balancing the facts of the actual happenings leading up to the “Standoff,” Bundy’s arrest, and the headline-making court decision. This decision dismissed all charges against Cliven Bundy after he spent nearly 700 days in prison.  Cliven Bundy American Patriot is fair, yet hard-hitting and well-researched, while holding nothing back from the life of Cliven Bundy. You’ll be shocked at the lengths the United States government will go to stop one man, a man who just wants to live his life on his own terms. You’ll understand the reasons Bundy took the actions he did. Then, you’ll be left to finally make a fully qualified determination:Is Cliven Bundy a Domestic Terrorist or an American Patriot?This book is not the typical book out on the supermarket rack or bookseller’s shelf. This book tells the story of real lives on the line … right now … today … in real peril. It’s not a dusty, old story about something that happened years ago – instead, you know that it is happening before our very eyes – even as its actual content is being so badly reported in the headlines, on social media, and on television. The vital stakes are high – not just for the 19 men unjustly imprisoned – but, for their wives and the 26 children who may be effectively or actually orphaned through their fight for our rights. So far, only one has given his life at the hands of the government. Besides the direct impact to these families, however, there are numerous ranchers, miners, hunters, countless other livelihood-stakeholders, AND YOU(!) who will be indirectly impacted if our public lands continued to be taken away from ""the people."" But more importantly, the story of Cliven Bundy is one in which every American has a stake. Cliven’s battle is about holding the Government accountable to the governed, a concept which is enshrined in the Constitution of The United States of America. Sadly, today’s government bureaucracy has a long history of reaching well beyond its boundaries, boundaries set by the Constitution, the law, and We The People. That is the story of Cliven Bundy; that is the story that needs to be told; and, with your help, here's how we are going to do it:1. With your help, we'll retain a nationally recognized Public Relations firm, whom we have already interviewed, who will work day and night to get the Nation’s attention focused on Cliven’s real story – by including coverage in:National conservative talk radio, magazines and newspapers, social media, local and national television.2. We will use search engine marketing and search engine optimization techniques to keep the book listed within the top five internet search responses to every search term so it will be presented right alongside the media stories. At least on the internet, the truth of Cliven's real story will have equal billing with the “news” that others are fabricating and reporting.3. With your funding help, we will ship a copy of Cliven’s book to Interior Secretary Ryan Zinke, every Congressman and Senator, and of course, to President Trump. As well, printed copies will be sent to reporters, commentators, educators and librarians who are open to the truth about Cliven’s cause.4. We want your help in supporting the grassroots efforts publicizing the truth, too. Countless men and women are keeping the truth alive by telling Cliven’s story daily. Risking it all, they have taken up Cliven’s fight and they need our encouragement in their determination to do this. We want to help them with merchandise that tells the story and similar ways of practical support.This effort is much more than just selling some books and t-shirts. It’s an effort to broadcast to the world what is happening in rural America; and it’s an effort to tell the government bureaucrats: No! Stop! … ENOUGH! This is an effort to restore the clearly stated intent of our Founding Fathers though the story of one man, Cliven Bundy.   Won’t you join us?","This isn’t our first rodeo. Michael Stickler, the author of ""Cliven Bundy American Patriot,"" has been writing and selling books for more than twenty years. An established author, Michael has both his publisher and distributor ready once-again to team-up, print, and ship books and promotional materials to a broad audience – immediately. The challenge, however, is piercing the brick wall created by today’s unholy alliance of the government bureaucracy’s wholly-fabricated narrative (which dismisses Cliven as a ‘gun-toting wacko’ and domestic terrorist) and a lazy and/or agenda-driven media that simply shouts this narrative’s sensationalism rather than doing the honest job the Fourth Estate should be doing – questioning! Who really IS Cliven Bundy? What does he actually stand for? What is the real issue here and how does it affect every American? … and why is Cliven, the only rancher left standing to challenge this half-century, broad government land-grab, risking everything (literally, his life, his fortune, and his sacred honor) to preserve our Constitutional rights?So, where are we – that is, you and I, in all of this?In essence, we need to sell this book – or, frankly, the truth of Cliven’s real story may never get to the American public and simply disappear into a history written by a land-grabbing, Constitution-ignoring government and its lazy media co-conspirators – along with your Constitutional rights.But, we believe that with your help and our marketing and production teams' we can keep the truth of Cliven’s real story from falling away unheard and unseen. Even in today’s hostile-to-the-truth media environment, with your help this book can ‘fly off the shelves’ and drive Cliven’s story into the consciousness of America. Producing anything at high-volume – let alone books and promotional products – poses many problems. But, after more than 20 years of keeping dozens of American workers and vendors employed to produce and deliver his books and materials, Michael’s track record is clear: these dedicated workers ship complete orders on time, every time!In addition, we are able to provide world-class customer service to our backers ... even in the publishing industry, one not traditionally thought of as having customer service at all.We are not starting from square one: •	We are still working with the production team who has supported us for years – and together, we’ve cut the trouble spots ruthlessly to bring our product to the market (and into America’s hands) very quickly. •	True, we’ve never sold promotional materials like t-shirts and hoodies (up until now, we've only sold books); but, we're confident that with our new team members (who are experts at it in their own right) we can pull these items’ production and delivery off, too. •	And we are confident that with your help, we can raise the America’s consciousness to the importance of the real issue at stake and its real truth."

Unfortunately it's a rich man's world and I need the first print run crowd funded to get going and show evidence of sales to re-pitch the book to stores.About the book: I've put so much effort into the functionality and design of this book, the images to colour in are based on digital artworks I've created and am currently working on a sequel which contains paintings I've created. This has been years in the making. The average colouring in book in any store you pop into is based on a cartoon character that's currently relevant, flowers, fairytales or other average topics. The colouring book I've created is nothing like that! - Greyed out lines so the user can feel like their final image looks actually drawn! - Spiral bound so the user can lie it flat without effort. - Reference images on the left, either to use as a guide or use as they wish! - 1mm covers so children can colour on a solid surface when they're on the go. -inspiring images.What the funds will be used for: I'll be printing 1,000 copies in order to get this project started. The book is 54 pages, 100gsm uncoated recycled white paper with a 1mm cover and spiral binding. 1k copies is enough to make the first round of sales and purchase then kick off the second bundle then slowly make a business and series out of this!The final product will be $25AUD each.Why do I need funding? I'm super indépendant and was hoping to present the product professionally to stores and hopefully one would pick it up. I'm finding that there's a bit of a 'catch 22' going on. Department stores are declining the item due to being full and book stores are declining the item based on the fact I'm self published. I've approached publishers and the few that accept colouring books aren't interested in representing my book unless I'm represented by a manager.I won't be giving up and now have a clear idea about how to continue. I will stay self-published and print the copies and sell them in every way Ifind possible, markets, online, via insta etc. My timeline for a turnaround is roughly 4 months I'm aiming to get the first turn around in 2 months.What will this mean to me? A dream come true.Artists may be able to relate when they're told they don't have a ""real"" career. Last year I tried for a few months to rally artists to open up an unearthed store with me although I found that less than 1/10 were willing to put any money toward building their career. This is where I differentiate, I'm willing to put in the work and time to build a business out of my art. Unfortunately, I need crowd funding at this point.The artworks I create and are used in the book will genuinely inspire the youth of today, hopefully building a new social construct on art being a ""real"" career prospect. I'd love to become a good example for this.","Honestly, there's a risk that I don't sell the items as fast as 2 months which is my aim.The challenge I'm finding so far is getting the product in stores. I believe that after I physically sell the product myself and test all the sales channels then I can go back to the stores that have currently turned me down and present to them the real numbers.Right now I don't find a challenge too tough selling cheap items, this item includes a range of my digital artworks which people don't want to pay hundreds for and also give the consumer entertainment. I believe that I can source some marketing via my insta.I'll be making the first initial sales at a market I have my eye on and we all know that's not an easy task.I've had experience marketing my freelancing, then marketing my art 2 years later.

After the last campaign didn't reach it's goal I (literally) didn't waste a second in relaunching it with some tweaks.(I was listening to ""What are you waiting for"" - gwen stefani)One hell of a colouring in book!I've put so much effort into the functionality and design of this book, the images to colour in are based on digital artworks I've created and am currently working on a sequel which contains paintings I've created. This has been years in the making.The average colouring in book in any store you pop into is based on a cartoon character that's currently relevant, flowers, fairytales or other average topics. The colouring book I've created is nothing like that! Build your skills in shading and attention to detail then show off your fantastic images to everyone! - Greyed out lines so the user can feel like their final image looks actually drawn! - Spiral bound so the user can lie it flat without effort. - Reference images on the left, either to use as a guide or use as they wish! - 1mm covers so children can colour on a solid surface when they're on the go. -inspiring images.I bet you can do a much more wow-worthy colouring in effort, although the below shows the potential for even little effort.This book has had it's journey, if you've watched 'Joy' then it's the main character ""mop"" that stores wouldn't take. As it stands now (imagine COVIC-19 didn't happen) the stores won't invest because I'm not backed by a publisher and publishers won't back it either because (depending on who you go to) I'm not represented by an agent or just don't accept colouring in books in general. I plan on eventually getting the book into stores after plenty of hard work and results to show in my next presentation.The last campaign I ran intended to raise $7,000AUD for 1,000 copies. This campaign has a much smaller budget which could get me anywhere from 200+ copies (the more bulk order, the more value you get). I'm not sure how the pandemic will affect the purchase cost in a months time although the goal is to sell enough to afford a larger print run, and then after the second print run I'll be able to make some income off the book.Fortunately Australia really is ""the lucky country"" (I'm super grateful) and my printer is still in business! It looks like the lockdown measures will stay stable for the campaign to successfully run and send you all some entertainment! Unfortunately, if you've watched the end of the video, my marketing tactics will have to change and be 99% online which makes this campaign different.I still have the goal to get it into stores although I need to take baby steps. Firstly I'll sell it here, next I'll sell it online, after that hopefully the pandemic will be over and I'll sell it in any physical manner that I can by opening stalls and partnering with small shops (I have one potentially lined up). After that, which could realistically take a year or two, I'll then propose my stats to stores again with sound knowledge of my costs, and sales which will give me much more of a chance to go mainstream.The final product will be $25AUD each.Follow future artworks on my insta! @miss_vanessaness","Honestly, there's a risk that I don't sell the firs print run as fast as 2 months which is my aim.

https://www.kickstarter.com/projects/worldtraveller/the-adventure-photo-challenge-prints-project?ref=discovery_category_newest,worldtraveller/the-adventure-photo-challenge-prints-project,"In April, 2013 I embarked on a dangerous and ambitious solo adventure to ride from Kalbarri, Australia to Tallinn, Estonia. The project is called The Adventure Photo Challenge - from Australia to Estonia and was supported by Kickstarter Pledgers. From your interest in professional photography and storytelling, I'd documented the experience from start to finish with the ultimate goal of creating a book.The project cost over $100,000 AUD. It took 12 months to prepare and 18 months to complete. The 35,000 km journey passed through South East Asia, Nepal and India, the Central Middle East, and ended in Europe.The cornerstone of the project was its focus on including the audience in the experience. Through honest writing about the people and places, and by expressing the truth of how it made me feel, supporters felt involved in the happiness and sadness along the way.Fortnightly update articles; Facebook progress updates; a sophisticated live GPS tracking system; and Photo Challenges, were all part of the project and the immersive experience.Most interestingly to people, they were able to buy photo challenges. This gave supporters the ability to challenge me to take a one-off photograph for them. The rules for challenges were simple. Provided the challenge wasn't too dangerous, too illegal, or too costly, I'd do it, even if it changed where I'd travel.From an initial audience of just 75 people, that number grew to over 13,000 worldwide.With over 30,000 images taken and 37 articles published, the project was a profound success exceeding the expectations of all those involved. A collection of adventure photographs, and the complete list of update articles can be viewed here at www.adventurephotochallenge.com. Having reached the end of the journey it became obvious that an important element of the project was missing...Prints! People from all over have shown interest in purchasing canvas or fine art prints for personal enjoyment in their home or office. However, not only do I want to provide extremely cheap, ultra high quality, large format prints, but also carefully created professional print pieces for project exhibitions.It is here where I once again need your support. The Adventure Photo Challenge - Printing Project needs approx. $5,000 AUD to start-up. This covers the costs of:The products described above are some of the most technologically advanced, industry leading, professional printing systems on the market. The quality of the prints are expected to be comparable to the best printing services in the world, but at a significantly lower unit cost.To ensure you are able to enjoy a prolonged lowered printing cost, I have included a free membership to those pledging $30 or more. This membership will allow you to print your own images later, at the same price, for one year; the locked in price will only be applicable to the rewards you supported.What you're really supporting is an important progression in The Adventure Photo Challenge story.

As a professional project manager in mining industries and The Adventure Photo Challenge - from Australia to Estonia, I intend to use strict management on times and costs to ensure this window is not lost.Most delays are imagined to be around receiving the equipment off the shelf; learning how to use it properly; receiving your print selection and media type; printing the pieces; and then postage and shipment. Its fairly straight forward.",https://www.kickstarter.com/projects/worldtraveller/the-book-the-adventure-photo-challenge?ref=discovery_category_newest,worldtraveller/the-book-the-adventure-photo-challenge,"In April, 2013 I embarked upon a dangerous and ambitious solo adventure to ride a KTM motorcycle from Kalbarri, Australia to Tallinn, Estonia.The project was calledThe Adventure Photo Challenge - from Australia to Estoniaand it was supported by many people and businesses interest in photography and storytelling. I documented the experience from start to finish with the ultimate goal of creating a book.From an initial audience of just 75 people, that number grew to over 13,000 worldwide. Altogether, it took 12 months to prepare the project and another 16 months to complete. The 35,000 km journey passed through Australia, South East Asia, Nepal and India, the Central Middle East, and ended in Northern Europe. All said and done, the total cost of the project was over $100,000 USD.The cornerstone of the Kickstarter project was focused on including the audience in the experience. Through honest writing about the people and places, and by expressing how it made me feel, supporters were invited to share in the happiness and sadness along the way.Most interestingly to people, photo challenges gave supporters the ability to challenge me to take a one-off photograph for them. The rules for challenges were simple. Provided theyweren'ttoo dangerous, too illegal, or toocostly, I’d do it, even if it changed where I traveled.Now with the project completed, I am aiming to produce the book privately in low volume and ultra high quality. My intention is to find an Australian publisher to back its commercial release, but until that happens, this once off private print run will become a bespoke and collectible version for anyone interested in the personal side of the story.My version of the book will be different from a publishers version so this is your chance to read what I felt more raw and unfiltered.Here are a few pages from inside the book:There are two types of rewards offered, the electronic or the hardcopy version of the book.+$20AUD: The PDF eBookThe PDF eBook is the exact same version as the hardcopy but in electronic form. This version would best be viewed from a large computer monitor in high resolution. It can be read using a mobile device but the writing, photography, and layout are optimised for PC screens.+$60AUD: The Hardcopy BookThe hardcopy book is a massive +340 pages of graphically designed writing and photography. The dimensions are large landscape format 300mm (width) x 230mm (height). The paper is high quality photographic paper with a density of 170 grams per square meter, making the book almost 3kgs heavy. The hardcover is bound using high end glues and is wrapped in a designed cover sleeve.The heavy weight of this book has between $10-15 AUD additional postage charges. Special Rewards:If you recommend or share the Kickstarter project with friends and family, then you can win a free copy of the hardcopy book. Every time 5 people purchase the book by referrals, I will draw a winner from the names given. That's a pretty decent 1 in 5 chance!To be eligible to win the following conditions apply:If you can get 5 people to buy the book through referral I'll also give a free copy anyway.","The Adventure Photo Challenge book has already been written and is currently at the fifth review stage. A printing house has been chosen and the prices and timing for production established. All that remains to be completed is the final review process and to physically print the book for supporters.UPDATE: Shipping is a huge cost which exceeds the price of printing, I might have to sea freight the books which will increase the delay by 2 months (ETA JULY)"

It has been four years in development and is now fully tested and ready to go. But it needs your help to become a reality...£50,335 is required to kick-start the project, and is broken down as follows:- £13,800 injection moulding tools to produce BLOCK- £10,665 first production run of just over 30,000 BLOCKS to provide enough to give out to our backers- £19,225 postage of BLOCKS to our backers- £6,645 selling fees & taxesIf you support the project, you will be the first to own and use this fantastic product in your homebrew! Only £5 plus postage and you receive 3 BLOCKS, which is about the same price as an airlock and bung in the shops! Once established, BLOCK will be cheaper than the current price of a bung & airlock, saving you money on future brews.Many thanks in advance for your support, and if you have any questions please get in touch!","BLOCK has been four years in development, and has been tested successfully with various brews (recently we made some good plum wine and wheat beer batches)! Once the injection moulding tool has been commissioned and made, the samples produced by the tool will be tested further and any minor adjustments to the tool can be made if necessary. Then an initial production run of around 30,000 BLOCKS will be ordered and posted out to our backers.

I have always been fascinated by creation stories and beautifully-illustrated books for children. Grandfather Thunder & The Night Horses is my own contribution to those themes. Your pledge will help make this project come to fruition.A year ago, I started working on some illustrations for a story I had been toying with. I'd already created a story for my son and wanted one for my daughter. I remembered how scared she was of thunder storms when she was little. Combining that idea with my passion for my Native American heritage (Blackfeet Sioux and Onondaga Iroquois), I created Grandfather Thunder & The Night Horses.The story, loosely based on the Lakota legend of the Thunder Horses, is told by a grandmother calming her granddaughter's fear of a raging storm. It is the story of life. It is a story of love. The book is fully-illustrated in bold, vibrant watercolor and ink and written in both English and Lakota through assistance from the Lakota Language Initiative in Pine Ridge, South Dakota and permission from the tribal elders. Now I'd like to share the story with all of you.With your pledge, I'll be able to publish this book as an 8.5"" x 10.5"" hardbound book with a dust jacket and coated matte paper with 32 pages of illustrations. A portion of the profits will go to the children of the Pine Ridge Reservation school (in South Dakota) as requested by the Lakota Language Initiative.The pledges come with rewards, of course, like high quality prints, illustrated thank you cards, and even original illustrations from the book!For this project, the goal is to cover the costs of printing and shipping of the first edition, plus the reward delivery based on pledge amounts. I must also cover the crowdfunding fees associated with a successful campaign and marketing (let's face it, no one can do this alone). As mentioned above, I made a promise to send books to the Lakota children for their school in exchange for the invaluable help of the Lakota Language Initiative in translating the manuscript.The projected breakdown as follows:Publishing Goal: $3,000*Reward Fulfillment covers shipping costs in the US and abroad, costs for printing and delivery of specified reward items, and my materials (paper, paint...)With campaigning, printing, shipping, and processing, I'm expecting this project to be completed by September. Shipping will be by USPS or UPS, whichever service is more financially efficient depending upon destination.I am very excited about this book and hope you will be as well!STRETCH GOALS!!When our goal of $3,000 is reached, I will do a free school visit within a 2-hour drive of Grantham, NH. Supporters can nominate schools (with the school's permission, please!), and a winner will be chosen at random. School visit will be for the 2017-18 school year and in arrangement with mine and the school's schedule.If I hit $2,000 over the original goal, I will make that a free school visit anywhere in the continental US (school permission, please and in arrangement with mine and the school's schedule).","All illustrations are complete, as well as the story, text, and translations.I have selected a publishing company and they are ready to go! The only thing I need to do is work with their art department to finalize fonts and the cover (all artwork is done).The main risk, barring an act of God or unforeseen illness, would be any unforeseen printing or shipping delays. While not likely, it is possible as with any project. I will provide updates as the process evolves.Please remember, this is all or nothing. If funds are not collected, the project does not proceed and the story will be silent. Thank you for your support."

Whether its environmental issues, social change, political movements or developments in the arts or cultural events; we remain resourceful and meticulous throughout. Choke is an open discussion, a fight for the underdog and a thought from outside the box.Our Contributors, Photographers, Writers and Talents, are game changers and frontrunners. Challenging the conventional, we bring our readers/followers exciting subject matter, awe inspiring imagery and unique design.We believe that each issue should feel like a collectors item. Therefore each issue is curated with a set theme from which we commission 6 unique Photographers to produce a 6-8 page story for our zine. Along with the main body of work, we would like to feature 3 key interviews with people that we feel are important to the theme of the issue. This could be anyone from environmental activists to musicians, politicians or tech innovators!When we go to print and launch the issue we want to do something a little different and hold an exhibition for Artists. This would be a great opportunity to sell the Zine and showcase exhibited works from the Contributors.","SUMMARYThe risk of starting a new publication is to facilitate enough revenue to continually publish and grow the business into a successful international enterprise.  Once the foundations of the magazine are set, it is easier to broaden horizons into advertising, events and creative direction, which we forecast in 5 years time.Some people might say it is crazy to start a new publication when most magazines are in decline, however the industry is making a steady comeback with independent publishing and special interest magazines. Therefore, it is important to keep Choke Zine as a niche market and retain its unique selling point as a limited edition 'art object'. We also want the publication to be tied to a reoccurring pop up exhibition for the launch of each issue. This is important because it creates an ethos for the Zine and broadens the creative network for future endeavours. It is also vital to maintain a social media feed through Instagram that is exciting and captivates our followers. We would intend to update 2-3 times a week with stories, artists, and features that we feel are relevant to our audience and our driving aesthetic. INTIAL FUNDING COSTS FOR ISSUE 1 (September 2020)1. a) 1000 copies for Issue 1 - 80% of the budget for our kickstarter fund  and we will need to reach our goal of selling all 1000 copies in order to produce the next issue. backup funds could be achieved through online membership in return for digital copies of the Zine. We could potentially hold fundraiser events between issues and sell at book/magazine fairs.b) Building a working relationship with established printers to keep costs, whilst we expand capacity and broaden our spectrum of printing capabilities.2. Event space for Choke Zine launch - 10% of the overall funding. We aim to have the space open in Manhattan for a week to increase sales and build our audience.3.

The Casual Cat Cafe plans to offer customers the unique experience of a lazy afternoon at home with tasty food and beverages and a sweet fluffy cat companion at your side. We will have two distinct portions of our business, a cafe and a cat lounge. The cafe will offer tasty food and beverage selections and will also offer many cat accessories and cat themed items such as clothing, accessories, and locally sourced art and crafts for sale. The cat lounge will be a relaxing atmosphere where you can sit with and play with cats that are also available for adoption. We feel this setting provides the best possible way for a customer to get to know a potential new member of the familyA Cat Cafe is a space that combines a cat adoption facility with a place to hang out, enjoy food, beverages, and the company of cats! All of the cats are free roaming, meaning they are not confined to cages, and are also adoptable. So if you happen to meet that purrfect kitty at the cat cafe, you can adopt them as a permanent family member!Everybody! Many different people are drawn to Cat Cafes as they offer such a unique and adorable experience. This includes people who love cats but:Of course, Cat Cafes are also the best way to find a cat if you are looking to adopt one into your home. This is because the Cat Cafe setting allows you to really see and experience a cat's personality.A Cat Cafe offers the community a public space to hang out in and relax. You can come and enjoy the food and drinks while curled up with a cat, bring a group of friends and catch up or play a board game. Need a place to study or read a book? What better place then while relaxing with a cat. We plan to stock our cat lounge with many different books and games all about cats!Cats are social creatures but many cats in shelters spend the majority of their day alone and without human touch. A cat cafe provides an enriching environment to keep the cats active. The cats will also be able to get as much love and attention from people as they want! We will also have a private cat area not open to the public in case a cat decides they need some alone time away from people.Cat Cafes offer many benefits to the community. The obvious benefit is for the cats who will enjoy comfortable surroundings as they wait to be adopted. A Cat Cafe also benefits the community by providing a public space to hang out by yourself, with friends, or catch up on some reading or homework all in the company of cats. Cats also provide many health benefits. For example, petting cats creates a calming effect and reduces stress and anxiety, and lowers blood pressure. Also, exposure to cats results in increased resistance to allergens, decreasing risk for developing allergies and asthma. These benefits from Cat Cafes are especially important for people who may not be able to have a cat at home.We are a husband and wife cat-saving team, John and Cindy! We have three cats of our own (as represented in our logo) and have been involved with cat fostering and rescue since 2008. During that time we have probably fostered well over a hundred cats as they try and find their forever home. Cindy is also involved in a national deployment-rescue organization. She is deployed to help out in animal welfare situations caused by natural disasters, hoarding situations, and puppy-mill cases.Our love for cats started when adopting our first cat together, Kitten. She is a silver Egyptian Mau mix. A couple years into fostering we came across Nice Guy. He is a black DSH who came to the rescue in bad shape with a broken pelvis and a larger area of skin and hair rubbed raw on his side and legs. He had a very difficult time at adoptions even though he was such a sweet kitty at home. We also noticed how nice and loving he was with new foster kittens. We decided he had found his forever home with us! Sweet Pea is our brown tortoise shell feral. She was trapped by a local woman who had been feeding her and noticed she was pregnant. We volunteered to foster her through her pregnancy and help adopt out her kittens into good loving homes. After her kittens were raised, Sweet Pea was spayed and ear tipped as she was a feral cat and planned to be re-homed to a barn. However, we fell in love with her sweet nature and realized in the time she spent living in our home she actually became scared of the outdoors and would stay very far away from any open exterior doors, so we decided she could just join our family! We don't see her too much and she will never be a lap cat (still too much feral in her) but she is our Sweet Pea!All funds received through Kickstarter will be used in the build-out of the perfect space! Due to local health code we are required to install a costly but beneficial ventilation and HVAC system which will be a significant expense. Additional funds will be used for the build out and furnishing of the cafe and cat lounge.","The cat cafe concept is new to the U.S. which poses a challenge as cities do not currently have ordinances and zoning in place for such a use. We have been in touch with several city planning departments and health departments in the DFW area to ensure open communication and that we are following all necessary rules. However, as this is new territory for us and the city we open in, this will be a learning process for both. We also risk a failed Kickstarter campaign which could delay or greatly impact the ability to open and be able to serve the DFW area. Ultimately we are counting on the support of our community of cat lovers to help make The Casual Cat Cafe a reality. We are advertising on Facebook and have reached out to several news organizations to help spread the word. However, a failed kickstarter campaign would indicate to us that there may not be enough interest to support a unique business like a cat cafe.Another challenge we face is finding the perfect location for the cat cafe!

Finally, we love our cafe cats and want to ensure their complete safety after hours so we would love to be able to install a detailed security and alarm system. We set our goal at a level we think we can meet and which should cover the cost of renovation and security. What's left will be used on furnishings and supplies for both the cat lounge and cafe. All funds raised in excess of our goal will be put back into the business in the way of better selection of cat toys, equipment, and furnishings for our cats and guests to enjoy.","The cat cafe concept is still new to the U.S. which poses a challenge as cities do not currently have ordinances and zoning in place for such a use.

These new dramatics works will all be based on the life experience of people from under-served communities.

The GYM is a program that provides local playwrights with the opportunity to workshop new work.  GYM playwrights are area professionals who are given various resources to help further their work. These resources include rehearsal space, collaboration with a director to assist the playwright, marketing, and public events supported by the theatre.  The GYM’s goal is to nurture new work in a safe environment, provide the “exercise” equipment needed to develop new plays by these Cleveland-area writers.

In 2014 I was asked to write a one-person play about a person in the Cleveland community who had been marginalized. Immediately I thought of someone who was a great help to me when I was researching the heroin plays I’d written previously. I had met him at an opiate town hall meeting in Lake County. I had interviewed him several times and he was always available to meet and answer questions whenever I called. He wasn’t only a source to help my research, over the years he had become my friend. I couldn’t think of a person with a more important story to tell. At that point he was eight years clean. His story shows that while recovery is extremely daunting, there is hope. This play could put a real face on the issue.  My friend agreed to meet several more times so I could interview him at a more in-depth level. As I wrote drafts of the play, I’d call upon him again and again for one “final” interview and he would generously answer any questions to help me better understand the truth of his story. While I had to adapt some of the events to make it function as a night of theatre (including the structure of the play, of a man making a video about how to be a respectable junkie) the idea of an addict’s plan to commit suicide is authentic. For me, as the playwright, writing this play was about theatre doing its ultimate job – serving the community.SYNOPSIS:A heroin addict in his thirties decides he’s going to take his life so he no longer has to destroy the lives of those around him. But before doing so, he decides to make a video for heroin users everywhere instructing them on how to be respectable junkies, because even he has grown weary of their behavior. HOW TO BE A RESPECTABLE JUNKIE takes an in-depth look into the troubled soul of a man caught in heroin’s deadly grip. Based on real-life events, JUNKIE is at once eye-opening, heartbreaking, full of humor, and ultimately hopeful.","Dobama Theatre is mounting this show as an additional summer show as part of the 16/17 Season. The challenges of undertaking a full production near the end of the season are real - both financially and in terms of the time and energy of staff. Support for this production will go towards production costs, programming around this important play, and to help assure that the production does not lose money for the theatre at the critical time of the end of the fiscal year."

We'd really like to over-provide in this area and unfortunately it can be expensive.PeopleAny extra funds we receive past our goal will go into hiring engineers and designers to make the builder better.","This isn't our team's first rodeo and the risks and challenges faced are minimal.We have already developed , built and tested the back-end of the web builder and at the moment have already built the front-end too.Now the team is working on testing all the platform and designing new awesome templates.We'll keep you posted along the way with new features, templates updates and much more!",https://www.kickstarter.com/projects/56963604/new-drag-n-drop-mobile-app-creator?ref=discovery_category_newest,56963604/new-drag-n-drop-mobile-app-creator,"Dear users:This is the second campaign funding we started our project, because the initial campaign was not raised sufficient funds we had expected.However, we have continued to work hard because our team believes it is a worthwhile project. Therefore sacrificing much of our precious time (forgiveness for our families), we have continued to develop on our own so that the platform can be launched with minimal funds. We managed to halve the necessary funds to launch the website and make sure it's something profitable and viable for our users.Without further here we leave you with our intro letter:The idea was born among us, a group of friends dedicated to app design and development; we felt we needed a service that would allow small creators without many resources but with many ideas, edit and publish mobile apps in a simple and inexpensive way.We started to develop some sketches of what we could offer to small developers and we realized it was important to support this idea by creating an open community where users could share ideas and knowledge between them.So we got down to work and after being users of multitude platforms of app creators, we decided to implement an app generator for mobile and tablet applications with a simple drag and drop system. Our main application generator uses the power of Mobiblocks API as backend, and we complement it with new features and templates to our users.So our main goal is to offer all our users all possible resources so that they can develop their ideas without being expert programmers, offering simple but powerful tools.The platform is based on a monthly subscription model for new users once it is launched. Users who support us in financing on Kickstarter campaign will receive the number of accounts they decide on their reward, for life and without any additional payment.Users of the platform will have access to all the tools from our website. Initially, the project was the Drag n 'Drop App Builder, but thanks to the support of our users and their comments and suggestions will be implemented more services in order to create a true COMMUNITY dedicated to app developers.What will include the platform (this part depends on the reached strecht goals, go to the bottom to see them updated):- Drag n' Drop App Builder, powered by Mobiblocks backend and with a lot of new Temaplates and Features designed by our team (funding successful!).- Drag n' Drop Website Builder, powered by IMCreator, including a large selection of templates and UNLIMITED hosting (funding successful!).- Community Forum, this will serve for many functions: support, help, collaboration between users, creating projects, resources, applications, etc. (funding successful!).- 2.0 Drag n' Drop App Builder, powered by SiberianCMS, designed to allow our users to work directly on their phones or tablets (funding successful!).And now we leave you with all the operational details of the tools that will have our platform:Our mission is to help companies and individuals create professional iPhone, Android and Amazon applications easily using a drag and drop system.This is why we decided to use a Mobiblocks backend and personalize the experience to our users with new templates and features, that can not be found anywhere else.With our new platform you don't need to be an Xcode expert, a Java guru or a software developer to build your own mobile app. Simply choosing a template, easily edit and format the content, and then adding pictures and multimedia files.Our web based platform will allow anyone to create amazing mobile apps without any programming skill and without sacrificing functionality.Just take a look at the early version of the editor:As you can see there is no code at all, only simply buttons to add and format your content. This creation environment allows anyone to quickly and easily create a gorgeous mobile application with superior functionality.The future platform will be based on a monthly subscription with different prices depending on the number of created apps. Our Kickstarter supporters will have a LIFETIME account without any more payments.Once you have entered the web platform, you can choose among more than 200 templates that we have developed or just start from scratch.1- Choose from one of our great templates or start from a blank template and choose your platform:2- You can choose your app tabs style from this options:3- On the next screen you will be able to choose the style for your app and color squemes:4- And finally you will access to your app control panel, where you can edit the content and all the features you need: Someone said Games?? Yes! You will be able as well to publish games on iOS and Android. We currently have more than 15 games developed and working on more. Just need to change some graphics and/or sounds and publish, keep it simple!     Here you can see some examples of available games templates:The funds provided by our backers, will be used to test the front-end, to add more features and templates (this native features and templates will allow for the quick and easy creation of mobile applications!) and deply additional tools as the community and Resources Forum, the Drad n' Drop Web Builder and the 2.0 App Creator.As you know, this is our second attempt to raise the project. The most part of the job has been done by our team. It has been several months of hard work! We have lowered our numbers just to launch the project and start to enjoy with our users.Also, we need to funding for hosting and servers that support the user's cloud contents.","This isn't our team's first rodeo and the risks and challenges faced are minimal.We have already developed , built and tested the back-end of the app builder and at the moment have already built and tested the front-end too.Now the team is working on adding more templates (for any type of business and more games), install new stretch goals tools and testing the synchronized building on iOS and Android.We'll keep you posted along the way with new features, templates, tools and much more!"

Recently, we've fallen on hard times, and have been forced to pursue new options for supplemental income. I won't go into any sob stories - because negativity is never good! Wash away those bad vibes!Instead, let us focus on the positives and the fantastic reasons behind this project! These scrubs and body products come from ingredients right in my home - though with your help, I hope to expand to even more deliciously exciting ingredients! All of my scrubs are entirely edible (I'm not telling you to eat them, of course- because think of the sugar high!) and include animal and child (and adult!) friendly ingredients from Sugar to organic Extracts and some elements in between to give them some extra zing!I have been making these fun lip and body scrubs for some time, and have been known to give them as fabulous gifts to friends or family. The idea came to me that perhaps someone out there might enjoy them, also - so here we are!The goal is simple and reasonable, I know times can be tough for everyone and I do not wish to be greedy when there are so many other wonderful projects in addition to mine! I reach for enough to purchase more ingredients for the scrubs, as well as more to expand my offerings! Any and all supplies would be covered if my goal is met, from jars and packaging to ingredients and giving back to the community!What makes my project so special? I would like to pledge to donate 20 jars of my sugar scrubs to local women's shelters for meeting my goal - with an additional amount to be donated in a stretch goal. There are many worthy places here that assist women in getting back on their feet, and I would love to offer some light to these women.

https://www.kickstarter.com/projects/gianteye/little-spaceman-lamp?ref=discovery_category_newest,gianteye/little-spaceman-lamp,"What this is:I'm raising money to start a production line of these demure, contemplative little lamps. I sculpted this spaceman after he became a recurrent theme of my sketchbooks and just had to get him out of my head. I want to get a mold professionally made of the sculpture, make duplicates, design and print my own custom packaging, and create a limited series for anyone to purchase.You can see an awesome video by designer See Ming Lee hereYou can see more photos of the little spaceman hereWho I am:I'm Matthew Borgatti (Portfolio / Facebook / Flickr / Twitter / Vimeo) and I like to make things.What it's about:I once had the opportunity to work with NASA engineers designing new concepts for returning to the moon. I learned from them a certain awe and respect for the monumental task of solving the problems of space. Every object taken into space is designed, planned, weighed, and engineered to the finest degree of detail. Every person is scrutinized and trained to the limits of human endurance. And yet the biggest battle in exploring the near reaches of the cosmos seems to be against the waning public interest. Space travel no longer thrills and inspires most people. Without this enthusiasm there is no longer the budget for ambitious plans like bringing astronauts to Mars. With the failures of Challenger, Colombia, Soyuz, the massive expense and minimal scientific progress incurred by the Shuttle missions, the botched installation resulting in a myopic Hubble telescope, the future of human beings in space is tenuous. When you consider that each probe and robot we've launched at Mars has had a less than a fifty percent chance of reaching its target it seems like our technology needs some time to mature before we're setting foot on a Martian surface.This makes me think of a generation, just a few decades away from our first extraterrestrial walk, that will grow up and possibly grow old without seeing another spaceman. As robotic technology develops we are able to test and estimate the effects of zero gravity on systems without the need for a human operator. We won't need another astronaut. We're running out of experiments that people can do in orbit. It makes me think of the last person out of the ISS, turning off the lights as she goes. It seems as though as we look around our planet the near horizon of space is too near, and the far horizon of Mars is too far. I can't imagine how that last cosmonaut will feel.I made this sculpture in response to those feelings.Where you come in:I'd like to raise $2500 to pay for molding, materials, casting, packaging, promotion, and shipping to try and reach as many people as I can with this sculpture. I have an artist lined up to make a mold for me to the tune of $650. I will have enough money left to make 30-50 castings. Each person that sponsors me at the $250 level and above will get a sculpture. If I reach my funding goal without having reserved each of the sculptures I will sell the rest. If there is substantial interest in the project after the first run have all been claimed I may create additional runs.Here's what you get:$5 - I will tweet your praises on http://twitter.com/gianteye$25 - I'll send you a nice postcard featuring the lamp and also praise you on the interwebs$100 - Everything above as well as a 20% discount on a lamp once the final version arrives$250 - ONE FREE LAMP$1000 - To the generous person who pledges a thousand dollars to the cause I will send a personally hand painted model with my utter and sincere thanksEveryone gets access to the production blog where I will post details on the process of making, molding, casting and selling these awesome little lamps so other folks with similar ambitions can take advantage of what I learn.",,https://www.kickstarter.com/projects/gianteye/the-anywhere-organ?ref=discovery_category_newest,gianteye/the-anywhere-organ,"I'm Matthew Borgatti. I make and build and do and teach and tinker. Over the last year I've built a huge mobile pipe organ out of salvaged organ parts. It's called the Anywhere Organ. I've got almost 50 pipes running through an electronic system that can be played by anything from a keyboard to a laptop to a cell phone through a simple MIDI interface.Now, It's time to scale everything up into the room shaking, space filling, world touring monster I've been dreaming of.Since its first twinkling moment this sculpture has been about replicating all the most incredible aspects of pipe organs: the way they fill a space with sound, how the instrument and the building that houses it are all part of the same sonic system playingeach other, how beautiful the pipes are when seen rank upon rank together, how they can mix different voices and instruments together to create complex other-worldly sounds. The crucial difference between your ordinary run-of-the-mill organ and the Anywhere Organ is that the Anywhere Organ can be brought anywhere, turning any space into a cathedral of sound.Since church organs are fading out, steadily being replaced by digital music systems, it's become easy to find salvaged organ parts. I've created a design that can easily be scaled to fit any collection of pipes from any organ. That means I can integrate pipes from hundreds of different derelict organs into one complete instrument.I'd like to make the Anywhere Organ as large, beautiful, and easy to play as possible. I'd like to create elaborate installations that make music in response to people dancing. I'd like to hybrid with musicians to make Bachconcertosin abandoned buildings. I'd like to stun people with the power of this instrument, but I need your help to make that happen.I want your support. Even one dollar helps. Please tell your friends. Spread the love. Let folks know that I'm building this thing and I want to bring it to their town to help them party down. If you know an amazing musician who might like this project please let them know. I'd love to find a way to collaborate with them and blend our creative juices. If you know of festivals that would want an Anywhere Organ hanging around please send me a note.The prototype I've produced cost roughly $4500 to build. I got some incredible support from the Awesome Foundation and FEAST Brooklyn which helped get the ball rolling, but I funded most of the project myself. I'd like to gather enough resources this time to devote myself to this project full time without having to decide whether to spend money renting a van and driving it to a festival or investing in new blowers to improve the sound. I'd rather not have to make those choices. I'd rather be asking ""Is this awesome?"" and doing everything that comes up in the affirmative.The way it breaks down is that each $1000 I gather adds another 2 octaves of sound on to the sculpture. I'm aiming to add another voice to the organ with the $3000 I'm proposing to raise in this Kickstarter. If I go over thatamount every penny will be put into making this project bigger and better, as well as getting it out in front of more people to enjoy.The Anywhere Organ won an Editor's Choice award at World Maker Faire '11. I'd like to thank everybody who came out to support it and take a spin on the keys. You guys rock... really. Did you see that guy playing ""Don't Stop Believin"" on the organ? That was awesome.The music used in the introduction video was recorded live during World Maker Faire '11 plus a chiptune track by GoldmanLoops (released under an Attribution Non-Com Share-Alike license).

Recalling the university’s Center for the Arts (CUDA), encouraged by my mom – Maritza Vielma- I took my first steps in music by joining the university’s children choir, learning theory, and playing Venezuelan cuatro (small guitar). At this amazing school, I observed photographers, sculptors, painters, ballet dancers, and musicians working on their passions, which motivated me to dedicate my life to music.Seven years have passed since I arrived in Boston, MA after spending a period in Caracas working extensively with amazing musicians. I never imagined ending up in such a musical and academic city like Boston, studying at two among the top ten music institutions in the world, Berklee College of Music and New England Conservatory of Music.I am happy that this record –Tendencias- represents the work I have sculpted in the US for a few years. It expresses some of the elements that my spirit has embedded from Merida, Caracas, Boston, and New York.Piece!Video teasers of the recording and mixing process! Check them out!","Completing the production: It is very challenging for an independent artist to produce an album. I am lucky to have the support of amazing artists and beautiful souls, from musicians to sound engineers and from designers to videographers. I am sure we can reach this goal with your support. The policy of Kickstarter demands that if the project does not reach it’s total funding goal I will not receive any funds from the campaign. The project will have to be postponed while I find other alternatives to finish the album. Let’s work to finish it together!"

I am off to New York later this month and hope to include some pictures from the Big Apple in the book.I feel too that launching this campaign at the start of the Chinese Year of the Dog 2018 will only bring us luck and good fortune. In China, it is still popular to name dogs Wàng Cái (旺财). It means “prosperous wealth” and comes from dogs’ barking sounds (旺旺—wàng wàng). ""","We are seasoned book producers,  the photographs are ready and our designer Heather Bowen is all set.  We have a printer lined up who we know will be able to produce the book to the demanding high quality we need.",https://www.kickstarter.com/projects/phodography/philip-e-west-aviation-masterworks?ref=discovery_category_newest,phodography/philip-e-west-aviation-masterworks,"Philip West is recognised as one of the world's finest aviation artists. Collectors of his original oil paintings span the globe, many waiting patiently for his next breathtaking canvas to appear.With more than 100 limited editions behind him, a waiting list of commissioned paintings for clients both existing and new, and a head full of ideas for new limited edition prints, life is never dull for this Wiltshire based artist! Self-taught, after years of painting pictures for friends and relatives, Philip took the plunge and became a full-time professional artist. Since when he has developed a very loyal and expanding following for both his original paintings and prints.Whilst jets, and Phantoms in particular, light Philip’s fire, he is also a master painter of piston-engined classics; being renowned for his rendition of Avro Lancasters and Supermarine Spitfires (as above). Philip is also one of the few artists to also enthusiastically paint pictures of Fleet Air Arm aircraft.  Philip's knowledge of aircraft and the accuracy of his work combine to record a moment in history so perfectly, that both collectors and admirers of his work are able to feel a real sense of the excitement and drama that his work portrays.For the first time, the best of these magnificent paintings have been painstakingly scanned and included in a luxury hardback book, to tie in with the 100th anniversary of the RAF this year.Each full-colour reproduction carries an explanatory caption, while Philip has composed an Introduction explaining how his paintings have become his tapestry to a remarkable career.His standing in the world of aviation art is endorsed by the fact that two of the best-known surviving Battle of Britain pilots have supplied forewords for the book.Squadron Leader Geoffrey Wellum DFC joined the RAF with a Short Service Commission in August 1939. He joined 92 Squadron flying Spitfires in June 1940 at the time of Dunkirk. He flew throughout the Battle of Britain, later completing over 50 fighter sweeps and escorts over northern France and Belgium until August 1941.He then joined 65 Squadron as Flight Commander in March 1942 operating over northern France and flew off aircraft carrier Furious on Operation Pedestal, to Malta. (Geoff was a Flt. Lt. during “Operation Pedestal”) He returned to the UK as a test pilot for Gloster Aircraft and finished the war as a Pilot Attack Instructor. Geoff was credited with three destroyed, four probables and several damaged and was awarded the DFC in July 1941.Geoff’s best-selling book “First Light”, recalling his wartime flying career, has sold more than half a million copies and has made him a household name.The other foreword is supplied by Wing Commander Tom ""Ginger"" Neil DFC & Bar, AFC, AE, who scored a total of 14 kills during the Battle of Britain and concluded a highly-distinguished 26-year career in the RAF in 1964. Neil took part in the commemoration of the 75th anniversary of theBattle of Britain in which he took to the skies in the largest formation of Spitfires and Hurricanes seen in Britain since the Second World War.Philip is extremely proud that these two truly great aviators enjoy his work and have sung his praises in their forewords ... the very last survivors of The Few.","A high-quality printer is lined up and we are very experienced in all aspects of book production, so there should be no risk involved in producing the project."

So not only have we gotten rid of countless battery changes but we've also eliminated nuisance components such as switches. This helps ensure the durability of the light and make it resistant to shocks, water, and dust—the 3 things that commonly destroy safety lights.",The main risks producers face is the problem of offshoring production. But making a product in China or other low-cost areas not only impacts our country but also affects the quality control in the manufacturing process of the product. At QuikFlash we pledge to keep all production in Canada where we can monitor our staff and ensure the greatest quality product possible for you. This builds jobs right here at home—something we wish more entrepreneurs were able to do.,https://www.kickstarter.com/projects/1798141982/cordcondom-practice-safe-charging?ref=discovery_category_newest,1798141982/cordcondom-practice-safe-charging,"At CordCondom we are all about prolonging the life of chargers to save time and money for our customers. Not to mention the amount of garbage kept out of landfills from fewer broken chargers being discarded.This campaign is to raise awareness of our company and allow us to create CordCondoms that will fit on more cables and in additional colours to save you even more money and time.We already have a functioning product for phone chargers with many happy users so you don't have to worry about whether we will be able to build out the product and get it to you. We want to be able to order in larger quantities and having pre-orders from Kickstarter will give us the funding we need to put ourselves on the map in the crowded phone accessory market.Wrap it up!We have designed a product that works on the Apple Lightning connector cable and the Samsung Micro USB. CordCondom will also fit on many other Micro USBs. This is one product that forms to all different chargers so there is no need to specify which condom you need.This also makes it easy to share a Condom with a friend in need regardless of their personal choice of mobile platform.Keep your current MFI certified charger safe and stop purchasing Non-Licensed cords online or at the gas station that give error messages after updating your phone. (CordCondom is not an accessory that connects to your phone directly and therefore does not have MFi certification itself.)Allergy ConcernsFor those of us who have to avoid latex products when being intimate, don't look for substitutes here. All our products contain no latex and are made from 100% silicone meaning a tougher product and no frustrating latex allergic reactions.It's Easy! We managed to do it in under 15 seconds and it can be done anywhere as it requires no tools or small parts.Here's Amanda applying it on her charger.Yes you read that right. The amount of waste caused by discarded chargers is TOO DAMN HIGH.If we could put a CordCondom on only 1% of these chargers and double their usable life, we would have 3 Million less chargers in the garbage this year.Well, we call it the ripper. We built a charger destroying machine and recorded the difference in time before we saw charger guts coming out. An unprotected apple charger on this machine took only 5 minutes to be destroyed, with CordCondom applied it lasted over 12 minutes.We have fun at CordCondom and we're definitely not a ""one trick pony"". We have plans to release more colours and patterns along with cord protection for more devices. Headphones, laptops, computer mice etc. This is not just a product to us, but instead, a passion. We promise to do absolutely everything possible to ship rewards on or before our deadlines. We started this company with very little money and fought to get things done on a bootstrapped budget. We have learned how to get around common problems (and way more come up then one would assume) and we vow to continue this persistence in growing the company, creating jobs and of course protecting cords everywhere.The majority of our product is made entirely in Toronto Canada. We package, roll and assemble everything here. The only offshore component to our operation is the manufacturing of the silicone, as we do not have enough money to afford the large silicone mixing and forming machines, yet.We do not intend to ever outsource our labour as we are aware of the importance of keeping jobs local and we believe most people will not mind paying slightly more to compensate the additional fair labour wages we pay.To make our product more attractive to our neighbours and citizens of Canada. We offer FREE SHIPPING. To our worldwide friends we offer a low flat rate of only $5CAD for packs of up to 12.Follow our Instagram: @CordCondomLike our Facebook Page: Facebook.com/CordCondom","As the majority of manufacturing is done in house right here in Toronto Canada, we do source our materials from Chinese silicon plants as we do not yet have the funds to make our own silicone. This provides a bit of a problem as we are dependent of these plants to provide the product at a predetermined price and hope that they do not decide to change pricing or minimum order quantities between our orders. To minimize this risk we have deals with 3 big suppliers and can compare pricing and offers to ensure our cost stays somewhat stable."

I'm utilizing kickstarter to fund a small print run for the first collectible double-issue, a 60 page comic book. The additional 40 pages can be accessed digitally and will eventually see a print run of their own.What's it about? It centers on Wiz Kid, who is stranded on Earth. His chance to escape presents itself when his own teammates come for a visit via the Legendary Ship The Eponea (pronounced ""Up'n'Away""). The only problem is that Wiz Kid Himself is one of their targets!Wiz Kid is actually the tiebreaker in a competition between the two headhunters, his old teammates Spaceman and Julia. They are on orders from the 13th Sponsor to recruit the Sirens of Violence, who have been identified on Earth. The four Sirens are wanted presumably to compete in the Galactic Grande Prix Tournament against their will. They will do whatever is necessary to stay hidden on Earth, even kill. Whoever of Spaceman or Julia recruits a majority, 3 of 5, of the targets between Wiz Kid and the four Sirens, shall earn his or her freedom.It's sounds complicated but this is all world building stuff, the plot itself is simple and sharp. It's just the mission, and how it plays out, the strategies, friendships, betrayals, even romance.  There is a sub-genre of story that does this that I really like, where the strategy is the story. The best two examples are Battle Royale, and The Hunger Games, but even Seven Samurai is a story like that, certain great arcs in Attack on Titan, etc.I will be running a Youtube channel in tandem during this this campaign, engaging with the readers there as well, taking requests for speedpaints and sharing my process and answering any questions.

Ordering printed comics is nerve-wracking but nothing due diligence and a loving eye can't deal with.A good thing about this Kickstarter is 95% of any necissary art is already drawn.  I will just have to draw the commissions.  So there should be almost no delay from when the kickstarter wraps to when the print order comes in and books start shipping out.Backers will be happy to know that I scheduled a whole month off to run this campaign, participate in inktober, and fulfill pledges.

I wanted to make a female led sci-fi fantasy film that was inspired by video games, specifically Nintendo's Metroid. An adaptation of a non-existent franchise if you will. One of the actors on the film, famous for being a student at a certain school of magic, encouraged me to write it. And I did... in 5 days! Not because writing is easy, but because I had a very very clear idea in my head for this particular film.The story starts with a young woman and her dog on their way to the countryside with her father, on a regular annual father/daughter retreat where he works as a Park Ranger. On this trip however, something is not right, signalled by the smoke coming from behind the abandoned factory on the way to their home. They pay no heed to it, and things slowly start to get stranger and stranger in a suspenseful build up to the fathers abduction from their home in broad daylight by large masked figures. With all the communication posts down, and the nearby service station now manned by a fresh corpse, the daughter emerging from where she was hidden away by her father during the carnage, eventually takes matters into her own hands, heading with her dog towards the one place they must have taken him. She finds an underground facility filled with weird sinister scientists, experimental creatures and an unlikely ally in one of the test subjects, and is forced to put a lot of her gaming instincts (She's a gamer) to use in a real world situation. With any luck, the little sizzle trailer below will go some way towards communicating that story, as well as giving you a good idea of the feel and look we are going for.I showed the script to a few people, who all liked it a lot, and then I put it aside as something I might do were I ever to have a suitable budget, as it couldn't be done justice to on a non existent or micro budget the way I envisioned. That was almost 6 years ago.There's been a lot of talk online and in the media about the celebrity kick starter campaigns which led to millions of dollars donated into certain projects, and how that was bad for the independents and bad for the site's ultimate purpose to empower those that really needed backing who couldn't get it otherwise for projects they were passionate about. And so I thought, ""I'm an independent filmmaker, and I could really benefit from that kind of backing for something like this"" knowing I would not have access to any sort of larger funding from elsewhere, being a relative unknown (Despite 5 feature films under my belt). If I had the right project, maybe I could finally give crowd funding a go... THIS is that project, and I hope to hopefully prove that even a nobody like me, can raise the kind of interest and consequent backing for a project that people are willing to see become a reality, without the kind of goodwill fan currency that more famous projects attract as standard.With this backing, I hope to enlist the services of at least a few recognised industry actors, as well as a team of respected industry professionals I have not yet had access to on smaller budgets, alongside my regular collaborators, to bring to life something special that will appeal to lovers of the genre, while also being done to a high standard. I have previously made my last films on nothing but blood, sweat and elbow grease by pulling favours and writing with a non existent budget in mind. For something of this scale, I wouldn't dare to try and make it for anything less than a reasonable amount to really do justice to the idea, and make it something worth your money, and your 90-100mins of viewing time. It's not about a pay day, but about being able to realise a dream project that will hopefully lead to more stories along the line from the same universe, as there is a fascinating world to be built with these characters, and anything that happens as a result of this film getting made, will be a DIRECT by product of YOUR help.If Bruce Campbell says YES? (Ash himself!! You KNOW it's a S-MART move!) If Samuel L Jackson says YES? (Yes it's Nick Fury, but we can dream, right?) If Sigourney Weaver says YES? (Ripley herself! How awesome would that be??) Give yourself a pat on the back, because YOU helped make it happen. There are a couple of people already attached (you may recognise them in the pitch video), and we are approaching several others already.The film is neutrally written as far as location is concerned, but it is being prepped with the US in mind, and with post-production in Europe. If we are able to make your donations go further in one location over another, then you can be sure we will go for that option, guaranteed.Well I'm glad you asked! Other than having had experience making many independent films before, all in different genres, I studied at film school in London, and went on to work on other sets of bigger productions in various capacities, and so have the technical experience and network to allow the kind of crew that will be skilled enough to pull off this sort of film, while also having the know how to deal with the industry professionals we will be hiring to work on the project.Two of my features recently got distribution, and will be available in the US, as well as worldwide. What does this mean? That those projects of very little means but a lot of heart, were able to convince a distributor that they were worth putting out to the general public. I'm hoping that what this translates to is that with more means at our disposal, we will be able to do something that won't just sit on a shelf somewhere, or on youtube, as well as be pretty cool and entertaining as well.I'll be working with a DP who i've collaborated with before, my good friend the talented Christopher Schneider. Here's something we did earlier:And a review for it. Plus my current showreel:And Christopher's reel:We're both fans of the genre, and want to see something on screen that also meets our own expectations as audience members, so we have an in built language that would allow us to translate the material to screen in a cool way, with the help of the rest of the team.We'll also be looking to work with the good folks at STUDIO ADI, Amalgamted Dynamics inc, who have worked on such iconic films as The Alien film series, The Thing, Tremors, Starship Troopers, Jumanji, and many many more.Much of the Visual Effects work in the film is going to be practical and in camera effects, so being able to afford to have them on board will be a real plus for us in bringing the vision to life.For the score, we will have an original soundtrack by Kurt Baggaley, which promises to be something pretty special, so all in all we're in pretty good shape with those already on board, and look to get in even better shape by the time we are able to get others to join on our adventure.Assuming we reach our goal, just to give a rough idea of where some of this money will be going right off the bat:Following this, our larger costsAnd then the cost of producing these perk rewards at the bare minimum:And of course production costs for equipment rental, insurance, accommodation, locations and permissions, crew and so on.What we are asking for is the absolute minimum we can afford to make this film for, and even then we're pushing the boundaries, all out of love and passion for this project. Without YOU, at this very moment, none of this will be possible.Also, the more donations we get, the more we are able to stretch the limits of what is capable on the project. We may even be able to shoot on Film! But that's the dream scenario where we surpass our goal, which again will only happen with your help.","Being an independent project, there are many risks that are associated with this kind of venture. Risks that we hope to minimise through good planning and good people, but which exist nonetheless. If we reach our goal, as in the bare minimum, there is always a chance that some of the logistical elements may mean delays in the start of principal photography, or post-production, as well as reward deliveries. Having worked as an independent filmmaker for a good few years now, making my own films as well as working on other people's projects, big and small, I'm very used to dealing with these kinds of situations, and the people I work with are too. Just because we have some proper funding to make a film, doesn't mean that we will get lazy with the process. Every little cent and penny will be put to good use to create an amazing piece of film worthy of our backers commitment, and of our own high standards. Scheduling is perhaps the biggest hurdle, getting talented people together for a set period of time is tough on a good day, so that could also lead to potential delays. Looking further still, once the film is completed, the biggest problem for independent films is distribution, and we plan on making it a very straight forward process by targeting specific festivals, and then having an official release online JUST for our Kickstarter backers, so you will be able to see the fruits of our labour after following us every step of the way towards making it, without having to wait around for any other deals to be made. Having had two other films land distribution, we're also hoping that it might be a little bit of an easier ride for this project, with all your help for even more of a solid foundation and a fighting chance. If you the people speak, those who have the power to put the film out there, will listen.  Regarding the perk rewards, some of these that involve physical props would of course vary in terms of what the final items will look like, but whatever the end design, they will be made to a high quality, and would be worthy of ""collectable status"", especially if the film ends up doing as well as we all hope it will, in which case you good sir or madam, will be in possession of a very rare item indeed, as well as having helped out on an ambitious independent project.",https://www.kickstarter.com/projects/1820213033/the-hades-pit-lazarus?ref=discovery_category_newest,1820213033/the-hades-pit-lazarus,"An anime and classic sci-fi horror inspired short narrative film. The film will also be utilising a new visual technique developed to pull off some of the action and dramatic sequences in a way that more closely mimics traditional animation, giving it a very unique and visceral feel.We are in need of YOUR help, to bring the short film Lazarus to life. Other than your contributions, it would also help us out immensely if you share this project round using the share options underneath the project image, and telling your friends about us.But before all that, here's the skinny on the whole project below:The Hades Project. Experiments by scientists working on extra-dimensional travel, who carry out tests on live subjects in order to create the perfect human vessel capable of surviving the journey from our world into another. Of the major trial subjects they have had, Lazarus 5 has been the most successful candidate. He is sent to the dungeons of the hades pit deep underground, where he can be monitored after a series of incidents make him a liability to the programme.When a recent abductee, a young woman, is sent down to the pit by accident, Lazarus 5 decides to take this opportunity to escape.This story all ties into the world of an in development feature film titled,The Hades PitThis short film will act as a proof of concept pitch for the bigger feature film, while also working as a standalone sci-fi short. We are looking to shoot it at the start of the new year, Jan/Feb 2016, with major pre-production and prep happening in the months prior to the shoot following our Kickstarter.The story starts with a young woman and her dog on their way to the countryside with her father, on a regular annual father/daughter retreat where he works as a Park Ranger. On this trip however, something is not right, and things slowly start to get stranger and stranger in a suspenseful build up to the fathers abduction from their home in broad daylight by large masked figures. With all the communication posts down, and the nearby service station now manned by a fresh corpse, the daughter takes matters into her own hands, heading out with her dog on a mission to rescue her father. She finds an underground facility filled with sinister scientists, experimental creatures and an unlikely ally in one of the former test subjects, and is forced to put a lot of her gaming instincts (She's a gamer) to use in a real world situation.That Test subject that she comes across... is the hero of our short film. Lazarus 5. And the short tells his story prior to the events ofThe Hades Pit.Below is a concept sizzle reel for the feature project:Lazarus will star Yuri Lowenthal (Naruto, Ben 10, Young Justice) and Tara Platt (Shelf life, Bleach, The Call), who will be playing the same roles they shall be portraying in the eventual feature film, as well as brand new characters created specifically for this short. I wanted to find a way to more effectively replicate the kind of kinetic movement that one finds in animation (of all types, japanese or otherwise), and do it in a way that does not utilise CGI. And the idea struck me to animate people like you would actually animate animated characters (I know that’s a lot of animation, but stay with me). Basically it’s not stop motion, and it’s not computer generated, but it’s using live action assets like puppets, frame by frame, to get unrealistic action and movement, with real figures placed onto real backgrounds using layers of varying styles and types, to come up with a single composite image with minimal tinkering of the original base frames. The result would be closer to the kind of movement and pacing one would associate with traditional 2D animation, as well as CG doubles in complicated effects sequences, but without the uncanny valley. It is a proprietary technique and should give a never before seen unique and visceral experience for the audience.

To really make it work, we need a little bit more than we have available to us to help get it to a stage where it looks and sounds as amazing as it can be, and not just another weekend project. And doing that for a sci-fi horror film requires a certain amount of money for production design, props and SFX makeup, lighting and other gear on the filming front that we do not have access to outside of our own resources, and then following the shoot funds for a decent post-production process which will include some minor VFX, as well as the often neglected aspects of good sound design and mastering.We've tried to keep things simple solely based on the requirements of the story, which means that we won't have to build the main deck of the starship enterprise or build a giant robot (though that would be awesome!), but we have to create a realistic portrayal of the characters and environments in our film.Funds will also go towards paying for insurance, general production upkeep, transportation of materials to and from set, locations that require hiring, and of course preparing your rewards.All the elements should add up to a roughly 10 minute short filmEveryone is doing this for the love of the project, so every penny and cent we receive is going straight into the production, and making sure what comes out of this collaboration will be something we can all be proud of, which will hopefully lead to bigger things down the line.We are a small outfit of film professionals and artists, and for a short film of this kind, of course there is only so much that we can offer you, so no lofty promises here. What we can guarantee you, is the final finished film in a variety of ways (Streaming, HD Download, Physical Flash drive with full resolution digital content) , with a number of behind the scenes assets we will be happy to share with you along with our experience making the film.There is something cool available at every reward level with the minimum being the finished film, and the higher tiers bringing you closer and closer to the production itself, virtually, and physically.The final film will be available right away to backers as soon as it is completed, and you will have exclusive access to it and other behind the scenes features, while we send it out for a festival run as well as using it as part of the pitch package forThe Hades Pitfeature film, before eventually releasing it online for public consumption. You'll be there FIRST! And you'll also be helping an original independent female led sci-fi feature film take its first steps into the world, while also getting a cool little short thrown in the mix. If we don't reach our goal, the likelihood is that we will not be able to make the film. Not without help from contributions such as what we would get from your kind selves here on Kickstarter. So basically no minimum funding goal, no film. And the way Kickstarter works is no money from contributions is taken UNLESS the funding goal is reached, and more importantly unless the funding goal is reached, the project doesn't get ANY of your contributions. Yes! We are making this film for a global audience, so geography is no barrier to entry. We are also planning for a three day shoot in the Los Angeles area as it fits the requirements we need for this particular shoot. We've even given an approximate EURO equivalent for all rewards tiers for our European backers, to accompany Kickstarter's automatic US$ equivalent for American backers, just to show you we're not turning anyone away.The reward tiers are a guideline and not set in stone, meaning that you are free to contribute whatever amount you would like or are able to. And if it does not correspond with a reward, you can STILL contribute, and we would be all the more grateful for it. For example, if you wanted to give $1, or £20 or a number like that, which has no reward tier, you can.If we make our goal, this is how the money will be shaping up:We can make this film on our minimum goal, which will be in addition to the resources we are all personally putting into it. However just to give you an idea of the things we would be able to do with a bit more funds for the film with your help:And if we REALLY get lucky:","We have a dedicated and experienced team behind the project who will help minimise challenges in the actual production of the film. One challenge which plagues all film sets including on bigger budget films is time, in terms of bringing everyone together, and then going through the filming and post-production processes. So that we can deliver on our promise to you for your contribution, we need to be moderately flexible to allow for adjustments and refinements on set and in post-production to create the best end product we can. We have plan B's, C's, and J's all the way through to be flexible enough to sort out problems that we may come across, but they all lead towards getting a high quality, fun, slick looking end result into your hands and out into the world.Ultimately, our success, is directly related to your help. And the more we get, the better we can make this film. Thanks in advance for also sharing this project round using the share options underneath the project video, and telling your friends about us. And also importantly, for helping support independent film."

The school focuses on digging into ""the way of life or Tao (Way) that includes nutrition and meditation with the objective of sharpening the perception about ourselves and the reality we are part of."" This program will bring me close to the earth, the ocean, and other natural landscapes which will serve to deepen both relationships with nature and my practice. I will also be expected to do farm work, as all participants work on the farm to sustain the community and therefore our collective wellbeing.This experience will serve as a model on how to build a sustainable community as I work towards achieving my own vision: to construct a collective dance space in my hometown of West New York, NJ. I have been fortunate enough to have many opportunities to participate in programs that have supported and developed my choreographic practice. However, I realize that many communities do not have access to the performing arts. I want to open a dance space in order to create access to the performing arts/programming, specifically within a diverse Latin@ immigrant community that strongly values sharing resources.El 4 de Marzo viajare haciaOlmué, Chile por 10 semanas para participar en un programa de teatro y danza en la escuela KiM. Yo deseo continuar mis estudios de artes escénicas, particularmente en coreografia, baile contemporáneo, meditación, y investigar la relación entre el baile, música, y neurociencia. Estoy lanzando este Kickstarter para poder pasar mas tiempo en Sur America y colaborar con artistas que conozca en el camino. **Si quieren mas información sobre los detalles del proyecto por favor mándenme un mensaje para poder comunicarme con ustedes.**I was inspired to travel to Chile and throughout Latin America to explore my heritage (my parents immigrated to the U.S. from Guatemala), through my research on Cuban visual earth-artist Ana Mendieta (http://www.drainmag.com/contentNOVEMBER/REVIEWS_INTERVIEWS/Ana_Mendieta_Review.htm), and to connect with diverse peoples and collaborate with artists across Central and South America - as I have had the privilege to do elsewhere throughout my travels in Berlin & Nicaragua. I believe dance can enact social change by tapping into the spiritual power of the earth. How and what does this embodiment look like? This trip will allow me to explore the intersection of dance and nature and help me develop a choreographic practice that will enact change locally and spiral outward.The emergingtitle I have for this project is TheQuinceñera Project. AQuinceñera is an extravagant Latin@ coming-of-age celebration that brings families and communities together in celebration of a girl's entrance into womanhood. My desire is to reimagine the celebratory space of Quinceñeras' as I feel the celebrations provide a context from which to disrupt ideas of latinidad, sexuality, performance, and multiplicities of being.Quinceñeras' will serve as a framework for me to beginstructuring how I will present and connect my time abroad to my community at home.I am excited to see how my experiences in Chile will inform and develop mycurrent vision of TheQuinceñera Project.This Kickstarter campaign will enable me to complete my program, support my trip to Chile, and begin funding forThe Quinceñera Project.Asan emerging dance artist, it continues to be difficult to find a job in my respective field. Moreover, I cannot dedicate myself to my craft or work towards my vision ofestablishinga collective dance space without outside funds to help me meet my basic needs. These funds will not only help me during my time inChile, but also for the return to the United States and ensuring thedevelopment of my work can continue in various spaces and places.I received funds from my university to help me pay tuition for the program, my travel to Chile, and my first two months of rent. However, I do not have enough to cover food,health insurance, travel throughout Chile and Latin America or my return flight home. ""So why travel to Chile?,"" you may ask. I have this sensation within me that I have not been able to explore on a deeper/spiritual level since I have been in pursuit of more ""practical"" goals. Now that I have graduated I am able to identify with the projects and programs that best align with both my artistic and spiritual needs. I feel an to awaken this spiritual energy and cultivate it into a moment throughThe Quinceñera Project.I will be documenting my journey online which will include my story, recent pieces I have choreographed and performed, and a blog of videos and written reflections. Although I am seeking financial assistance, by documenting and sharing my experiences with you, I am also inviting you to engage with my work and with me on a personal level. I look forward to receiving all of your questions, observations, thoughts, and concerns in order to collectively begin to impact the direction and shape of the project (Randy.Reyes05@gmail.com). If anyone has any information or knowledge about starting a nonprofit or collective space feel free to reach out to me. I hope that through this process we can connect to ourselves and the present moment. Please make this adventure happen!Here is a timeline of my trajectory:                           <3Another video of site-specific work in progress :)",This project is solely under my direction at the moment and I am in the process of finding other collaborators/spaces to work with for when I return to the U.S. Two things that will be challenging will be to find sites in urban areas that will allow me to develop my project in a way that does justice to the environmental-kinesthetic conditions of my time abroad and finding ways of making connections between my local community and the community of artists I meet abroad.,https://www.kickstarter.com/projects/1949942734/lxs-desaparecidxs?ref=discovery_category_newest,1949942734/lxs-desaparecidxs,"I am currently an artist-in-residence at CounterPulse, a leading performing arts venue, in San Francisco, CA. I applied to thePerforming Diaspora commissioning program through CounterPulse earlier this year and was accepted as an artist for this fall's iteration. CounterPulse has been one of the performing arts spaces I have had a strong desire to connect with since my move to the Bay Area and it is an honor to be excavating Lxs Desparaecidxsat the CounterPulse studios.The rehearsal process for this new collaborative piece began in late May of this year and will continue through the premiere of performances, which will occur Dec. 7 - 9 & Dec. 14 - 16, 8pm at CounterPulse. I am working with a beautiful cast of performance artists, activists, witches/brujxssss, healers, writers, who you will meet in the fundraiser video (filmed by the phenomenal Chani Bockwinkel) above.The performance piece is in essence a dance that grapples with its own ephemerality; with the aesthetic of not knowing and trusting the intelligence of the body to create an aperture for something to emerge. How do we collaborate with the force of the unseen? How do we use our own respective repertoires of lived experiences/lineages and surrender them into one fluid cartographic compass that can lead us through the waters of this piece?This is a physically-intellectually-spiritually rigorous process of asking questions that generate fecund potentialities around: displacement, assimilation, disidentifications, decomposition, queer futurist framewerqs, shifting consciousness, intersectionality, creating alternative languages based in movement/sound, searching for queer ancestral lineages, Chinese Energetics, rituals/prayers/magick, and other motifs.The blessing of being an artist-in-residence at CounterPulse is that I am granted access to 100 hours of free rehearsal space to develop this piece, the performances are fully produced and promoted by CounterPulse's production team, there is a production budget, I receive a small stipend as the lead artist on the project (which will go directly to the costs of moving to Los Angeles in mid-September), amongst other delicious perks.That being said, this fundraiser is largely being created and launched with the aim of supporting my collaborators who are graciously committing their time, energy, and presence to the process. All of us are freelance artists and we continue to have dialogue around the ways we imagine and dream of generating a sustainable artistic platform that is sustainable for all of us.How do we do this?In our current economy, we are unable to create our own form of currency that exists outside of capitalistic frameworks thus it is important for me to generate this financial exchange. In addition to the costs of paying my collaborators, I am also interested in hiring a set designer, sound artist, and having more resources go directly to our production budget, which entails ensuring we can purchase costumes, props, tripods, and other miscellaneous production related items.This creative process is essential to my survival and your support will directly impact the resources of the cast as well identify within the spectrum of {first generation - queer - artist of color - displaced} living at the intersections of our respective communities and the performance / art / dance world. Our lives matter. The work we are doing matters. Our visibility and the stories we share matter. Sharing these truths, developing spiritual resilience, and generating the movement that arises from the questions we are asking becomes a response to our current eco-socio-political situation. How do we prepare for the end of the world as we know it and what tools do we have in place to implement the infrastructure for the society we wish to live in and be a part of?The future of this project will continue during my time at UCLA as I will begin my MFA in Dance program there this fall. My intention is to bring together the artists I have been working with throughout the U.S. and the Americas as part of the afterlife of this year's Performing Diaspora performances.Please spread the word, donate generously if you are able to, and support this beautiful cast! We cannot do this without YOU!(photo credit: Robbie Sweeny & This Is What I Want Festival (Artistic / Festival Director, Tessa Wills)","As I mentioned, the beauty of this project is that it is being sponsored by CounterPulse and thus the resources that I need with respect to time, space, and tech production of the actual performances is covered by CounterPulse. There is a specific timeline to keep me and the other artist I am sharing the bill with, Javier Stell-Fresquez, moving forward with our respective tasks as the premieres of the show get closer. This includes attending various production meetings, works-in-progress showings, seeing upcoming performances at CounterPulse, and the actual rehearsal process timeline all in service of establishing a relationship between my cast members, Counterpulse, and myself.  ""Lxs Desparaecidxs"" is the only current performance project I am committed to this summer. The challenge coming up will be balancing the first year of my graduate school program at UCLA with the rehearsal period this fall. That being said,  I have prepared ahead of time and will commit to having a weekend of intensive rehearsals 1x-2x/month as the December dates approach, I will have my cast meet amongst themselves while I am in LA,  and I am also interested in hosting rehearsals at UCLA if enough funding can be secured to cover travel expenses. Additionally, one of my collaborators, Gabriel Christian, will be serving as my proxy/mediator at some of the production meetings I will be unable to attend due to my fall quarter class schedule at UCLA. These are some clear examples of the ways I am addressing these initial challenges head on. Ultimately, I feel fully supported by the structure of the Performing Diaspora residency in terms of the resources they are able to offer (i.e. time, space, tech production). However, what CounterPulse DOES NOT have the capacity to do is assist with the funding required to support my collaborators / other artists I am wishing to bring into the process to make this vision come to life fully.I hope you will join us in December!"

This letter is a call to arms.      As many of you may know, I have been in the process of trying to get an album recorded for some time now, and have been writing for that eventual album for even longer.  Well the time is now, I have all of my ducks in a row to make this album a reality.  I have the studio and engineer lined up.  I have the amazing cast of musicians lined up.  I have a fantastic artist lined up to do the art work.  I have duplication services ready, and waiting patiently.  I even have radio and online media outlets ready to broadcast the album once it's finished.  I have everything mapped out to a timeline that puts this album done in one month, once I tip that first domino.  The only thing I don't have together is the funding necessary to start this chain reaction.That's where you come in.I've started a kickstarter campaign to ask for help from my family, friends, and fans.  ""No man is an island"", ""It takes a village to raise a child (make this album...)""  If I try to do this on my own its going to take another several years.  I can't wait that long, I can't let more time pass, I must strike while the iron is hot.  If you choose to make yourself an active participant in the making of this album, I will forever be in your debt.  Think of it as pre-ordering the album...  Everyone who helps contribute will get a copy of the album once it's done.I know I probably bug you a lot on facebook, or twitter, or chess.com, to come out to the gigs I do. This is lightyears more important to me, and I truly hope you will help me realize a project that I have been writing and working towards for years.Warm regards,-Matthew Charles YeakleyHere's a trailer my girlfriend made for this, it's hilarious!",,https://www.kickstarter.com/projects/1883126372/matthew-yeakley-group-new-album?ref=discovery_category_newest,1883126372/matthew-yeakley-group-new-album,"HELP ME MAKE THIS RECORD!!!It is going to be super amazing and I want your help to ensure that!This record is going to be a collection of the tunes I have poured my heart into over the course of the last 4 years.

I'm just so excited to do this, and I want you to be a part of that!DetailsThe Band that will appear on this record is made up of Matthew Yeakley on Guitar, Matt Politano on Piano, Cooper Appelt on Bass, and Aaron McLendon on Drums.

The only way this project get's delayed at all, is if I can't get all the guys in the same room at the same time right away.  But at most that puts us back one maybe two weeks.  Everything has been really thoroughly planned out for this project, so any delays we hit are going to be minimal at the very worst."

It focuses on the best of black and white photography and challenges photographers to think more critically about their own thoughts on the medium.After a short hiatus, the business is looking to take its next big step forward: the creation of an digital magazine for iPad and Android. While the website in and of itself is quite good, it doesn't offer the interactivity that a true e-magazine can offer. Here's our prototype; but please note that the final version will be a fully functional app using what the web offers us.The current prototype is a basic PDF, but we envision the final magazine as an app with subscriptions that will have issues available for download. What you'll get is a much more all encompassing experience where you curl up with your tablet and delve into the content we work so hard to put together.The magazine will also evolve into doing more than just basic interviews. Our current vision also includes:- Tutorials on black and white- Photo essays from photographers- Musings about black and white photography- Occasional video segments/featuresYes, a magazine is going to do this: I want it to embrace the full potential of the web.To do this though, we need funds. These funds will help to pay for all the expenses the magazine will accrue within the first year. Beyond that though, I believe in fair pay: and I'm looking to treat my employees fairly in terms of compensation. Think about it: wouldn't you want to get paid for your talent?Photographers like Robin Wong, Luc Kordas, Nicholas Goodden,Iwona Pinkowicz, Milo Hess, and Clay Benskin have already been featured.If successful, we'll be able to get the first issue out by September. After that it will be offered monthly with various and incredibly fair subscription tiers to suit your budget. But for the Kickstarter, you'll have a chance at a number of other goodies.Thanks a lot for reading; please help us to make something beautiful.Apart from subscriptions to the E-Zine, most of our rewards pull from my own body of work. I have been a photographer for years, and I picked a handful of images that I think fit perfectly as 'thank you's.Post cards at the lower levels can be added to your art collection, or sent to friends. T-shirts (Prototype design below) will let you show your support of the new project. Posters of my favorite black and white image, signed by me, are also up for grabs.Lastly, you get a chance to learn, or be photographed, by me. The session will last for two hours, and if you have a theme you want to focus on, I will do my best to accommodate you.

https://www.kickstarter.com/projects/neilandersonjr/no-mess-chef-flavored-bone-broths?ref=discovery_category_newest,neilandersonjr/no-mess-chef-flavored-bone-broths,"In order to understand why we are here you have to understand how we got here. 2 years ago we started a meal delivery company in Portland, OR. It was going to be the best and biggest meal delivery company anyone could imagine. We pride ourselves on being different than all the others. We use glass reusable containers to lessen the impact of waste and to keep fresher. However, most importantly we were sourcing all of our animals from local farmers raising animals on pasture, the right way. We wanted to provide real quality food, using local ingredients, no refined sugar, and pasture raised meats. We purchased whole animals and had them locally USDA processed. We put that quality meat into our meals but the bones kept piling up. Eventually it came time for those grass fed beef bones to be used, so into the kettle they went. But just like our food, it wasn't going to be plain. Lots of veggies and lots of herbs. It had to taste good and it be extremely flavorful. It was! So much so, that I ended up starting the year off on a bone broth fast. Mixed in with veggies, pasture raised meats, and nuts over the course of 6 weeks, I lost 50lbs without thinking about it. The weight loss, and more importantly, getting out of a mental food fog was impossible not to notice and the questions started coming. So of course, we started making it for our customers. We decided to see how it would sell at one farmers market. It quickly grew to 6. But there came the problem. Last week Linda came and sampled the ""OTG"" Orange Turmeric Ginger Chicken and she's back for that along with another quart of ""Thanksgiving"". The problem is we are out of both. She loves the Rosemary's Beef and Spicy Chicken and gets a pint of both. However, she planned on using the ""OTG"" Chicken Bone Broth for the base of a curry she was making that week. This problem happens far too often. We've done 15 flavors over the last few months alone and we've have never had more than 5 available in stock at a time. We removed ordering from our website to handle the market demand.We are dedicated to supporting small farmers not only in our animal sourcing but our vegetable sourcing as well. We know the farmers we work with. We have built relationships over the last 2 years, and are committed to supporting them and their families. For our animals we want to make sure they had a good life on the pasture eating the right things until they have their ""one bad day"". By using the whole animal we make sure that nothing is wasted. By making sure they are raised right we are able to put protein, collagen, and other nutrients from a healthy animal into our broth; not whats embedded in the bones of a factory farmed animals. We are also happy to support young farmers, cultivating the future of food supply. By supporting us you support young farmers that are just getting established and are dedicated taking care of the land while growing quality produce.Now why bone broth? Bone broth can help relieve joint pain and osteoarthritis, detoxify the liver, aid in wound healing, prevent aging skin, alleviate eczema, support digestive health, balance hormones, increase energy, strengthen bones, improve quality of sleep, alleviate symptoms from certain autoimmune conditions, boost immune function, and more. There is a reason why your doctor is telling you to drink it. Whether you drink it or use it to cook with your body will thank you.So why are we here? We are tired of being out of flavors that people love because we need to increase our production. Over the last 9 months or so we have been working with the Oregon Dept of Agriculture and the USDA in order to wholesale our broth. However, there are many obstacles. Right now we are doing too many flavors and still want to give you that small batch taste, rather than something that tastes like commercialized compromise. We might get there one day but right now we like where we are headed. Our current needs are a larger kettle to be able to produce more as well as increasing our production space. We also have additional needs now that we are going to begin shipping in late fall. Currently we reuse our glass. If you've ever been to Portland you can understand that our customers are happy to return the jars to reduce waste. However, we can't get them back if when we ship. We go through thousands of jars and expect to go through a lot more as we continue to grow and begin to ship. We also were able to find out why Craig was stealing boxes and got fired. It was going to cost us about $2 for boxes and partitions to fit our jars. However, we talked to our glass manufacturer and they are going to package our future shipments in 6 pack boxes so we can reuse the boxes instead of the much larger cases they normally are packed in.Outside of little things we are pretty much set or have it mostly financially covered ourselves. Bigger kettle and more glass gets the job done and continuing to head in the direction we have been going. So we want the opportunity to show you what our customers love and continue to come back for week after week. We have a nutritious and delicious product, quality sourced ingredients, and a passion that continues to be fueled by each one of our customers we meet. We hope that you love our products and put more fuel in our tank.","We have set a timeline for delivery of December. This will allow us enough time to have the new equipment in place, and to have run enough batches that we have a large selection of flavors to fill orders. We will keep you updated as there is a good chance that we can start shipping sooner.",https://www.kickstarter.com/projects/neilandersonjr/no-mess-chef-flavored-bone-broths-and-soupor-sauces?ref=discovery_category_newest,neilandersonjr/no-mess-chef-flavored-bone-broths-and-soupor-sauces,"In order to understand why we are here you have to understand how we got here.

Lots of veggies, lots of herbs, and sometimes fruit. It had to taste good and it be extremely flavorful. It was! So much so, that I ended up starting 2019 off with a bone broth fast. Mixed in with fruit and raw veggies, and then eventually nuts over the course of 6 weeks, I lost 50lbs without thinking about it.

We had to remove ordering from our website to handle the market demand.Then in August 2019 came our SOUPor Sauces, born out of the desire to make the best tomato soups. It’s rich and flavorful and can be used as a tomato sauce or enjoyed as a soup when mixed with coconut milk, water, or bone broth. Made with pesticide free tomatoes, organically grown vegetables & herbs, and organic coconut, each of the SOUPor Sauce flavors has been hard to keep in stock. Now we have the ability to significantly increase our production which also means more ingredients etc.We are dedicated to supporting small farmers not only in our animal sourcing but our vegetable sourcing as well.

We grew tired of being out of flavors that people love because we needed to increase our production. In order to accomplish that we moved into our own production kitchen and now have 3 kettles to run. Our greatest need was a larger or more kettles to be able to produce more, however, we’ve addressed that need but there are others to keep us running smoothly. Outside of equipment needs we have a few others, i.e. more glass for our SOUPor Sauce, especially since we are going to begin shipping and won’t be able to get the jars back.We have nutritious and delicious products, quality sourced ingredients, and a passion that continues to be fueled by each one of our customers we meet. We hope that you love our products and enjoy the benefits that come from quality ingredients processed with passion and love.","With all projects there are some risks. However, this isn’t a new project,just a way to increase our volume. Risks include handling the increase in volume. I.e moving SOUPor Sauce shipppjng until May so we can have enough of our glass jars."
https://www.kickstarter.com/projects/danielgreenwolf/celtic-magic-an-evening-of-illusion-with-an-irish?ref=discovery_category_newest,danielgreenwolf/celtic-magic-an-evening-of-illusion-with-an-irish,"What if there was a show that combined Grand Illusions with Irish stories, Celtic Music, Gaelic Myths & Legends, Interactive Comedy, Action, Drama, and a wee bit o' Danger? If there was, that show would be called ""Celtic Magic.""And we need your help to make it a reality.My name isDaniel GreenWolfand I have been performing professionally for 15 years as a Magician and slightly-Mad Irishman. I have had the honor of working in so many wonderful venues including many Renaissance Faires across the USA, and places like The Big E, The Mark Twain House, and even the United States Coast Guard.I was able to learn Magic from some of the best, thanks to living in Connecticut, which is close to amazing magicians in CT, NY, and MA. I've also had the pleasure and life-changing experience of being a 7-year camper ofTannen's Magic Campand, for the past 9 years, a guest performer & counselor who gets to teach other young Magicians.In all of this time, I've had one dream in mind: To take the show that I have been performing for a decade to the next level. The problem is, a show of this size is expensive and almost impossible to do alone, especially when you're spending your time performing to make rent and such. So for two years, I've been thinking about and planning and losing sleep over one idea: an illusion show with an Irish Theme. No one has ever really done it like this, which has always surprised me. The history, art, and music of the Celtic Isles is so beautiful and interesting, that Magic seems like a natural fit.What Celtic Magic will be is a Full 90-minute Evening Show that combines Grand Illusions, Escapes, Smaller Stage-sized Magic and Sleight-of-Hand with High energy Irish Music, Celtic Myths & Legends, and sets, costumes, and props designed with an Irish Theme.There will be audience interaction, comedy, drama, and even some dangerous feats. It's going to be a full theatrical experience.But I need money to make it happen. A lot of money. And I know that there are enough people out there interested in something like this that the idea of Kickstarting this show is just crazy enough to work.And I'm not creating this alone. To get all of these elements to work together, I needed a team just as mad as I am. And aside from my crew of fantabulously talented people, whom I have worked with for years, I've brought in some of the most creative minds in Magic and Theatre to help bring my dream to the stage.Magician, Director, Producer, Choreographer, Actor, & Musician Hiawatha Johnson Jr. has been creating Magic and shaping Magicians for decades. He serves as accompanist /composer-in-residence for the Department of Dance atRandolph Macon Woman's College (Lynchburg, VA), he founded the KTMA Performing Arts Ensemble, worked as Chief Consultant forSiegfried & Roy Present Darren Romeo at the Welk Resort Theatre in Branson, Missouri, and has been a teacher and counselor at Tannen's Magic Camp for over 20 years.Illusionist, Director, and Producer David Garrity has been the performing Magician at Six Flags New England since 1992. Facing the demand of creating a brand new Illusion show every season for decades, David is an international performer who has made Magic in every conceivable type of venue since the early 90s. David performs over 500 shows annually.Vinny Giordano has been the secret ingredient in some of the world’s top magic and illusion acts.  Transitioning from a young performer to working backstage at magic shows since he was 15.  This propelled Vinny into Theme Park, Corporate Event, Off Broadway, Las Vegas Productions and most recent, “The Masters of Illusion - Live World Tour”  He is a magic consultant/designer, theatrical  prop fabricator and illusion technician.Scott Hitchcock is a great entertainer with an utterly unique style.  His enormous creative range encompasses magic, dance, music, complicated verse, impersonation and improvisation.  Presenting juggling and improvisational comedy on the streets of New York , sleight of hand at private parties and trade shows throughout the Midwest, and magic & illusion in nightclubs in LA, he has received numerous awards and critical acclaim. Not limiting himself to the United States , he has performed for audiences in Europe and Asia on many occasions.     Scott has also appeared on NBC, CNN, TNN , USA or E!.  He was also featured in the November 2009 issue of “MAGIC Magazine”.Magician, Producer, Director, and ""Mamma Magic"" herself, Terri Cook has been an integral part in forming the future of Magic for 30 years. Aside from being a full-time professional performer, Terri is the director of Tannen's Magic Camp, the premiere camp devoted solely to the art of Magic. Terri has also worked with some of the most influential Magicians in modern history, and has become rather influential herself.All of the rewards are listed over to the right, but here's a few visual examples of what the physical rewards will look like-Designs for the T-shirts:You can see that a majority of the funds are going to fabricate props. Magic illusions are expensive. REALLY expensive. There's going to be some illusionists that will think I'm crazy trying to put a show together for only $40000 and truly, it is the minimum I need. This isn't counting other incidentals like costumes, additional audio, and more. But this Kickstarter is meant to help get the show off the ground. Whatever is raised above and beyond the goal will go right into the show. We promise.These are just to give you a flavor of what we're looking to do with the look of the show. (Please note... I'm absolutely not very good a computer-based art... these are rough ideas)","There are a plethora of challenges involved with a project of this size including finding the proper assistants, fabricating illusions, creating sets, designing the routines, finding places to rehearse, and securing a proper Theatre for the Opening Weekend. But we have plans for all of this thankfully, and once this project is funded- nothing is going to stop Celtic Magic from Going LIVE.",https://www.kickstarter.com/projects/danielgreenwolf/tell-the-world-that-gingers-are-magic-the-next-gen?ref=discovery_category_newest,danielgreenwolf/tell-the-world-that-gingers-are-magic-the-next-gen,"Gingers are awesome! Yeah, I said it. And as a professional performer for over 20 years, I'm honored to be a Red-Head in the Public Eye. (Okay, maybe ""public eye"" is stretching the term, but my Mom likes me...right?)Four years ago, I launched a project for my original product line of ""Gingers Are Magic"" and I was overwhelmed by the response. The original goal was met in a week and we were able to unlock stretch goals and now there are hundreds of people literally around the world who are wearing the ""Gingers Are Magic"" t-shirts, buttons, stickers, and boy shorts and it's really humbling.One of the most common questions I got from people is ""Why aren't you on your own merchandise?"" and the short answer is two things:1- I wanted people to be able to enjoy wearing ""Gingers Are Magic"" without having to have seen my show.2- I didn't have any version of me that I felt comfortable putting on merchandise. I have a lot of self-image issues that I've fought with my entire life, which is really tough when you're a performer. I used to be really overweight and, even after becoming much healthier, I didn't feel comfortable enough with myself to think someone would want something with my picture on it.Then came Leslie Casilli. Leslie is a brilliantly talented artist who creates masterpieces at a level I cannot even begin to fathom. (https://lesliecasilli.com/)In 2016, the idea came to have Leslie make a caricature of me that I could use for promotional material and she made me look cooler than I could ever possibly hope for. However, life got in the way and we weren't able to make it into anything for almost 2 years.Skip to present day- Enough people have mentioned wanting to buy such items for so long and the technology has caught up and, thanks to Russ Loller at Battlezone Custom Printing (https://www.facebook.com/BattlezoneCustomPrinting/) we were able to put Leslie's image on a T-Shirt at an affordable price.So here is the image for the T-Shirts:The process is not a heat press, but rather a printing process that creates a high-quality shirt. No heat-transfer Paper. The image is printed directly onto the shirt in a really cool process.We will also be able to print the image onto Women's Fitted Tank Tops and Kid's Sized T-shirts as well. BUT THOSE WILL ONLY BE AVAILABLE FOR KICKSTARTER BACKERS. We'll only be selling the Unisex shirts at our live events and online.We also have a slightly different version of the image for the 3in stickers:And for the Button, we decided we didn't want to try shrinking the amazing detail so small, so thankfully, we were able to use the amazing artwork of Joey Marsocci of Grymm Studios (http://www.grymmstudios.com/) for the button.I am honored to have worked with so many amazing artists over the years and I'm honored to be able to offer this to folks who want to wear it.So we do have two sets of stretch goals, and the first is actually a really Easy one to reach once we reach our initial goal.This little dude was created out of a Joke from our Renaissance Faire Show and it was designed by Nick DeSimone of Big Red Button Designs (https://www.facebook.com/BigRedButton06010/) who also designed the original ""Gingers Are Magic"" logo. If you never seen the show, it might make little to no sense, but it's silly and I like silly. So we made him a special Unlockable Character for this Kickstarter. ;-)This is the image for our full evening Illusion Show called ""Celtic Magic"". And I think it's really awesome.So there you have it!Because Setting up a new line of stuff costs money. A LOT of money (at least by poor performer standards) so I need your help to start this really cool design and maybe if it takes off, ""Gingers are Magic"" can continue onto Sweatshirts, pants, flags, mugs, thongs, boyshorts, keychains, banana hammocks... sorry, I've gone too far. But you get the idea.Reaching the goal means we will have the amount to start the base product line of two different types of shirts, the stickers, and buttons, along with shipping costs and Kickstarter's cut. After the kickstarter pledges are fulfilled, I will be able to take the ""Gingers Are Magic"" line to all my public shows and spread the good word of Ginger Love to the four corners of the UNIVERSE! (Insert Maniacal Laugh here)Thank you everyone for taking the time to pledge and back the amazing work of all of these artists and bring them to other people after the kickstarter is done.","To be honest, once the project is funded, there really isn't much in the way of challenges to overcome because we have everything in order from our design, to production, to shipping all set. So our biggest hurdle is just getting it funded in the first place so that way we can get the quantity we need in order to produce the swag."

I have dreamed of performing on a huge stage as the headliner, and we have been provided with the opportunity to do so. After having a concept for a new album, we approached the Marcus Center for the Performing Arts at Vogel Hall and told them what we hoped to do to promote the big album. They saw our vision and helped to make it possible. We set the date for Nov. 10 and so the dream grew. We are going back into the studio in August and September to record our 7th album, ""Relentless"" and then releasing it at our ""Relentless"" show. The show is going to have a horn section, back up singers, the whole works...in other words, the CWB in full effect. However, the expenses for all this are considerable and that's where we need our fans help. Between studio fees, production costs and venue rental, we need to be sponsored to make the most of this opportunity.

We are the Charles Walker Band, a soul/r&b band from Milwaukee and my name is Charles Walker. We've released seven albums in nine years and we're embarking on releasing an EP, ""Ghetto Prophet"" which is what this project is all about. (BTW, the soundtrack for our Kickstarter video is from our last album, ""Relentless"" so now you know what kind of grooves you are in store for you.) Here is a cut from our last album: ""Ghetto Prophet"" is going to be our best yet because it we are bringing in two new lyricists and a new co-producer with Charles to add some new ideas and flavor to this EP. Here's a peek at our working EP cover design:   We are opening the door to wonderful backers such as yourself to get involved in something you've always dreamed of: become involved in a recording project! This means you become part of the record label. In the past, record labels controlled what band's did in the studio, what music they could record. Now, you have the unique opportunity to experience what it's like in the studio through exclusive video footage of the recording process. Here's how your backing dollars break down into the EP project:As the funding for the project is completed, you will be able to witness all the nonsense that goes into recording a cd (without the hassle of sitting through all the boring parts of recording take after take until we get it right!) We'll post videos and pictures and include the names of all the stronger backers in the liner notes so folks across the world will know their role in helping the EP come to life. And, of course, for those backers who want to really live the experience, Four lucky backers can pledge and we'll come right to doorstep and perform the EP for you, live! For you of you who want to be immortalized in song, we have a pledge for you too! We'll write you a song and name it after you! By now I'm sure youare curious as to what three tracks we are going to release, so here is our proposed track listing: ""Make Me Wanna Holla"" sounds a little like The Meters meet Prince. It has a deep groove with a nice prechorus and chorus which deliver a catchy hook.  ""Ghetto Prophet"" is just straight funk, reminiscent of The Gap Band. And ""Blind Woman See"" is an R&B Ballad, sort of jazzy/neo-soul, kind of a Earth Wind and Fire sound. Here is a scratch track of it:. If you have never heard any of our music, feel free to give our latest a spin on Reverbnation.  So there you have it. Our plan: Secure the equipment, lay down some tracks, mix it, master it, manufacture it and get it to you. Thanks for being a part of the Charles Walker Band recording experience. We can't wait for you to hear our next installment of soul!","The biggest challenge for the band will be to evolve, which is every band's challenge.  We must continue to implement new ideas, influences and sounds into our music so we can be relevant with a modern audience while still maintaining our roots in soul.  That's hard because as artists we easily fall back on what we already know.  However, in the studio we push each other to experiment and this album continue to push that evolution.  We won't settle for anything less than our best.  In fact, that's why the band's last album was entitled ""Relentless."" As well, bringing in some fresh ideas from a new co-producer and two new lyricists will also keep us on our toes!"

So you are not just supporting this project, you are supporting artists and something that can become potentially MASSIVE! And benefit everyone on board including even yourself.Surgery is the first big project for this, so if you are supporting this, you're are also supporting the potential of many more creative projects/concepts that will be up on the internet. From cartoon animations, comic books, albums, live touring and entertaining shows, to if possible, even movies, independent and large scale video games, when it comes to creativity, we have a universe of ideas at our disposal. And no limits.But back to Surgery, Surgery is a 3 part project about a layered story in the 17th century of a high noble ranked man, Jedrek Barbarrossa, praised and loved for his personality as a kind yet strong ruler of his land. His world gets flipped due to major events involving his wife and children and he begins to go insane, developing multi-personality syndrome, being convinced that through science and medical studies on the human body, that he can save his wife from an unknown disease. Slowly turning him into a horrible, cruel and terrifying monster of a man, at the head of an unbeatable army he creates within his grand castle 'Unsere Lion tonsfall'.Surgery is an opera about those events, how he fell apart, began doing highly wrong acts such as abducting citizens for science and medical studies. How he unknowingly destroys threats and turns his kingdom into a fearful place. And the beginning of when he unleashes his forces onto the world, commencing the prophecy of swallowing the world whole in a 100 year crusade as ""The world eater"". Was this man taken advantage of from a daemonic ancient warlord from centuries past? Or is there something far more sinister to this?We welcome you, to the incredibly deep and layered story, of Surgery.We say Surgery is a 3 part project because of its three parts, we have a operatic death metal concept album. A graphic novel, and a off shoot comic book.The comic book will have it's own kickstarter campaign as it is a off shoot story, with matching character names from the album/novel. However in a even more elaborate and layered story based in a 20th century urban environment, about 3 serial killers and the people that are trying to stop them.However, if we reach this goal we can make it a reality. And if we get more funding we can make the product better and even offer more for rewards, such as special limited hard cover concept art/novel books. And even get it further out there into the world with promotions and distribution. If there is enough funding we can even make touring a reality, a tour of this entire album with session musicians and theatrical performances for your entertainment. It can potentially even lead to having a big theatrical live show at Sydney opera house, which would be a personal dream come true.On top of that, this is to only cover/scrape the bare minimum, so you'll get your guarantee. ideally we want to aim at 20+ grand.More money means better production! More prizes and rewards! More promotions and distribution worldwide! More back to the people! And with enough funding, the birth of an empire, dedicated to creativity and dreams! So more projects! Things such as.The graphic novel continuing into a book series titled The 'Unsere lion tonsfall' novel series.More resonator albums, perhaps even a free non profit one?Resonator touring - if we get enough funding to play this album live we will! If we can do this across our country Australia, we will, If we can do it overseas (we're looking at you Japan, Europe and America) you bet we will!Snake in a jar - humor filled action packed sci-fi adventures! Of rowdy mercenary aliens with a galaxy of adventures. Comic books, animations, games? A big live touring act? the universe's the limit!The delinquients - Essentially my take on a hilarious and perverse twisted 'little rascals' about a bunch of derro metal head tafe students who share a massive run down house in a cartoon like twist of Sydney western suburbia.

Just like other artists that truly want to make their art seen and heard, I am a die hard fan of what I do and I want you to know how badly I want this to happen.Since before I started Resonator as a band a long time ago, I was already a visionary and I began becoming a very creative minded person, adding and adding to ideas of mine, the best example of this is my project snake in a jar. Which alone is the size of a galaxy! From years of developing it.I have always come across challenges and I do everything in my power to overcome them. I learn and adapt and do what I can to make these dreams of mine come true, and now, with all my current knowledge I have learned from many great business people in the industry, determination, abilities and amazing talented crew members. I want to share them with you.This kickstarter is needed to be able to make this project happen, myself and my crew I have are all Sydney area based, which is difficult to save extra funds for our creative projects due to day to day life. Plus we are starting to build this potentially big creative company, starting with this project.The challenges that we face are the stages to get the finished product made in time, which is why I have set all prizes to be sent by may next year, to make this happen and we want minimum problems for our first kick starter campaign, and this gives us plenty of time to prepare and make our distribution of prizes to you! However, for the record, delays/challenges we may face might include.Artwork.Recording Sessions.production delays.distribution delays.Lack of steak and cheese.That said however, if we can get this made sooner, we most certainly will! You never know, with enough support we may get this done before Christmas! Ho ho ho ladies and gentlemen!But let me tell you the general stages of this project.So first we have stage 1. We will be finishing off the rest of the instrument tracking, and then doing vocal tracking, followed by mixing and mastering. All while this happens the novel will be prepared as a final draft for our publishers. And artwork for both items (album and novel) and merch will be developing. We are aiming to have this finished by February at the latest as it is a massive project, but that is at the absolute latest. Bookings will matter in this and we might get it all done in shorter time. Again sooner the better! (ho ho ho)Stage 2! Will be us finishing off art and getting straight into mass production, making the album Digipacks. Graphic Novels and merchandise.Stage 3 is when we have everything together and we distribute all of our prizes/meets to backers.TERMS AND CONDITIONS!Food prep meeting (cheese sandwich and steak meal) and general meetings must be at an agreed place of both David Laverty and The backer. Under a signed agreement and must be witnessed by a additional member on both sides of agreement. Event will also be documented and either photographed or recorded and backer must have consent and be over the age of 18, if backer is underage, a parent/guardian must fill out a permission form and be present at event. Food making Events will also be in Australia only! Also meals must be made upon reasonable circumstances given/agreed on by David Laverty. After all we want to make you a good meal, not something terrible.General meeting rewards will be located in Sydney/Sydney area only, unless it is possible to do so via long distance, this will be determined at a later date but we do not a hold a solid guarantee.All rewards do have subject to potential delay, We have prepared everything to be on schedule and we will be financially covered. However we want to put this disclaimer to dates JUST IN CASE that rewards may be delayed due to life events. If so we highly appreciate your patience.Also we wish to announce listener/viewer discretion. Some content on this album and graphic novel, and especially the comic book will obviously involve adult themes and gory content. We wish to give a heads up to this matter for the purpose of potentially offensive material. The characters and both stories in this project are entirely fictional and not real. We advise and suggest this material is not for your viewing/listening pleasure if you disapprove of violence, highly adult themes and gore. This is only a story and should not be taken seriously and to heart. We do not condone this material to be used for personal reflection or references to real life scenarios. Again. It's just a fictional story.",https://www.kickstarter.com/projects/960156086/snake-in-the-jar-saddlebacks-from-beyond-the-stars?ref=discovery_category_newest,960156086/snake-in-the-jar-saddlebacks-from-beyond-the-stars,"www.snakeinthejar.comwww.facebook.com/snakeinthejarAityees Labs - Snake In The Jar proudly presents its first Album and its Kickstarter campaign. Saddle Backs From Beyond The Stars.""Over Centuries we've been watching the skies... When we should have been watching our backs!""""They tried to save their own universe, they gained one hell of a story, and it lead them to us... After sporadic sleep for millenniums, now they've been rediscovered once again... Saddle up!""Snake In The Jar, is a Sci-Fi concept by David Laverty, which has been worked on for 9 years now. It takes place in a universe called Aityees. The broad main story behind Snake In The Jar is vast with adventure, with a crew of special bounty hunters known as Saddle Backs.""We are, a presumptuous bunch that traveled the stars, of a universe called Aityees, We're Snake In The Jar. Rich and poor, Genocide galore! We saved billions by killing millions and yes we understand that score... But Jazz hands!We are the hidden ones. Saviours of our doomed stars. We'll go back, whenever that may. Probably when Season two of Firefly's away...So we had, a rather harsh conflict with a race called Canaliens. They tried to run a muck in Aityees, oh ****. They tried to take over by a means of a new universal order. And fart on everyone... Some people did not agree, and this is how we came to be. We were made. Aityees Savior. But for a sad excuse for a Sci-Fi. We won't ""push you down the stairs"" If the writer gets ****ing paid, and guess what?"" - Lyrics are taken from track ""First Contact""This project has highly detailed backstories and features characters with monumental amounts of depth & personalities. It also involves many syndicates as well as Snake In The Jar. Most (but not all) of which become enemies of S.I.T.J. Including The Peanut Mafia, galactic renown terrifying Military force ""The Resonation"", Dr. Croc enterprise, World Traders Federation (W.T.F.), The duck people, The Canaliens N.U.A (aye buddy?) the Dub Step and plenty more.Snake In The Jar's main story revolves around the birth of Snake In The Jar, doing everything they can and beyond to achieve their ultimate goal, which is to save Aityees from The Canaliens New Universal Order, which would lead to the mass genocide of astronomical numbers and extinction of many species. Everything involved in between their birth and that goal, And how they came to us on planet Earth from Uranus. (Yes we know)Saddlebacks from beyond the stars is all about Snake In The Jar being rediscovered again in mankind's history, this time, however, In Sydney Australia back in 2009. It revolves around an independent Australian agency called the ""Australian Aristocracy of Aeronautics and Space Sub-sonics Sydney based Association"". (AAASSSA)AAASSSA, discovers these beings through a relay message left on their ship in Uranus (Yes again) and figure out their exact location, three days prior to this however, Snake In The Jar's Brains of the group ""Rahh"" contacts this young man named ""David Laverty"" and tells him whats going to happen, and David needs to save them that day.David Laverty organizes with some of his friends, to set a few criminals known as Delinquients (spelt with an I, to show people they're serious), off into the western suburbs of Sydney to rob fast food franchises and service stations (que a cover of I fought the law, anyone?), this distracts all the media and local law enforcement, giving David and his friends a chance to break into AAASSSA's broad facility and kidnap Snake In The Jar, then hide them in his friends basement near Mount Druitt for 6 months until the heat dies down. Concluded with David Laverty and his friends going onto the dole, becoming TAFE students to exploit these aliens as a rock group for a production company.Through this presentation, we want to tell the stories of these characters through more Albums. Novels/short stories. Live shows. Games. And an ultimate dream come true. An Animated series.","We have this current album in the final stages of Production, we just have to do the final mix, and then masters. We also need to do our merch, Hard copies of CD's, Cover license, track barcodes, all that kind of stuff.As well as personal investment, we're looking to this Kickstarter to help with those final stages, and to help fund the next album production, An Australian Tour primarily based in NSW (but hoping to tour Melbourne, Canberra, Brisbane, Perth and more!) which will involve costumes and Props. And if possible, begin making the Short stories/novel series of the main story. the more funding, the better!We have a solid system together from past experience and we are quite confident this album will all be ready and released on March 29th, 2018. That said we will also keep everyone up to date with progress on our website which you can follow us on at www.snakeinthejar.com. If there are any extreme emergencies that may cause delays, you'll be informed ASAP!One final challenge we face is Shipping for a framed poster, thanks to our experience with using a telephone and crayons though! This can simply be fixed with a number of quotes from the post office, to which we will happily update details as soon as we know!"
https://www.kickstarter.com/projects/2140437408/tinkr-tech?ref=discovery_category_newest,2140437408/tinkr-tech,"MissionThe mission of Tinkr Tech is to help school age kids discover their creative potential through design, prototyping and programming. Tinkr Tech promotes a hands on educational experience using cutting edge technology.Why this mattersOnly through trial and error do we experience the opportunity to make mistakes and learn from them.I have found that kids are afraid to make mistakes. They are hesitant to try new things because they think they won't be any good at them, and of course they won't be good at it if they don't try. These feelings seem to be symptomatic of the test heavy school environment today. Kids do not get the chance to be creative at school. Hands on classes like shop, art and computer programming are being reduced or eliminated from schools due to budget cuts and the time needed to prepare for standardized tests.  Today's kids are consumers of technology and have no idea of how the things they use work. We want to help kids understand whats under the hood and give them the tools to change it if they want to.The TrailerWe know this is not a typical hardware build. You won't get the actual product you are supporting. What you get though is something bigger. You get to have a hand in creating tomorrow's artists, scientists and engineers. With your help we will outfit the Tinkr Tech trailer as a mobile maker space. We will fill it with a laser cutter, 3D printer, iPads, Lego Mindstorm, and old school tools like hammers, screwdrivers and glue guns. We will take the Tinkr Tech trailer from school to school, offering classes to students and teachers. The classes will focus on the design process; brainstorming, prototyping and storytelling. We can stay on site for a day, week or month depending on the needs of the schools and what type of project we have going on.Tinkr Tech will be the first of it's kind mobile maker space in the midwest. It will be based in Dayton Ohio, but will travel where needed.We plan to have all the equipment purchased and the trailer built out by September 1st 2014.What your donations support7' x 14' TrailerLaser Cutter3D PrinterHand Toolslittlebitsgeneratorsafety suppliestablesawningand much, much more!Who am I?My name is Bryan Adams...no not that one.  I am a Design Engineer with 14 years automotive design experience.  I've worked on the interiors of some amazing cars and built some cool prototypes.  At home, I am a bit of amateur carpenter, plumber, electrician and landscaper. I've built the deck on my house, plumbed and finished my basement and added a stone fireplace with built in cabinets in my family room.  I love to tinker and build things.  I am a father of 2 great kids and they are the reason I am starting this project.  ","Our biggest challenge will be obtaining funding to offer scholarships to reduce the cost of Tinkr Tech to schools.While we want to make Tinkr Tech free for all schools who need it, it will be expensive to run.  We will accept donations from any School, PTO or other group to help cover costs but not require donations for our services.",https://www.kickstarter.com/projects/2140437408/tinkr-tech-0?ref=discovery_category_newest,2140437408/tinkr-tech-0,"Tinkr Tech is a mobile makerspace that travels all around the Miami Valley to provide kids with hands on making experiences. Tinkr Tech offers workshops based on the design process and are aligned to Ohio's New Learning Standards.We believe that the physical act of making something is extremely rewarding.

We are also part of the KickingItForward.org movement.","The biggest challenge that Tinkr Tech faces is finding the correct channels into schools.  We all know that school districts are strapped for cash.  Tinkr Tech will begin taking workshop reservations starting August 1st, 2014.   $10 from every workshop we run will fund a scholarship program for the schools who have the most need and the least resources."

He is a Miami Mountain of Muscle named Carlos Hernandez and I couldn't help but add this amazing piece of original art to my collection.This recent acquisition is what inspired the art project that I'm looking to add to this kickstarter.I learned a long time ago that it's not enough to tell the big boys how good you are, you have to show them. Click the link to check out the ultimate graphic novel screenplay for my version of Spiderman, with a little inspiration from The Dark Knight -- 120+ pages so settle in.https://drive.google.com/file/d/0B8yn0yg9yzA7WlRZRnhoV1BOaW8/view?usp=sharingIf you like what you read then help me build an incredible art project that not only continues the fan fiction mythos for one of the greatest characters of all time, but also raises the funds to build up the Spiderman library for my after school reading program appropriately titled Comics in the Classroom :)I want to commission Carlos to draw a special wraparound style cover for THE ARACKNIGHTThe cover will have a split screen theme with a Black & Gold clad Spider-Man leaping from a Vertigo inducing position above. He will be sporting Web Wings as he pounces towards us in the cover.Flip to the other side of the cover and you will see my main villain in this story. My favorite Spidey villain since I first picked up on his adventures in the Savage Land and became a cosplay, cover commissioning obsessive freak for him -- the one and only Kraven the Hunter.Again this project is not about money, it's about getting noticed and continuing to add more and more Spider volumes to my reading program. Working as a special education teacher, you have no idea the kind of skills that can be built, recovered and created through the power of comics. And wouldn't it be really cool to stick it to Sony for such a crappy Spider-Man movie.....Just sayin.The best part of getting into creating and publishing comics is the opportunity to create original cover designs with wild and sometimes risque themes. Take a look at the first piece Jose and I did together for our last kickstarter. This baby sold at a premium to one of our backers and we just sold a Lena Headey as Queen Gorgo (300) sitting seductively on Odin's Throne on a Thor Blank.

https://www.kickstarter.com/projects/contentkaufmann/the-boda-boda-book-ugandas-motorcycle-taxis?ref=discovery_category_newest,contentkaufmann/the-boda-boda-book-ugandas-motorcycle-taxis,"They are as omnipresent in Uganda as lukewarm Coca Cola in old bottles, Waragi Gin or Marabous, the large carrion feeders that look like overweight storks with a double chin: Travel Uganda, and you will find Boda Bodas everywhere. Boda Bodas are the motorcycle taxis that keep Uganda moving: The cut through traffic jams in the cities, they go to remote villages that can't be reached by car, they are affordable - and they represent an important perspective for the future of young men. Eine deutsche Zusammenfassung gibt es unten.We’ve spent a year working on understanding the Boda Boda economy. We’ve started with taking pictures of the great and colorful decorations of the bikes, interviewing riders and riders, continued with research on the economic impact, and ended up with telling stories of everyday life in Uganda – and of freedom, development and growth.The Boda Boda Book is a colorful coffee table-book documenting the essential lifelines of everyday life in Uganda. There are around 800.000 riders out on the street of Uganda; according to research, the Boda Boda industry supports more than two million people - that’s 5 % of the Ugandan population. At first glance, the riders may look just like gangs hanging out on the streets, struggling for a few coins. In fact, it’s a well- and self-organized business that allows riders to make good money. On an average, a rider can make ten to fifteen Euros per day. That is a lot in a country, where the gross domestic product is about 700 Euros per person and year. The riders make enough money to take care of their families and to afford the education of their children. This is not a matter of course: In the past, there have been several attempts especially by the city government in Kampala, to reduce the number of Boda Boda riders – on the one hand, to reduce the risk of accidents, on the other hands, to ensure a modern, clean and calm urban image. But the city just does not work without Boda Bodas. There are only two bus lines for 1,5 million people, the only other alternative are Matatus, – collective taxis, that leave only once they are full, and if too many passengers get out along the way, the driver may take a break of unknown duration in order to wait for more passengers.So riders and people teamed up to defend Boda Bodas in the city - that’s why riders are now self organized in associations, providing training for drivers and also caring for social security. The Boda Boda Book tells these stories in photos, features and facts. It provides a glimpse on urban daily life in on of Africa’s megacities and on economic realities in Uganda. It also raises the questions: What do youths need, what is necessary to make a living and what are the actual problems Ugandan youth deals with? While creating the book, we came again and agin across the fact, that seen from Europe, „Africa“ (which ist neither an economic nor a political unity) is considered as needy and dependent on help. Seen from China or India, it suddenly turns into a business partner. Talking about Uganda: Infrastructure like roads and electricity are financed with Chinese partners, and the motorcycles are firmly in Indian control - there is practically only one bike, the Boxer Bajaj. The Boda Boda Book will be a 160 pages coffee-table book combining photos, features and facts. We’ve created prototypes and currently we are working in refining and improving. The publication and shipping is scheduled for March 2018.We’ve teamed up with SafeBoda. SafeBoda is an association in Uganda that provides training, helmets and reflective vests to riders. The specially trained riders are highly visible in the streets and they can be ordered through the SafeBoda App. That’s why SafeBoda is also touted as African Uber. – Once our campaign reaches it’s goal, 500 $ go to SafeBoda to provide training to 50 new riders. So if you support the Boda Boda Book, you will not only get a book, but your next trip to Uganda will be much safer … We’ve also teamed up with Positive Debt. Positive Debt is an organization in Entebbe that organizes entrepreneurial training especially to women. If you choose the „Book in a Bag“-perk, you will get the book delivered in a bag out of colorful African fabrics manufactured in the workshops of Positive Debt. The fabrics are mainly produced in Congo or Rwanda - and the crazy prints are simply great. Watch Mugabi John, one of the founders, explain Positive Debt and the Book in a Bag.If you’re curious about more details on the Boda Boda industry - we’ve published a collection of facts, charts and infographics on our social media channels. Have a look atinstagram.com/bodabodabookfacebook.com/bodabodabookThe Boda Boda Book is a high quality coffee table book.Michael is a writer, publisher and photographer.

Boda Bodas sind die Motorrad-Taxis, die Uganda in Bewegung halten: Sie schlängeln sich durch den dichtesten Verkehr in den Städten, sie erreichen abgelegene Dörfer, zu denen es Autos nicht schaffen, ihre Dienste sind leitbar - und sie bieten jungen Männern eine Zukunftsperspektive. Wir haben ein knapp Jahr damit verbracht, die Boda Boda-Branche zu verstehen. Zu Beginn waren es bunte Porträts von Fahrern und ihren aufwendig dekorierten Motorrädern, wir haben uns mit Studien zur wirtschaftlichen Bedeutung der Branche beschäftigt, und gelandet sind wir bei Geschichten über den Alltag in Uganda - und über Freiheit, Entwicklung und Wachstum. The Boda Boda Book ist ein Bild- und Reportagebuch über die wichtigsten Lebensadern des Alltags in Uganda. Auf den Straßen Ugandas sind geschätzte 800.000 Boda Boda-Fahrer unterwegs; Studien zufolge ernährt die Branche bis zu zwei Millionen Menschen (das sind fünf Prozent der Bevölkerung Ugandas). Was auf den ersten Blick wie am Straßenrand abhängende Gangs wirkt, ist eine organisierte Branche die gutes Einkommen verspricht. Fahrer verdienen zehn bis fünfzehn Euro am Tag - das ist eine Menge Geld in einem Land, dessen Bruttonationalprodukt bei 700 Dollar pro Kopf liegt. Im Jahr. In Konflikten mit den Behörden, die die Motorräder aus den Stadtzentren verbannen wollten - hohe Unfallzahlen und der Wunsch nach einem modernen, sauberen Stadtbild waren die häufigsten Argumente - haben sich Fahrer und Bevölkerung durchgesetzt. Denn Ugandas Städte funktionieren einfach nicht ohne Boda Bodas. Momentaufnahmen des Alltags in einer von Afrikas Millionenstädten The Boda Boda Book erzählt diese Geschichten in Fotos, Reportagen und Fakten. Es bietet Einblicke in den urbanen Alltag einer der Millionenstädte Afrikas und in das tägliche Leben am Land. Eine der Fragen, die uns bei der Arbeit auch immer wieder begegnet ist: Welche Möglichkeiten haben junge Menschen in Uganda, welche Perspektiven brauchen sie? - Während Zusammenarbeit mit afrikanischen Ländern von Europa aus immer noch unter dem Gesichtspunkt der Hilfe gesehen wird, entwickeln chinesische und indische Unternehmen hier Geschäftspartnerschaften. Am Beispiel Ugandas: Infrastruktur wie Straßen und Elektrizität wird mit chinesischen Partnern finanziert, und die Motorradbranche ist fest in indischer Hand - das Einheitsmotorrad der Boda Boda Fahrer ist die Boxer Bajaj. Details zum Buch","We’ve run successful crowdfunding campaigns before. Pictures and stories are there, the major parts have been written and designed – it just takes some time to produce a high quality book. We are funding the print production – the content is there, we just need the means to bring it to its audience. With your help, we are well on our way …",https://www.kickstarter.com/projects/contentkaufmann/doom-metal-kit?ref=discovery_category_newest,contentkaufmann/doom-metal-kit,"Doom Metal Kit ist die Geschichte von Kit - Außendiensttechniker für okkulte Maschinen, der im unwirtlichen postapokalyptischen Ödland Dienst tut und dabei immer wieder an diverse Höllengeräte gerät. Sein Schicksal hat es wirklich in sich: Als Baby von einem unheimlichen Typen mit Büffelhörnern geraubt, fast als menschliche Opfergabe auf einem obskuren Altar gelandet, dann von einem geheimnisvollen Kapuzenmann gerettet und in eine unterirdische Erziehungsanstalt gesteckt - und jetzt auf seinem Posten als einsamer Servicemann des Okkulten. Das ist eine Story, die erzählt werden muss, dachte sich Michael Liberatore, gestaltete das Skript, suchte ein Team zusammen - und hier ist der düstere Comic Noir, der alle Regeln alter Kriminaldramen durch den Fleischwolf dreht und in eine neue hinreißende Story verpackt.Doom Metal Kit ist eine Comic-Serie, die in Heftform erscheinen wird. Aktuell planen wir die erste Miniserie, die aus zwei Heften besteht. Neben den beiden Heften gibt es Variant Covers, T-Shirts, Siebdrucke und Postkarten- und Stickersets. Gleich die erste Variant Cover-Serie hat es dabei schon mal in sich: Die ersten beiden Artists, die ihre Sicht von Doom Metal Kit gestaltet haben, sind Michael Hacker, der Spezialist für herzallerliebsten Monster-Trash, und Peter Kramar, Illustrator mit viel Sinn für das Böse.Das erste Heft wird Ende Mai erscheinen, rechtzeitig zum Comic Salon Erlangen, von dem aus wir dann auch Doom über den deutschen Markt bringen werden. Heft zwei ist für Juli geplant. Umfang sind 36 Seiten pro Heft, Format ist das klassische Comicformat mit 168 x 260 mm.Doom Metal Kit ist eine Comic-Serie aus Österreich. Eine Serie, der wir eine echte Chance geben möchten - deshalb lassen wir sie nicht in Kleinauflagen irgendwo verschwinden, sondern wollen sie in die Breite bringen. Ein paar Vorzeigeprojekte haben gezeigt, dass das geht - es braucht nur den Anschub dazu. Das Team hinter Doom Metal Kit besteht auch keineswegs aus Neulingen: Die Hefte sind grundsätzlich fertig. Es liegt an euch, ob ihr sie auch sehen werdet. Wir haben zwei Hefte, eine Reihe von Postkarten und Stickern, wunderschöne T-Shirt- und Siebdruckmotive und wir haben auch schon etablierte Vertriebswege, über die all die schönen Dinge zu euch finden werden. Wer jetzt noch immer zögert, dem sei unsere Nullnummer ans Herz gelegt: Auf acht Seiten schnuppert ihr vorsichtig in Kits erstes Abenteuer. Die Nullnummer gibt es im Comichandel in ganz Österreich, bei der Vienna Comix, der Austria Comic Con - und auf unserer Webseite. Und dann - dann entwickelt sich Doom Metal Kit vielleicht zur nächsten großen Comic-Serie. Pläne dafür hätten wir. Aber ihr entscheidet.Schaffen wir die 4.444? Dann haben wir schon was besonderes für euch - nämlich diesen absolut crowdfunding-exklusiven Sonderdruck im Heftformat, signiert von Michael Liberatore und mit dem für sich sprechenden ""Crowdfunder 2018""-Badge. – Das ist mal ein Lifetime-Achievement ... :)Das erste Stretchgoal ist erreicht - danke!!!Hier ist der neue Deal: 4.666 – und es gibt für jeden für euch zusätzlich noch ein Heft von Michael Liberatores ""Schamane & Cowboy"". Die zwei ehemaligen Schulkollegen begegnen einander nach vielen Jahren in der Prärie wieder, auf 36 Seiten in Farbe.Ein paar Euro noch und das gehört euch!","Was kann schiefgehen? Wir sind gut unterwegs, die Hefte sind praktisch fertig. Es liegt an euch, ob sie auch erscheinen werden. Details zu den einzelnen Goodies (etwa zu den Statistenauftritten und Sprechrollen in den Comics) klären wir dann nach Ablauf des Crowdfunding - wir kommen auf euch zu."

He was a master of story and not onlytaught me about art and story, but like all great teachers, he taught me largerlessons of my self and what makes great work.I loved Tom and always felt lucky to know him. So when he asked me to helphim tell this story, of course I agreed; and I intended to write a one-man playfor him to perform. Unfortunately, while in workshop for the play, Tom’s healthcollapsed. We shelved the production and Tom never recovered. Before he died, Tom asked me, “What would you put in yourbox? Not just proof that you existed, but what would capture the essenceof who you were on this earth?” That’s the question at the heart of thisplay. The Lost Boy has never let me go.Like Tom, for the last thirty years, I have been a director,writer, and teacher. I have mostly worked independently but also have been theartistic director of Dimensions Theatre Project and the general manager of TheSeattle Shakespeare Company. Of all the work I have done, this project may bethe single most important project of all because it so clearly brings intofocus just why a story matters.Now, years later, I have re-written The Lost Boy for twoactors, have collaborated with the wonderful band Mom’s Chili Boys who’vecomposed original music for the production, and have arranged a venue: theDeMarcus Brown Theatre (University of the Pacific) has tossed its hat in thering with us as co-producer, allowing us to use its great space for ourproduction.I need some help to get the job on its feet and on thestage: we need $3,400 to get us to opening night. Like any theatrical endeavor,we could use some extra cash ($5,000 would even be better, so please begenerous!), but we can get it done for $3,400.Please help us get this great project on to the stage. Nuts & Bolts","Rather than risks I want to address perseverance. Our greatest obstacle was Tom's passing. We transcended that and, as I wrote earlier, this play will not let me (us) go. Our first Kickstarter failed and, as always, great information, opportunity, and learning came through that process.  With the generous donation of the space by UOP, we've found another path forward. Our only obstacle now is funding and we will, one way or another, bring this project to its feet."

Faux Fur is hard to find in Canada, it's expensive and the quality is often dodgy. While the simple solution is to buy faux fur online, it often is met with expensive shipping, gross custom fees and of course our waning dollar. I realized that there was a demand that no one was readily filling, and as costume enthusiast and designer myself I figured who better to fill that need than someone who understands the market. Over the past year I have been working with various manufacturers to find and create a line of faux fur that is soft, dense, and has consistent quality and color.  However like all manufacturers they have a minimum order quantity, and that is 100 meters per colour on existing colours they already manufacture and 300 on new colours. After careful evaluation we determined that 10 colors would be a good place to start for a total of around 1500 meters of fabric. We want to give this campaign the best possible chance at success so we are starting small. It is still a lot to handle and more money than what one person can do alone. That's where you come in, with your support, we can create a line of faux fur in both common and hard to find colors that will be distributed within Canada for a price that is on pair with online store without the worry of import fees and currency exchange. Each existing colour costs approximately 900-1200 to produce and each custom colour costs around 3500$ to produce. We decided that for our opening stock we will only choose pre-existing colours, allowing us to keep the start up costs minimal to give this campaign the best possible chance of success. To that end we require 10,000$ for around 10 colours, the remaining 5000$ will be used for shipping/taxes as well as kickstarters own fee. As this is a community project we want to give our backers a say in what colours we get. So for each milestone we hit we will hold a vote among our backers to determine what colour we create! We have a few ideas of what colours we want to make but in the end what colours we create will be decided largely by our backers! We really believe in this projects potential and we want to make it a reality but we cannot do it without your help, to that end we have set up some rewards for you folks that will get you early access to the faux furs before anyone else!  ","Every project comes with its own unique risks and challenges. The market around costume design is constantly evolving and keeping on top of what the community needs will be our top priority as we delve into the project.To do this we will be working side by side with fellow Fursuit Makers, Cosplay Artists, Plushi Makers and so forth to ensure we meet the demand of the community. One of the major challenges we will face will be quality control, which we will try to stay on top of as best as possible by obtaining frequent samples from the manufacturer during all stages of production.  This project is a fun and unique opportunity for Canadian Fursuit Makers and Costume Enthusiast alike to partake in as it will give makers the opportunity to work together and be the driving force in creating a line of Canadian Distributed Faux Furs. As this project will be driven solely by the communities input the backers will have the opportunity to vote on what colours and styles they like best. We really believe in this projects potential, and we have worked very hard to save money towards that end. However our efforts alone will not be enough which is why we need your help to make this dream come true!",https://www.kickstarter.com/projects/currlycabbage/canfur-canadian-faux-furs-fabrics?ref=discovery_category_newest,currlycabbage/canfur-canadian-faux-furs-fabrics,"If you're a Canadian who spends a lot of time making costumes then you've probably come face to face with the constant struggle that is buying Faux Fur.

Each colour costs approximately 1600$ CAD to produce, plus approximately 300$ in freight charges and an estimated 700$ in custom fees, adding in kickstarters own fees and taxes that brings us just shy of 3500$ to produce 100 yards of fur, that is a lot and it doesn't leave much room to profit while keeping prices low. The more faux fur we produce however the cheaper it will get, so each additional 1600$CAD we raise we will produce another colour and cover the remaining fees ourselves out of pocket. That said we are starting with one colour, one colour that will be decided by you guys! We will also let the community decide what we should call this new line of faux furs, though I have a few ideas of my own. ;)It will take the manufacturer approximately 15 days to produce the fur once the project is funded, and another 15-25 days for the fur to be shipped and clear customs. So ideally we will have this fur in hand and be ready to start distributing it by Mid-Late March of 2020.So without further adieu let me introduce to to you CanFur, because you can fur with Canadian Furs.","Every project comes with its own unique risks and challenges.

For 6 years Shawn has been toiling away atcreating and self-publishing this epic 9 issue mini series. A lot of people dothat, but what makes this comic unique is not only its grand scale of morethan 500 pages, but he did all the work on his own. The comic itself is amixture of genres including, mystery, fantasy, horror, action, and humor. Through much tragedy and loss, he’s hadevery reason to give up, yet continues working on the book. The DungeonDocumentary exposes the hardships and successes of working indie while tryingto make a mainstream living. Part instructional, part human interest, and part inspirational anyone wanting to work in comicsshould see this film.    My name is Chris’ O’Hearn and this documentaryis about the underdog. Lots of people dream to work in comics, but mostdon’t realize what goes into it. The long hours, the conventions, the lawsuits,business deals gone bad, ideas stolen, harsh and sometimes unfair criticisms,rejection, printing, and distributing all while trying to make ends meet. When I heard about Shawn Harbin’s passion for his comic, alongwith all of his set backs and tribulations, I thought this story needs to betold. We need to show what a talent this guy really is, but I learned thatmaking a documentary is costly.Think of me in a Rod Serling type role.I will introduce and narrate this incredible story, but the documentary isn’tabout me, it’s about an extraordinary individual that followed his heart while strivingto live a dream.Chris O’Hearn is a life coach and CEO of Strong Within a company that helps people find the hero inside themselves. He is the host and narrator of the Documentary. You may have seen Chris as the personal trainer on the MTV Reality Show “I used to be Fat”.  After Graduating from college with a marketing and business degree, Chris decided his place in the world was helping people reach their goals. The energetic, good-natured, life coach brings a spotlight to those that don’t always realize their full potential.Shawn Harbin is the reclusive, snarky, and often-sardonic artist/writer of The Dungeon Comic. Known for his mixture of realistic and cartoon imagery of monsters and sexy girls, sprinkled with humor and pop cultural references, his comics employ an out of the box style approach not typical of most comics published today. He has worked on books such as Holyoak, Shakespeare Shaken, Co-created Roadkill Du Jour, as well as contributing the book covers for The Relics, The Rise and Fall of Empire, and The Hunter: Before and After.  He considers his passion for his series “The Dungeon Comic” an unhealthy obsessive compulsiveness of creativity.     The documentary interviews a wide array of people from the comics industry such as Marvel/DC inker Jay Leisten  (Death of Wolverine, Uncanny X-men), web comic artist Dawn Griffin (Zorfbert and Fred), Editors Enrica Jang (Red Stylo Press) and Philip Hopkins (Brotherhood of the Dwarves), Authors John Dawson Jackson (The Relics, The Rise and Fall of Empire: A love story), Stephen J. Semones (Gloom), Sheryl Steines (Annie Loves Cham Series), Pin-up Model Miss V, Actress/ producer Dana Michael (Flogging Margaret, Mancation), comic shop owners, and fans all give reasons why the comic series works. We have also arranged to have music from some pretty coolbands. So far we have music from In This Moment-http://inthismomentofficial.com/landing/Hyper Crush- https://hypercrush.comThe Southern Drawl Band-www.SouthernDrawlBand.com •	A great aspect of this campaign is the Double Disc DVD/Blu-Ray of the Documentary. The second disc contains even more advice from the professionals involved. Tips include inking, writing, self-publishing, character design, web comics, and more. Not to mention bloopers, and other extras. The extra disk can be found on both the regular DVD and the Blu-Ray Edition. These extra’s are only available for the DVD and Blu-Ray Tiers not the digital downloads. •	 The Digital Download version will contain the only documentary. This is a cheap way to see the film and help support us.•	The Sticker of Awesome featuring Lace Wings-anyone that donates 5 dollars will receive the sticker out of our gratitude. We want you to feel as if you got something for helping support us.•	The Dungeon Comic Collector Cups. We will have 4 cups each showcasing one character from The Dungeon Comic. What’s great is if you back our campaign you can vote on which cup you want to get next in the stretch goal. You can even vote if the cup series will be white or black cups. Best part about this reward is if we hit the stretch goal you automatically get the next cup. So if we hit all of our stretch goals you get all of the cups for the price of one!•	Sketch Cover DVDs- We are offering a total of 50 Sketch Cover DVDs. An original color drawing of one of the characters from the Dungeon will be drawn onto the cover of your DVD/Blu Ray Packaging. Please specify if you want the Blu Ray or DVD edition. Note the Blu-Ray will be smaller due to case size.•	Signed DVDs- For a little more you can get your Hardcopy Signed by Host Chris O’Hearn and Artist Shawn Harbin.•	Limited Edition Kickstarter Exclusive The Dungeon Comic Movie Theater Scale Poster- it’s huge! This poster is high quality print measuring 27x40. It has never been available before and is a Kickstarter Exclusive. Limited to only 50 each one will have an original head sketch of a Dungeon character at the bottom of every poster signed by Shawn Harbin and Chris O’Hearn•	80s retro Cartoon Ending Credits-Of course if you back the campaign you can get your name in the film credits, not only would it not be a Kickstarter campaign without it, but it wouldn’t be right. We like to do things different. Sure we could put your name on a black screen and leave it be, but we want people to know YOU helped. So we made it a little more special to ensure people will pay attention.• Art from the film-Shawn will be seen drawing quite a bit in the documentary. Some of these pieces will be available for backer rewards at individual tier levels.•	Chris O’Hearn will provide a special personalized life coaching video as a backer reward.·If we don’t get our funding, we want you tounderstand we appreciate you backing our campaign. If you donate anything andwe fail you will get a digital download of a 30-minute instructional video byThe Dungeon Comic artist Shawn Harbin, FREE. Anyone that backs our campaign can sendin questions that may make it into the Documentary, it may even make it intothis consolation video for nothing more than thanks from us to you.   What we’re trying to do is launch a series of documentariesand The Dungeon Documentary is the first one. Once its complete we obviously want to get it out for theworld to see. Our plan is to print a small run of DVDs and Blu-Ray DVDs.Hopefully show it at some small festivals with aspirations of Itunes andNetflix down the road.   We came to Kickstarter to help finish thedocumentary. We have invested thousands of dollars into it already with traveland equipment. We need better editing software, a new computer, (ours has beenrebuilt several times); we need new cameras, lights and such. It’s become veryfrustrating trying to make this great with the equipment we’ve been using. Themoney raised will pay for the videographer, postproduction, composers,musicians, animators, and graphics designers. We also will use the money forshipping supplies/postage and for the incentives we want to reward you with forbeing our backer. We did a great deal of research to help keep the cost down tooffer them to you at a reasonable price. We also have to pay lawyers, licenses,fees, and taxes, which unfortunately is the most costly aspect of making the film.We also have to pay for the printing of the DVDs and Blu-Ray license. In theend, we want to make the most professional looking documentary that we canpossibly produce and we need your help to do that. Check out our trailer withwhat we have done so far. Imagine if we had better equipment!","Well the obvious challenge is meeting our goal, but other than that it’s pretty simple. Most of the really hard work and cost involves postproduction and the manufacturing of the rewards. We have to hire some people to help with the postproduction so that we can deliver it to you in a timely fashion. Once we hand over the files for the DVDs to be manufactured, the stickers, cups, and posters printed it is out of our control, but we have done a great deal of research to find well-respected, reviewed, and reliable manufacturers. Even learning their return policies on defective items. We want every backer to be happy with his or her rewards. And want to provide you with the best product we can. We will be getting some new software so we have factored in a learning curve and such, but believe it will be worth it in delivering a highly polished and professional product.

Now a local celebrity, Jaynie has it made, but she holds the greatest secret in the town. In truth, she’s Transgender.This Kickstarter Campaign is for the premier issue of Transfurred written and illustrated by Shawn Harbin (creator of The Dungeon Comic: The Most Epic Comic Ever and co-creator of Roadkill Du Jour ). This Kickstarter will fund the printing of Transfurred Issue 1 along with the production of stickers and other prints.While my other comic series The Dungeon Comic: The Most Epic Comic Ever was mainly an R-Rated book, I purposely designed Transfurred to be an ALL AGES BOOK. Of course I want everyone to enjoy it, but I mainly wrote it for teens like Jaynie to have a comic hero they could relate to, but I also wanted to help open a world of acceptance. I made a great effort not to politicize the character or the story, so the comic is in the vein of Saturday morning cartoons. Jaynie is a great detective solving mysteries and fighting monster, she just happens to be trans. I felt by allowing people love Jaynie first as a person, the cause would follow.Knoxville News Sentinel article on Why I made a comic with a transgender hero.The Characters:Jaynie Lain, our hero character, is a master detective, always coming up with a plan to stop whatever monster or baddie that crosses her path.

He's not up for things death defying, scary, or dangerous. Yet, he is her loyal companion, often snatching her out of harms way at last second.

(Which you can check out here.)We spent at least one night in 5 different districts and embraced the friendly personalities of the city.For the past few years I have been undergoing a personal design project focused around the travel and exploration. I am currently working on items representing the trip to Tokyo.Along side the many photos I have taken I would like to create a tangible piece to reference some of thecommon graphic and typographic visuals seen in the captivating city of Tokyo, Japan.This is where we need your help.The visual stimuli that is received by being in the busy stations of Shinjuku or the signs and displays that cover Shibuya, down to the hundreds of snacks you may find inside a Family Mart.

It shows the strength and possibilities of a powerful network of creative talent.The project started off with the thousands of photos we all had collected on our memory cards or cell phones that otherwise would be digital aether.

And you begin to think, ""Is my story beautiful too?""By producing and printing the first Vv True Beauty Collective Book, featuring the women we've photographed and interviewed through our Reveal process, we are endeavoring to change our culture's perception of beauty so that your story, your passions, and your inner and outer beauty are seen for what they are: intrinsically worthwhile, unique, and truly beautiful.

Released in December 2011, the first issue of Tidal (http://bit.ly/AisKLP) offered theoretical and strategic visions of how to transform the existing power structures. In early March, the second issue (http://bit.ly/GXtdUU) looked towards mass actions on May 1st and throughout the spring globally. Tidal is resonating internationally, with the entire first issue translated and printed in Greek, and the second issue ready to print in Spanish.Through mass distribution teams, Tidal is appearing in the streets, the subways, and every other space we occupy.

Released in December 2011, the first issue offered theoretical and strategic visions of how to transform existing power structures. The second issue, Spring is Coming, looked towards May 1 and the history of the General Strike in America and beyond. In August, we completed our third and latest issue, Year II, and are working to distribute it throughout New York City.Through mass distribution teams, Tidal is appearing in the streets, the subways, and every other space we occupy. We also host an open website, where each issue can be downloaded in PDF form.While every issue is freely availble online, a major distinguishing quality of Tidal has been that it is distributed physically, both at OWS actions and assemblies, and in public spaces to the world at large. In advance of OWS' historic reclaiming of May Day, 50,000 copies of Issue 2 were circulated throughout New York City. Indeed, the process of distributing Tidal has been a form of tactical direct action in its own right, as documented in the video producted by Team Tidal. In both its intellectual rigor and its large-scale distribution, Tidal has been recognized as a force to be reckoned with not only by allies on the Left, but also by influentialRight-Wingoutlets such as Andrew Breitbart's talk show The Blaze.We volunteer our time to produce Tidal, and rely solely on donations for printing and distribution costs. As one of the only radical journals of its kind, we think it is critical to sustain momentum within the Occupy movement. Your donation will go toward the printing and distribution of 12,000+ copies of a fourth issue of Tidal. And by donating, you will help carry the word of the movement throughout the world.In addition toprominent theorists David Graeber and Gayatri Chakravorty Spivak, Year II features contributions from members of the Direct Action and Strike Debt committees within the Occupy movement.

The vanguard has sold out to unregulated capital in flow; putting all kinds of debts together and selling them at high risk.

https://www.kickstarter.com/projects/shanewsmith/all-the-kings-men-300-page-anthology?ref=discovery_category_newest,shanewsmith/all-the-kings-men-300-page-anthology,"Latest update: select rewards will still be filled, even if the campaign does not meet its funding targets. All The King's Men is a science-fiction anthology. It's planned to run a mammoth 300 pages, a combination of short prose stories and black and white comics, all stories loosely linked together by theme and/or setting. I will be contributing one or two pieces to this anthology, andthe remainder will be sourced from other writers and artists.All proceeds from this Kickstarter campaign will be used to pay those contributors for their work. There will be no working for exposure, no working for royalties that might never materialise; if it’s good enough to get in the book, it’s worth paying for.This book, when completed, will be submitted to Zetabella Publishing for consideration, who have already offered to me their support and interest in this project. Ultimately, this means that there will be no need to cover book printing costs, no fancy equipment purchases, no huge drunken parties... all the money is going straight into the pockets of anthology contributors. The more funding the anthology attracts, the bigger their payday.All stories will be thematically linked, each exploring in some way the notion that some things are broken, and just cannot be fixed.All The King's Men takes place in the same universe as my previously published works The Lesser Evil, Peaceful Tomorrows, and The Game. Although tied to my previous work, this book will stand on its own, and will not require readers to be familiar with the other books. It's a dystopic sci-fi setting, one where civil wars are political tools, addictive drugs are revenue raisers, and the life of the man in the street is worth about... okay, yeah. As with most dystopic fiction, it's got plenty in common with the world as we know it today. People live, dream and die, and - living under the oppressive boot heel of the Senate - don't get a chance to do much else.It's a big galaxy, and there are many, many untold stories, just waiting to come forth. At the core of all my writing is human drama, emotions, growth, and a parable for the trials of contemporary life. As editor of this work, I’ll be holding all contributors to the same standard, to create a book that I would want to read.Set in a galaxy rife with corruption, oppression and shattered dreams, All The King's Men will be an emotional and intelligent interrogation of defeat, determination, and hopelessness. For more information on the book, including potential stories, and submission guidelines, please visit my website: http://shanewsmith.com/works-in-progress/all-the-kings-men/ Please, support the book. And just as importantly, support the principle this book represents: a fair deal for writers and artists.Although the creative line-up for this anthology will not be confirmed until submissions close in May, there has been considerable interest from a number of extremely talented writers and artists who wish to work on All The King's Men.

And when Frank Tomhines orders him to assassinate a man he once called friend, why is he powerless to resist?There's actually not a whole lot of budget detail to divulge right now. The money is only going to three places. That's it. Every cent that is left over after Kickstarter and fulfilling rewards will go into contributor pockets. No other costs that crop up will be funded by this Kickstarter.If the project meets its minimum funding targets, contributors will be paid:Authors: $0.02 per word ($120 for a 6000 word story)Script writers: $7 per page ($140 for a 20 page script)Artists: $35 per page ($700 for a 20 page story)Based on a survey I conducted late last year, the pay rates on offer at the minimum funding level is at the lower end of acceptable for an indie project. Personally, I would like to pay more to contributors. They’re certainly worth more. The only stretch goals this project has involve increasing the amount of compensation that contributors receive. The more you give, the more they get.The proposed timeline for this project:A survey I conducted late last year attempted to ascertain a fair pay rate for contributors to indie anthologies. While responses were varied, it was not impossible to negotiate a line between principle and reality.A write-up of this survey can be found here. In brief, respondents indicated that between $70-$100 was an appropriate amount to pay a writer for 10 pages of script, and somewhere in the vicinity of $300 was appropriate to pay an artist. This was by no means a comprehensive study, nor is it necessarily a fair rate of pay for contributors, but it was generally deemed an acceptable rate for small-time projects. The amount paid to contributors will be entirely dependent upon the level of success this campaign enjoys, but pay rates will not fall beneath:Authors: $0.02 per wordScript writers: $7.00 per pageArtists: $35.00 per pageAll contributors will be offered a contract that provides for payment upon completion of the commissioned work. These payments are in lieu of royalties, and the entire transaction will be treated as a work-for-hire arrangement. This approach was overwhelmingly favoured by respondents in the survey. The contracts will contain deadlines for production, which will facilitate the timely delivery of the anthology.In the interest of transparency, I will be making all details of the contracts available publicly. Below are drafts of the contracts that will be provided to contributors.Author Contract: http://shanewsmith.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/02/MoA_draft-Author.docScriptwriter Contract: http://shanewsmith.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/02/MoA_draft-Scriptwriter.docArtist Contract: http://shanewsmith.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/02/MoA_draft-Artist.docIt's all very well to be championing a cause, but it's even better to get something in return. I've done my best to pull out all the stops with regards to the reward structure. With the blessing of my publisher, I have been given permission to make my entire back catalogue of books available to backers. There's some amazing content available here in addition to All The King's Men, including a huge range of exclusive stories and artwork that aren't available from any other source.If the funding campaign for All The King's Men falls short of its target, backers will still be rewarded for their support of the project. Obviously, the anthology itself will not exist, but other rewards will still be provided. Here's how it will work.All pledges of $10 or more that are still active when the project closes will receive The Long Road Home as a reward... regardless of whether this campaign makes its target!All pledges of $150 or more that are still active when the project closes will receive The Long Road Home, The Lesser Evil, and Peaceful Tomorrows PDFs as a reward... regardless of whether this campaign makes its target!All pledges of $200 or more that are still active when the project closes will receive The Long Road Home, The Lesser Evil, and Peaceful Tomorrows PDFs, and the first unpublished issue of Triumviratus as a reward... regardless of whether this campaign makes its target!All pledges of $400 or more that are still active when the project closes will receive all of the above, except the issue of Triumviratus won't be digital; it will be printed, signed, and will feature an exclusive never-to-be-seen-again cover. If the campaign isn't funded, backers will not be charged a cent, but will still receive the awesome rewards outlined above. Please make a pledge, and support All The King's Men, and the principle of fair pay for the artistic community.","There are two primary risks with this project that I can see. One is that the book will not be produced on schedule, and the other is that it may not be published as hoped by Zetabella Publishing.1. What happens if contributors fail to deliver on deadline?I'm hoping to work with around 20-25 contributors on this book, so it is certainly a possibility that at least one will not be able to meet the agreed-upon deadlines.I will be monitoring the progress of the book throughout, so there shouldn't be any last-minute surprises. Should an artist be slipping behind deadline, I intend to be as accommodating as possible within the bounds of the contract signed by the artist. I'll remain in contact with the contributor, and through negotiation, we will determine whether or not the artist should continue to work on the project.  Should a contributor drop out midway through the project, it may be possible for me to offer the incomplete work to another contributor, or tackle it myself, without incurring too significant a delay (as each individual story is reasonably short).There is a chance this will impact delivery dates for rewards, but the consequences are unlikely to be more severe than that. The book will still be made, and delivered.2. What happens if the book isn't picked up by Zetabella?I have attempted to mitigate this risk by obtaining in-principle approval of this project from Zetabella, but (of course) they will reserve the right to make their final decision once they see the book. Should Zetabella elect not to publish the book, there are still several options open to me. I intend to submit it to a number of publishers first; should no interest be forthcoming, I can publish it myself. The money set aside for purchasing the books for the reward tiers will simply be sent directly to a POD printer instead of a publisher. I anticipate no major cost blow-out, and can cover incidental costs out of my own pocket.I always planned to start my own publishing company one day. This might be an opportunity to get a jump start on that.There are risks with any project, of course, but my commitment is rock solid. Please help me make this vision a reality, a beacon for the fair pay cause, and a damn good book besides.",https://www.kickstarter.com/projects/shanewsmith/undad-comic-miniseries-season-2?ref=discovery_category_newest,shanewsmith/undad-comic-miniseries-season-2,"Thanks for checking out this project. My name is Shane W Smith. I'm a two-time Aurealis Award finalist, and the creator and writer of the Undad comic series.In November and December of last year, I ran a Kickstarter campaign for the first Undad miniseries. Thanks to the generosity of ninety backers, the campaign raised enough (140% of its original goal)to get all four issues made and published as a trade paperback. The first Undad book is now available to purchase in both ebook and paperback formats. It is also available to backers of this campaign (see the rewards sidebar for all the options).With the backing of Deeper Meanings Publishing, and Creative Partnerships Australia, I hope that we can make lightning strike twice, and produce a second Undad miniseries that finishes the story off, and pushes it in brave new directions.The MATCH program gave me an irresistible chance to explore some of the options for an Undad sequel that I'd already started to process conceptually.Thanks to Creative Partnerships Australia’s MATCH program, every dollar you give to this campaign will be matched dollar for dollar, provided we reach our campaign target of $3500.This program provides us with a unique opportunity to create a high-quality book for a relatively low investment. If this campaign reaches its relatively modest goal of $3500, I will receive $7000 to produce this book with. This has given me a chance to hire some great artists for the book, to really push up against the boundaries of what small-time indie publications can ordinarily achieve. In Volume One of Undad, Brett Buckley unexpectedly became a zombie. His transformation was the centrepoint of a story that saw him desperately trying to reconnect with his family, while keeping his status a secret from them. Eventually, the delicate balance was sundered, and he was forced to reveal all his secrets to them. Brett always knew his days were numbered. But he wasn't expecting that number to be so small. Someone has discovered his hidden stash of live food. He is facing animal abuse charges. His job is hanging by a thread. His kids and wife are facing public humiliation. And that's just the small stuff. Over the course of the miniseries, Brett's daughter will be picked up for shoplifting, his son will start to exhibit some strange and deviant behaviour, his wife will learn to adjust to life without him, and his layabout brother will blow into town to complicate matters just that little bit more...As Brett's stable bases and safety nets drop away one by one, he realises that un-life can't go on in the way that he'd hoped. Big changes are coming for Brett... none of them good. But on the other hand, he may discover that he's not quite as alone as he'd assumed...Undad is not about the zombie apocalypse. It’s not about the decay of humanity. It’s about one man who struggles to keep his own darker nature at bay and his family together, while feeling (literally) dead inside. His world begins and ends in the family home; its implosion is the apocalypse he is struggling to avoid.Here's an issue by issue breakdown. Warning: potential spoilers.It would have been impossible to keep quiet. A man arrested for breeding and eating live animals was always going to be big news. It’s turned Katrina into a social pariah, though. The kids at school mock her mercilessly for her father’s deviant behaviour, and her boyfriend, unable to handle the pressure, splits with her. Distraught by this shift, she finds that she is equally adrift at home, with everyone else preoccupied trying to organise Brett’s defence. It’s at about this time that her uncle blows into town, probably to capitalise on the free publicity generated by his brother's arrest. He has time to spare for Katrina, but his influence serves to land her in even deeper water... “Dare you to eat it!” Brett’s arrest has caused the other kids Jason’s age to encourage mimicry. Jason’s willingness to eat carrion is obviously a reaction to losing access to his dad, but it also gets him noticed by a group of older kids, whose claim to individuality is that they bite each other. Veronica has noticed these changes, but is powerless to prevent them. She knows that Jason is struggling to process what has happened to Brett, but fears that he could do himself irreparable harm before it all plays out. Only Brett can turn him around, and even then only through an act of supreme personal sacrifice... Today would have been their fifteenth anniversary. Veronica is missing Brett, badly. Her friends tell her that she's better off, and publicly she agrees with them. Privately, though, she has her doubts.She still has nightmares about what he has become though. As hard as it is to be a working single mother, she's realised that Brett can't be allowed back in. Veronica's friends set her up on a blind date, which she reluctantly goes on. The date doesn't go well, and she tries to call Brett - her only confidant of the last fifteen years - to talk about it.Little does she know that Brett had already seen her out with another man, and is about to lose control in the worst possible way...This is as low as it gets. Brett has been picked up by the police, again. He's lost his job, his family, and is about to lose whatever freedom still remains to an undead man under attack from within.Now he's walking back home. The rain thunders down around him as he trudges across a long bridge over a river. It's a long way down.He jumps... and awakens to find a woman leaning over him.""You're not like them,"" she says.""You're like me.""A lost chapter from the first Undad miniseries. This issue will only be made if the Kickstarter campaign raises $5500.Easter is approaching, and Brett is going through a crisis of faith, the first one he has ever had. His kids both have difficult questions for him that once upon a time he could have answered easily, but now struggles with. Lost in existential crisis, he heads into his church after hours for answers, but finds only more questions.

This mistake was offset somewhat by the subsequent birth of three loyal minions who keep her entertained. She doesn't yet hold any official writing credits, but has in the past saved several of Shane's books from their embarrassing shortcomings, in the editing stage. Katie will be taking a more active writing role in Undad Volume Two, and will be co-writing at least two issues. Her keen eye for detail, her unique perspective on life, and her deep intuitive understanding of what makes a story satisfying make Katie an invaluable addition to the Undad team.

Issue 1 of the series can be read in its entirety for the duration of this campaign. Here are some pages to give you a feel for the different aesthetic of each issue so far.Here is a preview page from early in Issue 5, in which we see seven-year-old Jason doing what any well-meaning young boy would do upon learning that his father was a zombie.No matter whether you have $1 or $100 to invest, there's something here for you. It's important to know that when you make a pledge,Kickstarter will not take the money out of your account instantly. Instead, the money will be taken at the end of the funding period (May 29, 7:30pm), and only if the campaign reaches its funding target.So if you were thinking about making a pledge, it's important to remember to ask yourself the right question. It's not ""Can I afford this now?"" It's ""Can I afford this at 7:30pm on May 29?""Around 10% goes to Kickstarter right off the bat, with various fees and charges. The rest of the money raised will be split pretty evenly down the middle, with around half going to the Undad artists for their work, and the rest going to fulfilling the reward tiers you sign up for. The one and only stretch goal for the campaign has been reached, thanks to the unexpected arrival of some away-from-Kickstarter finances.Undad Volume Two will include an extra issue, bringing its page total up from 160 to 200 pages. The extra money will be used to hire a fourth artist to produce the artwork for this issue. The additional printing/postage costs will be minimal. The bonus issue will be a forgotten chapter from Volume One, which was cut due to financial constraints, and deals with Brett wrestling with his kids' inquisitive questions and his own faith at Easter time.Work has already begun on Undad. Initial artist payments have come out of my mortgage; I will recover the funds from the Kickstarter pledges. As work has started before the end of the campaign, this should shorten the production schedule, which is good news for everyone.All reward tiers will be filled as soon as possible. Digital content will be released on a staggered schedule, as it becomes available. Physical goods may be held over and shipped together in one package, though Undad Volume One will be shipped as soon as the campaign is funded. I've entered a tentative goal of November 2015 for both digital goods and paperbacks. In all likelihood this is a significant overestimation. ","Undad Book 1 is completed and published. Most of the rewards are being finalised and sent out at the time this project is going live. While this means a bigger workload for me initially, I don't anticipate this will create any unreasonable delays in the production of Book 2. The plotting for Book 2 is pretty much complete, and scripting has begun in earnest. I am a focused and committed person with an extensive publishing history. I've been shortlisted for the Aurealis Award twice, so I'm reasonably confident (without sacrificing due modesty) that if I bring my A-game, Undad will be a good book. The budget has been fairly carefully calculated, and I am in pretty good physical health (touch wood), so there is really only one major risk with this project that I can see: that the artwork for the funded book will not be produced on schedule. I have faith in my artists, as they were hired for (in addition to their talents) their professional approach to their work.I will be monitoring the progress of the book throughout, so there shouldn't be any last-minute surprises. There is a chance that an unexpected delay will impact delivery dates for rewards, but the consequences are unlikely to be more severe than that. The book will still be made, and delivered, and I'll be doing everything I can to ensure that it happens on time.In all these cases, I will be in constant communication with backers, and intend to be as open and forthcoming about revised delivery dates as possible. I want to get this right, and I want everyone to walk away happy."

Additionally, according to a 2011 study of 6,000 children's books, only 31 percent had central female characters.* We believe that stories shape our world, and that it is critically important to provide stories and main characters that all kids can identify with.The Young Explorer’s Adventure Guide is meant to fill that gap.We’re creating an anthology of age appropriate stories that all kids can identify with.  We have great stories, from a wide range of writers and a diverse set of characters – girls, boys, robots… everyone belongs here!Of the stories we've accepted so far, 80% have female main characters. We don't have girls who are prizes to be won, or waiting to be rescued. All of our heroines and heroes are on their own adventure, not a side note in someone else's.Sally Ride, first woman in space and Presidential Medal of Freedom recipient, famously said:""Young girls need to see role models in whatever careers they may choose, just so they can picture themselves doing those jobs someday. You can’t be what you can’t see.""Girls need to read stories where any number of possible roles are modeled for them. Just as importantly, boys need to read stories where girls are active participants in adventures.Help a new generation of kids reach for the stars. Support the 2014 Young Explorer’s Adventure Guide.*The study is ""Gender in Twentieth-Century Children's Books: Patterns of Disparity in Titles and Central Characters."" The results are also discussed in thisGuardian article.In our pages, readers will find stories about the care and feeding of pet robots, discovering what it means to be human (and whether it matters), how much trouble a superpower can get you into, what it means to survive past the end of the world you know, the secret of the best cheesecake in the universe, and many, many more!Ninety percent of our stories are brand new works.The majority of the stories have already been written and are undergoing editing as we speak.

If you'd like more information about the project, come on over and drop us a line!Sally Ride, first American woman in space and Presidential Medal of Freedom recipient, famously said:“Young girls need to see role models in whatever careers they may choose, just so they can picture themselves doing those jobs someday. You can’t be what you can’t see.”Girls need to read stories where any number of possible roles are modeled for them. Just as importantly, boys need to read stories where girls are active participants in adventures. And children of all colors and backgrounds need to know the future includes them.According to a 2011 study of 6,000 children’s books, only 31 percent had central female characters, and even fewer featured main characters of color.A genre that’s supposed to inspire us towards a bright future isn’t making space for half the population’s dreams. Boys go and have adventures, girls are to be defended, or prizes to be won, and the landscape is very, very white.It’s time for a bigger universe.We've got a great collection of 20 stories from amazing authors, ranging from Nebula and Hugo winners to relative newcomers to the field.   90% of the stories in the anthology are brand new, and 80% have central female characters.We don't have girls who are prizes to be won or waiting to be rescued. All of our heroines and heroes are on their own adventure, not a side note in someone else's.Our characters are white, black, asian, latino. Human and robot. Everyone belongs here.Marilag Angway started her foray into science fiction and fantasy sometime in the early ’90s by reading books written by females for females. She had no idea that these books were far and few at the time, and feels lucky to have had the opportunity to be inspired by female authors to think big and never stop imagining. When she isn’t scribbling her mind away, she’s lending what brainpower she has left to a good cause: the molding of preschool minds. Gotta start them young, right?

Those were the days!Although a classic kids toy, glow sticks can be super dangerous if they break, and there really has not been much advancement to develop a better version of this party handout over the years. Imagine harnessing that glow-ey awesomeness into something that isn't scary toxic like our old friend the glow stick, with the added bonus of not being disposable either!This is what we want to do here at Ready, Set, Glow! Help us make our dream come true and fund our project to create the first kid's clothing line that uses the power of photoluminescence to make every design come to life and light!Say so long to the days of just a little bit of white ink that might glow green or needing a blacklight to glow in the dark, our clothing line will take full advantage of a rainbow of glowing inks, allowing each design to not only pop during the day, but be even more dynamic at night! Stick the design under any UV light, including the Sun, for just a few seconds and glow for hours on end, wash after wash!To start our project off, Ready, Set, GLOW! will be printing up the two designs that are pictured below, one that fits with more a girly style, and one which fits more of a boyish style. All t-shirts will be screen printed by hand on 100% cotton t-shirts or sweatshirts. The pictures below will give you an idea of what each will look like printed during the day(on a t-shirt or hoodie) and what it will look like glowing at night.The beginning of our Ready, Set, GLOW! line will incorporate sizing for children ages 6+. T-shirts will be offered in youth sizes XS-XL, and sweatshirts will be offered in sizes 8-12, with the hope of expand to toddler sizing too, soon after launch.What makes these shirts so special? Our photoluminescent or Glow in the Dark inks!Every shirt's design is made in our one-of-a-kind inks, allowing you to glow all night with just exposing the shirt's design to any UV light, including the Sun, for just a few seconds! No blacklight needed to glow in the dark!Not only are our shirts totally suited for kids, with our inks being water-based, eco-friendly and phthalate-free, they are also 100% kid-approved with their bright, fun colors and awesome glow effect! We have tested these inks and have examples of how everything will glow from our adult's clothing line, Visible Spectrum Clothing,that has been up and running for the past 3 years. Using the knowledge gained from our experiences with the other line, systems have been set in place to get our blanks and printing done in a timely manner. Check out the video above to get a better idea of how bright these inks really do glow!Each reward has specifics on what you will receive depending on what you donate. Once the project is funded, you will receive a follow up message to choose not only your size(s), but also your desired t-shirt and/or sweatshirt color, along with the design. We will be offering Navy and Black t-shirts or sweatshirts for you to choose from for our first print, as these darker bases really make our inks pop!By donating to this project, Ready, Set, GLOW! will be able to get past the initial stages of set up. Funds raised will be used to establish our website and company, and print up initial stock for sale, which will include kid's unisex tees and sweatshirts perfect for the upcoming colder months.We want to be able to create the first 100% kid's glow in the dark clothing line to allow each and every child to GLOW as bright as we know they can be, and this cannot be done without the love and support of people like you!

I am looking at quilting and donating a minimum of 40+ quilts a year. These quilts would be given to each youth that enters the center and would be theirs to keep with them when they leave.My long term goal is to involve coordinators in other cities and help them establish local chapters of Quilts of Support. I will be launching a website at quiltsofsupport.com within the next couple of weeks.Anything raised over the goal amount will be used to purchase additional fabrics, quilt batting, threads and to update the website.","The main challenge we may encounter is time.

We have reached 100% of the initial funding and this means the project is a go and all rewards will be fulfilled.I won't offer any additional rewards for stretch goals. I believe that initial backers shouldn't see a new reward available after 100% funding is reached. The reward levels will remain unchanged.The stretch goal/items are additional items that allow me to offer more with vectorQuilts. The ELMO would allow me to present my sewing and piecing onto a tv or overhead projector without carrying a huge video camera setup to classes.The BlackMagic live video capture devices will allow me to introduce and schedule monthly or bi-monthly live video feeds for demonstrations, show quilters how to piece an item they are having difficulty with and do more Q & A sessions.The 1TB SSD would allow me to spend less time editing and rendering my videos and focus more on pattern design and videos.To celebrate Kickstarter's #make100 I am doing a limited edition of the Star Voyage and Tribal Star foundation patterns.My intention is to provide superior, accessible tutorials and quilt patterns in an easy to understand format, where anyone can attend from the comfort of their own space. I appreciate all the feedback everyone has given so far on how these lessons have helped and inspired them.When you back this Kickstarter, all funds will go toward creating more videos and the more frequent development and release of new (and exciting) patterns. It will allow me to bring Tribal Star and Star Voyage into production by early Spring 2017. The $3500 goal will allow me to purchase fabric stock for kits, pay for the pattern printing and setup the online store.While I have a timeline for doing this on my own, with your support I can decrease that timeline substantially. Your support will allow me to offer patterns quicker and eventually offer more classes outside the metro Atlanta area.When I filmed my first video, it was never my intention for so many people to see it.  I actually did it to demonstrate paper piecing to a friend. To my surprise, there was an overwhelming response from people who told me how much it helped them understand the process. It has over 14k views on FB https://www.facebook.com/dgilleland74/videos/10209255857927969/and 1k views on YouTube. This led to another video, which resulted in messages asking when to expect the next one.

https://www.kickstarter.com/projects/wyrdleatherandmead/wyrd-leather-and-mead-shop-kickstarter?ref=discovery_category_newest,wyrdleatherandmead/wyrd-leather-and-mead-shop-kickstarter,"Hey guys!We (Travis Sigler and Tayler Toll) are in the works of opening a leather goods and locally brewed mead store in the Portland area named Wyrd Leather and Mead. We havebeen best pals for over a decade, we now are wishing to open our own shop together focusing on things we are super passionate about! We have already begun all the legal work and everything is in the process of being registered through the state, but we need your help!The shop will contain a variety of leather goods such as belts, household items, costume accessories, apparel, and more!Also within the shop, we will be brewing our own homemade mead made from local Oregon honey! Many different flavors will be available.Starting a new business from scratch isn't easy. We will need a shop space, the brewing equipment, shop materials to start out with on both the leather and mead side of things, the build out fees in case any remodeling is needed (It is likely that we will have to build a dark room for the mead), funds to get by for at least 3 months of space rent while we get things rolling to serve as our safety bubble, licensing fees (OLCC), etc.With your help, we believe we can get our business kickstarted and can soon open!Follow us on Facebook and Instagram!","A risk that we may encounter is finding an adequate space that will allow us to brew and also craft. Our goal is to treat the mead side of our shop similar to how a kitchen would be ran at restaurant and cleanliness will be a top priority. A vent may be needed for when we boil our honey, but we will mention all of this and our concerns up front to the person potentially leasing our space. Another risk is that remodeling may push our open date back a bit, which is why we are asking for your help to fund at least a few months space rent (included in our overall goal) to make sure we are covered while getting things set up.",https://www.kickstarter.com/projects/wyrdleatherandmead/building-the-meadery-at-wyrd-leather-and-mead?ref=discovery_category_newest,wyrdleatherandmead/building-the-meadery-at-wyrd-leather-and-mead,"Hey everyone!We are Wyrd Leather and Mead in Milwaukie, Oregon and we are reaching out on Kickstarter to request assistance from the amazing community of friends and followers to help us build our meadery!This Kickstarter is to help us build out the meadery side of our shop. We will need to make plumbing modifications to our space, including the addition of two sinks and some changes to the drain system, in order to gain approval from the Oregon Department of Agriculture. They are the last gatekeeper standing between us and our ability to provide our customers with the best, locally brewed mead.Earlier in 2018, we launched a Kickstarter to help us get our shop space and perform any necessary build-out. However, we set our initial campaign goal too high. So despite an amazing amount of support, we did not hit the goal and so all of the pledges were canceled.But we would not accept defeat; we pushed on and got our space. The leatherworking side of the business has been a resounding success now that we have a storefront. Meanwhile, we submitted the applications to obtain licensing to brew alcohol at every level (federal, state, and county), and have finally gotten the green light. We are officially licensed to brew!There is no other shop quite like ours. We supply handcrafted leather goods ranging from your everyday belt or bracelet to specialty fantasy-themed pieces and leather armor, and the overwhelmingly positive feedback from our home-brew testing proves that once our mead is flowing, people will be singing it's praises all across the land.We need your help to take it to the next level! Will you heed the call?","Risks and challenges we may encounter are any requirements that the OLCC requires us to do for the meadery. We might have to add things such as a better floor drain, plumbing, etc. If there are any other challenges along the way in regards to backers we will let them know and keep everyone in the loop as we progress."
https://www.kickstarter.com/projects/dannylabrecque/tree-house-with-danny-labrecque?ref=discovery_category_newest,dannylabrecque/tree-house-with-danny-labrecque,"A message from my friend and mentor, Eliot DaleyWhy the retro 1950s look?Sometimes to move forward, we need to go back. In addition to being heavily influenced and inspired by the work of Fred Rogers, I’m also an avid student of other pioneers of children’s television including, but not limited to, Burr Tillstrom of Kukla, Fran and Ollie, Frances Horwich of Ding Dong School and Bob Homme of The Friendly Giant. Each of the hundreds of hosts from the golden age of children’s television (of both national and local fame) were uniquely different in style and delivery, but they all shared certain characteristics that reflected this early period of children’s television at its best. Each program listened to its audience and responded directly to the needs of that time. They were available to their audiences not only on screen, but also through live events and correspondence. Drop-board openings, canvas sets, miniature dioramas, simple hand puppets and a real connection with the viewers at home through a single camera frame made for a level of sincerity that is difficult to find in today's commercialized, fast-paced, auto-tuned, animated bombardment.Through consistency and repetition, trusting relationships were established over long periods of time. I believe that all of these factors lead to what I like to call “lasting emotional integrity” with the viewing family. There was nothing to hide behind in these classics--what you saw was what you got. These were real human beings. They were trusted friends. I’ve studied the visual and performing arts, and I spent a period of my life as a stage actor, but I won’t be acting on this program. Like the television educators that I consider to be my predecessors, I will offer you my true self on and off the screen.  Bill Jackson, best known for his many local Chicago programs, including The BJ and Dirty Dragon Show and Gigglesnort Hotel, once taught me that the key to puppetry is respect. Respect the puppet as you would respect the child.Why a Tree House?My grandfather used to make treehouses--really, they were deer spots--but knowing what a sensitive child I was, he waited to tell me their main use until I was older.  Together we spent hours high up in the trees talking and laughing, eating picnics and just listening to the sounds of nature.  It was a safe place that I remember fondly. When I decided to make a children’s program, I knew that I would need a thematic environment that represented slowing down and connection with a trusted adult caregiver. What child doesn’t want a tree house to call their own?I often remind children and adults that nature is everywhere--you just have to look for it. When we feel overwhelmed, no matter how old we are, our connection to nature can make us feel safe and empowered. This was a gift that my grandfather gave me and it's one that I try to share with every child I meet.The FormatEvery other Saturday morning, I’ll climb into my Tree House studio and introduce a topic inspired by a developmental milestone and/or current event. I’ll use the process of abstraction through play to safely and objectively guide your family’s examination of that topic within the guidelines of developmentally-appropriate practice. And then we’ll review our new-found strategies through an open-ended art project. This format isn’t complex. It’s simple. And there is no longer anything like it on commercial television. In the tradition of Fred Rogers, I’ll engage through the passive screen to connect with each individual child, but I’ll also take advantage of the technologies that literally allow us to talk with each other through the screen. At the end of each program, I’ll invite parents and caregivers to sign up to participate in a sort of parent/teacher conference through Google+ Hangouts On Air, which will later be tagged on the corresponding episode. During this time we’ll discuss that week’s theme and objectives. You’ll also be able to compare experiences related to the featured theme with other parents and caregivers from around the country. I’ll act as the facilitator for this conversation. The discussion can be continued by other parents and caregivers well after the video has posted through the comment window. All of these interactions will guide future topics within the program. We parents and caregivers and educators need just as much social-emotional support as our children do.  In fact, without it, it can sometimes be very difficult to fully support our children’s needs. Tree House has the potential to become a community--an extension and reflection of each participating family. The planWith your support, over the course of 2016/17, I plan to produce and release 22 20-minute webisodes through YouTube with accompanying Google+ Hangouts OnAir ""parent/teacher conferences"". There will be no fees or subscriptions to view Tree House with Danny LaBrecque. Each webisode can be viewed in its entirety or as a playlist of 4 individual segments, including the conference. Your donations will go toward proper production tools, like lighting and sound equipment, and build-out of a more permanent studio space. Funding will also be used for high-speed internet to support the parent/teacher Group Hangouts and materials to complete my set, props and puppets. And finally, I’ll need time. I don’t have a production team or a writing staff. I research and test the content in local schools, libraries and online. I write the scripts, design and build the sets, create and operate the puppets, write the music and host the program.  Not for saleI will absolutely not sell you products or endorse products on or off the program. The only time that related “products” will be available to the public will be through this Kickstarter campaign as part of the established rewards/incentives system. I feel very strongly that children should not be marketed to, directly or indirectly. In my mind, children and their parents and caregivers are not consumers that should be targeted through their media. I believe that lasting loyalty is built through trust and relationship--something that I will have to earn in time. The puppets, games, and activities that will be featured on Tree House can be easily reproduced and/or built upon with items found around the house and/or outside. TimelineJune: Order and distribute rewards/incentives (time may vary depending upon response and demand)May-July: Build studio, set, props and puppets. Install lighting and sound equipment.August: Test Google + Hangouts On Air. Test and finalize first half of scripts. Begin on-set production and editing for initial episodes.September: First episode is released on Saturday, September 3. New episodes (22 in all) released every other Saturday morning. Learn moreOver the years, within my limited means, I’ve been able to produce just a few programs ranging from my original concept, Danny Joe’s Tree House, to the more recent Emotional Guidance video tests for this new program. I encourage you to view those pieces on YouTube to gain a clearer understanding of my evolution in approach.Emotional Guidance Puppetry, 2015 (24:19)Emotional Guidance After A Tragic Event Through Dramatic Play, 2015 (19:11)“Separation Anxiety” Hand Ballet, 2015 (1:51)Danny Joe’s Tree House: Squirrels, 2008 (19:08)Danny Joe’s Tree House: What is Nature?, 2010 (31:15)Danny Joe’s Tree House: Little Bird Song, 2012 (2:01)The two images above show a visual formula I started to develop during an independent research visit to The Fred Rogers Archive at The Fred Rogers Center for Early Learning & Children’s Media at Saint Vincent College the summer of 2014. My specific interest at that time was in facilitating conversations between young children and their parents and caregivers affected by first and secondary experiences with gun violence, without adding to or creating new emotional stress. The Emotional Guidance videos came out of this research.A detailed podcast interview from 2013 about my history and goalsThe Neighborhood Archive- All Things Mister Rogershttp://neighborhoodarchive.com/articles/20131123_podcast24/index.html“For anyone interested in up-and-coming children's education, DannyLaBrecque is a name sure to become more familiar.

Your rewards will be sent out shortly after the campaign has officially ended.After some careful thought, I’ve decided to add a small stretch goal, as we still have 12 days remaining until the campaign officially ends. I designed and built each Tree House puppet, but when it came to their costumes, I needed to enlist the help of my friend, Colleen King Lacy. Colleen is a gifted seamstress and was able to turn my sketches into realities. My plan was to switch the original costumes from the clay puppet heads over to the new 3D print puppet heads, but now with continued support, I’d like to have Colleen make new costumes, so the originals can remain complete.Also, Teddy Bear is pushing 50 years old and after decades of love, he is becoming worn down to his stuffing. Colleen and I believe we can make a close-to-exact replica of Teddy, so that he can retire from the in-school Tree House puppetry programs and his successor can take on the heavy lifting. The stretch goal is $500.00. This will cover materials and creation. We’ll produce a new promotional video over the weekend for this stretch goal, but for now, please continue to share the link to the campaign with our new plan.  kck.st/2FttCP5 Thank you once again!Danny JoeWhat is Danny Joe’s Tree House?Danny Joe’s Tree House is a live-action, retro, children’s web series that fosters social-emotional learning in the digital age. We use the language of play to respectfully reflect and respond to specific experiences of the families we serve through passive and interactive screen. Children naturally project their thoughts, ideas and feelings onto puppets. If caregivers are listening very carefully, we can gain a clear understanding of the child’s experience and respond with age-appropriate guidance and support.You can learn more about our work on and off screen through this recent feature in Baltimore’s Child Magazine.http://baltimoreschild.com/2018/02/06/web-connection/The Tree House PuppetsInfluenced by the classic kids’ shows of children’s television, including Kukla, Fran and Ollie, Howdy Doody, Captain Kangaroo, and my favorite, Mister Rogers’ Neighborhood, I created the majority of the Tree House puppets to reflect the golden age of children’s media. I lovingly hand-crafted each Tree House puppet out of clay. That medium allowed me to create endearing and expressive characters within my limited financial means, but after less than a year of use on screen and in the classroom, they are beginning to chip and and crack! There are no back ups of these new, beloved characters. Each puppet weighs close to 4 pounds, which, when balanced on the end of my index finger for more than a few minutes, creates muscle and joint discomfort that compounds with continued use.Our Partner: Custom 3D StuffWith your support, we will partner with artist, Todd Blatt, of Baltimore-based Custom 3D Stuff to create long-lasting, durable and light-weight exact 3D replicas of each Tree House puppet head. If we surpass our goal, we would make secondary back-ups for each puppet—and potentially miniature finger-puppets for fans of Danny Joe’s Tree House!http://www.custom3dstuff.comWatch Danny Joe’s Tree HouseHere are a few brief clips from Danny Joe’s Tree House.

We stop by an empty parking lot at a nearby Middle School, where I observe a few cars lined up in a circle (literally one behind another in a circle). It looks very strange, but doesn't seem like a drug deal or anything illegal. It's actually relatively well-lit. I can see that each driver has the window rolled down, and they seem to be chatting with each other. At this point I have no idea what I'm witnessing... The passenger asks me to drive into the circle. I'm like, ""what is this?""""You don't know what this is,"" my passenger chuckles.""No, should I?!""""Yes, this is a gay sex ring. You see how there are some people driving forwards in the circle, and other cars are driving backwards in the circle""""Yes, I can see that...""""Well, what happens is we drive around in the circle, find a partner we'd like to share the evening with, and one of us parks our cars, and we go off to have sex in the other car.""""Wow...You're kidding me ... but what's the significance of the drivers driving in reverse?""""There are pitchers and there are catchers.""(SPEECHLESS)He continues, ""So, once we finish, we go back to the 24 hour fitness, shower, and repeat the process. I took an Uber back here, because my last partner was done for the evening.""""Geez...this is real? Is this legal.""""Chris, we're not criminals, we're just fags. Don't worry, I'll get out here.""I'm truly amazed that this type of activity exists. Ahem... also going to make a memo for myself to make sure to wear sandals when I shower at 24 hour from now. Let's Uber on! DOG-WALKERS(UBER recommends passengers contact drivers to make sure it's okay to bring the dog. Drivers can refuse due to allergies, odor, etc.)I picked up a dog-walker, and a dog from a home in San Francisco, we drove roughly 3-4 miles, I let him out, and he asked me to wait in the car for a few minutes. Observing from the car, I see the dog-walker take a quicktwofie with the dog in a nice serene spot, and texting the pic it to someone (he let me know later it was the owner). Then he got back in my car, and we returned back to the original house. Scandalous! After asking him about his dog-walking process,he said he was not 100% against it, in fact he thought he was doing the owners a FAVOR, since the dogs seem to quite enjoy the car ride. Hmm, I didn't counter that the certainly were NOT getting their exercise. I have witnessed this process on multiple accounts in San Francisco, with one passenger repeating this process twice to walk2 separate dogs from 2 different homes. Good grief, people can beSketchy!LAKE MERRITT CAT LADY(Not what you'd expect, woman in her early 30's)I receive a call, ""Hey Christopher, just want to let you know. I'm not weird, but I'd like to take my cat for a drive. Is that okay?"" (uBer lets passengers call Drivers through a discrete phone number using Twilio) Hmm, anyone that starts a sentence with, ""I'm not weird, but...""I respond, ""Sure... No judgement here, if you'd like to take your cat for a drive, that's perfectly fine, I have no allergies.""""Great! Oh first I need to catch the cat! Silly me, I should've done that before calling the uBer. Go ahead and start the fare, be down shortly!""I proceed to drive the passenger around for 25 minutes, including a short pit-stop to get her Carne Asada Steak fries from Tacos Mi Rancho, a fantastically popular taco truck near the lake. Her big fluffy white cat did not especially enjoy the ride, meowing frequently towards the end, almost as if speaking to me, ""Why am I in your car?"" Jane didn't talk much, she was giving me directions where to go, until suddenly she announced, ""Okay, I'm good, take me home now.""The truth is stranger than fiction. I've heard from other passengers that cats need to be acclimated to cars before going on road-trips, perhaps that was the reason she took the cat on a ride, but it seemed like more of a spiritual experience since she didn't speak much. Apparently, I've heard this isn't uncommon in Oakland. In Oakland, where I picked her up, there is also the nations first cat cafe, CatTown. Hmm, I've yet to pick up a cat-walker though. MUNCHIES RUN #1(Hey, it never hurts to ask...)I guess when you're in the service industry, people literally ask for all kinds of things. I personally love munchie runs, they're hilarious. MUNCHIES: ""Hey UBER driver, we're super duper really really CRAZY high, here's $20, can you get as much Taco Bell as possible?""Chris: ""They have other services for that dude, I'm not a munchies delivery service.""MUNCHIES: ""Seriously man, we can't even stand up right now, we're too high, can you help us? Please. There's a Taco Bell on Telegraph, please help us, this is really important.""Chris: ""Can one of you come with me?""MUNCHIES: ""No, just keep the meter running like we're going with you. Most of us can't even stand up. We'll give you $40, get some tacos for yourself too!""Chris: ""Just come with me.""MUNCHIES: ""Fine. I'll come with you, but if I come with you, you have to let us smoke you out for being so fu*&king cool!""Chris: ""Dude, you can't smoke me out, I'm driving people around.""MUNCHIES: ""Oh, right right. We'll just give it to you, you can smoke it after you're done driving. UBER says tipping is forbidden, so we just give our driver's weed.""So munchies is one thing, but I've also literally received a list of items to get from Trader Joe's, Target AND Safeway from one request and been barked at, ""Go get this for me,thanks. Let me know how much it is and I'll add it as a tip on the app."" Hmm,There's so many things wrong with this scenario, including which the fact there are no tips through the Uber app. THE ""COME IN MY HOUSE FOR A SECOND"" LADY(Umm, no.)LADY: ""Hey UBER driver, do you mind coming in to change a lightbulb for me?""Chris: ""Umm, I'm not going to do that, thanks though. I don't really want to go in your house.""LADY:""No seriously, it'll just take a second.""Chris: Thinking to myself, (Exactly, it'll just take a singular second for me to die) ""I'm not going to do that, thanks though. I'll be going now. This is not what UBER Is for.""LADY:""No seriously, it'll just take a second, I'll give you $5.""Chris: ""Gotta go!"" LADY:""Ugh, you're the 3rd driver to cancel.""It's the law of numbers, I've had passengers claim that you attract what you want to attract, but I think it's just the science of numbers, there are just a certain percentage of people who are ""different."" I've had over 10 passengers that have started the ride with""I don't have a destination, start the meter, I just want to talk.""Please help me fund my project, so I can share an entire year of experiences with the world!Your pre-orders will help me fund:THANK YOU!","There are safety risks associated with this project, mainly the risk of my personal safety from engaging in driving a motorized vehicle all year.  Should I become injured during the year (knock on wood, hopefully that doesn't happen), there may be a delay as I may need to recover before driving again. I will keep everyone in the loop.

The book collects 13 comics from Split Lip's first 10 years and adds copious bonus materials from artists, the series' creator, and other writers.Every Split Lip story is self-contained. That meansWhat Lies Inside: The 10th Anniversary Split Lip hardcover is for readers who have been with Split Lip since the beginning or are discovering it for the first time.Special Update: Check out the BONUS REWARDS section below for extra rewards being given to backers!Split Lip is an anthology of self-contained horror comics written by Sam Costello and drawn by artists from all over the world. It is often compared to The Twilight Zone and Night Gallery. Influences include writers like Shirley Jackson and Clive Barker, comics creators like Junji Ito and Emily Carroll, ghost stories, folk tales and murder ballads.Calling Split Lip horror is easiest, but it's more accurate to call it weird fiction. Weird fiction incorporates horror, but is more focused on ideas and strangeness and being unsettling than grossing you out, splattering pages with gore, or the other things that make some people dislike horror.People often tell me, ""I don't like horror, but I like Split Lip.""I started Split Lip in Oct. 2006 because I wanted to bring the kind of weird fiction and thoughtful horror movies I love to comics. Since then, we've published 45 stories, 6 books, and 8 comics. Split Lip stories have been drawn by people as nearby as my neighbor and as far away as Hungary, Finland, and Brazil. Split Lip features art by Kyle Strahm (Spread, Image), Sami Makkonen (Deadworld, IDW), John Bivens (Dark Engine, Image), and T.J.

It's not overly gory (though there is some blood and violence). It cares about characters and their emotional lives. It's more interested in the dark secrets hidden by those closest to us than in violence or shock.You won't find the typical horror characters here.

That said, there is some violence, some blood, and a little nudity. Given that, I'd guess that ultimately it would get an R.I haven't read Split Lip before. Can I start here?Absolutely. Split Lip is atrue anthology—there's no ongoing plot or characters and every story is complete and totally self-contained. You can pick up What Lies Inside having never read another Split Lip story and everything will make sense.I’m an artist. Can I get involved?Sorry, not for this book. What Lies Inside is strictly for stories already published at Split Lip. That said, I'm always working on new stories and looking for new artists. I suggest checking out the website to see what's been published at Split Lip so far. If you think your work is a good fit, drop me a line.Will What Lies Inside be available after the Kickstarter?That depends. The book is limited to 500 copies. If all of them are taken through the Kickstarter, then no. If the Kickstarter is funded with some copies remaining, I'll sell those online and at conventions. The digital version of the book will be available at comiXology and other digital-download stores.Will What Lies Inside be reprinted?No. It's a true limited edition. The 500 copies printed for this Kickstarter are the only copies of this book that will ever be produced.Why is overseas shipping so expensive?I know. I'm sorry. I was not excited to discover how much it costs to send the book overseas. The problem is the size/weight of the book and the uncertainty of shipping rates around the world. A 350-page hardcover is pretty heavy and requires specific packaging. Combine that with the possibility of shipping to dozens or hundreds of countries and we get to those prices.Credits","I hope I'm not jinxing myself by saying this, but the risks to this project are relatively low. Here's why: All the comics are complete. All of the extras are assembled. All of the pre-press and layout is done. I’ve even gotten a few proofs. There’s not a lot to left to do.That said, I see two primary risks: 1. Printing. Because I'm printing overseas, there could be shipping and delivery delays, and unforeseen printing disasters.2.

Thanks to everyone who said they'd help us recover our Amiga hard drive we can now get some of the original game music direct from source code. And we will fill up as much Dave Lowe computer game music from the originals so including conversions he did and also some rarities and bootlegs from the studio! This will be a really cool CD and all of Dave's work in one place, signed with some lovely artwork to remind you of the halcyon days of his gaming music! Just to reiterate - this is NO LONGER A STRETCH GOAL BUT PART OF THE MAIN FUNDING! Check to see which rewards are eligible!*DOCUMENTARY A behind the scenes documentary of the making of the album and recording at Abbey Road and the Uncle Art studios is now part of the main funding goal! - See down the bottom of this page for more details!

Great vid!Watch on YouTube here:https://youtu.be/QjpPczeKLBw*INTERVIEW WITH US BOTH Interview with us both about this Kickstarter project at 'They Were Our Gods'Please check the UPDATES section for latest news too including uncovered Bootlegs from the Uncle Art archives! :)****************************************************************************************The ProjectIn the 80s and 90s, my dad Dave Lowe who also went under the name 'Uncle Art' made music for computer games. His techniques were pioneering in his constant quest to not let the music be compromised by technology. He even had vocals on the Atari ST's AY chip which was thought impossible because the AY chip was incapable of sampling, instead he used bespoke look-up table to squash the fully studio recorded audio into a 4 bit sample and used the machine's volume controller of 0-15 to move the speaker cone equivalently to the 4 bit sample to create the music he'd recorded. And that's how you were able to hear ""STAAAAARGLIDER"" singing out of your Atari ST in 1987! More information about the technical achievements of Uncle Art Music can be found on our websitehere.Some of his famous game titles include:+Elite II Frontier & Elite III+Starglider 1 & 2+Afterburner+Carrier Command+Street Fighter 2 (Amiga Custom Conversion)+IK+ (Amiga conversion original composer: Rob Hubbard)+Beneath A Steel Sky+Microprose Formula One Grand Prix+Incredible Shrinking Sphere (ISS)I know these games and the music that accompanied them (often as a separate cassette to play along with the game - ahh those were the days!) are held in a special place to some people - myself included! As someone who was games testing for my dad since I was 9, I'm a gamer through and through, but there's something really special about the music in particular to those early games. People on the internet and in person when they find out who my dad is always ask:""Are you going to remake the tracks?""Well now this question can be answered with a yes!We're going to make a release an exclusive Limited Edition Kickstarter album called 'A Temporal Shift'. The album will contain remakes of my dad's most famous tracks and also very excitingly, full live orchestral recordings of his Elite II Frontier Main Theme and Second Theme. We're going to record these with The Chamber Orchestra of London.The remakes will most likely include the following although the tracklist is not set in stone and by all means we are open to taking opinions and polls from the backers to see what they'd like to hear on there.Elite Frontier - main and second themes (recorded with real orchestra)After BurnerStarglider 1Starglider 2Carrier CommandIncredible Shrinking Sphere (ISS)Night ShiftRasputin (first ever Uncle Art game music project!)Formula 1 Grand PrixMidwinter 2Please note the teaser you can hear on the video is only short pieces interwoven as a showcase of different styles and tunes that we're talking about for this project. On the album each piece will be much longer, although we may still choose to interweave some of them.These remakes are really exciting to us. What my dad was always trying to do was to not let technology limit the music, which is why there were vocals and reggae breakdowns and melodies that stay with you forever! Generic was never in the Uncle Art ethos! And now - we have all the scope in the world! Between the two of us we play nearly every live instrument going and we are sooo psyched about creating tracks that do the compositions proper justice. I'm talking Pink Floyd-esque atmospheres of meta-galactic space and orchestrations to bring down Jericho and all manner of mad things to splatter about in there! We might even take some of the chip-tune stuff from the C64 and sample it in, use banjos and harpsichords and trash cans and filthy bass sounds and intricate vocal harmonies and counterparts. The possibilities are just limitless and we're really looking forward to showing people what we can do today!A Temporal Shiftwill be pressed on a special Kickstarter limited edition CD and Vinyl. We're only going to press (as close to as possible) the number of people who have backed it in Kickstarter, so having this limited edition CDs and Vinyls shows that you backed it from the beginning. In fact, it's pretty much the only way of getting a copy since it's only for the fans on Kickstarter! You can only buy it if you back it!There will be a high quality download that will stay up forever however you get to buy it at a discounted rate by backing it here on Kickstarter.Even if any of the tracks go on to be licensed in any future projects, this physical album will not be for sale anywhere else other than on here.There are also Uncle Art Music t shirts in the rewards (we wear ours in the studio all the time, sad as we are!)We are really keen to have mind-blowingly good presentation for the CD and Vinyl so the artwork is really important to us. We have our artist confirmed now and will start to showcase you his work as we go along as he will work bespoke for the project.++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++Included in the main funding is now a documentary made by my sister and Dave's daughter - Lucy Lowe. She's going to make a behind-the-scenes documentary. It will be free to all backers and backers who pledge £55 and above will be credited in the film.**************************************************************************************PLEASE SPREAD THE WORD.......IT'S JUST ANOTHER MISSION!!!****************************************************************************************","Some of you may know that this is version 1.2 of this Kickstarter due to some technical issues but we feel much more comfortable with what we face now: remakes of the originals and orchestral recordings of the Elite Frontier themes. Technical difficulties aside from the original project, we were aware that many of our backers were mainly interested in the orchestral Elite recordings and as this was a stretch goal in the old project, we felt it a bit unfair that a large proportion of our backers were backing something that might not happen. So we feel this is the best of both worlds for everyone now: an album of remakes INCLUDING the orchestral recordings and a stretch goal for the collected works of the original game music plus some bootlegs. As far as risks or challenges go, it's getting Kickstarter right that really is the hardest part and we've learned a hell of a lot from the first 10 days of the first one. Making the music is the fun part - We've left ourselves a lengthy amount of time in case of any big problems. I do work away and around the world a lot but we tend to work in the studio in blocks as opposed to whimsically every day, which makes it a lot more focused. The orchestral side of things is being greatly taken care of by the guys at COOL Music Ltd. who manage the orchestral recordings of game and film music literally every day. In fact they even represent many game composers in an agent field, so we are really in very good hands with them. As I said - the Kickstarter is the hardest part, and reaching the funding goal is the most risky bit! But we have been so warmed and encouraged all of our backers from the V1.0 project that I know you guys will help us as much as possible hit those goals.",https://www.kickstarter.com/projects/hollyjazz/the-physics-of-us?ref=discovery_category_newest,hollyjazz/the-physics-of-us,"(^^^Subtitulos en castellano disponible en el vídeo arriba^^^)Hola! I'm Holly! Well I would really love to make an album of new (and a couple of oldish) songs of mine. But actually have them physically in one place and also actually release it so it's all online and forever there. After so many years of being a musician, singer and songwriter it's frustrating that I don't have anything complete to show for it. I want to have something I can physically hold and be proud of for my whole life and I need your help to do so!I feel like I've been struck with a sort of clarity lately, where all my experience as a musician, songwriter, singer, producer and a person over the years has all come together. It feels like exactly the right time to be doing this project and Kickstarter feels like exactly the right platform to do it through.So I'm from the UK but I now live in Mallorca and after a pretty lengthy writer's block (there's even a song about that) they are suddenly pouring out of me and I've got a new energy for it all. Not only do I want to make this album, I want to release it and try and get it in front of some music industry too. I've had record deals in the past and I know how tough and flakey the music industry is and it's very possibe that nothing will come of it, but nothing at ALL will come of it if I don't do anything. If I just sit at home and keep my music to myself then I stand no chance of anything. So I have to at least try , by making this record and giving it the best push I can to be on the side where something COULD happen.I've put a band together here who are the Dāhs! (Si - drums, Matthew - bass, Miki - guitar&sax / Shannagh - vocals) I have been demoing the songs by myself in my practice room / studio but now we've been playing them live with the band I'm now convinced I need to make this album with them including live drums which is always the trickiest part of a quality band recording project. There's an amazing recording studio here called Palma Music Studios where we would go to record them and get in my old faithful engineer Ben Darlow (Dāhlow!) to engineer the session mix some of the tracks.I also just want to mention here the insanely talented Patrick Burke who had designed the album cover specially. He spent 3 weeks listening to the demo while creating it. I was speechless when he showed me it. It is stunning!!!If you know me from the previous Kickstarter I did with my dad Dave Lowe (an epic project where we remade his old computer game music) you'll know that me and my dad have worked togeher for years and years. He will of course be there along the way for help and ideas and studio time (I plan on doing all the vocals and more in his Uncle Art studio in Yorkshire, UK), but for the first time I will be stepping out and producing the whole album by myself. So it's a test of me as a producer as well as an artist.I've called this yet-to-be-made album 'The Physics Of Us' because many of the songs are based around concepts of gravity, time, chance and forces. It's like, who and what are we if not affected by other people and their forces, the push, the pull. Without other people and the attraction and repulsion that affect us we are like heavenly bodies just drifting forever through time and space. It's other people that make things interesting. In other words, it's an album about love...Here are some of the songs I definitely would like on the record:Writers Block * No Regrets * Forecast For Snow * Tint O' Time * Wasn't I Always The One? * Before Two Stars Collide * How Can I Help You? * Collision Course * Sad Old Songs * Cartography Song *As with most things in life, you need money to be able to achieve things! I'm needing a bit of a helping hand to pay for the following:* My studio rent where I do all my demo-ing nad editing, some of the recording and where the band rehearses.* Recording costs - studios cost money as do engineers and mix engineers and any additional musicians you get to session on it. Drums will be recorded at Palma Music Studios here in Mallorca. I also plan to do quite a lot of the recording including most of the vocals at my dad's studio in Yorkshire which obviously doesn't cost me anything to hire but it does cost me to get there and I might have to fly various band members out there too.* Pressing the CD - physically pressing the CDs obviously costs money. There are also costs involved in hosting downloads and releasing to the online streaming sites etc.* Music Videos - this is where I really am hoping we can get a decent budget to make some great videos. I know not all videos need an expensive budget but they normally need something and you need talented people to make them or help with them. The more we have left over to help with music videos the better as everyone knows that in this day and age it is so important to have videos in order to get your music heard. (Be seen to be heard!)* Press / Marketing budget - Making a CD is one thing but getting people to hear it is another. It really does require marketing from press releases and PR campaigns to radio and streaming pluggers to get as many people talking about and listening to the record as possible.* Live / touring expenses - this isn't budgeted into what I'm asking for here, but if we go over any extra money beyond the extra we need for more videos and marketing will go into all the costs that are involved with playing live and touring. Which would be awesome!I'm asking for the absolute minumum amount required here to make this album and release it. But really, we could do with a lot more to really give the videos, marketing and live budgets what they need to really maximise this opportunity. But the most important thing is to make the album in the first place which is why I'm only asking the absolute minimum needed to make this.OK now let's get back to talking about music! Thanks again for being here please check out the rewards and get involved with the project.","If you know me from Kickstarter before, you'll know that I've already successfuly run and delivered a music campaign and on a much bigger scale than this. (Uncle Art: A Temporal Shift campaign) So I feel I have a good reference for delivering what I say I will. Things have changed quite a lot since then as I'm now a parent to a nearly 3 year old daughter and that comes with its own challenges! Mostly time. I feel like I have been generous with the time I've allowed for this as most of the songs are already written and demo'd."

Did you ever witness film melting before your eyes on the silver screen? That image was from reel filmprojectors. When I bought the Historic Howell Theater in June 2014, I found one of those filmprojectors in the basement. In the projection booth sits its replacement, a ""modern"" projector, but it is nowalso a dinosaur in the movie theater business.I am guessing there have been three film projectorsmoved in and out of that projection booth during the Historic Howell Theater's movie history and now the theater needs a digital projector to take up the work of this outdated dinosaur. The Historic Howell Theater is in need of updating its projector tonew technology--a digital projector-- and I need the help of this community to make it happen. For this reason, I have designed a Kickstarter to purchase the best digital projector and sound system for this theater. My investment in the building and the revisions it needs is huge for me and I need everyone to rally behind our community movie theater to bring back the drama, laughter, thrills and chills to these movie screens. What I hear in the community is the need for lower priced movie tickets. To accomplish this goal, your participation in the Historic Howell Kickstarter will put digital technology in the theater while keeping ticket prices affordable.Moviemaking is magic and art. There is an experience beyond mainstream movies to take the moviegoer's imagination to new heights. That's what I want to bring you in the Historic Howell Theater; movies you won't find anywhere else -- independent films, sing-a-longs, silent films, documentaries, classics, world cinema, family films, midnight movies and film festivals.I want to bring the magic back to this great, old movie house. There is a lost experience with mainstream theaters; going to the movies was about a special night which took you through a range of experiences and left you feeling like you just stepped off a roller coaster of emotions.Let's move beyond movies. . . Let's build a creative community around the Historic Howell Theater.Artists will have space to display their work, collectors can show their prized collections, andwe can open our doors to creative programs like open art studio time and art workshops. The Historic Howell will bea bustling, creative hub for dreamers who want to share their imagination with others; to inspire usto think ""outside the box."" Research shows us art stimulates our learning and thinking.And then there is performance art. The Historic Howell will become a place for music, comedy andother performing arts. Stages will be built to accommodate musicians, magicians, comedy, improvisation and other acts. Come to the Historic Howell Theater to transform the way you look at the world, expand your visual vocabulary and gain new perspective.Let's fill the place with laughter, clapping, shrieks, sighs and singing. The Historic Howell Theater has been and will continue to be a fun-packed, imaginative, friendly, happy place where our community can come to relax and enjoy the show.I see the Historic Howell Theater as the community movie theater--a place I want to share with all of you.Visit me-- the door is open and I would love to meet you. There will be tables and chairs in the lobby formoviegoers to sit down and discuss the movie. I want to hear what you have to say about the movies. One of my missions for the theater is creating a home for local filmmakers to present their incredible work! One way to achieve this is by an Open Projector night similar to an Open Mic night, but with video. It is my hope this leads to a Howell Film Festival!The community will shape the identity of the Historic Howell Theater.- Princes Leia/ Star Wars: Episode IV A New HopeIn my 24-years, I've watched 2,145 movies. At some point I started saving the ticket stubs and have abox full of them. Let's talk about what you've seen. I'm always looking for something new towatch.The Historic Howell Theater needs you. I will work hard to bring you the best creative experience at the Theater, but I need your support too. Please come to the Howell as a moviegoer, participate in the Kickstarter, tell your friends about us and bring your family. Share your experience on social media and tell me yourideas. We can be found on Facebook, Twitter and Instagram. Be creative! Get the word out! Participate in the Historic Howell Theater Kickstarter--we need you!Storytelling is a cultural experience. Cave dwellers left us evidence of their storytelling on the cave walls. That's the earliest storytelling we know. Librarians sit the little ones in a circle for story time, teachers read aloud to their students, parents read bedtime stories and thespians tell their stories onstage. The moviegoing experience is just one more way a community shares stories and at the Historic Howell Theater we want to continue the 86-year history of storytelling through the lens of a new digitalprojector.When I purchased the Historic Howell Theater in June 2014, I had been looking for a communitymovie theater where I could share my love of movies and art. My moviemaking began when Iwas about 7-years -old when I discovered the video camera my parents never knew how to operate. I've been drawing every day for as long as I can remember. Art and movie camps, private art lessons, andchildren and adult art classes at the Toledo Museum of Art dominated my life. If there was anopportunity to be creative, I took it. In 2012, I graduated from Webster University in St. Louis, Missouri, with a degree in film production. I've worked on film sets, in a special effects studio anddirected a couple of my own short films. Movies are my passion.In high school I started a Future Filmmakers Club and while at Webster University, I organized a Creative Jamboree which featured artists, musicians, movies, art activities, and more. In the summers I taught caricature drawing at an art center. It was these creative avenues that made me realize making and appreciating art is best enjoyed in community.I am excited to be moving to Howell and starting this adventure with The Historic Howell Theater. -Rick Blaine/ Casablanca (1942)NOTE: You also have the option to contribute anonymously.For anyone who would like to support us and may live out of the area or would liketo donate their movie tickets/package to a non-profit of your choice we would be happyto help facilitate.","The Historic Howell Theater has a history of opening and closing. My take on the theater's past is it has not appealed to the range of tastes represented in our community.  It is my goal to schedule a blend of programs and movies to attract every age and interest.  As I have stated, the door is open and I am truly interested in learning what the viewing audience has to say about what we present at the Historic Howell Theater.  We are a true independent community movie theater.

We have again become the destination in Livingston County for Independent film, live entertainment, private events, school trips and fundraisers. But it has not been easy. We had to clean six inches of mud and sludge out of the basement, waterproof the basement and side walls, repair the gutters and roof, renovate the interior, paint, install new carpet and flooring, reconfigure the concession area, fix the mechanical systems and install new screens, digital projectors and surround sound. We have done this all on our own. Now our marquee is in need of some serious help; it is almost dark (as you can see in the above photo) and in need of a major overhaul including new transformers, repair of the neon and new energy efficient LED lighting. This is a significant project and we are hoping to get some financial help to defray the costs to restore the Historic Howell Theater marquee to its former glory and light up downtown Howell.Since we have surpassed our preliminary goal to partially fund the marquee we have established a stretch goal of $7,150 to complete the marquee as well as the repair and rewiring of our six outdoor poster display cases, four of which are currently dark (also seen in the photo). ",We are really hoping to reach our goal since Kickstarter is an 'All Or Nothing' platform.

Sincethen, I have been able to make a living as an artist, performing in some of thebest Jazz festivals and venues in the world. I have many recordings, both, in the USA and abroad, oftenearning numerous accolades from the music media worldwide. My first project was ""COSTARICA-COSTA RICA"", a recording commissioned in 1980 by the CostaRican government. My latest release,“INVISIBLE (2010), is a conceptual project created in dedication to the poor,the sick, the homeless, the true “Invisible” ones of the world. I was given an ACAM award by the CostaRican Society of Authors and Composers as “Jazz Composer and Producer of theYear” for this newest recording. Thesame was true for my 2006 CD“VIDA”.“LUZ”(light), my new CD, will be a group of compositions recently written, inspiredby the concept of enlightenment, of darkness and light as paths, not asopposites, about the capacity of humans to freely choose to navigate from oneto the other at any time and about the fact that it is through alternatingbetween them that we find meaning. I am hoping to release the “LUZ” CD inJanuary of 2013In2011, I was invited to participate at a TED conference in San José, Costa Rica.That was a very important performance for me, since it marked the return to myhomeland for the first time in almost 20 years. In March of this year I was invitedonce again to perform in Costa Rica, this time at the International Festival ofthe Arts (FIA). We were able tofilm those two performances in HD.The FIA concert, where I collaborated with several American and CostaRican musicians, was filmed in its entirety by the wonderful Costa Ricanfilmmaker Mario Cardona and his team, (http://www.zenentertainment.tv/directores/cardona.html). That performance took place at a building that for yearshoused the main prison in the country, now converted into a beautifulchildren’s museum. A DVD of both concerts, plus some extra footage, will be thesecond part of my “LUZ” Kickstarter project.Finally,I will be producing a concert at the Lobero Theatre (www.lobero.com), a beautiful venue in Santa Barbara, CA, on April of 2013, markingthe release of both the CD and the DVD.This will be the third item of this “Luz” Kickstarter triad. This concert will offer me theopportunity to share the results of a project that will have taken 3 years tocomplete. I will be sharing itfirst with our hometown audience, which has supported me as an artist,unconditionally, for decades, and then with the rest of the world. Irecently finished writing all the music for “LUZ”, I have in my possession allthe raw footage for the DVD, and I have a date for the concert (April 17,2013).

Can this serial fiction anthology raise enough money to bring daily adventure fiction to a world it never expected?Yes!CHIMERICAL TALES is the fiction magazine I've dreamed about for a decade, first envisioned back in 2005 during a six-month hospitalization. I was brought up with serial fiction... from the comics I read to the stories my father told me at night, always ending with the three most exciting words in the English language... ""to be continued.""In the style of the old pulp serials, Chimerical Tales is a serial fiction anthology designed for the discerning cliffhanger enthusiast.Let's break that down:Every weekday, Chimerical Tales will post a new chapter in one of its five serials. Each chapter will be an easily digestible piece of flash fiction--around 750 words, or three pages--just enough to read during a coffee break!A different serial will run each day of the week, so readers will know exactly when to come back for the next installment: Mythstalker Monday, for instance, or Resume God Thursday.To lead off each week's serials will be a beautiful full-color cover by a great artist... and man, do we have some great artists lined up! (Peek ahead to see who! We'll be here when you come back.)Not only will CHIMERICAL TALES run online, but after each week's serials are complete, the cover, stories, and additional editorial content will be compiled together in a PDF magazine, suitable for reading on your tablet or computer of choice! The plan is to sell each of these magazines for a dime... but pledgers above the $25 level will get these magazines emailed to them each week for free!If you really want to see what to expect from CHIMERICAL TALES, we'll be sending out a free ashcan PDF of the imaginary issue #0 to anyone who pledges $10 or more, so you can sample a copy before this Kickstarter is even finished!Finally, when a given serial is completed, that serial will become available in a collected ebook as well, so everyone will have their choice of how to read CHIMERICAL TALES!The plan is for the www.chimericaltales.com site to go online with content on July 1, 2013 and update every weekday for the next fifty-two weeks. This Kickstarter funds that first year, or as I call it, Volume One.I'm a forty-two year old writer who's always loved big stories broken down into little parts. In the early 2000s, I wrote the comics DEFIANCE and MYTHSTALKERS for Image Comics and also ran the website CHIMERICAL COMICS, a Previews-style chronicle of an imaginary comics company.In 2005, I almost died from acute necrotic pancreatitis, which put me in the hospital for most of the year. While there, I developed the seeds of CHIMERICAL TALES, and have been building up to this project ever since then. For a long time recovery, parenting, homeschooling and life kept convincing me that it ""wasn't a good time"" to start CHIMERICAL TALES, but after several years of building up material and finessing the concept, I had an obvious epiphany: there would NEVER be a good time. So I'm going with the next best thing... now.The initial five serials launching with CHIMERICAL TALES #1 will be:MYTHSTALKERS: Originally published by Image Comics, MYTHSTALKERS tells the story of the Victorian age Society of Cryptozoological Research, five daring men and women who seek out creatures of myth. Unbeknownst to them, however, they are opposed by a time traveler from the 21st century who is determined to beat them to the secret behind the re-emergence of these beasts of legend. The 33-issue series was never finished at Image, but CHIMERICAL TALES will finally tell the full tale!THE LAST ADVENTURE OF ACE ARCHER, SPACE PIONEER: In the 1930's, America thrilled to the adventures of Ace Archer, Space Pioneer as he explored the universe and fought for freedom throughout the galaxy. Today, Ace Archer is forgotten and space is an empty place of vacuum and dust. What happened to the universe? What happened to Ace Archer? One woman sets out to discover the answers to both, and in doing so, brings about the return of Earth's greatest space hero!JANE CROW: AS THE CROW LIES: The secret world of witches has long hidden from the mundane world. To keep this secret, the High Coven has infiltrated the FBI's paranormal division with a double agent, the inscrutable Jane Crow, master liar. However, when Jane is assigned to a series of impossible murders, her true loyalties are put to the test.RESUME GOD: Carl McCall is an unemployed newlywed graphic designer who needs to spend his days finding a job. Unfortunately, he's just found out that he's the supreme being of a microuniverse on the brink of destruction. Time management was never this exciting!TESLA GIRLS: TESTING OUT THINGS: Electric powered girly punk science heroines protect Apex City from evil and boredom. A rookie hero scores a team-up, but a night with Emilie, Kate and Marina turns out to be anything but what he expects. Who are the Tesla Girls, really? The first story of the Apex City Cycle, superheroes for the flash fiction age!And, as each story ends (or, if it never ends, at least stops) new serials will join the CHIMERICAL lineup. In this first year of publication, we're also planning stories with titles like Closing Time! Impermanent Record! Darkness on the Edge of Town! The Ironclad Alibi! Imaginary Suicides! Ragnarok Love Stories! The Champion! Untold Myths of the Lost World!Honestly, fifteen thousand dollars sounds to me like enough money to swim around in, a la Scrooge McDuck. Still, I actually made a spreadsheet for this project, so you know I must be serious. Here's what you'll be funding with your pledges.COVER ART: I'm no artist, so I'm hiring some. CHIMERICAL TALES covers will offer art from a wide range of artists, both professionals and up-and-comers. Since we love our artists, we need to be sure to pay them. Fifty-two weekly covers is a lot of art, so this makes up about 70% of CT's budget.SOFTWARE: For this first year, I'll be running CHIMERICAL TALES through WordPress, but I'll need the Pro Bundle upgrade to make it look the way I envision it. I'll also need an initial outlay for professional looking page design graphics. To make the PDF and ebook files, I'll need a decent digital publishing program; I'm looking at Adobe InDesign for this. All of this stuff comes to approximately 10% of the budget.WRITING: The final twenty percent of CHIMERICAL TALES' budget is the writing rate. My lovely wife, Kay, works full time to support our family as a pastor, and has for many years. Part of my dream for CHIMERICAL TALES is to find a way for me to bring some bacon to the table here and contribute financially. However, for the first year of publication, I'll be emulating the old pulps not only stylistically but fiscally... I'm only going to pay myself a penny a word. Hopefully you'll find at least several of my words worth more than that. The writing for CT will only make up about 20% of the budget.I'm so glad you asked! Who do we have for art so far? Some of my ALL-TIME favorite artists and people!CLINT LANGLEY! 2000AD artist for SLAINE: BOOKS OF INVASION and ABC WARRIORS: THE VOLGAN WAR among many other awesome looking things. He's no stranger to the serial, being one of the stars of CHIMERICAL TALES inspiration 2000AD.MIKE GRELL! The creator of THE WARLORD and longtime GREEN ARROW writer/artist, not to mention JON SABLE, FREELANCE... master of some of the most beautiful linework ever seen!MATT HOWARTH! Creator of THOSE ANNOYING POST BROS., SAVAGE HENRY, KEIF LLAMA, XENOTECH and so much more, he makes music as comics and comics as music. If I were an artist, I'd want to be him.MARK OAKLEY! The man behind THIEVES & KINGS, STARDROP and JENNY MYSTERIOUS, Mark has a style full of youth and energy and he never writes down to the reader. (Not that that has to do with his art, but I love that about him anyway.)MARILYN SCOTT-WATERS! The Toymaker herself, author of THE TOYMAKER'S WORKSHOP, THE TOYMAKER'S CHRISTMAS and artist of HAUNTED HISTORIES... she'll be doing a special paper toy cover suitable for printing, cutting out, and constructing! So much fun!BRIAN MENZE! One of the top videogame artists in the industry, Brian is the visionary who created FALLOUT's Vault Boy. He's also worked on STAR WARS: KNIGHTS OF THE OLD REPUBLIC II, NEVERWINTER NIGHTS 2, and is currently working on Kickstarter's biggest project ever, Obsidian Entertainment's PROJECT ETERNITY!CHRIS BURNHAM! Current artist on Grant Morrison's BATMAN, INC. (you know, that little series that made the New York Post?) as well as OFFICER DOWNE and Coheed & Cambria's AMORY WARS. (Also the artist of my favorite Chimerical Comic, ""nowhereacademy"" which we pitched to Image back in the day!) He's busy, but promised himself as a ""potential"" if we make funding!TOMMY KOVACS! If you didn't love AUTUMN, you must be allergic to brilliant strangeness. The writer of Disney's WONDERLAND and the infamous creator of SKELEBUNNIES (NSFW!) Tommy brings the weird to weird fantasy!DAN GOODSALL! The creator of Mr. Toast and Friends and their media empire, Dan will be doing a special Mr. Toast cover of one of our serials!AUSTIN JANKOWSKY! Creator of STANLEY THE SNOWMAN and artist on such series as IRON MAN: THE END, JUDO GIRL and 10TH MUSE/SHI.And this is only the list of people I have SO FAR!We'll also be showcasing new, up-and-coming artists... there's nothing more exciting than finding a fresh style and helping expose its creator to the world!So, I'm sure this sounds good, but unfortunately, CHIMERICAL TALES is hanging, white-knuckled, off the Kickstarter cliff. Will my long-imagined dream of exciting serial adventure be able to escape and deliver two-to-three-fisted action, speculative tales of speculation, embarassing romantic dilemmas and unknown mythologies? Don't you want to have something to read every day? For once, you don't have to wait for someone else to resolve this cliffhanger... it's up to you!To be continued...","As I said earlier, life has a way of making itself difficult. Nobody expects a six-month hospitalization, a forced move across country, or the Spanish Inquisition. We know sometime in the next year that we'll be moving, actually, which is part of why I'm funding early to get a good backlog of writing and art ready before our July 1, 2013 launch date.I haven't collected together all fifty-two artists yet, but as you can see from the ones I've gotten together in the past two weeks, I'm expecting to have a lot of talent on board... it's just a matter of finding it all! And hey, if you're interested in doing art for CHIMERICAL TALES, just send me a message and we'll talk!Who knows what unknown waters we're sailing into... but the process is part of the excitement. If I can get Ace Archer out of the Necrochapel of Jeth, I'm confident I can figure out how to make an .epub format document. We're all in this together, and with your help, I know this can happen. Happen and rock.",https://www.kickstarter.com/projects/321395714/chimerical-tales-lean-and-mean-remix-edition?ref=discovery_category_newest,321395714/chimerical-tales-lean-and-mean-remix-edition,"Welcome, or welcome back, to CHIMERICAL TALES.When last we left Douglass Barre's online serial fiction magazine for the discerning cliffhanger enthusiast, it had suffered a Pyrrhic defeat at its first attempt at funding. (If a Pyrrhic victory is one in which you win the battle in such a way that the toll upon your army negates any sense of victory or profit, I figure that a Pyrrhic defeat must be one where you fail to win the battle in such a way that afterwards you feel like going to Disneyworld to celebrate.)Let's take a moment for those of you new to this:In the style of the old pulp serials, Chimerical Tales is an online serial fiction anthology designed for the discerning cliffhanger enthusiast. For more details on the original Kickstarter, please check it out at http://www.kickstarter.com/projects/321395714/chimerical-tales. It was originally envisioned as a big fancy web magazine with weekly covers by comic artists to draw attention to my daily fiction serials.Anyway, a professor at one of the world's top business schools (and original CT pledger) asked me, ""Why is 70% of my donation going to the artists instead of to you? I wouldn't fund this Kickstarter just to see more art from these guys--they're going to produce art anyway. I'm funding this Kickstarter for the stories.""It was oddly surprising to me. Sometimes I've been known to miss the obvious, and this was one of them. As the last Kickstarter went on, more and more people showed their interest and faith in my writing. The CHIMERICAL TALES #0 sampler magazine was a hit, and my Hail Mary taunting updates (#s 5 and 6) were acclaimed ""Best. Update. Ever."" (Thanks, Scott!)I also discovered that this is something that isn't just a cool idea I wanted to try... this is something I desperately want to do. I want to write CHIMERICAL TALES so bad that I'm actually spending all my time trying to make it happen instead of just wishing life would make it convenient and waiting for opportunity to knock.So, we're doing this thing. The new budget is less than the total pledges from the old Kickstarter project. This isn't just doable, it's pretty much already been done!The new ""lean-and-mean"" CHIMERICAL TALES will be an online site with new chapters of original fiction serials every weekday. It's still going to look great, but this time it's going to be done without specially commissioned art. Each week, the serials will be collected into a .PDF e-magazine, suitable for reading on your tablet or computer.If you're a returning CHIMERICAL TALES pledger, all you have to do is pledge what you did before... you didn't get charged last time, so that money's still there (unless you got caught by those cool new Lone Ranger LEGOs and blew it all on those.)If you're new to CHIMERICAL TALES, then pick a pledge and join us! Any pledge $10 and over gets the CHIMERICAL TALES #0 ashcan sampler, so you'll be able to see what the excitement is all about almost immediately! We've also got some cool stretch goals if we exceed our old totals.I'm only running this Kickstarter for two weeks, because I actually need the funds to get started if I'm going to make the planned July 1, 2013 release date! So if you're going to spread the word, let's spread it quickly!The initial five serials launching with CHIMERICAL TALES #1 will be:MYTHSTALKERS: Originally published by Image Comics, MYTHSTALKERS tells the story of the Victorian age Society of Cryptozoological Research, five daring men and women who seek out creatures of myth. Unbeknownst to them, however, they are opposed by a time traveler from the 21st century who is determined to beat them to the secret behind the re-emergence of these beasts of legend.

In this first year of publication, we're also planning stories with titles like Closing Time! Impermanent Record! Darkness on the Edge of Town! The Ironclad Alibi! Imaginary Suicides! Ragnarok Love Stories! The Champion! Untold Myths of the Lost World!So here's the breakdown on CHIMERICAL TALES (the lean-and-mean remix edition):Software: I still need this to make the ebooks and now, to cobble together covers with good old public domain art. There are a few public domain sites that require membership, but I'll see if I need to dig that deep before committing funds. For this first year, I'll be running CHIMERICAL TALES through WordPress, but I'll need the Pro Bundle upgrade to make it look the way I envision it. I'll also need an initial outlay for professional looking page design graphics. To make the PDF and ebook files, I'll need a decent digital publishing program; I'm looking at Adobe InDesign for this. Since we're going to be going without fancy covers, I want to make the site itself as professional and appealing as possible, so I bumped the site design budget a few percentage points.Materials and software make up about 30% of the budget.Writing: My lovely wife, Kay, works full time to support our family as a pastor, and has for many years. Part of my dream for CHIMERICAL TALES is to find a way for me to bring some bacon to the table here and contribute financially. However, for the first year of publication, I'll be emulating the old pulps not only stylistically but fiscally... I'm sill planning on doing the first year at the old pulp rate of a penny a word!Even at this low, low price, the writing now comes out to the other 70% of the budget.All told, the budget came out to $4036, and I'm rounding it down to a nice even $4K. Our first CHIMERICAL TALES Kickstarter came in well above that, so if everyone pledges what they did the first time, we're already a lock! (And if you decide to fund more, take a look at our cool stretch goals to see what you can strive for!)$4597 - COVER POSTER! So, now that I've explained how we won't need any art budget, I'm going to cheat a little and mention that my first stretch goal is to get an original CHIMERICAL TALES cover from 2000AD artist Clint Langley. Anyway, I think one great piece with our serial characters done by a 2000AD fave would be something to see. If we beat our old pledge total by one dollar, we'll have an awe-striking front page to gaze at before reading.$5000 - PODCAST! My loving wife Kay has been podcast crazy the last few months, and it occurred to me how much fun it would be to have audio versions of the serials, just like the classic days of radio. I've got someone on call ready to mix and edit, and a few great voices ready to read. If we hit this level, I can get recording software and other needs to make this a reality. Anyone pledged at the CHARTER MEMBER or higher will get these for free with their subscription. Others are still in the planning stages, but here's a teaser:$5500 - CHIMERICAL COMICS SATURDAY?$6500 - SUNDAY COMIC STRIP?$7500 - CHIMERICAL TALES RPG?Who knows... anything could happen! (Okay, well, this clock isn't about to become prime minister, but you know what I mean.)This time, we're going to make it happen. CHIMERICAL TALES will launch. Fiction will serialize! Cliffs will hang! And, of course, it's allTO BE CONTINUED...","As I said earlier, life has a way of making itself difficult. Nobody expects a six-month hospitalization, a forced move across country, or the Spanish Inquisition. Last time I wrote about risks and challenges, I thought I might have to move. This time, two months later, we've already moved and I'm still moving forward on this!Who knows what unknown waters we're sailing into... but the process is part of the excitement. If I can get Jane Crow to face her stepsister for an honest conversation over lunch, I'm confident I can figure out how to make an .epub format document. We're all in this together, and with your help, I know this can happen. Happen and rock."

Can you be stylishly committed to changing the world? Absolutely, you can! Ethical Fashion is about style choices we make while consciously thinking about the world around us: the people who make what we wear, the animals we need to protect and the planet we must preserve. Ethical fashion recognizes and celebrates the talent of designers and artisans who pursue their work with respect for people, animals and the environment. From the materials to the methods, fashion that is made with love is transforming the fashion industry to create one that is as much about awareness as style.Ethical Style Journal promotes this new fashion industry! We love that we can shop our favorite brands, while supporting causes that are improving people’s lives and creating a healthier world. By sharing positive stories focused on ethical and sustainable fashion, and reconnecting people with nature, we hope to inspire our readers to make more conscious choices when shopping. We don't have to compromise our personal style to shop ethically, and we're happy to prove it. Basically, we're going to change the world—in style. You should join us!","One of the biggest challenges we'll face is getting enough subscribers to contribute to the magazine's production. We realize that there's a lot of free information out there, and that can make it difficult to get someone to subscribe.To overcome this, we'll work endlessly with our talented team to bring you the most unique stories with fashion styles that are both progressive and attractive! Our quarterly magazine is focused on ethical fashion, with the intent to inspire more conscious shopping, and has a less-is-more approach. We don't want to overwhelm you with information, so all content will be carefully selected, timely, meaningful and fun! Our team is a small one made up of four people: executive editor, fashion editor, creative director and director of brand messaging. We're hoping to continue to grow the team with a successful campaign here, so that we can do an incredible job connecting with our audience and giving you what you want! Additionally, a percentage of all subscriptions will go toward our featured charities. From the fight to end human trafficking to ending animal suffering, you'll be part of making a difference for people, animals and the planet.",https://www.kickstarter.com/projects/1140881596/ethical-style-journal-goes-to-print?ref=discovery_category_newest,1140881596/ethical-style-journal-goes-to-print,"The momentum is building behind environmentally-friendly, ethically-made, slow and sustainable fashion, but this movement needs a signature platform that shows the world what it truly looks like.Ethical Style Journal is a digital magazine that celebrates and promotes ethical and sustainable fashion, to inspire readers to shop more consciously. Now on our third issue, it's important that we continue to do our best to make ethical fashion appealing and accessible to a wider audience. We believe going to print will allow us to achieve this! In doing so, we will be, to our knowledge, the first fashion magazine in print that exclusively covers ethical and sustainable fashion. Our readers have been asking for the magazine in print since the first digital issue, which launched November 2016, and now we feel we're ready to move forward with making that happen, starting with our summer issue. We have personal essays, features introducing the makers behind some of our favorite brands, and an incredible written piece on the psychological impact of fashion. And of course, beautiful editorial photography. Having a print version makes sense for those who prefer the more traditional way to read magazines. Not everyone enjoys reading on digital devices, especially after looking at screens all day or before going to sleep. Plus, there's just something magical about being able to hold your favorite magazine in your hand. We want people to be able to read Ethical Style Journal while lying in bed at night, or while sipping a cup of coffee at a favorite local spot. In addition to being a milestone for ethical fashion journalism, we think it will make the Ethical Style Journal experience even more enjoyable! Meeting our Kickstarter goal will allow us to make our summer issue our first in print. This includes publishing 48 pages (including cover), a short print run, and delivery of the finished product to our team, along with distribution, which we plan to do ourselves. From there, we’ll carefully track how many units we sell, and how quickly we sell them, so that we can make smart, economical printing choices as we move forward as a print publication. Publishing and printing can be difficult industries to navigate, but we believe our niche magazine is a perfect candidate to achieve success in this market. Our team is committed to doing our best in presenting a print publication that is unique, inspiring, and informational in celebrating and promoting ethical fashion, while also making it appealing and accessible to a larger audience.","We are new to print and, as with any industry, we have a lot to learn. Specifically, the most economical and sustainable ways to print, and which printer can offer us exactly what we are looking for in publishing our magazine.We have taken a few different sustainable printers under consideration, and are still weighing our options as we move into production. But, they've all been accommodating and open about their processes, and helpful in providing the information we need to make the right choice for our magazine. From page count to paper and ink options, to quantities that makes sense for our budget, they have provided the tools we need to feel comfortable moving forward as a print publication. Our editor-in-chief has some experience with print, as she worked very closely with the Publisher at Natural Awakenings Magazine Dallas. Her experience will definitely come in handy, and she has mentors with whom she can consult throughout the process.We hope to be able to print future issues, but we are still building a following, so it's difficult to project whether or not our budget will allow us to commit to print runs for each issue moving forward. Our current plan is to allow people to pre-order the print version of each issue to determine quantity and cost relative to our budget for each quarterly magazine. Once we've established ourselves as a print publication, we'll introduce regular purchase options to order individual issues and annual subscriptions in print."

Between planning, prepping, cooking, and cleaning mealtime can seem like an impossible (but necessary) task.My partners and I all struggled with food allergies too. We found it almost impossible to find recipes that were fast and easy without a ton of ingredients and it was certainly not fun converting recipes that called for processed foods.We barely had energy after a long day's work to spend time planning, prepping, and cooking then to have no one eat it because they didn’t like it.  We decided to talk to professional chefs and home cooks alike to discover the secrets to getting dinner on the table in 30 minutes or less every single night of the week - even with food allergies. We took that information and created a system to make sure that no matter which recipes we picked, there were make-ahead steps. We made sure the system was scalable for the size of family and that it would create a custom shopping list as well. Weeknight meals were on the table in record time! (Check out a 5-day plan here) It was like one of those boxed meal delivery services only way less expensive and we had control over the ingredients eliminating the worry about dealing with a reaction. Our families LOVED the meals - even our pickiest eaters. There was little to waste to boot because every thing we bought was used! Heaven!And 20 Dishes was born. We created a mobile responsive membership site and give our members everything but the kitchen sink in their membership: Share this project via TwitterWe were amazed by the results. A couple hundred really awesome people signed up! And for the most part (about 98%) absolutely loved it.  Kickstarter is an incredible community of people who appreciate great products. We think 20 Dishes fits that bill. We’ve gotten incredible feedback from our awesome members, and we’ll use the Kickstarter funds to revolutionize a new type of cooking experience.We’ll use the funds for:From the bottom of our happy, hungry hearts we thank you for being a part of 20 Dishes with us.

We've done this because there are thousands of people asking us to reach these goals, and hopefully after our Kickstarter campaign there will be thousands more.We've set a goal of ""shipping our software"" or ""creating the new 20 Dishes experience"" by August of 2017 (this year!).

I am approaching the Kickstarter community to help me fund the production of 10 digital c-prints.RECTANGLE STUDIES 1-10  Each Rectangle Study will be printed by an Océ LightJet 5000 photographic laser printer on Fuji Crystal Archive Pro Super C Matte photographic paper. Each print will be 40” x 40” in size and signed by the artist as a single-edition digital c-print.REWARDSThe rewards for this project are very straightforward. Each print costs approximately $100.00 to produce. So for each $100.00 I receive in contributions, I will send the contributor a signed, single-edition Rectangle Study print. I will receive no monetary profit from this project, all prints will be provided at cost. My ultimate goal is to produce the work and get it into the hands of those who want it.OVERFUNDINGShould I be fortunate enough to receive overfunding for this project, I will continue production of rectangle studies 11-20, again providing the prints themselves as the rewards.  For a complete portfolio of work, please visit:http://www.jeffgdavis.comThank you in advance for your support!",,https://www.kickstarter.com/projects/jeffgdavis/facades?ref=discovery_category_newest,jeffgdavis/facades,"I am currently developing a new body of work called Facades for an exhibition this January at the Walter Art Gallery in Scottsdale, AZ. The Walter Art Gallery is a contemporary art space that celebrates the work of unique and experimental artists.This project is a series of abstract prints that suggest the window patterns and glass reflections of high-rise buildings. Each image is generated through a custom algorithm that randomly selects the window configuration, color progression, and degree of perspective.For my show at Walter Art Gallery, I am planning on exhibiting 16 different Facade prints. Six pieces will be 36” x 36” digital c-prints, face-mounted to acrylic glass and backed with PVC board for installation. The other ten pieces will be 20” x 20” archival pigment prints, framed in white.In addition to the work in the exhibition, I will produce additional Facade prints at varying sizes as rewards for project contributors. Every Facade print that is produced for this project will be unique. This means that apart from the postcards, no two rewards will be the same! Rewards will be delivered after the exhibition closes at the end February.In order to professionally produce this project, I am seeking $4,000 to help cover the production costs (approximately $3000 for the printing, mounting, and material costs of the large prints, and another $1000 for the printing and framing of the medium prints). Any funding beyond this target will be used to produce additional prints and professionally document the exhibition at the gallery.By supporting this project, you are helping me realize my vision as an artist and execute a first-class exhibition at Walter Art Gallery. Your support is greatly appreciated!","The only challenge I foresee is the tight window for the campaign, trying to complete fundraising before the holidays. I will need to start production on the work for the exhibition prior to the end of the campaign, so hopefully we will be able to reach our target quickly."

https://www.kickstarter.com/projects/stormetech/arduecu-the-worlds-first-waterproof-and-rugged-ard?ref=discovery_category_newest,stormetech/arduecu-the-worlds-first-waterproof-and-rugged-ard,"ArduECU is the world’s first rugged, IP69K waterproof, Arduino compatible, electronic control unit (ECU) to be used for harsh environments. The circuitry inside of the IP69K waterproof rated enclosure is a self-contained Arduino-based Atmega 328P microcontroller platform that also has additional capability, durability and water resistance built-in, right out of the box. From controlling motors, servos, interfacing sensors, high voltage digital inputs and outputs, ArduECU can do all that your normal Arduino can do plus more!Now you can create Arduino based projects that are all so familiar, but finally rugged, waterproof and robust.*Requires external fusing. Max recommended current per ECU is 30A.The video below shows a brief overview of an ArduECU MK1B (Basic) Controlling a motor and LED light strip directly via PWM.ArduECU is built tough for all of your rugged requirements. And yes, it can take a small blow from a hammer without any noticeable damage.ArduECU is rated to IP69K for all of your waterproof requirements. This means it is even capable for applications where you require a close-range high pressure, high temperature spray downs.ArduECU is also cloud capable which means it can stream data via ESP8266 Wi-Fi for your rugged IoT applications. Like streaming data from your backyard garden weather station (shown below).The sky's the limit on what ArduECU can do for you. Whether it be machine control, industrial automation, rugged outdoor use, or any of the following examples below - ArduECU has you covered in some way! Your only limitation is your own creativity.Do you have a cool new concept for a product you've always thought of developing but you didn't have a low-cost controller to do it? Well now you can make that concept come true with ArduECU. Pledge for a unit today and let your imagination run wild with your new concept!Have a prototype machine, lab setup or test apparatus that needs some controls? Use the ArduECU to turn on and off lights, control motors, or use use analog inputs like potentiometers to control a process automatically.Have a marina and want to monitor your expensive yachts going in and out? Now you can! Use an internet connected ArduECU to create a mobile control system that alerts you, texts you, or emails you when a boat may be missing, moving unexpectedly, or rocking too heavily during a storm. Keep tabs on your boat at all times! (Would require additional GPS module and accelerometer connected either externally via wire harness or via on-board headers).Have a vehicle fleet you need to keep track of? Need an open-source platform to manage your valuable assets? With ArduECU, you could create a fleet tracking unit to monitor where your vehicles are, how fast they are travelling, or even to keep tabs on when they are due for their next service. Connect to your vehicles control system via ArduECU to keep tabs on critical vehicle data like throttle position, temperature or RPM's. Connect to an internet dashboard to view your fleet's information remotely from any internet connected phone, tablet or computer.Heck, maybe if you, the backers, back enough, we might reach a special stretch goal to enable some sort of ""cool"" custom ArduECU IoT dashboard for this type of application? Just saying.Power RequirementsReference VoltagesCommunicationsProcessorInputs/Outputs*Hardware jumper selections must match your software configuration. **Above specs for MK1C and MK1B models only, although some are the same as with an Uno since it is ATmega 328 based. You can reference exact Arduino Uno specs used with the MK1U here. You can also use the Arduino Uno Wifi which has specs listed here.Environmental Ratings**Ratings need final verification through certified testing.ArduECU's housing is based off of the Cinch ME enclosure. It is a proven enclosure for use with off-road machines, vehicles, and agricultural equipment to name a few. We've chosen this ECU enclosure since it is readily available, rather cost effective and readily available if you ever need a replacement.All of ArduECU's hard-wired connections for Inputs, outputs, serial communication, CAN and power are connected via the Cinch ME mating connector which plugs into the ArduECU. The mating connector is what you'd use to interface your ArduECU to your system which includes external sensors, coils, motors, valves, potentiometers, switches or a CAN network for example.ArduECU's mating connector will come as a kit which includes pre-terminated Cinch pins that you can populate into your mating connector as desired. For Serial communication, you can solder on a DB-9 connector to the Tx and Rx lines of the mating connector to connect to an external Serial to USB converter.Since ArduECU uses a water-tight enclosure, getting it open can be tricky of you do not have the proper tool. We have come up with a low cost, 3D printable housing opener tool, to easily open and close your housing as needed to configure settings, jumpers, add components or for whatever reason that may require you to open it.CAD and .STL files for 3D printing the housing opener tool with be available as a free download on our website. Also, every ECU sold will come shipped with your first housing opener tool.ArduECU comes in three models. All which have different levels of functionality and purpose. Review the breakdown of models below.The Uno breakout model of ArduECU is a custom made, PCB breakout board designed to fit inside our Cinch housing. It has the footprint for an Arduino Uno microcontroller and can also accept the Arduino Uno Wi-fi variant (which we supply with our MK1U Developers kit).This version allows you to convert any existing Arduino into a waterproof, rugged Arduino that can be used for rugged applications. It is a lower cost alternative to those who may not want to purchase the full blown ArduECU controller with custom circuit board assembly.Want Wi-Fi? Easy by using Arduino Uno Wi-Fi with built-in ESP8266 Wi-Fi chip. Now your basic IoT projects can be placed outdoors or in rugged locations!Want a totally autonomous temporary, mobile ECU? There is even room to place a small battery pack (9V, or rechargeable Li-po) inside of the housing to create a wireless, and totally remote ECU for your application! Supply power right from within your ECU.Another reason to buy the MK1U is that you could make a waterproof Arduino battery pack. Place an array of batteries inside the MK1U kit, and interface it to another MK1U with Arduino built in, for a much longer operation time!Want to create a garden monitoring system, or outdoor sensor that you want to trigger without wires? Use the above scenario to create a fully wireless control option! How about an waterproof RFID based unit to open and close a door?The built-in prototype area allows for capability to add in your own jumpers, wires, components, MOSFETS, relays or other Arduino based shields (such as GPS, Bluetooth, SD Card, accelerometer, RFID etc.) to make a fully custom ECU for your project!Geared towards:ArduECU MK1B is our custom, ground-up controller based on the ATMega 328P. It is a fully re-designed ECU controller based upon the Arduino Uno microcontroller. For those designers who want more functionality than that of a basic Arduino Uno but don't want CAN communications enabled, should consider purchasing this version.*Requires external fuse which is not currently included.**Bypassing the protection circuitry will only allow you to source standard amount of current as capable by normal Arduino.**Has CAN circuitry built-in, but it is not enabled as with the MK1C version-- which is the CAN-ready option.Geared Towards:ArduECU MK1C is our custom, ground-up controller with a built-in CAN controller which is enabled out-of-the-box. It is a fully re-designed ECU controller based upon the ATmega 328P with additional capability. It has all of the specs of the MK1B except that it has the CAN controller enabled for additional CAN-based applications such as:Geared Towards: Designers, control engineers and car hackers who want more functionality than that of the basic MK1U or MK1B and want to add in a little CANbus!Standard Programming via Arduino IDEOut of the box, ArduECU programming is achieved serially via the Tx and Rx lines of the Cinch header. Therefore, the user would need a USB to Serial Converter in order to program the unit or to transmit serial data. Since we wanted to keep the user from needing to remove the board from the housing to program it, we did not include a USB connector on the board itself (For MK1B and MK1C variants only, as MK1U Uno Breakout verison still has internal USB or Over-The-Air programming). By default, ArduECU is coded using the industry standard and ever popular, Arduino Wiring Language; so using it will be a breeze if you know the standard Arduino Wiring language. Use one of the hundreds of libraries or online examples to get started programming your ECU for your own project.All ArduECU functions are compatible with standard Arduino functions and libraries as normal-- The only difference being the fact that you need to understand the correlation between Cinch Pins to Arduino Pins on the hardware side (but don't worry, we will provide sample code, examples and documentation to get you started).ArduECU is versatile in that it can also be coded and programmed using alternative methods:ArduECU is the World's First Arduino that is compatible with Codesys and the IEC 61131-3 standard. Now you can program your ArduECU just like you would with industrial, professional grade automotive and off-road ECU's; such as the examples you'd find here.Another method of programming can be performed via the CANbus directly; although this option would require a special non-Arduino based bootloader. In this way, you could program your ArduECU from anywhere where you would normally connect to your vehicle or machines CAN network; as long as ArduECU is connected to your CAN network. Now for the pricing and rewards structure. It is broken out based upon the three models; MK1U, MK1B and MK1C. We also have a developers kit for those who want a package deal with accessories to get started and aid in development.If we raise these below amounts, awesome new stretch goals will be unlocked! One of them was hinted in the above commentary. Did you find it? You must be a serious maker if you did! Back us now Kickstarter to find out what more we might have up our sleeves. Unlocking goals could unleash new features, add-ons or software additions and libraries.Where will your money go?If this campaign is successful (of which we hope so), a vast majority of the funds will go towards finishing the project and obviously delivering a high quality product to you-- our backers!What we hope to do with the money we raise:1. Finalize our circuit board development and do our last iteration of the PCB and circuit board assembly.2. Weed out any bugs with our suppliers by performing a final pre-production pilot run of production-based parts.3. Perform environmental testing on the ArduECU to ensure that every aspect of the unit is as rugged and as durable as possible (ex, vibration testing, CE, FCC, heat, thermal shock, etc).4. Put a vast majority of it back into fulfilling backer rewards.5. Finish development of our custom ArduECU libraries and CAN bus software development which includes items such as:6. Donate 10% of our profits to charity and our local community.7. Grow the business and begin developing other cool aspects of the ArduECU platform!8. Begin creating kits for different control applications that include an ArduECU at it's core.Warranty and ReturnsAll Kickstarter rewards are final, although we will work with customers on a case-by-case basis if needed for warranty and support.ShippingWe would like to offer all USA based backers free shipping.

These modules are capable of up to 2 Mbps communication rate, and has a incredibly low latency, making controlling high performance projects a breeze.It comes with an 8 Pin female header that is used to interface with the NRF chip, a 16 pin header to interface with the LCD display, and a 14 pin header to connect any additional items you want! Like Bluetooth, WiFi, or even a buzzer! Add an accelerometer for additional motion control, or whatever else you can think of! The 14 pin user header has Serial, SPI, and I2C communication available for whatever your projects needs.This Pilot Remote Control for Arduino is based on the ATMega32U4 which has USB 2.0 communication, allowing you to use it as a mouse or keyboard on your own computer! You could even use it to play Minecraft!With the integrated LCD header, plug in the included LCD display so your remote can let you know of important information from your project, like battery levels or telemetry. Or, if you're an experienced coder, program your own menu to increase the functionality of The Pilot RC even more. The possibilities are endless.The Remote Control comes with a built in voltage sensor for measuring battery percentage! Simply hook up any battery between 6 and 20 volts, and then use our example code (or make your own) and you will be able to read the voltage of your battery with accuracy of up to 0.01 volts. Be sure to always know when you need to charge up!There are two options you have when ordering the Wireless Pilot Remote Control for Arduino. You can purchase the Pilot RC with the standard NRF modules with a range of 100 meters (300 feet) or the NRF extended modules which can have a range of up to 1500 meters (5000 feet).The Pilot RC is great for many, from advanced users to people just looking into Arduino! Do not worry, we will provide example code for all of the features on the board, such as how to control the LCD, NRF, and voltage sensor. When you are ready, you can start modifying the code for whatever you need, or make your own! We will make sure you can start coding on day 1.Once funded and the design is finalized, we will release the schematic and board layout for the design. Just like any other Arudino, our project will be made open source so you can make any modifications you want. Once you are familiar with the board, you can start adding your own equipment and make the Pilot Remote Control whatever you want it to be. We cannot wait to see what you build and control with it.The video above shows a demonstration of the analog sticks along with a wireless communication demonstration. Notice how we used a NRF extended range module on the remote control, but used a standard NRF module on the drone. This was to keep the weight down on the drone while still achieving a good range!The Serial Monitor in the first demonstration shows the raw analog values coming from the joysticks 2-axis and the digital value of the push button. While the wireless communication demonstration shows how you can send and receive telemetry from the Pilot RC. Looking at the display, you can see multiple values. The first is a command to pull down the stick to arm the drone. The DR value is the drone battery voltage and the Sig value is how many signals a second the we are receiving from the drone!The Wireless Pilot RC for Arduino can be used for any of your existing projects! Either control a RC car, a drone, or a game on your computer. The easy to use NRFs allow you to plug them into any existing Arduino project and within seconds you can be sending and receiving wireless data.The controller is designed to be easy to use and to be a great starting point for a tinkerer wanting to get into Arduino based projects. It comes with pushbuttons, joysticks, an LCD display header, NRF header, and voltage sensor to get you up and running with your project in no time.If you are a more experienced Arduino user, then plug in your own devices into the user pinouts section of the board. Add a buzzer for noise notifications, an accelerometer for motion controller, or maybe even a microphone for voice control. This board is perfect for beginners and advanced users alike.The video below shows a working prototype of the Pilot RC being used to control an Arduino Drone!The Pilot RC works just as any other Arduino and uses the ATmega32U4 microcontroller. This specific microcontroller comes with USB communication, negating the need for a separate Serial to USB converter. It is an 8-bit SOC, with a 10-bit ADC, 32 KB of programming space, 2.5 KB of SRAM, and 1 KB of EEPROM. The board itself uses a Mini USB port to be powered and programmed.The board does come with the ability to be powered by an external battery ranging from 6V to 20V. Two capacitors are placed at the Vin pins to provide voltage stability, as well as two resistors that act as a voltage divider so that the battery voltage can be safely read by the Arduino.The dimensions of the board are 100 mm x 55 mm. The mounting holes have dimensions of 94 mm x 49 mm and have a diameter of 3.5 mm.The joysticks are what make a remote control a remote control. The joysticks work like two potentiometers in each axis, and include a push button (just like an Xbox or PlayStation controller). We will be using quality joysticks that we have personally tested.These joysticks are soldered directly to the board, and are already connected straight to the Arudino. Just load up some code and start using them for whatever you please. The board is 1.6 mm thick, ensuring it can withstand the force when you are pushing the sticks in either direction.There is an ISP header included just in case you need to bootload the Arduino for any reason. (Trust us, we have all made mistakes). The board also comes with TX and RX LEDs, so you can visually see when data is being sent or received.One of the big attractions of this board is the integrated LCD header. This header fits the standard 1x16 pin configuration (which will be included with purchase). Simply just plug in your LCD display, and start coding! The LCD display can be used to give you real time feedback from whatever project you are controlling.The LCD header also comes with a built in potentiometer so that you can control the contrast of your display, or use it for whatever else you may need! If you have no need for an LCD display, then do not use it. You will have access to even more pinouts to connect whatever you desire.The LCD display header is shifted slightly towards the left of the board. We did this so that when you plug in the display into the header, it lines up center with the Remote Control. (I know, we thought of everything).The display has 2 lines where you can add 16 charterers each. These can include letters, numbers, or even pictures. This display has a blue backlight which means you can see it at night, and the text will appear white.There is a reason the ATMega32U4 is our favorite Arduino microcontroller, and it's because it has USB 2.0 communication built in. No need for a serial to USB converter that takes up space and energy. And because of the native USB support, you can connect your Pilot RC straight to your computer and use it like a mouse or keyboard! A really unique feature specific to this microcontroller.The Pilot RC is as easy to program as a normal Arduino. Simply load up the Arduino IDE and select Arduino Micro. Plug in the Mini USB port to your computer, and use it just like a normal Arduino. No additional set up needed! Upload any code of your choice to the board and you're done!Of course you can! Just hook up any battery with voltage greater than 6 volts and the Pilot RC will come to life! No more cords! The Pilot RC also comes with a built in voltage sensor that will allow you and the Arduino to monitor the life of your battery, notifying you of when to swap or recharge the battery.Easy! The Pilot RC has breakout headers to dedicated pins on the Arduino. Just plug them in through jumper wires or solder them on! The available pin configuration is as follows:Left SideRight SideThe pins allow you to get digital and analog devices, as well as SPI and I2C interfaces! These pins also provide power for 5V and 3.3V. It is just like a normal Arduino!If you do not want to use an LCD screen in your project, then don't! You will have access to so many more pins if you have no need for a display.The board layout and schematic are already complete! To show you that we aren't lying, take a look below. All the pins are available for you to plug in whatever else you may need, making the possibility of combinations nearly infinite.That's up to you! Personally, we like to 3D print our own custom housing (as shown in the pictures above). But you can also make them yourself out of acrylic, plastic, wood, or whatever you want! The board does not need a case to operate, but has mounting holes around the board should you so desire.Whether you are an avid tinkerer, or new to robotics and want to jump in, this is the perfect addition to your collection. Having a pre-built arduino wireless remote control makes it easy to control any of your arduino based projects. No wires and no connection checking, everything is already connected and ready to go.Just plug it into your computer and open up the Arudino IDE. It works just like any other Arduino Micro and is detected as such! Look at this example of a wirelessly controlled peg climbing robot using the Pilot RC!We already have a working prototype of the board! The final product will only be slightly different (depending on what you, the backers, want). We have talked to our PCB fabrication house and we have worked out all the numbers. If we get funded, then all we have to do is give them the go! This whole process could take a few weeks as our suppliers assemble the joysticks, but we will make sure to keep you updated.Once we receive the board from the PCB fabrication and assembly house, then we will start bootloading, testing, and mailing them out. The bootloading process is something that we want to do for you before you get your board. Bootloading the board is pretty much putting the ""Arduino Operating System"" on it. When you plug it in it will appear as an Arduino ready to program, rather than just an ATmega32U4.Once the bootloading process is done, we will test all of the aspects of the board. This includes the joysticks, the LCD header, the NRFs, the voltage sensor, and the user pinouts. If the testing checks out, we will pack them up and ship them out to you!Once funded we will begin building and assembling your Wireless Pilot RC. You will receive the assembled Pilot RC, two rubber thumbstick caps, a 16x2 LCD Display, as well as your choice of 2 standard NRF or NRF extended modules.Thank you so much for helping make our vision come true! We look forward to delivering your new Wireless Pilot Remote Control!","The risks for this project are pretty low. We have already built three prototypes and have made sure all the bugs have been worked out. Our PCB fabrication house already has the designs and the bill of materials to make and assemble every single board. If we get funded, a few weeks will be spent doing more extraneous testing (using oscilloscopes and other technical processes) to make sure everything is working fine. Right before we send in the final order, we will purchase 10 boards to make sure we receive them exactly how we expect them. If they pass our quality check, then the next shipment will be coming your way!The joysticks are the other tricky part of this project. You do not want bad joysticks on your board with a lot of dead stick and terrible accuracy. We are looking for great joysticks that do not break the bank. We believe we have found them, but just in case we will keep looking for quality joysticks that we can get in mass quantity. Do not worry, we will keep you updated every step of the way.",https://www.kickstarter.com/projects/763396391/the-pilot-remote-control-for-arduino-0?ref=discovery_category_newest,763396391/the-pilot-remote-control-for-arduino-0,"Whether you are controlling your own drone, RC car, stereo speakers or anything you desire to communicate with wirelessly, a fully assembled Arduino Wireless Remote Control will be a welcomed new addition to any of your projects.

Two months ago we launched this project with a $10,000 goal. We hit over $3,000 and were overwhelmed with the support.And this is why we know we can get it done this time:Our new funding goal is $4,000 dollars. After rerunning the numbers we believe we can make this work with 100 backers. We thought we would need the $10,000 dollars to be able to safely fund the project last time, but to save on costs we will manually be assembling some parts of the board. We have also changed the board design in a way to make it more cost effective for manufacturing. We have not lowered the quality of the board at all, just made it easier to be manufactured.One of the big mistakes of our first Kickstarter was that we relied on Kickstarter themselves to promote our product, and that was very naive of us. To fix this we have created social media platforms to get our products our there. So far we have over 1500 followers across all social media platforms and have started to advertise on these sites as well. In addition, we also compiled an email list of potential backers.We are confident that we will hit our goal this time around. We have had multiple articles written about our product since our initial launch and you can go check them out through the websites below!Once funded we will begin building and assembling your Wireless Pilot RC.

In addition, an ever-growing number of non-Muslims, curious about Islam and its practices, are also seeking some form of spirituality in their lives and are turning to such practices.One of the ways of gaining mental clarity in this blessed month is the daily recitation of supplications taught by Prophet Muhammad, peace be upon him and his family. This unique book presents the short daily supplications which the last Prophet of God, peace be upon him and his family, used to personally recite each day for 30 days, and features a brief, yet inspiring explanation of each prayer, based on the Prophetic teachings and verses of the Quran.This daily book of prayers for the Month of Ramadhan is sure to boost the spiritual strength of any reader and give them a better insight into the world around them and their own souls by elucidating on a wide variety of topics, some of which include:1. Spiritual Awareness2. The Sweetness contained in the Remembrance of God3. Connection to the Divine4. Active consciousness of God5. Mercy of God6. Internal Happiness7. Gaining the Pleasure and Acceptance of Godand many more.This book is bound to make a world of difference on how we view ourselves and how we better understand the religious teachings which Islam has brought forth to offer mental clarity and spiritual openness which will give us energy throughout the year to better ourselves and the world around us.","The translation, editing and design of this book has been completed and we have one final cover to cover reading to perform before we sign off on the project. As we are going to launch this book at least 6 weeks before the Month of Ramadhan next year, this gives us ample time to complete the final reading and printing of the book.",https://www.kickstarter.com/projects/1357654719/salvation-through-patience-and-perserverance?ref=discovery_category_newest,1357654719/salvation-through-patience-and-perserverance,"Salam Alaykum!We've all had ups and downs in our lives when things just don't seem to be going as we want to them go. We could either give up or we could do what the great men and women of God have done throughout the ages, turned to the All-Merciful Creator for support and assistance.How do we do so? There are many modes and methods of prayer and supplication, but perhaps none are as powerful as Salat al-Ghufaylah - a prayer which the scholars of spirituality have spoken about and especially the Dhikr Yunusiyyah - the special invocation made by Prophet Yunus (Jonah) when he found himself trapped in the belly of the fish.This book is the first ever English work on this prayer and not only features a step by step method on how to pray, but it covers the following areas:1. Introduction to the Daily Prayers2. Recommended Prayers in the Ahadith3. What is Salat al-Ghufaylah?4. Benefits of the Stories of the Qur'an5. Salat al-Ghufaylah method 6. Various points about Salat al-Ghufaylah7. Historical analysis of Prophet Yunus8. Commentary and explanation of everything recited and performed in this prayer9. Other recommended prayers for the believerAs you can see, this is not just a step by step book on how to perform this prayer, but rather, it goes into much more detail and will leave the reader WANTING to dedicate his or her time to the performance of this and other prayers on a constant basis. It is sure to elevate our worship to a greater level of being believers who will be actively looking for an opportunity to converse with the All Beloved Allah.","As with any project, there are always unexpected obstacles which we hope don't come up, but need to plan for.The writing and first edit of this book are now complete; the cover page is finalized and a special how-to video has also been produced and is live on our Youtube channel [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tQZjlWk1ywI] - all that is left is the Foreword by a world-renowned Scholar, an Introduction by another well-known Muslim Scholar and the printing of the book!We are hoping to have this book ready BEFORE the Month of Ramadhan but are cautiously optimistic on this date and so, will probably have it in your hands during the Blessed Month of Ramadhan of 2016.If anything changes, rest assured that we will let each and every one of our supporters know!"

The Eastern Equatoria Youth Music Project seeks to help the community build a multi-use music centre; where youth can utilize a practice space and recording studio.The core of the project is the construction of the centre, built by the community, utilizing local resources. The building will take about two months. During the dry season (January-March), residents of Budi County will build a thatched building over a clay foundation, powered by a solar generator, in Ngatuba Village, located in Budi County of Eastern Equatoria.The $5,000 budget will cover costs of building materials, the generator, music recording equipment, and the daily maintenance of the centre.$500 - Build Music Centre (Local Materials)		- Two Months Construction (Building Supplies Seasonally Available January - March) 		- Clay foundation, thatched house$2000 - Solar Power Generator$2000 - Music Equipment (Field Recorder, Laptop)$500 - Daily Maintenance of Centre (Food, Cleaning Supplies, Presentations)		- Six Months Operational Budget$5000 - Sum Total Fundraising Goal In communities throughout Eastern Equatoria, music is played before, after and during harvesting time. Songs are composed and sung, accompanied by thumb pianos and various shakers as a form of community education, typically focusing on culture, morals and history.The two primary project planners, Augustino Lucano, of Southern Sudanese Children's Literacy Foundation, and Matt Hanson, freelance journalist and writer, have met over the past few months with a shared vision regarding the youth of Eastern Equatoria. Our initial meetings culminated in two podcasts (1 & 2) featured at The Media Co-op. Recently, Augustino was recently interviewed by the CBC regarding current events in South Sudan. ","Firstly, the two project coordinators, Augustino Lucano and Matt Hanson, currently reside in the United States and Canada, separately. As this poses risks and challenges, this also offers extraordinary opportunities to branch out support networks internationally. Secondly, and most importantly, armed violence and political conflicts in South Sudan can create an altogether inhospitable environment for positive social progress, as with cultural vitality and progressive community-based work. However, this also makes the youth music focus all the more pertinent, and needed. Lastly, as there is currently no physical space, the construction, from start to finish, will invite community consultation and local resource management, however, since one of our project leads (Augustino) is from the community, there will be no foreseeable impediments to the very frequent community-based work of constructing thatched buildings.",https://www.kickstarter.com/projects/80198883/a-romaniote-odyssey?ref=discovery_category_newest,80198883/a-romaniote-odyssey,"There are social critics who believe that experiential historicism means living in the past. ""History repeats itself, first as tragedy, second as farce,"" said Karl Marx. I ask, ""What kind of future will there be without critical historical reflection?"" And to that perennial human question, I will add that there is no future without auto-history, and by that I mean having a subjective understanding of one's own history as a way in which to perceive current social, cultural, and even economic realities. As the great ""people's"" historian Howard Zinn said, ""Objectivity is neither possible nor desirable."" Again, I will start from the end. On the 25th of March, 1944, the Nazis deported 1,960 people from Ioannina, the land where the community had lived and created a distinct Jewish culture for over two thousand years.I will spend the month of March in Ioannina.While from an American viewpoint (one steeped in Romaniote heritage), what I am producing is an incipient body of literature that recognizes the Romaniote cultural and historical perspective in the contemporary. The body of literature begins with a series of articles, and aspires to book-length literary works in both nonfiction and fiction, to respect the nature of oral storytelling and the meaning of cultural history from a contemporary Romaniote perspective.To briefly introduce my past literary developments up until this project, in 2011, I returned to journalism six years after starting my first paid writing job at a newspaper when I was eighteen and still in high school. After taking those six years to develop and publish work in creative literature internationally, I was again compelled to write journalism, only invigorated by a new sense of writing in service of social causes. That was in Canada, where I wrote extensively on such themes as where cultural tradition and environmental consciousness align, and diverge. As a recent university graduate from a rarefied multidisciplinary social sciences program titled, ""International Indigenous Studies"" I began to research, and write reflexively on the oral and folk history that I appreciated through a close friendship with my grandfather. His name is Manny Asser, and I owe the foundation of my intellectual independence and literary appreciation to him. He was born in 1915 as the son of Romaniote migrants from Ioannina, Greece. Today, his early life in the Lower East of Manhattan during the 1920s and Williamsburg, Brooklyn during the Depression and pre-WWII years continue to surface in his stories, as he lives on into his hundredth and first year.In continuity with his storytelling, I seek to develop and expand the recognition of ""Romaniote literature"" as a style and genre, like African literature, or Yiddish literature, although regrettably in English and sadly not in Yevanic, the now near-extinct Romaniote tongue. Once I have created the work that best represents this literary niche, I will collaborate with translators in Hebrew, Turkish and Greek with respect to the span of historically prominent cultural syntheses that shaped the Romaniote identity in Ioannina, and in diaspora. The current research excursion, ""A Romaniote Odyssey"" from Istanbul to Ioannina begins at Ahrida Synagogue, the oldest synagogue in Istanbul. Arguably originating prior to Ottoman rule in the Byzantine era, the late Roman Empire that has led to the name ""Romaniote"" to distinguish the culture of Greek-speaking Jews. Ahrida Synagogue was, interestingly, founded by the Romaniote community.Having gained permissions from the Turkish Jewish Community, I will visit Ahrida Synagogue in the Istanbul neighborhood of Balat on February 3rd. Only two of nineteen synagogues remain in Balat, once a vibrant Jewish neighborhood. In the first week of 2016, the second remaining synagogue in Balat, Istipol, of Macedonian origins, opened its doors for services for the first time in 65 years, and two weeks later was vandalized by anti-Israeli graffiti. I am foremost concentrating on Ottoman-era Ioannina, particularly the two decades leading up to the city becoming part of modern Greece, when my ancestors emigrated to New York. In this way, to begin from Istanbul is appropriate, the capital of the Ottoman society, once known as Constantinople, to encompass the entirety of Romaniote-Ottoman history. On the 18th of February, I will leave Istanbul by bus to Salonika, where I will spend up to ten days in the city that was famously known as ""The Mother of Israel"" for the vibrancy of Sephardic and Romaniote (Greek-Jewish) culture that emerged there under Ottoman rule. From Salonika, I will go to Ioannina, where I will immerse myself in local history, culture and ecology.","Travelling overland from Turkey to the Balkan region may be challenging in the midst of the current refugee crisis, especially now near the northern Greek border (where Ioannina is located). With enough funds, I will be able to travel safely, and more securely, with the right resources that I will need to cross the border, and find accommodation efficiently. I plan to stay in Ioannina for a month, and during that time will need funds to sustain my visit, to comprehensively appreciate the city of Ioannina in a deep, historical and socially-conscious light, and to also access rare books and obscure sites related to Romaniote cultural history."

We enjoyed it so much that wedecided to share it witheveryone. Here is the gameplay:Your battle of drawings will create a fun and 100% unique storyboard that you can easily share on Facebook, Twitter and anywhere else.The app will be available on iOS and Android first, and later on other platforms.Every time you receive a drawing in one of your games, you have to choose whether or not it destroys your last drawing. So until it does, the game continues.But if you receive a drawing that, you think, cannot destroy your last one, then you can reject it. And if you do so, your story will be ended and sent to a tribunal composed of other players.Every other players will have a chance to give their opinion on your game during the next 24 hours. They can vote for your last drawing, or for your friend’s last drawing.After the 24 hours, and if the game had got a sufficient amount of votes, the verdict will be given and you will receive a notification to let you know if you won… or if you lost :-/.You can still watch it in the mobile app and share it as you want.On the side of the mobile app, we are also working on a website for Draw Destruction. It will enable everyone to see, like and share every games.One of the most important points for us was the ability to easily find your friends and play with them, so we integrated Facebook. If you’re not using Facebook then no worries, you can still play with your email address.One of the many things we added to the original concept of Draw Destruction is the possibility to add a “rule” to your game. It can be anything from “No rules” to “Draw things made of water only”, “Draw flying things only” or any other rule you can imagine (yes, you can choose a predefined rule OR write your own one ;-) )Then when it comes to the drawing part, you can now use multiple sizes and multiple colors without having to carry around all your pencils :-D And if your last stroke is bad, you can just undo it.After you sent your drawing to your friend, you can leave the game. We will notify you when it’s your turn again.In the future updates, we plan to add more drawing features like transparency, drawing effects (like stars, hearts, bubbles, …) and template drawings (like stickmen, weapons, vehicles, buildings, …).The other major update coming after the first release will bring achievements to Draw Destruction. Many goals to achieve along the game will get you a lot of rewards and give you a grade visible to other players.ZERO ! It is totally FREE to play Draw Destruction, as we wanted it (and we truly care about this aspect of the game). The battle part and the tribunal are freely accessible to anyone who has a compatible iOS or Android device.Only the optional features will be unlockable with the virtual money that you can either earn while playing or buy directly with real money.We are 4 people involved in this exciting project:Francois Amblard andMaxime Thibaut: We are two entrepreneurs freshly graduated from the Epitech, a computer science school based in Paris, France. It gives us all the keys to understand the technical, managerial and financial aspects of creating, running and releasing a project like Draw Destruction. We both have a professional experience in mobile development on Android, iOS and BlackBerry. We are also passionate about video-games since our very first years (probably like you if you’re reading this ;-) ) and that goes without talking about new software and hardware technologies!Gaspard VanKoningsveld: I am one of the first beta-testers of Draw Destruction, involved in bugs-reporting and I am also responsible of this KickStarter campaign.Adrien Buono: I am a junior Graphic Designer blessed by the power of squares, circles and triangles.

If you want to know more about the story, let's have a look to the teaser …Why do we talk about a shepherd in cable cars ?This movie is certainly talking about a shepherd, looking after one of his goat through the rough and chaotic mountain, but not only. As a great symbol of nature, wild and overwhelming, he will be opposed for the first time in his life, to the soft and appealing comfort of a house : the cabins. This comfort is kind of coming from nowhere and really intrusive, but still, what can we do to it, when it's that attractive ? Neither good nor bad, it's just here, and for free.As you can see, this movie will be quite contrasted. Limited but safe properties with the warm and curved manufactured cabins, versus the no frontier and free mountains, but rugged and cold.So now, take a seat in the livingroom's cabin and enjoy the landscape !Why you can trust our team ?From the beginning to now, 31 serious people have given a hand up on this animated short movie (animators, renderer, sound composer …). Most of them did it voluntarily.What we have done and what is missing ?Today, we can say that about 50% of the movie is done (characters, modeling and a part of animation). But to finish this film, there are still post-production steps missing. The funds raised will help us to complete these steps by hiring qualified professionnals who will maximize the quality of the movie. Also, it will help the team to get a second wind to finish it. If we raise enough funds, it will allow us to :-Finalize animation> 4000£ :The animation is nearly finished, with the first goal, we could finalize it.-Lighting and rendering>6000£ more :It has a huge importance in our movie. The effects with the frozen mountains will bring a cold and attractive mood in Mr. Balmes’ world.-Sound design and music> 3000£ more :Mute doesn’t mean silent. The descrepency between the deafening mechanic noise of the cable cars and the extreme silence of the mountains will require accurate sound effects. About the music, it brings a different and retro atmosphere, an enigmatic touch.-3D stereoscopic> 3000£ more :Don’t be wowed … Yes, it’s a 3D short movie. You will live in Mr. Balmes’ life and watch through his eyes the wonderful view he is enjoying.They Believe in usThe adventure has begun about 2 years ago …. We started the project with regional financial helps and the CNC (organism for the cinema in France) which helped us for the 3D stereoscopic effects.Recently, we made a sponsorship with Chaos Group which gave us Vray licences for the rendering. Renderstreet generously offered us the machines. We really thank all of them for their support and their trust.We need you allToday, we have decided to try the kickstarter adventure to create a community around the movie before its releasing.

First picked up by our radio, we were able to receive them on our computer and decipher them by increasing the frequency and translating them into words. To our surprise, these were poems from an exoplanet in our galaxy.We were able to translate sixty-five of them. They tell us about the lanscape that surrounds the author of the poems, his environment, his beauty, but they also tell us about the questions that the author asks himself in the face of our own world, his suffering, his wars, but also his natur and the essential that man research, that is, hapiness.A beautiful reflection on these two worlds that such a large space separates. We have not able yet to communicate with the author of the poems, but we feel that we can share with you these words of great wisdom.The author takes a critical look at our world, without judging, with objectivity.Some other poems of the book :The book will be 9 inchs by 6 1/4 inchs ( 23 cm by 16 cm ) It will have eleven pictures of the sky above the exoplanet and on it !All credits for the photographs will be indicate at the end of the book.And we hope that we will be able to receive more of them to share with you, and also communicate with the author to show and explain all the emotions he created with his words ! ","We hope these poems can join all of you. I am familiar with publications, so it will be fine to check all the process and deliver everything at time.

This press is an approximately 1/16 scale replica, functional and pleasing to the eye. It represents the most important invention of the 15th century, the invention of the printing press.Gutenberg was born in 1400 and raised in Mainz. It is here that he invented the printing press with movable type, special ink for printing and also the press that he built to quickly print the thousands of pages for the book he wanted to publish, the Biblia Latina.Back then, it took three years for a copyist to transcribe a Bible, but Gutenberg would print about 180 in three years, a work of over 1,200 pages. His press therefore printed more than 100,000 sheets on both sides.I wanted to show with this model the ingenuity of Gutenberg by trying to be as close as possible to reality. It will surely please you and will make a very beautiful decoration on your desk or shelf.Each press is functional. If you choose the model with the rubber stamp, you just have to insert a piece of paper in the tray, put ink on the rubber stamp, close the panel of the tray and place it under the threaded screw. Like a real press, pull the lever and print the sheet of paper!You can have the Gutenberg press with a wooden piece representing the movable characters used: You can choose the second option which is functional and comes with a personalized rubber stamp, a black ink stamp pad and 50 little sheets of paper ready to use for printing. Each kit comes with a instructions manual:You can also choose the third option which is functional and comes with five personalized rubber stamps, a black ink stamp pad, 50 little sheets of paper ready to use for printing and instructions manual. With this kit, you will have five different stamps to use and you will really enjoy printing with the Gutenberg Press!The wooden piece and the rubber stamp are 1 inch by 1 1/4 inch. The rubber stamp has a gothic font and it really made to use with ink stamp.I use cotton swabs to take ink from the black ink pad and gently apply the ink on the stamp, just enough to see a brilliant coating, and after that, I place a sheet in the tray, close it, put the tray under the threaded screew, I pull the little lever and print on the paper!For some who choose the kit with five stamps, the trick to change the stamp is that you can use a little piece of tape, roll it and place under the stamp. This will allow the stamp to stay in place. After that, you can easily remove the stamp and replace it with an other one!Each press is about 6 inches tall by 8 inches long. Each kit includes three boards with the laser cut pieces. I used water based stain for the boards. The stamp is made of rubber, because it easier to use and a metal stamp is to expensive to manufacture! You will need glue to build the kit.For the project, I have already glued the pieces supporting the wooden screw in order to make the threads. The beam will therefore be ready to be installed during assembly of the model. I personally make each threaded screw to be sure that it works perfectly with the beam.For those of you that order the personnalized stamp options, at the end of this kickstarter project, you will receive a questionnaire that will allow you to send me your personalized text to be printed on the rubber stamps. We accept texts with approximately twenty characters, the stamp being 1 inch x 1.25 inch, it can be your name and address, words of thanks, a friendly thought, etc. Please, no offensive words!  I hope you will enjoy building this Gutenberg Press !Music: Celebration by Alexander Nakarada (www.serpentsoundstudios.com)Licensed under Creative Commons BY Attribution 4.0 Licensehttp://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","For this project, the risks are to find enough boards to be able to make all the models!

It didn’t matter if I was at a Bluegrass festival in Sperryville, Virginia eating garlic habanero pickles or crabbing with grandpa in Edgwater, Maryland snacking on pickled beets that grandma made. I was influenced by family and friends with my passion for good food. So much so that I started in the restaurant business in the DC area as soon as I turned 18.I moved to Las Vegas in my early 20′s and continued my culinary education. After working in all kinds of cuisine from American to French to Asian I learned more then I could have ever imagined.

Athletes swear by pickle juice’s scientifically proven benefits to exercise recovery. In one 2010 study, pickle juice halted post-workout muscle cramps in 85 seconds. That, plus its electrolyte-restoring powers has even yielded Pickle Juice Sport – a dill-flavored sports drink. But really, most athletes stick to good old Vlasic!PMS RemedyFor those same reasons, pickle juice is widely used as a cure for menstrual cramps. It may also prevent you from eating four bags of potato chips in one day. Not that we ever did that. That was a friend.Potato Pick-Me-UpAdd a heavy splash of pickle juice to a pot of simple boiled potatoes for a fantastic side dish. The flavors absorb so perfectly you won’t want to add salt, butter, sour cream, or anything to these taters once you’re done. Making potato salad? Skip the mayo, and toss with veggies and pickle juice for a much healthier (and more flavorful) version.Pickleback ShotOdds are you’ve seen this cocktail on a bar menu sometime in the last couple years (lore has it they were first sold out of a London food truck in 2011). Perhaps you scoffed or called it a fad, but the truth is bartenders claim this to be the perfect complement to whiskey, instantly soothing the taste buds and aftershock of a rough liquor. Order one, and you will order five. For bonus points, follow that up with a Pickletini.Hangover CureIf you can stomach it on a hangover tummy, pickle juice is a known folk remedy that actually works. It replenishes your depleted sodium levels and helps to assist in rehydration. In many countries, people even take a shot of pickle juice before going out to help prevent dehydration in the first place.Vinegar ReplacementPickle juice works in place of vinegar in salad dressing, soups, or virtually any recipe. It is essentially vinegar on steroids.Heartburn CureAlong with its flavor-boosting benefits, pickle juice seems to have the same health effects as straight-up vinegar. Particularly effective as a heartburn soother, pickle juice may also help to avoid blood-sugar spikes if taken with a meal.Bloody Mary BoosterOn the not-as-healthy-but-just-as-important side of the spectrum, pickle juice is absolutely dynamite in a Bloody Mary. When its hangover-killing benefits combine with a little hair of the dog, nothing could make your Sunday morning any greater. Except cronutsCleaning AgentFood industry insiders have been using pickle juice to clear blackened copper pans for years. It also works well as a grill cleaner, making those charred, crusted-on bits much easier to scrape off.Dill Pickle BreadMake this. Make it now.Pickle PopsiclesTrue, you can buy these on PickleAddicts.com (actual, real thing), but you can also just pour some of this glorious nectar into pop molds, paper cups, or ice-cube trays and make your own savory summer snack.Re-PicklerOr maybe you just want some more pickles? Empty your vegetable drawer and throw some onions, carrots, peppers, whatever, into the jar of leftover pickle juice. Let them sit for a few days and BOOM: new pickles!Meat Tenderizer & MarinadePickle juice has amazing meat-tenderizing abilities and, as a marinade, will add a ton of flavor to your meats, without the extra cals in heavy sauces or marinades. It works exceptionally well on chicken – some claim a skinless breast soaked overnight in pickle juice will taste like fried chicken when cooked, and we say that is voodoo but we’re okay with it. Try it on cuts of pork and beef, too.Fish PoacherThere is very little in this world that sounds more healthy-boring than poached fish. But, add your pickle juice to the poaching water and you will never look back.Weed KillerThe high vinegar and salt content of pickle juice has made it a longtime favorite with gardeners. Dumping it on dandelions, thistle, and virtually all common weeds that crop up around your home. Bonus, it’s pet-friendly and you probably already have it in your fridge!Recipe Add-OnWe lost track of all the things you can add pickle juice to, but some favorites include: BBQ sauce, hummus, chicken salad, mac ‘n’ cheese, gazpacho, deviled eggs, vinaigrette, borscht, beet salad, salsa, bean dip, and meatloaf.Hiccup StopperWe’ve found little scientific evidence backing up this claim (and, frankly, we’re glad the scientists are working on other things), but many, many people claim that the number-one cure for hiccups is a small glass of pickle juice. Given how well this stuff works on everything else in the world, we believe it.",The largest challenge this project faces is capitol. We are in need of working capitol so that we may have raw materials on hand to meet the wholesale and consumer demand for our product.

My name is Morgan and I'm the writer for Vagabond.Vagabond is a story about displacement and isolation. At the surface, it is a story that tries to answer a question that everyone is asking, but no one is trying to resolve; What do we do with the homeless problem on our planet? It’s simple, we send them to another planet, of course! While the story’s response to that question might be a bit radical, it highlights some serious racial, gender, and status issues prevalent in our society. In a nutshell, Vagabond is the lovechild of Elon Musk and Lord of the Flies with a dose of culture.I'm raising the money to pay my amazing artist, Salvador Perez the money he more than deserves.

https://www.kickstarter.com/projects/foundershouse/mythic-a-quarterly-science-fiction-and-fantasy-mag?ref=discovery_category_newest,foundershouse/mythic-a-quarterly-science-fiction-and-fantasy-mag,"Hi, everyone. My name is Shaun Kilgore, editor of MYTHIC: A Quarterly Science Fiction & Fantasy Magazine. I’m the Publisher at Founders House Publishing, a small indie book publishing company that produces MYTHIC. Inspired by the old pulp magazines of the early to mid-20th century, I started MYTHIC in the summer of 2016. My goal was simple: To offer a new place to showcase unique voices offering new visions in genres that were often pigeon-holed by a few reoccurring themes, setting, characters, and conventions. MYTHIC provided the venue for exploring stories that broke the status quo as well as honoring the best of science fiction and fantasy as whole.I had a great reception, with many subscribers jumping on board before the first issue appeared in print. The emphasis was and remains on print. MYTHIC is a 7x10 print publication, first and foremost. It offered the most dynamic way to present content I wanted to share. But I could not avoid the realities of readership today. I expanded to include eBook editions of the magazine.To date, there have been five issues of MYTHIC. I bootstrapped the process essentially on my own, editing, designing, and publishing each one. It’s been an exciting time sharing so many entertaining stories with the readers and subscribers. I was able to make it a paying market, but a lower, flat-rate based one. However, my aspirations for MYTHIC were much higher. Any ongoing magazine has expenses involved in printing the issue and paying the authors (and maybe paying the editor a little something?). MYTHIC is no exception. I’d recently heard about other magazines by creators I know who achieved funding for their short story magazine ventures via Kickstarter, so I thought I’d give it a try.I’m seeking the funds necessary to keep publishing this magazine and do so while also paying our authors professional rates for their short fiction. As I mentioned, we started as a flat-rate market, but my primary goal is to pay all authors at least 5 CENTS A WORD. As a quarterly, I like to have plenty of stories so I generally have at least 10 pieces of short fiction per issue though that number has been as high as 13. Book reviews and, in one case, an essay have also been included. As part of this campaign, I want to build off that and add more content and interior illustrations that will make MYTHIC more like the old pulps that originally inspired it.

But, we wanted to account for stretch goals, so here are few.$12,000 – If we reach this amount, we can cover expenses for two issues plus start adding additional content such as regular book review features, interviews, and more.$18,000 – This amount funds three issues of MYTHIC plus allows us to continue the additional content plus some interior illustrations. All backers receive their choice of one back issue of MYTHIC in print or eBook editions.$24,000 – We can fund a whole year of MYTHIC: A Quarterly Science Fiction & Fantasy Magazine. This includes four issues including original fiction and other content and illustrations. All backers receive their choice of two back issues of MYTHIC in either print or eBook editions. New subscribers will receive all current back issues in the format of their choice in addition to the four issues of their subscription.Above $24,000 – If we hit this stretch goal, we will use all additional funding to pay for subsequent issues of MYTHIC and will move towards paying authors6 cents a word for original short fiction. We will be able to continue our nonfiction features and illustrations.","The publishers of MYTHIC know there is always the possibility of delays with printing and shipping from time to time, but we have always delivered our books and magazines to our customers. We will face any challenges and make sure you are provided with a quality magazine every quarter.

Professional scientists watched the color changes that seemed to mark the Martian seasons and speculated learnedly about life elsewhere in the solar system. With that as justification, the writers of science fiction’s golden age flung their imaginations skyward and filled the pages of scores of lively magazines with tales of adventure on nearby worlds and the spaceways that linked them...Vintage Worlds collects seventeen stories totaling over 120,000 words of new, original short fiction inspired by the stories that appeared in pulp magazines like Weird Tales, Astounding, Amazing Stories, Planet Stories, and so many more.Here is the list of authors and stories included in Vintage Worlds: Tales of the Old Solar System:John Michael GreerBorn in the brawling Navy town of Bremerton, Washington, and raised in an assortment of Seattle suburbs, John Michael Greer began writing stories as soon as he could hold a pencil.

He lives close to the sea in Heysham, Lancashire. He writes: “For most of my life I suffered from terrific writer's block, very frustrating.  Then in my late fifties I underwent a dazzling conversion experience, consisting of the revelation that it would be a good idea to show some consideration for the reader, i.e. write stuff that a fellow creature might conceivably wish to read.“Since that mental breakthrough I have never looked back.My published works are the Old Solar System novel Valeddom (2013) and the novella collection Uranian Gleams (2015), the alternate-Earth Kroth trilogy (The Slant, The Drop and The Rise, 2013-15), and the previous-universe novel Man of the World (2016). I am currently working on a Uranian novel.Dylan T. Jeninga -Dylan T. Jeninga is an enthusiast of the fantastic yet (perhaps marginally) credible, and it was this interest that drew him to science fiction when he was a young boy, and more recently to the classic tales of our Solar System as it ought to have been. Born near the Wisconsin/Illinois border on the last day of 1993, he now lives in Chicago with his soon-to-be-wife (who, the reader may be sure, has a hand in shaping everything he creates). He works as an improvisational actor/hopefully temporary shop clerk, and he writes everything from realistic adventures among the planets to sojourns to the distant stars.

He lives in Huntsville, Alabama.Clint Spivey -Clint Spivey spent eight years as a meteorologist in Europe and Asia. He now teaches English as a foreign language to university students. He is fortunate enough to be able to work on a rice farm during the spring and fall. His fiction has appeared in Into the Ruins, The Moon Magazine, SQ Mag and Perihelion.Christopher Henningsen - Christopher Henningsen is an inventor, learner, and spiritual Venusian living on Canada's East coast.  He writes:  “I'm a son of German back-to-the-landers, and my youth was spent between rural Canada and Germany. During the traditional stint as a roughneck in Alberta's oil industry that most East Canadians go through after high school, I developed a strong interest in sustainable energy. I spent another, shorter stint as an English teacher in a Chinese kindergarten before going to University as a mature student, where I studied Sustainable and Renewable Energy Engineering. I graduated in 2014 and have been keeping my skills sharp outside my day job with technical and artistic projects.”David England - David England is a ponderer, generalist, and student-of-everything who, in the words of his daughter, ""does math for a living."" Following a nomadic childhood typical among military families, and supplemented by wanderings of his own, he now resides in the well-rooted community of Two Rivers, Wisconsin (birthplace of the ice cream sundae) with his wife Anne, her incredible artwork, and the half-dozen or so unwritten novels which have taken up residence inside his head over the years. This is the first story of his that has been accepted for publication; another story, “The Last Outpost,” has also been accepted for publication in the deindustrial-SF magazine Into the Ruins.Arthur Vibert - A San Francisco native, Arthur Vibert has lived and traveled all over the world. He was worked in advertising and currently works as a video producer. And of course he’s been an avid science fiction reader all his life, starting with “Space Cat” by Ruthven Todd.Grant Canterbury - Grant Canterbury is a naturalist and writer who grew up reading stories about speculative worlds of science fiction and fantasy.  His stories have been published in the science fiction anthologies Merigan Tales and After Oil 2: The Years of Crisis.  He lives near Portland, Oregon with his family and quirky spaniels.  See canterburia.blogspot.com for irregular blog posts and project updates.Peter C. Aitken -Peter C. Aitken was raised in New York and attended university in Scotland, where he studied English and Philosophy. While an English Degree provided him with plenty of inspiring material, none has been as powerful as The Gods of Mars by Edgar Rice Boroughs. He burned through A Princess of Mars at a sprint but devoured the sequel at a more frightening pace. He has worked in Science Fiction and Fantasy ever since, trying to replicate the same balance of action and philosophical query.Damian Macrae -Damian Macrae spent his formative years on a dairy farm watching Star Trek and reading dusty paperbacks from the likes of King, Vance and Herbert. Fleeing the family farm weeks after completing high school, he has worked various IT jobs across Australia before moving to Hobart, Tasmania to study surveying, where he learned to brew beer, stew rabbit and keep chooks. After two years working underground and a volunteer assignment in Laos he now resides in Christchurch, New Zealand with his partner. In between working and writing he dreams of owning a small farm, perhaps with some chooks. Occasionally, he threatens to build a wooden sailboat.Rachel Cowan -Rachel Cowan grew up on a farm in South Texas.  She began her career in journalism, writing for her hometown newspaper in Eagle Pass, Texas, as well as for her college newspaper at Texas A&M University.

Some of his interests include juggling, martial arts, woodworking , painting, and writing science fiction stories.Violet Bertelsen -Violet Bertelsen is an herbalist, farmhand and amateur historian currently living in the northeastern United States. While she was a child, the woods befriended and educated Violet, who proved to be an eager student. She spent her young adulthood in a haze, wandering the vast expanses of North America trying to find the lost fragments of her soul in deserts, hot springs and rail-yards.  Now older and more sedate, she likes to spend her time talking with trees, reading history books, laughing uproariously with fellow farmhands, drinking black birch tea and, on occasion, writing science fiction stories.Augustus Keden -Augustus Keden writes of himself:  “I am currently writing a series of inter-related stories based on the oral narratives of the lives of real people of various ages spanning the years 1880 to the present. The narrations are his-story, her-story, not history. The narrators are Irish, English, Scottish, Canadian, French Canadian, German, American, Polish, Mexican, Peruvian, Guyanese, Punjabi, Trinidadian, Jamaican, Barbadian, Nicaraguan, Costa Rican, Ghanian and Nigerian. I am currently living with my wife, a black American woman, in a small apartment on the side of a cliff overlooking the Atlantic, just off the coast of Africa.”Al Sevcik -Al Sevcik is a professional photographer and author living in Tampa, Florida.  His recent work can be found in two anthologies, After Oil #3 and Merigan Tales, and in several issues of Into the Ruins magazine.Joel B. Jones - Joel B.

His interest in sci-fi goes back to the Traveller role-playing games run by his older brother in the late 1970s. He currently works as the co-director of Charlottesville's Big Blue Door, a theater and comedy troupe.Initial funding will cover the costs of producing ebook in standard formats (MOBI and EPUB), producing and delivering trade paperback versions of the anthology, cover art, payment of the editors, payments for the authors, and some advertising and promotional expenses. Funding above the minimum would primarily be used to increase the pay rates of the authors and provide funding for additional volumes in a Vintage Worlds anthology series, which is already garnering enthusiastic support.All backers will be listed in the acknowledgements page in the book.John Michael Greer has edited five anthologies of short fiction including the four volumes of the After Oil series. A collection of what he calls deindustrial SF—that is, science fiction set in the kind of future we’re most likely to get at this point, in which the dream of perpetual progress slams face first into the hard limits of resource depletion and a damaged biosphere, and sends humanity tumbling back along the familiar arc of the decline and fall of civilizations. The other is Merigan Tales: Stories from the Worlds of Star's Reach, a shared world anthology that collects other stories that take place in the fictive future of Greer's deindustrial SF novel Star's Reach.If you like great science fiction and fantasy, you have the chance to pick up individual issues or a subscription to MYTHIC: A Quarterly Science Fiction and Fantasy Magazine.Visit www.mythicmag.com for more details.If we are fully funded before the end of the campaign period, we will announce stretch goals and additional rewards. As stated above, one of the primary aims is to better compensate the authors involved in this venture and provide a high quality anthology.","As with any production of a book, it is possible that there may be unexpected delays in the production process which may cause a change in in the delivery timeline of this book. However we are committed to making every effort to have the books ready for release and delivered by October 2018."

Music is a language for me, it helps me convey things that can’t be conveyed with words. I am recording a 12 track concept album based on the universal 12 steps of addiction recovery. 1 song for each of the 12 steps! THIS HAS NEVER BEEN DONE BEFORE.The album is an exhibition of hope, survival, and overcoming darkness—themes of which I have had a personal connection to since a very young age. My own mother battled drug addiction for most of my childhood and took her own life when I was 11 years old. This crucial moment of tragedy is what inspires me to write today. (Below is my first Single Honesty that was released last month, I did this on my own with my own resources.)Addiction to things like alcohol, drugs (prescription and illegal), pornography, eating disorders, etc.. and anything else we as individuals feel powerless to overcome on our own, is everywhere now. If you haven't personally experienced it, I bet that you have friends who have. Addiction Recovery is the belief that, ""You can regain power over the parts of your life that seem powerless"".My message is simple:The music and message is going to be AWESOME. It's going to be a full length, mostly-instrumental album that will take you through the journey of recovery. Blending Classical Piano and Strings with a modern EDM (Electronic Dance Music) feel, it's a new, refreshing, exciting genre that conveys a lot of emotion. Since it is instrumental, it teaches in a way that words can't. You can mold the music to the memories and experiences of your own life. This is your story. Your recovery.Whether you are an addict yourself, or you know someone who is; I believe you will find value and healing through listening to this music that I have invested so much time and emotion towards. It has been an extremely personal experience for me, creating this.I believe that this is an important message for everyone, and I want this album and message to reach all across the world.I imagine myself standing in an assembly of kids/teenagers, sharing my experiences and playing my music for them. My aim is to help them understand that life is easier lived without the heavy chains of addictions formed early on. I am taking a very modern approach to this message, and striving to present it in a way where everyone can connect to it. I don’t want the music to just sound good, I want it to sound powerful, inspirational, and great! I want to create music that people will enjoy whether or not they are familiar with the deep meaning behind it. I hope that this album will help de-stigmatize addiction and bring hope to those in the recovery process. For this reason, I am seeking to raise $20,000 to fund this album (Production, distribution, etc...) through this Kickstarter campaign. The ultimate goal of this passion project is to help people.Follow the movement:www.facebook.com/brendondavidnielsonwww.instagram.com/brendondavidnielsonwww.brendondavidnielson.com",I feel confident I can produce a professional album within the budget we've put together.

https://www.kickstarter.com/projects/1hitwonder/one-hit-wonder-the-hollywood-killer-graphic-novel?ref=discovery_category_newest,1hitwonder/one-hit-wonder-the-hollywood-killer-graphic-novel,"What the hell is this?But before that: Do you love old pulp comics and Free Shipping? Are you a fan of Elmore Leonard or Harlan Ellison or Quentin Tarantino and Free Shipping?Do you like your heroes a little bit broken and a lot bit flawed especially with Free Shipping?Then you’re going to love One Hit Wonder.One Hit Wonder is 160-page hardcover graphic novel about a child actor grows up angry and becomes a hitman for the mafia. And, YES, you guessed it, WE OFFER FREE SHIPPING IN THE USA, EVEN INTERNATIONALLY FOR CERTAIN REWARDS. YES, REALLY***I’ve been working on this book since 2012, gestating it until it was perfect, and now I’m ready to show it to the world.The book is 100% done and ready for the printer. I just need print funds in order to make this book a reality.The book is beautiful. I have been working in comics for over 20 years, including for companies like Marvel, Image Comics, Dynamite and Humanoids.I even created Spider-Man Noir, that weird black and white character Nicolas Cage played in Spider-Man: Into the Spiderverse.This was my first creator owned project and I’m so excited to share it with you. If you love fast paced thrillers, heroes without a conscience, funny mystery books, or just flat out mind-blowing art, then you’re going to love this book.Plus, EVERYBODY, including international backers, get FREE SHIPPING (I think everyone got it by now).Sounds great, but what’s the book about?Richie Reese was a (terrible) child actor. He was the worst. Seriously, he couldn’t act his way out of a paper bag. However, he soon found that acting wasn’t helpful in getting out of a paper bag anyway.No, but a gun was very helpful in all sorts of predicaments. His heart filled with anger, he found solace in violence and everything Mafia related.Until he joins the mob for real.That’s where we meet Richie. He's at the top of his game. He’s internalized every bit of crazy that Hollywood has thrown at him over his decades living in Tinseltown, but he’s become very efficient hitman in the process.Then, one of the only people tethering him to the last shreds of his humanity is murders, which sends Richie into a murderous rage, and he sets out on a vengeance spree that will change him foreverThe creatorsI remember this like yesterday. I met Ariel in 2008 at a comic book festival in Strasbourg (France). To my knowledge, he was the only creator listening to Tango music while drawing at cons. We got along really well. In 2012, we were discussing on Facebook and I said I'd love to send him a few pitches whenever he'd be free to work on something outside of Marvel or DC. I sent him a project called ""Gangsta Grill"" that he immediately loved. But then, as I was on my way to attend San Diego Comic Con that year, I had the idea for ONE-HIT WONDER. The first issue came to me in a few days. And I came back to Ariel with that new project which he liked even more. Then on we were. A French publisher, the now defunct Indeez Comics, helped funding the first issues (thank you JMB) then, I was on my own.Blood, sweat, tears, bankruptcies and relocations later… ONE-HIT WONDER is ready to make a come back. And what better place than Kickstarter to make that happen?Now for those who don't know who's everybody, here's a recap…- Fabrice Sapolsky:Co-creator/writer of Marvel's SPIDER-MAN NOIR, ONE-HIT WONDER and INTERTWINED (Dynamite Comics). Artist. Letterer. Senior Editor (at Humanoids Publishing currently).- Ariel Olivetti:One of Marvel's superstars! Whether it's on Thanos, Hulk or the Punisher, Ariel Olivetti is a badass artist who likes to draw badass characters. He was the original artist and designer on ONE-HIT WONDER.- Stephen Thompson:replaced Ariel on the series. Currently on STAR TREK comics covers for IDW.- Ivan Fiorelli:Italian artist Ivan Fiorelli hasn't been super present on the US market, but italian comic book readers know him very well for his many years drawing fumetti at Bonelli Publicazione.Why did Fabrice create ONE-HIT WONDER?Guest Stars and soundtrackEarly on, especially witha Hollywood theme, I knew I wanted to drop easter eggs and musical references.One of my friends, Beat Boxer supreme Terrell Woods AKA Carnage XXL was the reference for Richie's best friend/sidekick in the book. Terrell also provided beats for the series but never could complete the lyrics. Hopefully, thanks to this campaign, we'll be able to!I also had the opportunity to convince genius producer Ryan Leslie to let me make him a character in issue #5. What an honor!There's another character that was based on a celebrity but you'll have to read the bonus section of the book to know who it is (I know, I'm teasing). :)Where your money goes?There are a lot of Kickstarters out there. And we, as creators HAVE to be transparent. Here is how the money will be used:Kickstarter - 10% - $800. It's our platform of choice's fee.Production - 13% - $1000. With this, we're paying our time/costs to create the best possible edition.Printing - 50% - $4000 - Half of our budget for printing! Yes. But wait until you see the book. Hardcovers don't come cheap. ;) It'll be matte and beautiful.Shipping - 25% - $2000 - The books being printed in China, we have to ship it to our fulfillment platform where it'll be sent to you.Artists - 13% - $1000 - With your help, we can give back a bit more to the wonderful creators who worked on the book.Total - $8000. If we manage to make it to $10k or more, there'll be cool stretch goals in the house!Stretch goalsSo what happens if we crush it??? Well, we get more ONE-HIT WONDER made!- Over $10,000: We commission a new original cover from Ariel Olivetti.- Over $15,000: We get a new cover and Fabrice writes a new ONE-HIT WONDER story (artist will be revealed during the campaign) released as a DIGITAL ORIGINAL comic book.- Over $20,000: New cover for the original book+new story printed as a comic book. and sent for FREE to all backers anywhere! PLUS: The exclusive OHW Soundtrack by hip-hop/beatbox artist Carnage XXL!Sneak Peek","Fair Square Comics LLC was created in June 2019 to develop, publish and distribute new comics created by Fabrice Sapolsky and his amazing friends. ONE-HIT WONDER is the first of many Fair Square Comics' projects. Fabrice successfully funded his previous creator owned project INTERTWINED on Kickstarter three years ago. But it was a tough experience. He learned  a ton from this and is now more than ready for this new challenge. The main lesson is: there's what one can do, and what one can't. Dealing with logistics is a job. It's not a creator's job. For ONE-HIT WONDER, Fair Square Comics is partnering with a fulfillment company (Caurette Editions) whose job is to package and ship graphic novels all the time. The books will arrive on time and well protected. Also, contrary to many new projects, ONE-HIT WONDER is already fully produced. No wait (beyond printing and shipping) is needed. The graphic novel will be in your hands sooner than later! So give in… to ONE-HIT WONDER!",https://www.kickstarter.com/projects/1hitwonder/one-hit-wonder-take-two?ref=discovery_category_newest,1hitwonder/one-hit-wonder-take-two,"WE'RE FUNDED, BUT THE STORY CONTINUES…We passed the $4000 mark but it ain't over til it's over! We have stretch goals! Here they are:And look below for the full story :) Thanks to everyone backing our project.Alright folks, let's do this one last time…I'm Fabrice Sapolsky. Co-creator/writer of SPIDER-MAN NOIR (yes, that character you loved in INTO THE SPIDER-VERSE but in a much darker mode in my comics).I also had a successful Kickstarter campaign in 2016 for another one of my graphic novels called INTERTWINED (with the great Fred Pham Chuong).You may already know about ONE-HIT WONDER. And if you don't, click here: https://www.kickstarter.com/projects/1hitwonder/one-hit-wonder-the-hollywood-killer-graphic-novel?ref=pbuild_dashboard#project-previewLong story short: I ran a campaign back in October 2019. I didn't reach my goal. But then… Something happened. After the Kickstarter campaign ended, I had TONS of people reaching out, saying they had no idea I was running a kickstarter. Telling me they would've contributed had they known.But here's the thing: I DID publicize it. Ran posts about it for 30 days. Every day. Paid over $300 on Facebook, Twitter and Instagram ads. But no, I didn't make it. Was I too ambitious? Maybe. In the end, I had more people reaching out to say they were sorry than backers in the initial campaign.I know how it is. There's a lot of content out there. A lot of white noise. Especially coming from branded projects.But worry not, in comics, no one ever dies, thus… I'M BACK! And this time, it's even better!If you pledged in the last campaign and were disappointed it didn't happen: here's a second chance. If you did NOT pledge during the last Kickstarter, please consider it a new chance to discover a cool graphic novel by me and Ariel Olivetti (with additional art by Stephen Thompson and Ivan Fiorelli).What's this ONE-HIT WONDER: TAKE TWO all about?Well, it's still the same ONE-HIT WONDER story you’re going to love (or grow to love if you consider it an acquired taste): the story of a child actor who grows up angry and becomes a hitman for the Mafia in Hollywood.I switched from hardcover to softcover editions to bring the goal down a bit and allow the book to be made. So what you get here mainly is the book itself. A 144 pages matte cover perfect bound baby. The full story plus a few pinups and bonuses. If we unlock stretch goals, we might have some surprises in store.Oh, and one more thing… original artist Ariel Olivetti drew a BRAND NEW COVER for this new edition. How cool is that?A very diverse crime comedy story with cool guests!I neverstress this out too often, but I'm kind of a unicorn in American comics.I was only the second French writer to ever work on a Marvel Comic (after JM Lofficier in the 80s) and to my knowledge, the only one currently living in the United States (there are a handful of artists though). So, yes, I'm an immigrant. That brings a lot of perspective to my work and my life. And I'm always leaving a large space for other immigrants and minorities to be featured in my works. The Intertwined graphic novel mainly dealt with those themes. But you could see some of it in One-Hit Wonder.On top of that, I'm a creature of passion. And I love bringing my other favorite things in my comics. In ONE-HIT WONDER, there are a lot of Hip-Hop/R&B/Funk references. And even a couple of cool guests stars! First one is my man Terrell 'CARNAGE THE EXECUTIONER' Woods. Terrell is a genius beat boxer and Hip Hop performer from Minneapolis. He plays himself in the graphic novel. Well… A very special version of himself. More on him here: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Carnage_the_ExecutionerNext up is super producer and mastermind Ryan Leslie. His music credentials are impressive. His intelligence is too. He inspired me so much that I asked him if I could have him as a comic book character, which he agreed to. He became the Black Mozart in One-Hit Wonder (inspired by one of his albums of the same name). https://mzrt.com/The RewardsAs Confucius said: ""a picture's worth a thousand words"". How about a clip too? :) Below are the great pieces loaded with some rewards. In the little clip, you can see (from top to bottom) an example of an 11x17"" original art piece I drew (this one populated with many Spider characters, but it can be anything). Top right is the OFFICIAL MARVEL ART PRINT I drew (colors by Tan Shu). The second row shows four different MARVEL and DC Sketch variants I drew original art on. They're generally sold between $100 and $150 each. So getting them in some of the rewards is a real good deal, just sayin… ;)Last but not least, you can also make it a combo by buying both creator owned books I made with those incredible artists with some rewards and even (for the fanciest reward) an original picture disc!So what are you waiting for? You know you want it: PLEDGE NOW! DON'T WAIT!Any question? TEXT ME DIRECTLY: +1 (323) 405-9401 and add yourself to my virtual phone book: fabricesapolsky.superphone.io This is a REAL number and I want everyone to be able to contact me to talk comics and more. Thanks!","I guess the biggest risk is failing… again. But it's also a highly motivating challenge. I never failed a Kickstarter before the initial One-Hit Wonder campaign. So this was a humbling and a learning experience. Its success will open the door for me to create and deliver more original projects. In the current ""brand culture"" climate, having creators succeed despite a smaller fire power than the big corporations is mandatory. Comics need to remain fiercely creative. They need to challenge the readers with amazing innovative stories and groundbreaking art. Let's do this together. One-Hit Wonder is the first in a series of four projects Fair Square Comics will release in the next two years. Please join me on my journey to tell those stories!"

This planet is an amazing creation and there is so much to be seen and even yet to be discovered. Unfortunately, there are some people who do not have the time, passion, or money to be able to explore this wondrous earth. Our goal as photographers is to bring the world into peoples houses through our product. We are looking to create a high-end coffee table photo-book of Iceland, more specifically of the Aura Borealis over the waterfalls, glaciers, landscape and volcanoes of Iceland.Photography is a passion of ours. We have been photographers for 10+ years, photographing landscapes, our travels, weddings and whatever else may happen to make its way in front of our lens. A greater passion of ours, though, is sharing the experience we had taking the pictures we took with our family and friends. We enjoy seeing the wonder in people's eyes when they see the pictures of places far away and sharing the stories of where and how we took that picture. We want to begin sharing our experiences and travels with people outside of our small circle of friends and family.Photography is a medium that stops time. It captures landscapes that are ever changing, it keeps people forever young. When we go to Iceland, the pictures we capture are going to be one of a kind, nobody on earth will be able to duplicate our photographs because Iceland is forever changing. Help us reach our goal of bring the beautiful Icelandic landscapes into peoples living rooms. This trip is Iceland, who knows where we will be next.","The biggest risk we have in this venture, is taking the photographs. We run the risk of traveling all the way out to Iceland and not seeing the Aura Borealis, however, we have been planning for this trip and the time we are there is among the most active time for the Northern Lights over Iceland. That is one of the exciting parts of being a photographer, especially when you are photographing mother nature, you never know what you are going to get. In my experience however, she has never let us down.",https://www.kickstarter.com/projects/559916143/iceland-northern-lights-photobook?ref=discovery_category_newest,559916143/iceland-northern-lights-photobook,"I am looking to create a high-end coffee table photo-book of Iceland, more specifically of the Aura Borealis over the waterfalls, glaciers, landscape and volcanoes of Iceland. Back in 2014 I ventured off to Iceland for 5 weeks of backpacking and photographing landscapes and the northern lights. I had a desire to publish a book using the photos I collected while I was there. The trip was challenging from a photographers perspective and I failed atthe attempt to get enough quality imagery to produce a quality product.I planned to go back last year for another 5 weeks to complete this dreamof showcasing the landscapes with the northern lights above them. My planswere interrupted when I was diagnosed with leukemia. I spent the last yeargetting treatment and living a life that was difficult for me to adjust to.The treatment plan that I was on requires 3 years of chemo to prevent a relapse. A couple of months ago, my insurance lapsed and I had to be removed from thetreatment plan until I could afford it. I have recovered to a point whereit is hard for me to commit to going back to getting chemo infused into myblood and needles stuck in my spine. I have my insurance restored, but I have decided to forego conventional treatment. I am in remission, but the chances of a relapse are still high. That adds abit of urgency to this trip. It is important to me to accomplish the publishing of this book. If I were to relapse before or after the trip, it could be fatal. I need help to publishing this dream. With your help we can create something beautiful to share.I am really excited to get back to Iceland and make images to shareand hopefully ones that inspire people to go, see, and experience life moredeeply.I am trying to raise a daunting amount of money for this project. A largemajority of the money raised will go towards the publication cost andshipping. I have estimated my project goal to actually be below my minimumrequirements to run the trip, but I am contributing a great deal myself.Transportation costs run about $4500 for the 5 weeks. Food and rare hostelstays are about $800. Equipment, fees and other general expenses I have counted to be about $300. One of the biggest difficulties I encountered last time was getting to thelocations I needed to be, when I needed to be there. This time I decided it is imperative to get a rental vehicle for the whole time. I will justlive, eat, and sleep in the vehicle during my time there thus eliminating housing and hotel costs. I depart on September 21st and will be spending 5 weeks traveling Iceland, photographing the landscapes under the northern lights. I will return November 1st to begin edits and publication.Its a large world and I'd like to show off the beauty of this small portionof it and the phenomenon that is the Aurora Borealis. The book that I am putting together will be a 50 page hardcover book. The pages will lay flat so I can share large high quality landscape photos. Each page will be coated to be water resistant and perfect for a coffee table. The photos will be accompanied with camera settings and info for budding photographers to see how I shot each image. I will also include a small blurb about the location and other info I deem relevant and important.These will be a perfect book for browsing through at home or in a waiting room. I will also be including a page for sponsor recognition. I would like everyone to know that I had incredible people supporting me on this project.Thank you everyone who has helped already in other ways, and thank you inadvance to everyone generous enough to support me in this campaign.For others that do not wish to receive an item from the list of rewards, donations are accepted here: www.vicariouslyowen.com/iceland ","Last year I began a new adventure when I came down with Leukemia. I am currently in remission, but not out of the relapse risk time frame. The fact the the Leukemia can come back at any time is the biggest risk factor for me, I need to go and get this done. I took this trip to Iceland back in 2014 trying to work on the book. I wasn't able to afford a rental car during the trip, so getting to and from the locations was a great challenge. If I don't achieve the project goal, I will once again be headed back without a rental car. Though this is not ideal, I can hitchhike around and camp out like I did last time, but I'm not sure how wise that would be with my health, and my ability to capture the images in my head would be far more difficult. I plan on being in the country for 5 weeks because I can't predict the weather and I need the sky to be mostly clear to properly capture the northern lights. That means I might spend a couple of nights just getting one photo."

We need your help to create and publish a hard-cover, 20x25cm Photography Book that will visually communicate the progressive, innovative and inspiring reality of Rwanda today.We’re proud to have officially partnered with the African Entrepreneur Collective (AEC); a Rwandan based social enterprise and business accelerator. The AEC have pioneered a new approach to economic development in Rwanda, by supporting and mentoring a diverse range of entrepreneurs across the country.Over the course of 4 weeks, we’ll be running from town to town, spending time with and photographing local Rwandan entrepreneurs, allowing them to guide us through a country that embodies the potential of one of the world’s most exciting continents.   The Story Of Run Rwanda - Introducing John and the teamI am a passionate long-distance runner, with a love of breaking away from pounding the paved city streets, to experience new and beautiful cultures. Having spent the last 10 years working as a Brand Consultant in London, I’m taking a career break to pursue a project that I’ve been planning for many years.Her energetic yet elegant visual style portrays a magical and intriguing interpretation of our world's diverse cultures.  From remote desert towns in Southern Africa to the chaotic streets of India, Cate has lived alongside many an eccentric lifestyle, documenting the intricacies of both people and place.Cate initiated Captured Once to celebrate the unique and natural moments captured in every image. Her work is motivated by the relationship and trust gained between herself and the subject. While living in Vietnam, she worked with deaf and mute children, using the camera as a tool for communication and self development. Her passion for the true power of the lens is now demonstrated in the participatory Photovoice projects she runs at Captured Once, promoting well being and positive social change.Communicating powerful personal stories and bringing to life stunning landscapes, Cate's work will intimately portray Rwanda as an exciting emerging county and a key travel destination in Africa. The resulting Photography Book will showcase her favourite images and visualise the exciting face of modern day Rwanda.Below are a selection of Cate's imagesRun Rwanda - The schedule and routeOn the 29th July, the team will be flying from London to Kigali, the capital of Rwanda and after 2 days acclimatisation and preparation they’ll travel up to the very northern border with Uganda.To make Run Rwanda a reality, we need your help raising the £6,500 required to create the Photography Book. The majority of funding raised will be invested in bringing the book to life, covering editing, design, printing and publishing costs.While the Run Rwanda team will be covering their own travel costs, a portion of investment will help fund the Support Team in Rwanda, including vehicle hire, accommodation and Visas.A detailed breakdown of how funds will be invested in the Run Rwanda project is outlined below.","We’ve been planning Run Rwanda for 6 months and have tried to mitigate against as many risks as possible. We’ll be carrying additional camera equipment and memory cards with us, backing up onto hard-drives whenever possible.A support team will be accompanying John at all times during the run, and while injury is a concern, the Run Rwanda route has been planned to incorporate reasonable mileage each day, with a contingency for rest and recovery days when needed. In the worst-case scenario that an injury prevents John from running, the Run Rwanda project would continue by bike.Travel always incurs an element of risk and unpredictability, however we’re optimistic that the project has been well planned and coordinated, with a strong level of in country back up available through the AEC.Finally, there is the risk of delays. We will do our best to finish the book on time and we’ll be using established, high quality and reliable printers and publishers. However, it is possible that unforeseen circumstances may push the publishing date back. If this occurs, we will inform you as quickly as possible.",https://www.kickstarter.com/projects/1848248899/beyond-a-thousand-hills-a-photobook?ref=discovery_category_newest,1848248899/beyond-a-thousand-hills-a-photobook,"Beyond A Thousand HillsBeyond A Thousand Hills will take you on a powerful visual journey through contemporary Rwanda. From inspiring entrepreneurs to captivating landscapes, explore the untold stories creating one of Africa’s most exciting destinations.Using the power of photography over a 12 month period, award winning photographer Cate Gunn and innovation expert and adventurer John Gunn, intimately documented the local people, businesses and projects that are shaping the future of Rwanda.Through an official partnership with the African Entrepreneur Collective and by working closely with local development initiatives, they discovered a unique entrepreneurial culture that’s become the beating heart of a rapidly progressing but often misunderstood nation.Beyond A Thousand Hills will visually document that culture and its manifestation across all aspects of Rwandan life.By funding this book, you'll be helping to create and publish the first photographic celebration of modern day Rwanda.A Unique Photography BookBeyond A Thousand Hills: Edition of 1000Photographs:250 photos will cover 20 fully narrated chapters, each exploring a unique aspect of contemporary Rwanda.Size:36cm x 36cm, hard-back with approximately 150 pagesThe AuthorsCate GunnCate is a published and award winning travel and arts photographer.  With a background in Sociology & Collaborative Arts, and a passion for community and culture. She has spent time living in the UK, Africa and Asia.Her work is largely humanitarian, and the majority of her photography focuses on capturing the essence of people and the unique places in which they live.  Cate also facilitates participatory photography projects, working therapeutically with the camera to promote well being and positive social change.Capturing the true nature of Rwanda’s inhabitants and culture, Cate continues to explore a visual documentation of the changing face of Rwanda.John GunnJohn is a British Adventurer, Endurance Athlete and Innovation Expert. Hehas a passion forentrepreneurshipand in the summer of 2016, he partnered with Cate and the African Entrepreneur Collective to found Run Rwanda, a pioneering 450km run across Rwanda with an ambitious objective to shine a light on a unique culture of entrepreneurship in the country.Voted by the City of London as one of the 50 most inspirational people in London, John is a Fellow at the Royal Geographical Society and a regular commentator in the adventure press.As co-author of Beyond A Thousand Hills, he is tasked with sharing the infections spirit of Africa's first entrepreneurial state.Example Chapter SummariesIntroducing Africa's FirstEntrepreneurialStateRwanda: a country nearly always judged by its tragic past and a destination not traditionally on tourists’ bucket lists.Dig a little deeper, however, and you will find an exciting, evolving nation that is taking a unique approach to growth and development.  Redefining what it means to be an entrepreneur, Rwanda is living up to its name as Africa’s First Entrepreneurial State. It is a fitting title for a country where a business can be started in 48 hours and children are taught entrepreneurship as part of the national curriculum.By 2020 the Rwandan Government aims to transform the country from a low-income, agricultural based economy to a middle-income, knowledge-based, service-oriented economy. A strong commitment to entrepreneurship as a driver for 21st century growth guides this aim.In 2016, award-winning photographer Cate Gunn and innovation specialist John Gunn partnered with the African Entrepreneur Collective in Rwanda to visually explore the untold stories fuelling one of Africa’s fastest growing economies. Entrepreneurship From The Bottom UpEntrepreneurs start young in Rwanda; the county's youth have been given the responsibility to dive economic growth and development as well as tobuild a culture ofentrepreneurship from the bottom up.In 2007, a series ofentrepreneurship education programmes were developed for secondary schools that aimed to encourage a moreentrepreneurial culture,transforming individuals and social norms.By 2012, all secondary schools in the country were teachingentrepreneurship. Children as young as 11 were encouraged to developentrepreneurial attitudes and taught how toidentifyand manage business opportunities as well as how to start and manage a business.Over a million children had taken the course withinits first two years.Rwanda's Digital CityKigali, Rwanda’s charismatic and orderly capital city is leading the country’s digital revolution.Located in Rwanda’s centre and home to over a million people, Kigali is becoming known as an incubator for innovation. Across the city’s sprawling hills, budding entrepreneurs can choose from a selection of Innovation Hubs to network, cross-pollinate ideas and build their businesses.From SafeMotos, an Uber-esque moto-taxi company created to improve motorcycle taxi safety (80% of all road accidents in Kigali involve ‘motos'), to Jumia Food, Rwanda’s fast growing food service app and equivalent to Deliveroo, the clean and developed capital is home to more than a handful of Africa’s most exciting digital entrepreneurs.Pioneering ConservationThe country'sentrepreneurial culture has helped to drive innovation across every district.Rwanda is now, for instance, leading the way in pioneering wildlife conservation. Home to three national parks, the biggest conservation success story lies deep in the forests of the Virunga Volcanoes. Discovered in 1902, Rwanda’s mountain gorillas – the world’s largest primate – have since suffered constant persecution.Critically endangered, an innovative conservation initiative has helped rebuild the remaining population. Centred on inclusive and sustainable eco-tourism, a limited number of highly priced tracking permits have been made available, providing the funds to protect the gorillas day and night with armed security.While offering a once-in-a-lifetime encounter for guests, 5% of all permit revenues are invested back into the local community, providing infrastructure and employment across the northwest region of Rwanda. Celebrated as one of the world’s best conservation case studies, the mountain gorillas are now the only primate species in the world that are increasing in numbers.Innovation In SportInnovation in Rwanda stretches beyond the private sector.The Rwanda Cricket Stadium Foundation is currently constructing the country’s first international standard cricket facility on a 4.5-hectare plot on the outskirts of Kigali. By providing a green and pleasant environment where Rwandans of all ages can learn and improve their cricket, their mission is to provide people with skills they can use in their wider lives and, ultimately – on a broader scale – help promote reconciliation.For the Discerning TravellerOver the last decade, Rwanda has emerged as a leading tourist destination in Africa.This unique gem nestled in the heart of East Africa offers an evocative and enlightening lens on humanity, progression and conservation of natural beauty. From a turbulent past Rwanda has risen with unrivalled stamina and welcomes exploration, foreign investment and tourism with open arms.Rwanda offers the discerning traveller a diverse range of experiences unparalleled on the continent. While wildlife enthusiasts can enjoy open-top jeep safaris across Akagera National Park, in search of lions, Hikers can explore the riches of Nyungwe Forest and Volcanoes National Parks. That’s not to mention the volcano crater lakes, age old mountain gorillas and a thriving capital city, Kigali.RewardsBeyond A Thousand Hills Postcards: Cate's favourite images from the book will be translated into unique Beyond A Thousand Hills Postcards.Beyond A Thousand Hills Prints: Choose from a large selection of limited edition 30cm x 20cm high quality prints from Beyond A Thousand Hills, ready to be mounted and framed.Beyond A Thousand Hills: Enjoy the book itself, and be one of the first to receive Beyond A Thousand Hills, a unique hard-back coffee table photography bookBeyond A Thousand Hills Framed Print: Receive a limited edition fully mounted and framed, signed and numbered print, delivered ready to take pride of place on your wall.Beyond A Thousand Hills Photography Lesson: Enjoy a 4 hour photography lesson with award winning photographer Cate Gunn.

Once we hit target, we have the opportunity to increase the impact of the project through stretch goals!If we raise in excess of £6,500 we'll be in a position to fund an official book launch, combined with a Beyond A Thousand Hills photography exhibition in Kigali, Rwanda.A launch and exhibition will help to generate increased awareness as we continue to scale the project by working with East African tourist boards and local retailers.PartnersThe unique access to some of Rwanda's most exciting and inspiring stories wouldn't have been possible without the Beyond A Thousand Hills partners, based in Rwanda.The African Entrepreneur Collective (AEC) was founded in Rwanda in 2012, as a collection of Business Accelerators that support local entrepreneurs to drive job growth across the country.AEC Accelerators partner with young entrepreneurs to build their skills, expand their networks, and grow their businesses so that they may employ others. Since launch, the model has already helped to create over 1200 jobs.Akagera Aviation is one of Rwanda's leading aviation companies, with a unique fleet of helicopters offering services ranging from medical evacuation, wildlife surveying and national pilot training. Akagera Aviation have partnered with Beyond A Thousand Hills by offering unique aerial photography opportunities.Go Kigali was founded by Eliza Richman and Xavier Curtis in 2016 following the success of Go Addis (previously Addis Eats), Ethiopia’s #1 ranked tour company established in 2013. Go Kigali is the first tour company devoted to unique city tours in Kigali, Rwanda's charismatic capital city.Local ImpactDespite the book still being in the production stage, the Beyond A Thousand Hills project has already captured hearts and minds out in Rwanda. Press coverage endorsing the book has been significant and the project even made the national news late last year.Where The Funds Will GoTo date, the entire project has been 100% self-funded and all the content and photographs are in place.A specialist London based design team is already on-board and working through initial mock-ups of the book.We're turning to Kickstarter to raise the final amount necessary to print and publish the book.

The Festival is gifting the community and visitorswith this unique and interactive fire art experience through the generosity of sponsors, donors, community arts organizations, and YOU. By offering it free to all, The Festival's goal is to make this art accessible to as many people as possible, enrichtheir lives through the experience, and inspire growth in this unique form of artistry.Each evening, after 8pm, ticketed musical entertainment will keep the party going. MarchFourth Marching Band, Eufórquestra and Samurai Gypsies are all going to be in Telluride for this first-ever Fire Festival!Funding so farThe Telluride Fire Festival has raised $75,000 so far through grants, sponsorships and private donations: the budgetis $189,000. The Festival is working on obtaining additional sponsorships and has three grants pending, including one with the Colorado Regional Burning Man organization. In addition, the Festival has two fundraisersscheduled—one on November 14 at Crash 45 in Denver, CO, and one at Cosmopolitan Restaurant in Telluride, CO, in December. Ticketed entertainment taking place each evening (following the freeoutdoor fire artistry) will also help fund the free outdoor events and workshops.Why the Telluride Fire Festival needs your supportYour donations support the local regional and national artists who bring these fantastic fiery art installations to life! Your support will help fund a flaming art car (beingcreated specifically for this Festival), larger-than-life fire installations, outrageous fire performances, and free workshops. Additionally, the Festival has other expenses, such as equipment rental, staff to assist with the four-night/three-day event, permits, security, and travel for artists. Every dollar YOU give will go toward making this fire art festival amazing for YOU. Reducing our carbon footprint wherever possibleThe Festival is committed to minimizing the environmental impact. Wherever possible, the Festival is trying to save money and be environmentally sensitive at the sametime. For example, all of the wood that will be burned in the artistic firecauldrons and art installations has been salvaged from local construction dumpsters (reducing theamount of waste going to landfill).  All materials used in the creation of the Festival art car are recycled or found objects. The Festival also has rescued all of the decor for the special (super secret) fundraising gala. Even the informational sandwich boards are being made out of scrap plywood and painted with rescued paint. The Festival also intends to purchase shares in a local solar ""farm"" and gift them to a local nonprofit to provide them with renewably-generated electricity, save them money, and make them more financially sustainable.We've already got the support of some fantastic local and national businessesAnonymous Fire Goddess Brown Dog PizzaCamels GardenCarolyn & Kit JacksonClark’s Market Mountain High Fire & SafetyCosmopolitan RestaurantFloradora SaloonHotel ColumbiaHamel Family WinesTelluride Mountain Village Home Owners AssociationIce House LodgeHotel Madeline TellurideLa Cocina de LuzLa MarmotteLumiere TellurideMary Janes MedicinalsMountain High Fire & safetyMountainLodge TellurideOak—Beer,Bourbon & BBQPenelope PlaceGleasonRiver Club TellurideScott’sPrintingSiamTelluride/TalaySilverStar Luxury PropertiesTelluride.com Telluride ExpressTellurideSki & Golf Companythebutcher & the bakerThe Hotel TellurideThe Peaks ResortThe Rex FoundationThe Victorian InnTimberline Ace HardwareVirginia & Bill HowardTheTelluride Fire Festival has some really cool rewards for your pledges.

The only thing you need to connect Omzlo devices together is a simple RJ45 cable (4 twisted pairs). You can even use ordinary 4-wire electric cables with the addition of the optional 3.5mm screw-mount terminal blocks that can be soldered on the Omzlo One. It is conceptually similar to PoE (Power over Ethernet), but uses a simpler network called CAN bus.The Omzlo platform uses a communication protocol called ""Nocan"", which is based on the CAN bus protocol (a really neat multi-master serial bus standard, see https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/CAN_bus). Nocan makes it very easy to create networked Arduino applications. With Nocan, each Omzlo One node automatically gets a unique address (between 0 and 127), and then all communications take place over ""channels"" with a simple ""publish/subscribe"" model (like MQTT):The great benefit of this approach is that each node will only get messages it is interested in: your Arduino application will not waste any time/CPU to process data it does not need or want.The web interface running on the PC allows you also to publish data to any channel as well, so you can send data to nodes yourself.Technically, this protocol is mostly managed by a dedicated chip on the Omzlo One: an ARM Cortex M0, running at 48MhzThe real hero of this project is the Omzlo One. Physically it has the same board shape and pins as the popular Arduino UNO R3. It is even binary (hexfile) compatible with the Arduino UNO. The Omzlo One has the following technical specifications:The network is managed by an ARM Cortex M0 (the STM32F042P6) using a dedicated firmware that communicates with the ATmega328pb with I2C. The Atmega328pb is almost identical to the Atmega328p that powers the classic Arduino UNO. However, we take advantage of the fact that the Atmega328pb has one “extra” I2C line compared to the Atmega328p. Hence, network management does not “block up” any Arduino pins from the board!To upload your Arduino sketches to the Omzlo One, you simply follow these steps:And you're done!The bootloader in the Atmega328pb will take care of the rest.The very first time you do this, you will first need to download the Omzlo One Arduino package from our website.The Omzlo USB controller is the natural companion to any project that uses the Omzlo One. It acts as a CAN bus to serial USB interface, translating CAN bus messages to serial data, and vice-versa. Technically, it has the following characteristics:Once plugged in a PC, the Omzlo Controller is identified as a USB serial device (CDC).The Omzlo USB controller is equipped with a “smart” network power switch: DC power is automatically switched off in case of over-current or short-circuits.The network management software communicates with the Omzlo USB controller to manage the network, using the Nocan protocol. It’s main functions are:This notably allow users to upload a new firmware to a Omzlo One node over the network with just a mouse click.The dashboard can be used to send and receive messages to Omzlo One nodes as shown on the example below: typing ""Hello"" in the dashboard causes an Omzlo One device with an LCD shield to display ""Hello"".The network management software is written almost entirely in Go (https://golang.org/), with just a few lines of C dedicated to the low level serial interface.This project started more than a year ago as a personal project, to put sensors and automation in my house and garden. But as it evolved and matured into the Omzlo platform, I realized that I had made something that was quite unique, which could become something much bigger than I initially thought. So I'm going to try to make it bigger!I want to finance the first production run of the Omzlo One and the Omzlo USB controller. I love electronics and I love embedded programming. This is for me the first stepping-stone into making this a more permanent activity.But this kickstarter campaign is also for me a great opportunity to share with the community. By getting the Omzlo One in the hands of hackers and makers, I hope to get feedback and new ideas to make this project even better.  This is the strength of open source and open hardware.One of the first things to note is that adding a network shield will “use up” some of the pins of your Arduino. For example, adding a RS485 shield will take away 2 pins for serial communication, a CAN bus shield or an Ethernet shield will typically use the SPI pins of your Arduino board. This is not the case of the Omzlo One: all pins remain available for your project, in a compact solution.Now from a technological point of view, each network solution has its advantages and disadvantages:The CAN bus is similar to RS485 but allows hardware filtering of messages and automated arbitration, offloading the Arduino CPU from these tasks.The Omzlo One effectively builds upon the CAN bus, but embeds a solution to power devices, and comes with a novel network protocol called ""Nocan"" that makes it much simpler to build connected Arduino applications, so you can focus on making stuff.The Omzlo platform is composed of several pieces that are completed or close to completion:Next steps:When finalised, this project will be released as open source and open hardware. Some files are already available at https://github.com/omzlo. and more data will be added in the following weeks.Since it's open, you can make it better and contribute back to the community. Or if you don’t like it, you can change it. For example, with a change of firmware, the Omzlo USB controller could easily be transformed into a generic “USB CAN bus sniffer”.","I’ve studied quite a few kickstarter DIY hardware projects and I’m well aware that it’s a challenge for this type of project to deliver on time. This particular project slightly increases the challenge by involving the production of two boards: the Omzlo One and the Omzlo USB controller.The main identified risk areas are:•	Delay or lack of availability of a part in adequate volume.•	Manufacturing delays•	Production scaling issues / DFM issuesI have already sourced some of the parts needed. For almost all parts, I have an alternate solution as a result of experimenting with several prototypes during the past months. I have two alternate manufacturing options for the hardware, one acting as a plan B in case plan A fails. I have also planned a bit of leeway in my timeline that should allow me to overcome some unexpected issues. The boards have been designed to be easy to manufacture and I have already identified a couple of potential manufacturing issues that will be tested in the next weeks when the finalised manufacturing process is fully defined.  No such project is without risk and I intend to be transparent and report back to all backers regularly in case any issue arises. I have already invested a lot of personal time and money in this project and I’m determined to make it succeed.",https://www.kickstarter.com/projects/1242572682/nocan-the-wired-iot-platform-for-makers?ref=discovery_category_newest,1242572682/nocan-the-wired-iot-platform-for-makers,"NoCAN is an Arduino-compatible 'wired' IoT platform for makers. It is based on CAN-bus: a robust bus communication protocol that is widely used in industrial and automotive applications. It enables you to connect a set of Arduino-compatible 'nodes' to a Raspberry-Pi, using a single cable that brings both power and networking. The Raspberry-Pi controls the network and acts as a gateway to the outside world. You can connect sensors, lights, relays, and actuators and build complex IoT application easily. You can even control your network with your smartphone thanks to the 'blynk' gateway included in the software.Featured on:We love building 'wireless' gadgets. Like many hardware hackers, we have spent many hours playing with the fantastic ESP8266 Wi-Fi modules and some of those new Bluetooth LE adapters. However, in some applications, we ran into power issues and signal strength issues. Changing batteries every few days or plugging into a USB charger is not always practical. Your wireless signal does not always reach that little corner of the building where you have put that precious sensor box. So we decided to build an Arduino-compatible 'wired' IoT platform that would be simple and cheap, for those cases where 'wireless' is not the right solution.And this is how the NoCAN platform was born.To build a NoCAN network you need:With the cables, you connect the Omzlo PiMaster HAT to the first Omlzo CANZERO. Then you connect the first Omzlo CANZERO to the second Omzlo CANZERO, following with the third, and so forth until you have connected all your Omzlo CANZERO nodes, forming a chain that can be 300 meters long! (yes, that's 1000 feet!). You plug the DC power supply into the PiMaster HAT: this will power both the RaspberryPi and your newly created network. Now, connect to the RaspberryPi and launch 'nocand' our network manager application and you are ready to go. 'nocand' is a self-contained application that runs on a standard Linux Raspbian OS.You can now connect sensors, lights, relays, and actuators to each CANZERO node to create rich interactive IoT applications for your home and your garden.Get the best of both worlds with the NoCAN platform: mix the Arduino universe and the Raspberry Pi!The hardware is simple. But what makes NoCAN really cool is the software we have built on top.Firstly, CANZERO nodes communicate with each other and with the outside world using a 'publish/subscribe' mechanism. CANZERO nodes can create a 'channel' with a name (e.g. 'temperature') and all CANZERO nodes that subscribe to that channel will receive any data published on that channel. When sending a message, there is no need to worry about the 'address' of the recipient node. Sending data to multiple nodes is just as simple as sending data to a single node. If you have ever used MQTT you'll feel at home here.As an example, a CANZERO node sensing temperature would typically contain the following code, which creates a channel called ""temperature""and then publishes temperature readings on that channel:Similarly, a CANZERO node that needs to react to a certain temperature condition would include the following code:Secondly, our software allows you to update the firmware of any CANZERO node over the network at any time. Imagine if you had to plug a USB cable into a CANZERO node from your laptop each time you wanted to make a change to the software! That would be really annoying, especially if you have a few CANZERO nodes sitting inside nice waterproof enclosures in hard to reach locations!Thirdly, our software enables you to interact with your NoCAN network in powerful ways. It lets you publish messages to any channel in your network or receive messages just like any CANZERO node in the network. And this software doesn't even need to run on the Raspberry Pi that controls your NoCAN network. It also works on Windows 10, Linux and Mac OS X, so you can pick your favorite weapon!Finally, we have not forgotten that the ""I"" in ""IoT"" stands for ""Internet""! so you can optionally connect your NoCAN network to the internet thanks to the 'blynk' platform. With a simple smartphone, you can then send or receive data to any channel in your network. Check from work if you left the lights on at home and remotely switch them off!We love Arduino and the open-hardware community. It changed our life. We might have never got interested in microcontrollers and hardware if Arduino had not existed. We might have never tried to build something if we had not seen so many people building and sharing their own amazing projects. So when we designed the NoCAN platform, we tried to make it Arduino-compatible as much as possible.The CANZERO board is designed to adopt the new Arduino MKR form factor. The pinout of the CANZERO is similar to the Arduino MKR Zero as shown in the diagram below.Any shield designed for the Arduino MKR family should work on the CANZERO.Note that the CANZERO is equipped with a 32-bit MCU that is much more powerful than your classic Arduino UNO. You'll get 8 times more flash memory to store your project and 16 times more SRAM! And your code will be running at 48Mhz instead of 16Mhz. Itpacks quite a punch for your next IoT project!We provide a CANZERO board definition and libraries for the Arduino environment. Once they are installed, you can write sketches in the Arduino IDE, export them as compiled binaries and then upload them to any node with our dedicated software too.We provide detailed instruction in an extended tutorial describing how to set up the Arduino environment for CANZERO nodes.If we reach our funding goal, we are committed to making all hardware and software open source. By doing so, we want to make sure that anybody can replicate our work and hopefully build exciting derivative work and enhancements to the NoCAN project. You can already find the schematics of our boards on our website.As we mentioned previously, NoCAN networks can be connected to your smartphone, thanks to the blynk platform(note: We have no link with blynk inc.).You can download and use the blynk application for free on both Android and iPhones. Then, with just a few lines in a configuration file, you can connect 'channels' in your NoCAN network to widgets in a blynk application on your smartphone.Here are examples of applications of this technology:For more details check out our blog entry describing how to connect a NoCAN weather station to a smartphone.The Omzlo CANZERO node is a dual-MCU board with the following characteristics:The Omzlo CANZERO provides a 3.3V supply pin (300 mA max), a 5V supply pin (500mA max) and a VIN supply pin (e.g. 12V).However, like most newer Arduino-compatible boards, the Omzlo CANZERO is designed to operate with 3.3V logic instead of the 5V logic used by the Arduino UNO for example. As a consequence, itshouldnot be connected to 5V logic without using some kind of voltage shifting circuitry. The CANZERO nodes use an efficient switching regulator to step-down the network voltage (e.g. 12V) down to 5V, and then a more traditional LDO to reach 3.3V.The Omzlo CANZERO measures25mm x 61.5mm (approx. 1"" x 2.4"")and is physically compatible with the dual 14-pin headers of the Arduino MKR family.Additional details about the Omzlo CANZERO, including schematics, are available on our website.The Omzlo PiMaster is a Raspberry Pi HAT withthe following characteristics:The Omzlo Pi Master is compatible with all Raspberry Pi boards with a 40 pin header, notably the Raspberry Pi 2 model B+, the Raspberry Pi 3 or even the Raspberry Pi Zero though the later is smaller than the Omzlo PiMaster HAT.Additional details about the Omzlo PiMaster HAT, including schematics, are available on our website.The NoCANplatform uses CAN-bus running at 125Kbps. This speed allows building networks over 300 meters (1000 feet) long.NoCAN cables need 4 wires: Ground, VIN, CAN_L, and CAN_H. You can use cheap Ethernet cables as described in our tutorial.For very long networks, it is recommended to add a termination resistor on the last CANZERO node of your network: simply connect a 120-ohm resistor between the CAN_L and CAN_H pins. Each reward kit is provided with such a resistor, though you probably won't need it.The Omzlo PiMaster and the Omzo CANZERO nodes can operate with a power supply providing any voltage from 6.5V up to 28V. In practice, it is recommended to use a power supply that can provide at least 12W (24W is better), typically as 9V, 12V or 24V.This power supply will need to power both the Raspberry Pi and the NoCAN network. It's also possible to use a separate power supply for the Raspberry Pi as an extra level of redundancy.The following pictureshows a weather station based on an Omzlo CANZERO connected to a BME280 temperature, humidity and pressure sensor. The node was placed in an enclosure and connected to the rest of the network.The following picture shows an enclosure hosting a CANZERO connected to a relay which switches on or off a light connected to mains (here 230 VAC).In the third example below, we have connected a 12V Passive infrared sensor (PIR) to a CANZERO node that is programmed to send a notification on a dedicated channel if the sensor detects a presence between 11 pm and 5 am. The notification is forwarded to a smartphone with the blynk platform. Since the NoCAN network is powered with 12V here, the PIR sensor is also directly powered by the network with no additional regulation circuitry.Backers can try the NoCAN platform with two kits: the standard kit with 2 Omzlo CANZERO nodes, and the extended kit with 5 CANZERO nodes.Though it should be clear from the diagrams above, we highlight that the kits do not come with a Raspberry Pi or a power supply. You will need to provide your own.If you are not looking into building a wired IoT project, you can still show your support for this project with the ""silly""supporter sticker reward pictured below. The sticker is 5 cm by 8 cm (approx. 2"" x 3.1"").","We are quite confident that we will successfully complete this project and that we will deliver rewards to backers on time. Indeed, this crowdfunding campaign is not designed to turn a prototype into a real product: we already have a real product. This crowdfunding campaign is designed to provide us with the funds to produce our first production run and kickstart a community around the NoCAN platform. We have a good understanding of the manufacturing challenges for this project and we have already produced the first batch of 30 Omzlo CANZERO nodes and 10 Omzlo PiMaster HATs. We have been testing the platform in the field for a couple of months. We have also recently provided some sample kits to selected beta testers, in order to root out any remaining issues in software or documentation. The feedback provided by these beta-testers during the next 2 months will be integrated into the product delivered to bakers.At this stage, the only potential cause for delays would be an unexpected shortage of a component necessary for the assembly of the rewards. We have already pre-stocked all passive parts covering our funding goal. Should we still run into any supply issue for the remaining parts, we will notify our backers immediately and provide a new delivery date. Given the current stock levels of our suppliers, we believe that such an issue is unlikely. In general, we promise complete transparency to our backers in case we encounter any issue. We believe that trust is a key element to establish a durable relationship with our backers beyond the end of this crowdfunding campaign."

https://www.kickstarter.com/projects/beddoes/seaquins?ref=discovery_category_newest,beddoes/seaquins,"Paul Bigsby is a 17 year old lad struggling with school, adolescence, his parents...oh and his burning desire to become a drag queen.A well known drag queen said, ""if you can't love yourself, how the hell you gonna love somebody else"". Paul Bigsby could have done with this advice, but sadly for him RuPaul's Drag Race won't be hitting the screens for another 18 years....hell Netflix won't be founded for another 12 months (with 30 staff and 925 DVDs on a pay-to-rent structure). He could always text his best friend Stacey for support, but he doesn't have a phone (the Nokia 3210 is two years off launch). Welcome to 1997, Blackpool, Lancashire.Teenage years are a scary and confusing time, especially for Paul as he feels a calling to entertain, sing and make people laugh in the world of drag performance. The posters for the various cabarets in Blackpool seemingly trying to recruit him.However, opportunity presents itself in unlikely forms, and a chance encounter with an off-duty drag queen is going to open up a world that Paul had only dreamed of. He will go on a journey of transformation, both physically and emotionally, all within the solace of The Seaquin Club.A heartfelt comedy-drama about learning to love yourself when the easy option is to hide.The idea for Seaquins came from our writer wanting to tell the story of drag set in a time when it was a much more niche sub-culture. The idea has existed in one form or another for many years, but we feel this is the perfect time to tell this story. The fandom for drag queens and the drag world is at an all time high thanks to artists stepping out into mass culture with the likes of Conchita Wurst's win at Eurovision and the growing viewership for RuPaul's Drag Race. The Drag Race live shows are touring worldwide and selling out large scale venues. Drag fans range from ages 6 and up, with a huge and fiercely dedicated following amongst the teenage and millennial communities. Bianca Del Rio has been known to bring young queens on stage when they attend their shows with their parents, supporting who their children are, and it's such a joy to see the widespread progression and acceptance of the drag community. However, this is not to paint a picture of total acceptance of drag and the LGBTQI community in general. From a story telling standpoint, we feel that our film has a strong message about acceptance, accepting others and learning to love what people are about.With Seaquins, we want to focus on the time in the not so distant past before drag was more visible, when the cost of being a queen was not only measured in financial expense, but also in terms of how people viewed you as a person. Our writer, Amy, speaks of her experiences with drag culture when she was first introduced to it.‘When I was seventeen, living in Ireland, I first discovered drag at dance school living with guys who were discovering their drag personas - often via my wardrobe. I’d come home to them dancing around the living room in my clothes, and looking better in them I might add.Since the launch of RuPaul’s Drag Race, drag has been brought into the lives of more people, and sparked conversations that wouldn't otherwise have been had, which is exciting to see as people embrace the art form.I grew up in a small Irish village where being different was never easy, and with no smartphones, or mobile phones in general, and a lack of home internet, there were few resources instantly available to ‘find your people’. You just had to wait until you were old enough to move onto the next chapter of life. I discovered that when I went to dance school and discovered the joy of drag, the arts, and entertainment. I found my people.Having been born in Blackpool and spending a lot of my childhood there and in St Annes on family visits, when the story of Seaquins began to emerge, I wanted to set it in the world I remembered when it would have been less accessible to someone like Paul. Seaquins looks at drag before it became the mainstream hit it is today, when Blackpool in the late 90’s was less and less the thriving British family tourist attraction, and the costly art of being a drag queen relied on working in tired venues on the promenade to a niche audience of LGBT locals.Paul is a shy, awkward teen who doesn’t fit into the world he’s been raised in. He desperately wants to embrace his artistic side… by being a drag queen. His singing talents are the pride of the school and his family, except his straight laced father, but that’s not enough for Paul. He looks longingly at the pictures he has of himself standing with the drag queens on Blackpool promenade when he was just a child, wanting to copy their look. But with only the Halloween costume box to supply him and old tights stolen from the bin in his parent’s bedroom, he’s a long way from polished. His chance encounter with Roger leads him to The Seaquin Club where he sees Roger perform as Sophie Le Purr. Sophie literally and figuratively “drags” Paul into the world and mentors him from the ground up. The Seaquin Club gang are a group of supportive queers from a range of diverse backgrounds, who have found their family in each other. Paul, the latest member, finally feels he belongs. As his journey continues, his confidence and belief in himself is challenged, as he tries to overcome his inner demons to become the person he’s always wanted to be.Reminiscent of The Full Monty or Billy Elliot, Seaquins is a ‘feel good’ British comedy about overcoming your greatest obstacle, your own self doubt. In order to get Seaquins made, we need your help. This film is an authentic depiction of the art of drag in the late 90's through the eyes of a shy, gay teenager with a big ambition wrestling his demons. In order to make the film in the tone and style we have in mind, we to consider a number of factors to give this film the dedication it needs to reach its full potential. Although we have had talent, equipments and help pledged from many people, when it comes to filmmaking, there are still costs we just can't proceed without covering. Things like locations, equipment, costumes, props, catering, accommodation, transport, cast & crew expenses, and not to mention all those wigs, heels, eyelashes and sequin dresses we're going to need!So this is where you come in, helping us to reach our goal so we can give this film the chance it deserves. The more budget we have, the more we can allocate to things like better equipment to get the shots we want rather than compromising, more money for props for our period 90s setting, more time when it comes to shooting...all going towards making the film look and be its absolute best.We have been overjoyed so far with the enthusiasm and support we've received from people when telling them about this project, and we hope that you feel just as excited about it reading this and watching our video. Every donation goes a long way to building up to our target. If every drag fan in the world gave us £1, we'd more than smash our budget! But we can't get anywhere near that without your support. And that's not just financially, the bigger audience we have, the more we're likely to make our target. Without that, we don't have the resources to make this film, and we more than anything feel this such a wonderful story and an important time to continue making history together in the LGBT+ and drag community. So please, if you love this project as much as we do. If you love drag, and you support us living in an accepting and loving society, please share this project to your social media, tell your friends about it, help up to open up this world even more.Amy Clarke - WriterAmy Clarke has had the story for Seaquinssloshing about in her brain for a number of years. Last year, she decided to sit and write it and is passionate about seeing it brought it its full potential. She's been immersed in the world of drag and LGBT culture for a number of years. Seaquins is a project born out of seeing her friends go through their own journey with their sexuality and lifestyle. She's a firm believer that love is love and the world is a richer place for its diversity.'For all the progressiveness we've seen in the world, we're now living in uncertain times with narrow minded ignorance feeding off fear of things that people don't understand. I feelSeaquins is coming at a time when now, more than ever, we need to promote, as a community of accepting people, that we should be open, kind, and supportive of a multi layered culture.'Amy has recently obtained a First Class Honours undergraduate degree in Creative Writing at London South Bank University.Michael Beddoes - DirectorMichael Beddoes is a filmmaker with a number of years experience making short films. His projects have played at a number of Oscar and BAFTA accredited film festivals around the world.As well as festivals, his previous projects have also been Short of the Week selections for both HungerTV & Collabor8te online channels.Catherine Goldschmidt - Director of PhotographyCatherine Goldschmidt’s passion for crafting visual stories began in 2005 when she shot Academy Award nominee Benh Zeitlin’s award-winning short film Egg.  Since then she has been across the U.S. and around the world, shooting narrative, documentary and commercial work on almost every continent.Catherine shot on the new Netflix original series Abstract: The Art of Design (premiering at the Sundance Film Festival 2017), as well as the period show A Crime to Remember (2-time Emmy Award Winner for Best Cinematography and Visual Design.)  When it comes to music, Catherine has photographed a wide variety of international artists including Prince, Barbara Streisand, The National, Florence and the Machine and Jurassic 5, among others.More recently, Catherine wrapped shooting on Todd Berger’s latest feature, Cover Versions, for Lakeshore Entertainment which will be distributed by Sony later this year.  No Light and No Land Anywhere, Catherine’s 6th feature, directed by Amber Sealey and executive produced by Miranda July, had its world premiere at the Los Angeles Film Festival in June 2016 (winning a Special Jury Award), and continues to make the festival rounds.Along with cinematographer Vanessa Whyte, Catherine is a co-founding member of illuminatrix, a UK-based collective of female cinematographers.Sian Revill - Make-Up Designer/ ArtistSian is a UK based make-up artist working across film, theatre, TV and fashion projects. She is a long time collaborator with director Michael Beddoes.Veronica Green/ Kevin Grogan - Drag ConsultantKevin is an actor and singer living in London. He has most recently performed in Pageant, the hilarious musical comedy about the world of beauty pageants at The Camden Fringe. He first started doing drag in 2013 for Halloween and after that was a roaring success, his drag queen persona, Veronica Green, was born.Speaking in an interview for 'Guys Like U' in April 2016, Kevin says of Veronica:""Veronica is elegant, glamorous, sassy, genuine and very versatile. She sings, dances, acts and is a complete illusion from head to toe. A lot of people don’t get it because they think I’m an actual girl. I also like the fact that I’m subvertly challenging gender norms by following the stereotypes for what is socially acceptable for women. I really enjoy people coming to their own conclusions and really start to think about what they are seeing. It’s far more powerful for me to allow them to make up their own minds.""When we approached Kevin about being drag consultant for Seaquins, he was more than happy to come on board and support the film. We're in a time where even though drag is becoming more popular and mainstream, there's still a lot to do. ""The UK has always been accepting of its panto dames and comedians dressing in drag as characters on TV (Little Britain, Kathy Burke as Perry in Harry Enfield and Chums etc) but drag is still very underground in the UK. If the right queen came along we could have a golden era in this country, it’s just going to take a brave producer to bring us to the forefront.""Kevin is passionate about the themes that Seaquins touches on. It's a film that explores behind the scenes of drag, not just its glittery presence on the stage.

As an illustration of their talents, please have a listen below to the demo they made for 'Female of the Species (rights agreed with Phoenix Music International) to show the style that the track will be used during our final scene.Festival FormulaFounded by Katie McCullough, Festival Formula is the culmination of over ten years experience strategising film festival submissions. They have joined us as official distribution partners to make sure that the festival strategy is thought of at every stage of the filmmaking process.Organised Chaos FilmsSeaquins is being produced by Organised Chaos Films, who have a number of year's experience bringing incredible short stories to the screen, including films for Felix Thompson (Independent Spirit Award winner), Kate Herron (Screen International Star of Tomorrow 2016) and Rebecca Rycroft (numerous directing credits across BBC and Channel 4 programming. To see some of their work and credits, check out their website:www.organisedchaosfilms.comBlackpool CouncilThe lovely PR & Film Officer, Jenny Clark, has offered help and support in bringing Seaquins to big and small screens. This will be essential in securing filming permissions across the various Blackpool based locations.Blackpool & the Fylde CollegeBlackpool & the Fylde College have offered support in with a casting space, local casting support for the younger roles and also a production base for the film. We will also be taking on a number of their media students as junior crew.Seaquins is already underway in terms of production. The script has already been through a number of drafts, each time getting better and stronger.In May 2017, we went up to Blackpool and Lytham-St-Annes for meetings and initial location scouting. We found the people in the area, supportive, passionate and helpful in discussions about the film.Behind the scenes there has been on-going discussions about cameras, equipment, scenes and individual shots. Storyboards for key shots have been drawn up and concept artwork for locations and characters have been created.Why set the film in 1997? Well, a couple of reasons actually. First of all, it is an era in which both writer Amy and director Michael were in their adolescence and therefore have an intricate knowledge of the culture, the music, the news and daily life. Although it doesn't seem that long ago, it's actually an age in terms of lifestyle and technology and it made Paul's journey more compelling to isolate him by removing access to digital support groups through Facebook, Twitter and even Myspace!The lack of the constant ability to contact peers, friends or helpful strangers meant that the when things went wrong in the 90s, it could be a very lonely experience.It also put a larger emphasis on school and social activities outside as the opportunity to socialise. Paul cannot wait to see his best friend Stacey but also knows that this means a potential run in with the school psychopath (every school seemed to have one).We have a number of great awards and perks available to backers. These range from a shout out and thank you on social media, through to artwork, books, t-shirts and even the option to appear in the film itself.Well hopefully yes! Eventually. Not only do we want to tell this story as a beautiful, self contained short film, but we would use it as proof of concept to support the pitch of a feature length film exploring the characters and world in more depth.","As with any film production, there are risks, such as weather, illness of key members of cast or crew and equipment issues. However, through a mixture of preparation, insurance and using trusted/ experienced people, we can be ready for most occurrences.",https://www.kickstarter.com/projects/beddoes/sequins?ref=discovery_category_newest,beddoes/sequins,"*NOW RAISING TOWARDS OUR STRETCH GOAL OF £6,500*SEQUINS is a coming of age comedy short film set in late 90s Blackpool. 17-year-old Paul'sjourney of self-discovery takes a unique turn when he embarks on his ambition to become a drag queen, despite fear of ridicule from his peers and being ostracised by his family.Opportunity presents itself when Paul meets drag queen Mimi Le Purr, a seasoned performer at The Sequin Club in Blackpool. With the help of Roger, (Mimi out of drag), Paul embarks on a journey of transformation, both physically and emotionally.A heartfelt comedy about learning to love yourself and trusting that those closest to you will accept you no matter what,Sequins is the ""Frilly Elliot"" of Drag.Why Now? The film looks at a time in the not so distant past before drag performance started to become more mainstream and there was less social understanding about it as an art form.Since the launch of RuPaul’s Drag Race, drag has been brought into people's homes and sparked conversations that wouldn't otherwise have been had, which is exciting to witness as people embrace it.But we're still on a journey towards acceptance, and the story of Sequins is as relevant today in the ongoing attempt to bridge the gap between the LGBTQ+ community and less liberal thinking areas of society.Why You?In order to get Sequins made, we need your help. Things like locations, equipment, costumes, props, catering, accommodation, transport, cast & crew expenses all add up, not to mention the wigs, heels, eyelashes and all the sequin dresses we're going to need! So this is where you come in! The more budget we have, the more we can allocate to things like better equipment, making the film look its absolute best. We have already won the Genera Film Fund prize which covers our camera equipment, an Arri Alexa Plus/ Arri Master Primes package, to be provided by Procam. But we need this last push to get over our budget line and into production at last.The footage shown in the Kickstarter video is test footage shot by director, Michael, with a camera borrowed from a friend in order to put together a sizzle reel for potential investors and talent agents, and to prove that this project should get made.Because we are a small, indie film project, we wanted to ensure we present ourselves as dedicated professionals who are passionate about this project every step of the way. We can't thank our young cast enough for giving up their time for the day of shooting.What Do I Get? Every donation goes a long way to achieving our target. We have some amazing rewards available that will hopefully make you want to be a part of the Sequins family. For instance:If you'd spend £20 on a night out at the theatre, cinema or a drag show then consider chucking it our way. WHY? Because you'll get an invite to our official screening which will include live drag performances and mingling with the cast and crew. THAT'S SOME VALUE FOR MONEY HUNTY! HALLELOO!So please, if you love this project as much as we do, if you love drag and you love film, please donate and share this project to your social media, tell your friends about it, and help us make this film. Thank You.THE PEOPLE BRINGING SEQUINS TO LIFE:Amy Clarke - WriterAmy is a scriptwriter born in Blackpool and living in London. She's just completed an MA in Scriptwriting at Goldsmiths University of London, where she's been developing the feature film script of Sequins.

His projects have played at a number of Oscar and BAFTA accredited film festivals around the world.As well as festivals, his previous projects have also been Short of the Week selections for both HungerTV & Collabor8te online channels.We have other amazing cast and crew...oh boy do we have an incredible team on this film. We'll be doing rolling announcements every few days to introduce you to everybody.The Sequins Production Story so far...Potential Investors: We are happy to share the latest draft of the script with anybody looking to invest for any of the producer perks, so please contact us at mike@mikebeddoes.com","As with any film project, there are of course risks. We will take all precautions to limit the chance of these happening, and we will be insured against any unexpected accidents or injuries while filming.We will have back-up plans for our exterior shots in the event of adverse weather conditions.Arrangements with our rental houses and locations will allow us to delay filming and reschedule should a member of the cast become ill or not be able to perform for any other reason."

https://www.kickstarter.com/projects/224840420/presentation-day?ref=discovery_category_newest,224840420/presentation-day,"Hello Everyone! My name is Perrin Pang and I am a theatre maker. This is my first every theatre project ever as a director as I am studying acting in East 15 Acting School (Year 2). Although I haven’t graduated yet with quite a few experiences, I have a lot of passion in making theatre and would also like to improve from my mistakes. In this experience, I would like to explore “Playground theatre”, a devising method created by Dr Ramiro Silveria. It is a unique way to play while creating ideas to improvise that I would like to bring to the theatre field in Hong Kong. In this performance, not only I want to use “Playground Theatre” to create the play, but I would also like to educate the audience about this method.For more info:https://www.ramirosilveira.com/I would like to start by introducing this performance called ""The Presentation Day"". The venue of the classroom from primary school to secondary school to university is a place to learn and grow. Actors will be portrayed as (you guessed it) students in a show-and-tell lesson, where they will tell wonderful stories of their items. Their stories may be wild and creative like a fairytale filled with dragons and castles or can be dark filled with horrors and ghost. However, these stories all link to the main idea of regret, where the students did or didn't do something and hated themselves for it. Is this just a normal presentation day or does it mean something more? I personally love to work with an ensemble and create group images such as physical theatre lifts and lively images. This piece, I would like to audition young creative actors to tell their own stories. However, they will not be performing their own stories, and the stories will not be literally told, rather metaphorically presented.I wish to give something to the audience, as well as the actors to think about after the whole experience. I also would like to give myself different perspective of life. I really hope this experience will be successful, even without enough money. I will try my best in every turn to create a lovely piece of theatre(work) and I wish you would come and support me!!! If there are any questions please drop me a message! The money will be mainly used for renting stages and creating set and props. After calculation, a day worth of renting a stage in Hong Kong is around 9000 HKD, and I am hoping to perform 2 days with 1 extra day for rehearsals and tech run. I also hope to create one more session for educational purposes on my way of creating theatre if the theatre allows me, as I hope to interact with audiences as well as knowing their way of thinking. This will not only benefit them to understand “Playground Theatre” but also for me to look for rooms in improvement in creating theatre. For people who donated a generous amount of money, I would like to thank them by creating a documentary of this whole experience. I invited my friend who is a professional filmmaker to help me to look back on this whole experience and create something special for myself. It might not be a proper top-notch production, but it is everything that I can present and I hope you won't mind it. I would also like to present a free ticket to donors who had given more than 300 HKD as a thank you!Thank you and wish you all the best!","There are definitely a lot of risk and challenges in theatre. For my piece, I might not get enough actors or crew. In that case, I would just have to work extra hard, and maybe even pick up a role myself. Another challenge is that we do not have a lot of resources, of course, the money would help, but rehearsal space is also an issue. worse comes to worst, I would use my old secondary school as a rehearsal space if they allow me to. If not I would also have a few backup plans of rehearsing in my home or in the park. I really would love to create this project with any means necessary, so I do think I can and will overcome most of the issues!",https://www.kickstarter.com/projects/224840420/the-presentation-day?ref=discovery_category_newest,224840420/the-presentation-day,"Hello Everyone!

The passion for growing the highest quality organic food has been our focus for the last three years as we built out infrastructure to bring the Pick and Ship program to life. In the early stages we had to grow lots of food to see what worked and what can realistically be grown and shipped. Having a surplus of vegetables and wanting to focus on just growing we decided to donate our vegetables to the local food bank. The Name Helping Hand Name began to Bloom.We believe a great tasting high quality fruit or vegetable could really help in a time of need and this will continue to be a part of our Mission.The founder worked as a Social worker assisting people with disabilities find employment. Knowing the struggle they face the farms ultimate goal is to grown into a larger and possible network of organic farms with are Pick and Ship program, continue to act as a trainer and place of employment for people with disabilities.We grow a large variety of fruits and vegetables at the farm. We will pick and ship that day to insure absolute freshness and quality. We will specialize in Jersey Heirloom tomatoes but also will send mixed produce boxes with obscure items. We will at times have peach boxes, apple boxes, hot peppers like Ghost Peppers and Scorpions. 2021 we will have limited additions of fresh Elderberries, Beach Plums, Goji and several other rare berries, hard to find potatoes, onions and so much more as we expand.We are aware that the idea of sending boxes of vegetables is around but after extensively testing the market we concluded we are in a class of our own.Boxes will contain derivatives of popular vegetables you can not find in your local markets, rare items, and regular organic vegetables. Each box will list the items and have recipes. Once a member of our Pick and Ship program you will receive an email letting you know what items are being harvested. You can select to add or take away items you do not care for.Yes it is possible to grow with ocean water. Only a few farms throughout the world grow with minerals from the ocean. Using the correct ratio will greatly increase the mineral content in vegetables. Doing so causes a dramatic increase in taste, nutritional content, and shelf life of the vegetable.

The passion for growing the highest quality organic food has been our focus for the last three years as we built out infrastructure to bring the Pick and Ship program to life. In the early stages we had to grow lots of food to see what worked and what can realistically be grown and shipped. Having a surplus of vegetables and wanting to focus on just growing we decided to donate our vegetables to the local food bank. The Name Helping Hand Name began to Bloom.We believe a great tasting high quality fruit or vegetable could really help in a time of need and this will continue to be a part of our Mission.The founder worked as a Social worker assisting people with disabilities find employment. Knowing the struggle they face the farms ultimate goal is to grown into a larger and possible network of organic farms with are Pick and Ship program, continue to act as a trainer and place of employment for people with disabilities.We grow a large variety of fruits and vegetables at the farm. We will pick and ship that day to insure absolute freshness and quality. We will specialize in Jersey Heirloom tomatoes but also will send mixed produce boxes with obscure items. We will at times have peach boxes, apple boxes, hot peppers like Ghost Peppers and Scorpions. 2021 we will have limited additions of fresh Elderberries, Beach Plums, Goji and several other rare berries, hard to find potatoes, onions and so much more as we expand.We are aware that the idea of sending boxes of vegetables is around but after extensively testing of the market we concluded we are in a class of our own.Boxes will contain derivatives of popular vegetables you can not find in your local markets, rare items, and regular organic vegetables. Each box will list the items and have recipes. Once a member of our Pick and Ship program you will receive an email letting you know what items are being harvested. You can select to add or take away items you do not care for.Yes it is possible to grow with ocean water. Only a few farms throughout the world grow with minerals from the ocean. Using the correct ratio will greatly increase the mineral content in vegetables. Doing so causes a dramatic increase in taste, nutritional content, and shelf life of the vegetable.

Additionally, there will be a “toddler” space that allows for safe and enjoyable play for younger children as well as an “imaginative play” area that includes a mock kitchen and other role playing equipment, art and craft supplies, puzzles and the like. Finally, there will be a table top gaming section for older children that may be looking for more intellectually stimulating forms of play. The facility is intended primarily to support play while adult caregivers socialize on-site, however, “drop-in” care options may be available. The vision of the children’s entertainment facility is to meet the developmental needs of children specifically through play. What sets Evolution apart in this capacity, and will ultimately make this business successful, is the departure from the technology and electronics-heavy entertainment facilities that exist in the market today. The on-site dining area will provide a service not currently available in any local children’s entertainment facilities in that the available food and beverage options will depart from the highly processed “fast food” choices such as pizza, french fries, and pretzels and will transition to delicious and still healthful menu items that will be offered through the catering service. Evolution will provide creative solutions like smoothies, soups and stuffed fruits and vegetables to help kids enjoy eating healthy.Essentially, the “concession” area of Evolution will be a café offering a tasting menu of what will otherwise be available to consumers through the catering menu. This will ensure the success of the overall operation in that it will minimize the risk of food-waste by making the food purchased multi-functional. Employing a seasonal rotation to the menu will also mitigate the risk of overhead involved in traditional food service establishments by allowing for a flexible menu that can be modified as needed.  As a culinarian, owner and operator Monica Basantes has provided off-site catering services to friends in the community for the past 3 years. Evolution will provide a larger facility for offering such services and meet the needs of the health-conscious, farm-to-table style food service demand that is growing in popularity in the Triangle area. Traditional catering operations have proven successful in the Triangle due to the growing population and the demand from consumers of various types such as corporations, trade show organizers, community organizations and families securing services for functions such as weddings and other gatherings. Evolution will successfully meet the needs of the “farm-to-table” niche as well as those consumers looking for an alternative in pricing and the availability of on-site catering at the Evolution premises.","Opening a café is one of the riskiest new business endeavors. Evolution will address this risk up front by keeping the menu small and flexible. Maximizing ingredients across menu items and keeping purchases small will reduce waste and keep food costs manageable. Labor cost is one of the largest costs an establishment like this will face. As the general manager, Monica Basantes has committed to avoiding taking any kind of salary until the business is profitable. In addition, key full-time employees will enjoy salary structures that not only keep labor costs fixed but also provide ownership in the company, motivating employees to be efficient with time and products. Finally, liability, particularly for a facility that serves children, is a significant risk in this type of business.

There will be several events leading up to the opening of Evolution to introduce the community to the business mission and values.

Finally, labor cost is one of the largest costs an establishment like this will face.

Although there has been many variations of their back designs, one has remained the most influential, the ""rider back"". The design has been color swapped, and modified to fit other themes, but overall the design has stayed the same. With keeping in the tradition of what makes the design great, we have worked with the USPCC to push what makes the rider back great and bring you a new design inspired by the original. A design which keeps the integrity of what we are familiar with, yet something new to add to its LEGACY. BICYCLE LEGACY is a TRUE set of unique poker cards. This means both decks have identical faces with 2 back color variations. Hand drawn courts, aces, and joker cards add to the decks appeal while a simplistic layout keeps the deck familiar. This makes LEGACY a great deck for performers of magic and cardistry, while bringing something fresh to your weekend poker games.Consisting of 56 cards, these decks are manufactured by the USPCC® with their world famous Bicycle® Brand and Stock.FEATURES:- BICYCLE Branding- Premium Bicycle Paper Stock- Magic Finish- Interior Tuck Box Coloring- 2 Gaff Cards- Custom Faces with Hand Drawn Courts, Aces and Jokers- QR Code Reveal- Barcode Reveal - Hidden Tuck Flap RevealAlong with the Bicycle Branded Legacy Red & Blue set comes the Limited Edition Unbranded Legacy Black.

Tenebre (Darkness) Rosso (Red), is the first Limited Signature Series deck to be produced by 4PM DESIGNS and printed by TheLegends Playing Card Company....Printed by The Legends Playing Card Company (LPCC)...WHAT no USPCC?! Now before we cause a riot, Legends is the company that manufactured the ground breaking Legends #852, and later collaborated with The Expert Playing Card Company (EPCC) to print their beautiful Exquisite decks with the innovative EPCC sideways tuck. If you don't know about these decks, we suggest you look them up because they are surprisingly impressive.Why LPCC? One reason is because we are able to print an extremely limited run of 1,111 decks. A run that the USPCC would not provide. Another, being that the day we held the Exquisite and Legends Playing Card decks, we knew they had something special.We admire them for being one of the first companies to explore high quality and innovative print jobs outside the USA, their flexibility with design/production and responsive communication. Their close partner the Expert Playing Card Co. granted permission to use the signature EPCC sideways tuck and EPCC pack jacket, both of which are exclusive EPCC designs.We have been working with magician Lawrence Sullivan at the LPCC to produce a deck of cards that can capture what we loved about the Legends #852 and Exquisite decks, yet allowed us to put together something new. This exploration led us to Tenebre.FEATURES:- Sideways Tuck Box design (courtesy of EPCC)- Exterior Pack Jacket (courtesy of EPCC)- Matte Red Tuck Box- Interior Tuck Box Foil- Specialty Legends Diamond Finish and Cutting- Specialty Legends Card Stock - 54 Fully Custom Cards EXCLUSIVE PACK JACKET...Included with every deck will be a custom pack jacket. Made in collaboration with the LPCC & EPCC (Expert Playing Card Company) these fantastic packs will help protect your decks while adding to its design. Each pack jacket will contain foil printing and be signed then numbered by hand.ROSSO EDITION...So wait...If this is called the Rosso Edition, does that mean there will be more? Well, hopefully, that's the plan. All new editions will remain limited to the one time printing by the LPCC.SIGNATURE SERIES...The Signature Series is planned to be a continued effort to bring new artwork and ideas to the market. Many of our Bicycle decks have taken inspiration from pop culture and vintage cards, but our Signature Series will focus on more personal designs. If the support is there from everyone in the playing card and kickstarter community, Tenebre will be the first of several lines of cards, exclusively manufactured by the LPCC.However, this does not mean we will abandon the USPCC. We still have many more new designs to unleash to the world and with your help they will retain that great USPCC standard.EXCLUSIVITY...Since only 1,111 are being printed, Tenebre will not be available to wholesale. We also chose a maximum pledge level of 6 decks to allow enough decks to be available for other backers. Therefore, the only means to get Tenebre will be through us and the LPCC official website, who would only carry 111 decks (without the Exclusive Pack Jackets). Yes, that's why the run is a weird number. Realistically, approx. 900 will be available through kickstarter. With the exception of our private reserve, If they sell out on this campaign, they would be sold out altogether. Both The Grid and Grid 2.0 sold out within a year of their release, and they both had runs of 5,000 decks of each.","Any project on Kickstarter will bare the risks of the costs for the manufacturing of their products and shipping. This is our 5th deck launch and we have plenty of experience with manufacturing and delivering our products on schedule. Even though our deliver dates are in place, we have a tendency to deliver months ahead of schedule. However, this isn't a guarantee, sometimes there can be unforeseen production dilemmas but we are dedicated to work them out efficiently. This is our first venture with the LPCC so production may be handled differently. Timing is subjective.*Some artwork, color tones and features on all products subject to change without notice. By pledging, you understand any risks and changes that may occur throughout the campaign to delivery. Pledges can not be changed/cancelled after project deadline."

Typical Portuguese restaurants and places rooted in their tradition and cultural history are slightly disappearing from the city’s skyline. Nowadays, innovative local shops pop up and put a fresh spin on the city’s ancient past by giving Lisbon an authentic new voice. Therefore, the salt & wonder magazine ate its way through Portugal’s capital, collecting stories about authentic and inspiring places and portraying passionate people with innovative ideas. Three chapters document the growing food movement in Lisbon and highlight new products and future-oriented thoughts.It all started as an artistic, student project with an idealistic background.

During this time abroad I saw an opportunity, to showcase an authentic piece of my creative voice. The city crowned as Startup City 2015 and the strong Portuguese culinary distinction formed my idea in February. Over five months, I spent and observed many hours with each Startup to go behind their surface with the mission to understand their stories and new directions.

The first change was that all of the products are now made with flatlock seems for a better fit and performance. The Core 2.0 Shorts and Leggings now have a gusset built in (see above image) for an improved fit. The Core 2.0 Top is stylistically similar to the Core 1.0 but is less fitted into the arms as per feedback from our customers. Finally the Pro Top (new image pending) has been specially designed to give a greater range of movement in the arm and shoulder and is stylistically quite different to the Core tops. WOMEN'S PRODUCT DESCRIPTION:The Women's Core 2.0 Products will be very similar in design to the Core 1.0 in design. The primary difference will be that all of the seems will now be made with a flatlock stitches for performance, and the Core 2.0 Women's shorts will come to the mid-thigh rather than the knee.Please note that rewards will come in BLACK as standard.PROJECT TIMELINE:Description: the project timeline illustrates our intended deadlines for the campaign and the resulting deliverables. As you may have seen we have allowed for an additional month to manufacture and ship products to make backers aware that if an unforeseen delay should arise we may have to - for example - roll into January for shipping products.CLINICAL RESEARCH:Above is the abstract of a preliminary study done on the technology that goes into our garments. As the abstract suggests further research is required to fully understand the benefits of the observations that were made. However for those that are not scientifically minded, the results showed that participants needed to consume significantly less oxygen to achieve the same amount of work - implying an increase in the efficiency of respiration.For those that wish to do so we have created a drop box so that you may read the other clinical and mechanical studies that have been done. Simply click HERE to be redirected.THE TEAMAt KYMIRA we are creating a community between our core team and you, our customers. We are always keen to hear your feedback, how you are using your KYMIRA gear and how you are getting on with your competitions and training goals.CONCEPT DESIGNS:","The risks and challenges associated with this project are similar to many other campaigns. We have sought to minimise any delays in the production process by purchasing and shipping our KYnergy fabric ahead of the campaign launch, with the ETA in the UK expected to be before the campaign ends. We have also allowed for the campaign to exceed our target amount and still be able to cater for the production required. There is the possibility that the campaign will exceed expectations and we will have to order more fabric in order to cater for the increased demand. If this is the case then orders will be fulfilled in chronological backing order and backers regularly updated on the process.Finally distribution can be the thorn in many campaigns side. However as we currently ship globally we are confident that we will be able to  avoid any distribution problems by working with our current distribution partners."

In the video and pictures you can see the tokens our artist has designed so far. When you back this project you will get the base 10 tokens plus ALL future tokens that are unlocked in the stretch goals. The set of Minimalist Miniatures will come in an assortment of colors. We will try to make the color selection as diverse as possible to help in easily differentiating tokens on the gaming table.Our first Kickstarter Project, The Character Crate, was a high-end container for nicely painted miniatures and dice. We have been working hard to design a simpler product. Minimalist Miniatures take up a fraction of the space of a standard miniature. You wont have to worry about a sword getting bent or the paint chipping. Maybe you use beautifully hand painted miniatures at home, but you want something simple to take with you on the road, to cons, or to your FLGS. Perhaps you've always used a coin, or an extra die to represent your Hero and you want to upgrade to something that's easier to differentiate. You might be a GM for players who never bring their own miniatures, or maybe you need tokens for that random barkeep or monster your PCs run into. No matter who you are, the Minimalist Miniatures can simplify and improve your gaming experience.These are the PC/NPC designs that our artist has created thus far. He is hard at work on a set of monster tokens. We'll update with photos as soon as we can.Upgrade your pledge level to receive a beautifully crafted hardwood box for your Minimalist MiniaturesWe will send out a couple surveys to backers to find out what designs people are interested in. We will then be working with our artist to create some truly incredible designs for the stretch goals. We are also considering adding a wooden carrying case and an extra set of custom Monster tokens as Add-Ons, so keep an eye out for awesome additions to the campaign as we move forward.Speaking of incredible designs, we are extreemly grateful to our artist for the awesome work and contribution to this campaign!

But he was hugely important in developing the way we listen to and appreciate music today. His neglect in recent years is probably due to the fact that he had a somewhat unorthordox career. As a child, he played the organ and trombone and took composition lessons but studied law at university, became a solicitor and set up his own practice which he ran for over thirty years.Performing was always a part of his life - he founded two orchestras in the Midlands before and after the war - but it wasn't until his retirement in the 1960s that he was able to make his mark. It was at this time that he established the The Little Orchestra of London which consisted of top London freelance players. Jones was at the forefront of the movement to reduce the size of orchestras for performances of 18th and 19th century music and an early adopter of period performance practice, long before it became part of the mainstream several decades later. His LP recordings were illuminating in their interpretation of familiar repertoire.Unbelievably, none of these recordings are currently available. Heritage Records has unearthed the original masters of a selection of these recordings which showcase Leslie Jones and his orchestra at the height of their powers. The expense of re-mastering these tapes, however, is considerable. With your help, you will be giving Heritage the opportunity to put these extraordinary recordings into production, bring them to the attention of a global audience and restore the reputation of Leslie Jones, as one of the key pioneers in performance practice, to its rightful place. In return for your generosity, Heritage has some great rewards.Thank you in advance for helping to make this important project a reality!THE RECORDINGSVolume 1 (3 CDs)Haydn – Symphonies 101 & 104Handel – Music for the Royal Fireworks; Water Music Suite No. 3; Concert a due coriBach – Harpsichord Concerto in D Minor & F Minor; Violin Concerto in E MajorVolume 2 (4 CDs)Mozart – Oboe Concerto; Clarinet Concerto; Serenata Notturna; Sinfonia ConcertanteBeethoven – Symphonies 1 & 8Dvorak – Serenade for Wind Instruments; Serenade for StringsHummel – Partita in E FlatSpohr – Notturno in C Major",I don't anticipate any risks associated with this project.

I’m MariaI am a professional classical pianist originally from Madrid, now based in London, and I perform in recital halls all over the world and broadcast regularly on the radio. I would like your help to fund a new recording I’m hoping to undertake later this year. The album will be a celebration of the piano music of Spain. Since my childhood, I have adored listening to and performing the music of my homeland. Quite simply this music is in my blood. I was fortunate enough to record a disc of Spanish piano music in the 1990s for which I received ‘Best CD of the Year’ from the British Retailers Association. With your help, I will be able to record a further disc and complete the project I started all those years ago.I believe that few countries have produced such an instantly recognisable musical identity as Spain – every region has its own song, dance, rhythm and harmony, fiery essence and unique magic. My album will feature music spanning three centuries from the sophistication of the keyboard sonatas of Baroque composer Antonio Soler, through the romanticism of Albeniz, Granados and de Falla to the music of modern Spain with two new works written specifically for this disc. Included will be dances from Catalonia, Aragon and Castile in the north and Andalucia in the south.I am thrilled that a major classical label Heritage Records has agreed to release my album. However, they will not fund the production, manufacturing and marketing costs. This is where you can help. By donating to my Kickstarter campaign, you’ll be giving me the opportunity to share the extraordinarily diverse music of my homeland with a global audience. In return for your generosity, I have some great rewards.Thank you in advance for making my dream project become a reality!PROGRAMMEAntonio Soler: FandangoIsaac Albeniz: Cataluña, Sevilla, Aragón, Cuba (from Suite Espanola No. 1)Manuel de Falla: Four Spanish piecesEnrique Granados: Allegro de ConciertoJoaquin Rodrigo: Preludio al gallo mañaneroL.de Arrizabalaga: Vals lAlejandro Yague: Halley II",I don't anticipate any risks associated with this recording project.

It will cover the cost of the illustrator, as well as the cost of fulfilling all pledges on this page.We will work on fulfilling all Kaylee-related rewards ASAP after fundraising ends. For those ordering a pawtographed copy, I will ideally have Kaylee pawtograph your actual book, but should she pass before the books are printed, I will insert pawtographed cards into the book.Thank you for helping to make this happen. Children are capable of such love and compassion, and I'm hoping Kaylee's story will encourage children to give some of that love to senior dogs.","Of course, one challenge in fulfilling rewards would be Kaylee passing before we can fulfill her portion of them. We'll be doing what we can to prevent that from happening by (of course) taking exceptional care of Kaylee AND by fulfilling her portion as soon as possible after funding is complete. We'll be making pawtographed cards to insert into the books should Kaylee pass before the books are printed.Should the illustrator we have our eye on not be able to commit to the project after funding is obtained for any reason, we will find another illustrator with a style that works for Kaylee's story. If anything happens that fully prevents us from being able to move forward, all pledges will be refunded."

We're fundingwebcomics, music, merchand of course...HOT PEPPERS!.This kickstarter is about funding a grow nursery for peppers, by branding this weekly comic strips ABOUT the peppers!4 strips every month. 1 comic strip per week. Illustrated and Written by the Co-collaboration between Monsters Peppers andFierce Ferret Foundry. Follow by spectacular tunes of Reverie! The creator of the Monster Pepper Theme.Writing story with illustrated visuals on weekly basis requires unique set skills... and we have the perfect people in mind for the job! Teaming up with the Fierce Ferret Foundry! Creators of the webcomics DungeonMinis and Beelzebud!Monster Peppers is start up nursery that will specializein growing hot peppers and nursery container plants. Monster Peppers plans on working towards sustainable agriculture and breed new kinds of peppers withmutagenesis orhybridization.The Story Behind Monster Peppers? Dr.Franken Pepper was an Environmental idealist who fought to save humanity from itself, before retiring to her experiments. And so she created monster peppers! The doctor and her Monster Pepper Girl experiments will make great adventures for our weekly comic strip, every pepper type we grow will at some point will get illustrated by the Fierce Ferrets Foundry and make appearance in the comic. Rade the grower behind Monster Peppers Plans on being Agriculture company. Growing large diversity and variety of peppers strains. Rade is skill in growing peppers and will being working all year round towards growing the bulk of the rewards. His knowledge stems from his relentless researching and practicing many garden methods through out the years.Cooking with hot peppers adds heat and provides extra kick to foodAlways trying to push the possibilities of what you can just grow in simple pot. He would like to start producing his own line of hot peppers, slowly work towards becoming local food distributor down the line. Supplying his favorite small local business with locally sourced and responsibly grown hot peppers.These can kill the beneficial insects, microbes and fungi on which healthy plant depends. I focus on using natural methods when dealing with pest.Monster Peppers have local Hover flies. Hover fliesare true flies, but they look like small bees or wasps. They are the helicopters of the insect world, often seen hovering in the air, darting a short distance, and then hovering again. Monster Peppers have  lighting bugs, wasp and ladies bugs.These beneficial insects are valuable tools in the fight against aphids, thrips, scale insects, caterpillars, snails and slugs.So no need for any form of chemicals or sprays. They are all locally active in the garden. Here some capture photos of them on the actual pepper plants grown by Rade.Hover fly that is resting, notice the uncanny stripes however share no similar body shape compare to the real wasp.Lighting bugs are common in the growing space and their larva are carnivorous as they eat slugs and snails. Lady bug larva are very carnivorous, and ladybugs are aggressive hunters on soft body aphids.Rade wants everything to be done in house. From growing the plants year round from the seeds he sell. He wants to sell hot peppers when they are in season but also provide quality service to growing plants and aiding others with their container gardening. The trouble in urban society we have limited access to land for food growing. Our Location is in NewYork and Rade wants to be guide for those who like to learn and develop their gardening skills with container methods with in their limited space.So far Rade been growing 200 peppers plants and would like to increase the grow quantity to 1000. All of them grown and maintain in 3 gallons containers or perhaps 10 gallons if possible. Each plant averages between 30 -75- 100 Pods per plant. I wish summer would last forever but as every one at house Stark would say in game of thrones. Winter is coming.Rade does not have facility to over winter many plants. However, he does own three grow lights. The grow light stack system is sufficient and effective for growing seedlings all the way to young adolescence stages of the plants growth cycle to be later transplanted outside.Numerous amount of basil variety growing under the lightsThe Contorted Coco is coming back from extinction as Rade is helping Kevin Bane the founder of this pepper by growing them out. Contorted Coco ismutation from Peach Bhut. This year Rade plans on growing 50 Contorted Coco plants or more. Contorted Coco Seeds are currently doing well and will be ready by spring. Soon as last day of frost is gone and temperatures are stable above  65 F at night. They will be transplanted outside in 3 gallons (hopefully 5 gallon if we get that stretch goal) by mid May 2018.https://www.instagram.com/explore/tags/contortedcoco/These seeds are growing up nice and healthy with no sign of trouble. Our personal favorite the Contorted Coco. These grow in monster size!I grow many unique strains but mostly been crossing and hand picking for the most unique traits in color and also shape or size.By the time May arrives, Rade have great start for the next grow season. By the start of May 2018 he will have Registration and Certification as a Plant Grower for NewYorkStateNursery retail. So every winter he will just regrow peppers and herbs indoors. Rade currently on his own been expanding the grow light system and trying to save enough for green house. Rade wants to do this full time.  Rade has already started growing peppers before the kickstarter even launched. However, if the kickstarter succeeds, he will begin germinating even more variety of pepper seeds in stock right away to grow between 200 - 1000 plants depending if all the stretch goals are attained before the end of this kickstarter.No money is require for these! These rewards can not be unlock base on how much funding is receive. Depending on the achievement it will unlock extra rewards that every one will get to enjoy.

We have many thank you gifts to offer for making a contribution. The goal is to raise a minimum of $12,000 in just 30 days, and of course we can't do this without you. The way Kickstarter works is it's all or nothing. In order for us to receive the money we must meet our goal, If we do not meet our goal by the end date then we don't get any money, and sadly the nursery cant afford to keep growing peppers.We only get 1 shot at this because we have strict deadline. We can not afford to try this again if fails first time. Only 1 chance per grow season.Rade wants to grow full time and start business growing hot peppers. As each increment of funding keeps rising you will be helping unlocking more strains and images of the peppers that will be growing. Every pepper strain will get illustration as kickstarter progresses. Totaling to 50 strains if we reach to the higher stretch goals. Every pledge makes difference. The life of these monster peppers will be heavily impacted by how much funding is reach by the end of the kickstarter. Majority of the funds will be put towards attaining supplies to grow the peppers and to provide all the tier rewards for every backer. This will require Rade's full attention all year round, and some trusted handy capable help from Fierce Ferret Foundry to make the Art. Every resource of capital will be utilize to make strong and healthy rewards. If you love fresh local grown peppers that are well fed and have not been expose to any form of  pesticides, fungicides, insecticides, and herbicides. Then I'm sure you want to see Monster Peppers open its own nursery. If you want to see Fierce Ferrets Foundry Release WEB COMIC about Monster Peppers. Please Spread the word and make pledge to help the war effort towards world domination.Thank you to everyone who supports this project in some way. Just sharing the kickstarter or choosing to just give just $1.00. means so much to the Monster Peppers. We cannot wait to hear your thoughts and reaction from the peppers that will be growing and the art that will be created from result of the kickstarter.theBatclamGraduated Valedictorian from Full Sail University for 3D art and now full-time freelance artist, making comics & games under the Fierce Ferret Foundry.

One of them was eating tacos with enormous amounts of Taco Bell hot sauces packets. That has to be earliest memories of me enjoying what I perceive to be ""hot sauce""  That was the start of my spicy life.TIME SKIP....Years later I took up gardening. It started with Tomatoes, Basil, Oregano and Rosemary in potted containers. Mainly basil as kind gesture of love towards my mom. From the garden I made decent sauce from scratch with fresh grown vegetables and herbs in the garden. I tasted big difference both in flavor when using fresh local ingredients. I fed my plants well in return they did the same.My Love for growing hot peppers started in 2015 when Taco Bell release the $1 Dare Devil Loaded Grillers, they were the talk of the town at the time. This was first time I was exposed to the idea that these kind of peppers existed. Ive expanded my horizons from herb and tomato growing onto hot peppers. It was out of curiosity of what the real mccoy would taste like that lead me to growing my own personal supply for consumption. I wanted to harness the heat and flavor of the spice for my own but now I want to share in everything that I discover and learn in the years to come.","WITHOUT YOUR PLEDGE, we can't make MONSTER PEPPERS COMIC or MONSTER PEPPERS NURSERY!  We need capital to grow large quantity of plants, that can not happen without your help.Risk and Challenges: While we will do our best to deliver all the pepper rewards by the estimated date. Natural disasters and world events are hard to plan for but Rade will make every attempt to complete every shipment. If shortage occurs every one will get alerted and alternate arrangements can be made for the future.The benefits of growing everything in potted containers is that they are mobile and in emergency the plants can be transported to safety. Other plants can be remove and isolated with ease because they are mobile. Growing peppers with out using any form of pesticide in large numbers is challenge. High risk of pepper pods being attack by blight or insects that can barrow into the pods is scary factor. No body wants to eat pepper to find something else got to it first. The size of these bugs are gargantuan! This is why you not test on bugs when using unstable elements. However lucky for us the Monster Peppers have develop wonderful defense mechanism that protects itself from foreign pathogens. The capsaicin and related compounds known as capsaicinoids. Capsaicin is present in large quantities in the placental tissue, the internal membranes and the other fleshy parts of the fruits of plants in the genus Capsicum.  This capsicum protects the pepper during it development. This Kickstarter has two teams! TWO TEAMS.While one team works on growing peppers and handling the rewards aspect of the kickstarter. The other team will focus on the writing and illustrations of the comic aspect of the campaign.

Hot peppers with energetic genetics. Learn to grow your very own Monster Peppers. Learn about peppers in fun and creative ways through exclusive content and explore the ability to grow them. We not just doing peppers, we creating new content for everyone to enjoy.Teaching people to grow and encouraging others wanting to grow can help the planet become better place. In more ways then you might think.Scientists associate the dramatic decline of insect populations to climate change and agribusiness, due to the destruction of natural habitats and the application of heavy pesticide usage over the course of decades. The decline of insects is rapidly getting worse, this hurts all terrestrial ecosystems. Insects are the basis of the food network that supports the diet of birds, reptiles, amphibians, humans and help with the pollination of plants. 75% of crops would be unable to reproduce and die out as a result of the lack of insects. If plants don't get pollinated by insects that means you do not get any food from the vegetables/fruityou are growing. Peppers can self pollinate which is a wonderful trait to have in world where pollinating insects are on the decline.Monster Peppers will not use pesticidesbecause the collapse of insect populations can lead to the collapse of terrestrial ecosystems. That really bad news for entire planet. INCLUDING YOU!Rusty Patched Bumble Bees are endangered and to avoid any harm towards them and other beneficial insects that live in our environment, we must protect our natural local ecosystems by using methods that will not hurt the beneficial insects, microbes and helpful fungus which plants depend on to survive. Monster Peppers tackles this issue by using ladybugs to combat aphids that hurt crops. Healthy soil is made up of billions of beneficial microscopic organisms. These microorganisms exist in all places and especially in the growing medium of our soil. Using pesticides hurt the activity in the ground and ends up destroying the fertility in soil. Grow herbs such as Thyme, Cilantro, Borage, Sage, Fennel, Mint, because these herbs have flowering stages that help feed Bees.Monster Peppers is focused on crop breeding for organic growers that want conventional farms / gardens. Farming and gardening often means working with occurring natural problems like insects, the weather, and soil fertility. Monster Peppers focuses on breeding plants to produce seeds for nature's harshest conditions. Sustainable Seed strains that grow without pesticides or genetic modification. Breeding plants for sustainability by improving their genetics. This will help new generations of growers that want to learn how to harness the power of growing their own food and help save the environment in the long run. Also it helps to eat locally sourced food and shop for certain foods within their grow season.What is Plant Hardiness? Plant hardiness is the ability of a plant to survive adverse growing climates such as drought, flooding, heat and cold. The science behind plant hardiness can be complicated. Plant genetics determine the ability of a plant to withstand many forms of natural problems nature provides. Each plant may have different hardiness levels based on their adaptations and genetics. Monster Peppers plants are grown in the most simplistic way, only letting the healthiest survive. Many of the plants that are grown do not survive the harsh trials of Monster Pepper growing but that is the point! We are breeding these domesticated plants to be stronger then your average everyday mass-produced plant, but in the most natural way possible.(We perfect IV and EV train/breed our plants. Only some of you will understand this reference)It's prohibited to offer genetically modified organisms as reward items on Kickstarter. Monster Peppers are not such things.Genetically modified organism (GMO) are living things, including seeds whose DNA has been engineered outside the natural process of cross pollination to inherit desirable traits. Many of the GMO products being grown today have used Super Science Technologies to artificially introduce Non Plant Based genetics into plants. It is this ""crossing"" of two different living organisms that nature would otherwise NOT allow that has many others concerned. Monster Peppers, IS NOT to be mistaken as GMO. The term GMO is still a term that is feared, leading to confusion about what a GMO seed really means.The Scoville Scale is a tool for measuring the hotness of a chili pepper, as defined by the amount of capsaicin it contains. Named afterAmerican pharmacist Wilbur Scoville, who devised the Scoville Organoleptic Test in 1912 as a measure of the amount of capsaicin in hot peppers. Unlike methods based on high-performance liquid chromatography, the Scoville scale is an empirical measurement dependent on the capsaicin sensitivity of testers and so is not a precise or accurate method to measure capsaicinoid concentration. Johnny Scoville and Sasquatch are both active reviewers in the chili community. Check out their reviews on the Contorted Coco! Monster Peppers will be scouting for pod reviewers to be featuredon the Monster Peppers YouTube Channel. Have a channel and want Monster Size Pods to review? Reach out to us in our discord server! Access to the server is granted to all who back the project.Chili Peppers (hot peppers) contain ferocious chemical substance call Capsicum. Chili peppers containing capsicum is what gives these family of peppers their intensity when ingested or applied topically.The chili pepper capsicum activates sensory neurons call Polymodal Nociceptors. These neurons exist all over the human body, such as your mouth and nose. These sensory neurons are activated by extreme heat. Your brain thinks it's in pain because the capsicum triggers these sensory alarms that exist all over and internally inside the human body.These compounds known as capsaicinoids, is present in large quantities in the placental tissue, the internal membranes, and the other fleshy parts inside of the pods. There are 23 known types of capsaicinoids, with their nutritional and antibiotic properties being used largely in painkillers and pepper spray. However not all spicy foods are spicy in the same way. The difference lies in the types of compounds involved. The capsaicin found in black pepper and chili peppers is made up of larger, heavier molecules call Alkylamides, which linger in your mouth after consumption. Horseradish and wasabi in contrast are made up of smaller molecules called Isothiocyanates that float to your sinuses. This is why chili peppers burn your mouth and wasabi burns your nose.Capsaicin is a fat soluble chemical that has long Hydrocarbon Tail,meaning it's non polar. Non-polar molecules do not have two electrical polesand the electrons are distributed symmetrically on both sides. The thing about non-polar molecules is that they can only be dissolved in other non polar substances. It binds strongly with lipoprotein receptors in the cell walls of fatty foods like milk and ice cream. Milk contains non-polar substances, meaning the capsaicin will be dissolved and washed out by milk.Water is a polar solvent. Only polar compounds and other polar solvents will mix with water.This iswhy drinking Water is bad after eating hot peppers. It only intensifiedthe pain.The average price for hot pepper seeds is $5 for 10 seeds. That's usually been the market norm for hot peppers seeds. Prices can range from $3.00 per 10 seeds to even as high $15. The reason for this is because certain pepper seeds are carrying unique genetic information. Those genetics contain value, years of someone's life spent to cultivate those pods. To many competitive growers getting the best seeds with amazing phenotypes is worth the price.Let's evaluate the standards of those seeds you purchase from a respectable grower online:There's really no way to know is there? Monster Peppers seeks to address this issue...What's the point of purchasing seeds that never derive from the pod that's being displayed?Growing out strains and breeding plants that produce consistent pods for their iconic phenotypes. The consumer has the right to know the details. What seeds were produced from which plant, and with what Genotypes and phenotypes. Those are the standards that we will provide thatmakes Monster Peppers seeds worth backing and purchasing.None of our seeds will be mixed with other seeds from different pods. You will know which seeds came from what specific pods. Harvested seeds that come mixed with others from different podswith different phenotypes seems like a terrible and outdated business practice.The Phenotype is a description of physical characteristics that can be observed. Visible characteristics like plant height or pepper pod color, but also the overall health, the disease history, and even behavior and general disposition. Does the plant grow rapidly or slow from every transplant? Does the plant get stressed easily during transplants from one pot to the next? Can it afford to be overwatered or underwatered? Does the plant like music or t.v? These are all considered phenotypes.The Genotype is the genes that help create those phenotypes. A Genotype is a complete heritable genetic identity; a unique set of genes or genetic material present in a cell or organism with all of the information needed to build that organism and allow it to grow and develop in a certain way. Each is very likely to contain similar phenotypes but the overall Genotype can be different. Here we value every seed being individual. The only way to be certain is growing every seed and isolating each plant to determine it's unique Genotype and the average traits seen in the family.Genes do not always reveal everything.Some of the most exotic peppers come different biomes of the world. That's because the environment plays an important factor in the phenotype developmentof the plant, which will later determine the outcome of the pepper pods physical traits. Some pods are smooth while others are spiky or rougher in appearance.Most phenotypes are influenced by both the genotype and by the unique circumstances in which the plant has lived it's life, including everything that has ever happened to the plant. We often refer to these as “nature” - the unique genome that the plants carry, and “nurture” - the environment that your plants lived.This can explain why some pepper pods look vastly different from other growers in different parts of the world even thought they are growing the same family of pepper plants.These pods are the same pepper strain and the same mother plant, but have two distinctively different phenotypes. Each pod's physical appearance is decided from random DNA sequences. You will never get a bunch of pods looking exactly identical to each other. Pods may all come from the same mother plant but the outcomes can be completely random from one another.Pepper seeds from the same pod are closely related to each other however they are not genetically identical. This has always been a misleading message that has run rampant in the pepper growing community. Not every pepper pod is going to come out looking identical to previous pods from past grow seasons. Pods from the same mother plant grown in isolation will all still have genetic variations from one another. Each seed in every single pod are genetic individuals. This is something that is never expressed enough and that should be public knowledge to all consumers in this market. But that genetic diversity can be controled through isolation.Now when buying seeds many growers say they isolate their peppers by growing them far apart in separate locations. Well Monster Peppers wants to take it to the next level!Segregating plants is the best we can do for now even with netting that will be purchased for the purpose of isolation. The problem is that their still is a small chance for cross pollination to occur when growing outside. Some bugs are so tiny even for the smallest of netting. The only way to fully prevent cross pollination is by growing in a 100% sterile, isolated, indoor room.Since these pepper plants are being grown in an urban setting, space is limited. So each plant will get it own space and mesh netting that will prevent bees and other insects that would cause cross pollination. This netting is to help isolate certain pepper plants for quality assurance to help determine what pods each will produce and the genetic purity of them. This also helps determine the average of which genes the plants are carrying and what traits they are passing on to their pods.Hence why it important to have netting to avoid cross pollination. Isolation growing will help prevent the pollen spreading. However mathematically speaking there are numerous of differences in every plant's DNA sequences. Decrease your output in genetic diversity to get the pods to look more identical to the phenotypes of your choice by growing them in isolation.The only way to get an exact copy of a plant and thus increasing the chances of getting the specific mathematical outcome of certain phenotypes is by simply just taking cuttings in order to clone the plant. This is call Pheno Hunting.What are hybrids? How are they created? If you like to understand how hybrids are made, well you're in luck. To simply sum it up, a hybrid is made up of two peppers that combine into a new one. When two Peppers Love each very much they combine their genetics. Hybridization is difficult to produce unless each pepper can be in sync mentality, emotionally and physically. The peppers must be in a healthy relationship to form a hybrid. The outcome of the pod results in it taking on new completely different form. They gain traits inherited from their counterparts.The pod gains amazing new flavors of strength that help them overcome the most difficult of challenges by being together.Peppers have two sets of♂chromosomes♀.Being self-fertile, a chili plant that pollinates itself will produce peppers containing seeds that will grow a very similar replica of the original plant.When you take two different varieties of pepper plants and place them close together, they most likely can and will pollinate each other. This cross pollination occurs by taking one chromosome from the mother plant, and one from a father plant that results in creating a hybrid chili pod.Hybridpepper pods require several to ten generations of selective crossing to become stable enough to produce uniformly. Planting the seeds produced from a first generation hybrid plant wont produce the same outcome.It takes years of selective growing to stabilize the outcome. Size, Heat, Taste, Color, Shape are all determined by a random number generated by each individual seed. It takes a lot of work and plenty of growing to make an unstable hybrid into a consistent homozygous heirloom.Here is an example of two types of peppers. Devil Brain on the left and 7 Pot Bubble Gum on the right. These two kinds of pepper plants cross pollinated and the outcome is the result you see in the middle. The pepper pod contains traits familiar to each pod.By selecting certain pods with certain phenotypes and growing them year after year, picking the plants and pods with the characteristics that you want, the percentage chance that the pepper pods will come out looking uniform increases with each generation as you filter out the genes that you do not want.The process to creating Monster Hybrids requires time and dedication. A lot resources are required to achieve these results. Through the success of this Kickstarter, Monster Peppers can continue create the most exotic looking Monster hybrids. It's only with the community's help that MONSTER PODS can exist!Monster Peppers practices Darwinian Growing in a safe controlled environment. Monster Peppers is organized and works hard to record and catalog data from every pepper plant and pod grown individually. Collecting only seeds with more selective ideals with the focus of breeding for strength and resistance to the elements in the most natural way possible. This has always been and will be a long ongoing process that takes years to refine. This is done by growing plants but only keeping the ones that survived the control trials of adaptation to intense conditions during the grow cycle into early maturity. The plants must undergo heavy exposure to wind, drought, heat, flood, cold and aggressive harming pathogens like fungus and molds, leaving only the strongest one's to survive and adapt and leaving only the healthiest genetically to keep producing seeds. This process ensures quality as nature would slowly perfect them over time in the wild. However unlike nature, Monster Peppers will pay attention to the flavor and size of each pepper.In the scientific process, it is crucial that studies are repeated by other labs and scientists. This prevents fluke studies from being passed off as truth and verifies the results. So put these seeds to the test! Only as a community working in unity can progress occur and truth can be resolved. Let's build a community together growing new kinds of peppers!! MONSTER PEPPERS!!!","While we will do our best to deliver all the rewards by the estimated dates. Natural disasters and world events are hard to plan for but Monster Peppers will make every attempt to complete every shipment. If shortage occurs, every one will get alerted and alternate arrangements can be made for the future. Do you want mass produce seeds or seeds that have been handcrafted by intelligent design? Seeds that will produce strong plants and give rewarding results? Many of the plants do not survive Monster Pepper standards of growing. The best way to improve their genetics is by replicating nature itself. You can't recreate the wild and only take the beautiful. You must also be willing to take the ugly, because both are inseparable in nature. The results are beneficial for both the plants and financial responsibilities needed to maintain them. Plants that require less water and have a natural stronger tolerance to drought. Plants that are bred for shorter summers means breeding plants that can grow quickly and produce pods sooner then later while surviving sudden weather changes. Plants that are more resilient to climate change. Plants that can survive random drops in temperature or unforeseen frost from climate change.No matter what happens we will do our best to get everyone their specifics  rewards! This Kickstarter has multiple of teams! One team works on  growing the peppers while another is focused on handling the T-Shirts and Art aspect of the kickstarter.

With its easy-to-operate slider handle, and a humbucker/single coil A/B switch, it offers the fullest range of tonal possibilities, effortlessly and immediately. Unlike other guitars which have a stationary pickup (or pickups) offering a limited number of tone choices, the Pole Position utilizes a single moveable pickup which can be moved  with a single fingerto any position from the bridge to the base of the neckfor unlimited choices.As demonstrated in this video of the prototype Pole Position, the player can slide the pickup to any position from the bridge to the base of the neck with ease and as often as desired, even while playing.Canavan Musical Products has been developing the Pole Position guitar over a period of two years, producing a series of designs which culminated in the prototype featured in our video, and then the final design pictured below.

There is certainly more to it than that, however. a full service restaurant with a bacon-themed menu and dozens of craft beers, a butcher shop with lots of bacon, ham, salami, prosciutto, locally made cheese and bread, artisan sodas and more. This is the vision we have on mind, and want you to see this vision with us.With over a dozen flavors, and more being created every day, 1803 Bacon tempts all of your taste buds with Ohio pork belly. Sweet, savory, spicy, whatever you desire, we have probably put it on your bacon.Using different hardwoods for smoking each batch and a selection of delectable, unique styles and flavors, 1803 Bacon has something for everyone.We have been testing flavors at private tastings, doing events like Ohio BaconFest15, and getting our bacon, bacon jam, bacon caramel, all sorts of goodies to the masses. But we want to have you sit down for a meal!We are currently scouting a location for our bacon shop, so that you may come in and try all the wonderful flavors of bacon, and take as much home with you as you'd like! With your help, we can open the door to a new experience in bacon. You'll be tempted by the smells, the sights, and of course the many available flavors of bacon. Come on in, order a sandwich, and saddle up. No matter what bacon you order, you are in for a ride.But wait....there's more! Our location will not only serve as a butcher shop and restaurant where you can enjoy pork in many different ways, but we will also have a craft beer bar! Why not enjoy a beer with your bacon? Here in Columbus, the craft beer scene has been booming, with more breweries popping up all the time. We take great pride in our bacon, and want to pair it up with some of the best craft beers this city, as well as the entire country, has to offer. This storefront will allow us the opportunity to provide you with the best of both worlds, beer and bacon!We thank you in advance for your kindness, and salute your love of bacon. At 1803 Bacon, we want nothing but happiness for all, and we are trying to do that through bacon.","The challenge will be finding a brick and mortar location, but our city has grown by leaps and bounds in recent years, and continues to grow so locations are plentiful. In the meantime, we will be working out of a commercial kitchen and figuring out a mobile situation. Ideally, 1803 Bacon & Brews will become a unique breakfast, lunch and dinner style bistro. Hurdles obviously include location, equipment and liquor license. All of these things are in progress, but we need that extra boost.Everyone involved has been trained, and is Food Safety certified, with many years of experience. Setting up shop, making sure everything is run the way a good restaurant should, safe, and clean, none of these things are an issue. we have all worked in the food industry and know our way around a kitchen.

Better yet, who doesn't love 1803 Bacon? We certainly do, and we hope all of you do as well!We at 1803 Bacon have been making artisan bacon in over 30 flavors for the past year. We made our debut at Ohio BaconFest and have been going strong ever since. Special events, pop ups, bacon events, cooking classes and farmer's markets are just a few ways we made our presence known to bacon lovers all around central Ohio. We use only heritage breed Berkshire pork from Saddleberk in Urbana, Ohio, and we use almost all Ohio ingredients. We are a proud member of Ohio Proud!Now in 2016, we are looking to increase our span around Ohio by moving forward with Wholesale Distribution. For us to do that, we need bigger smokers and more room to keep it all in. That's where you come in. 1803 Bacon needs your love of bacon to help drive us over the edge and get the smoker we need.Increasing the capacity of the smokers will allow us to make a LOT more bacon and work on even more flavors. With your generous donation, you will reap many rewards, mainly bacon!","With a successful campaign we will still face growth challenges as a company. Our long term goal is to have brick and mortar shop, but in the mean time this money will help us increase production for our current growth projections as well as supply the demand for wholesale accounts including local food trucks, restaurants and grocery stores around the state. This will obviously boost us into a more permanent location faster."

This kickstarter is to fund the Pilot. We hope the Pilot will then kick off a new goal - the series of 12 episodes, each also lasting 5 - 10 minutes a piece. We'll always leave you wanting more!This is a passion project.  We are pouring no less than our entire heart and souls into this world, into this adventure.""Most people work way too long for way too little doing what they're really not gifted at, unfortunately, because most people don't take the time to find out who they really are."" Richard Hatch of Battlestar Galactica, when I interviewed him at NASFIC, 2009.Everyone on this project: We know who we are, we know what we're gifted at, and we'd like to share those gifts with you by planting a seed that will grow into the Evar’nûm.High Fantasy is defined by the epic stature of its characters, themes and plots.  Each realm of Canticles has its own histories, religions and creation myths, from the Reignhearth to the Wreatheland, while each character is as deep as your best friend, from the Ildraeor to the Elzhri.I consider this to be a ""Living"" series, one that expands its own world boundaries with each episode. My goal is to have fans fund it, in the hopes that their love for the story will fuel its arc. I use the word ""Living"" to describe the style in which it evolves and is affected by everyone involved, from Director to Fans.""Everything we do in life affects every life we touch."" - the Shard, Everon.Eventually, the fans themselves may even have a say in what happens within the plot of their favorite character's development!The series follows Sybil Liltshyr in her attempt to save the Old World from a growing Darkness.  It is the account of her fellowship.  She will gain and lose allies along the way; they will brave the Shadow, find and fall in love, and learn the inevitability of fate in the loss of hope.  At its heart and soul is the thematic element of ""good versus evil,"" as well as ""friendship conquers all,"" even in death.In the Pilot, we see her introduce the world and fight her first battle against the Shadow.The Hunter antagonist in the Pilot is a physical manifestation of the growing Darkness. At its empty heart, the Shadow is pure evil - it's only objective is to bring chaos and destruction to the Realms of Aegis. However, throughout the series, we come to learn there's more depth in the Black than anyone could imagine...[kan-ti-kuh l]:A song, poem or hymn.I grew up knowing that song was instrumental to the development of the universe and everything else, pun intended. Like all Fantasy lovers, at nine, I read The Lord of the Rings, in which J.R.R. Tolkien riddled his literature with song and poetry. This series will do the same.The music of Canticles is as much a part of the world as the land, the plot, and the characters.Alexander James Adams!Unleashed from the land of Fae comes the heir to Heather Alexander’s music and magic. AJ Adams is a fiery Celtic fiddler with a compelling voice to enchant audiences of all ages. From tender love songs to rowdy brawls, gentle Irish airs to rockin’ reels, AJ brings ancient legends to the mortal world in true bardic style, proving once and for all, the magic never dies!Now, you've heard the short instrumental version on our teaser above, but below is the full lyrical version of one of many tracks AJwill create to help bring the world of Canticles to life:If we exceed the $15,000 goal, and reach $30,000 or more, then we can shoot the first 3 episodes at one time!

The MindRider app maps and tracks your engagement, and allows you to share your maps with others. These maps provide quantified insight that empower you to maximize your riding experience,  and they are a great resource for riding communities and street advocacy.MindRider has been featured in The New York Times, MSNBC,Discovery Channel Daily Planet, Fast Company, Wired,Shape Magazine,CNN HLN, Boston Herald, PRI's Studio 360, WGBH, BostInno, Make,Discovery News, GizMag, KGW-NBC,WNYC, and many more.We built the original MindRider for cyclists and have tested it with commuters, beginners, and avid riders. Recently, we’ve tested MindRider with skaters, as well. Josue (daily commuter), Alex (new cyclist), and Julia (skater & rollerblader) all talk about their MindRiding experience in our video.We’ve also received inquiries from para-gliders, triathletes, equestrians, climbers, and skiers, just to name a few. MindRider is CPSC and CE certified.FeaturesCompatibilityThe MindRider App is an application suite, for mobile devices and web browsers, that maps all your MindRides. As you can see below from the Discovery Channel video of Lucas Cochran's rideevery MindRIder map has its pure green ""Sweetspots"" of relaxation, and its pure red ""Hotspots"" of focused concentration. Riders have examined their ""mind-maps"" and have seen how Sweetspots and Hotspots can be influenced by the rhythm of the road, pedestrian and vehicular traffic, and social interactions of many kinds.This quantifiable insight provides you the opportunity to challenge, enjoy and maximize your experiences.Josue, our experienced rider, uses MindRider to turn his commute into a kind of mind-training game. After reviewing his MindRider maps and learning which routes have the most Sweetspots and Hotspots, he often challenges himself to relax his mind and turn his Hotspot-heavy routes into Sweetspots all the way from home to work. You can examine your MindRider maps, share them with your friends, and even (optionally) share them with your community. These maps have implications not only for individual riders, but for “smart” and “green” cities incorporating new kinds of sensor data into analysis and planning. Advocates for street safety have also expressed keen interest in using community MindRider maps.For instance, in our hometown of New York, the new mayor has launched a ""Vision Zero"" initiative, inspired by similar plans in Europe, which aims for streets free of traffic fatalities and serious injuries.MindRider maps can provide an additional layer of quantification to help us understand where we feel those Hotspots. We're mind-mapping our own local streets of Brooklyn, block-by-block, to produce new kinds of heat-maps for MindRider users, and to provide new insights for all riders.The MindRider project is led by Arlene Ducao and Ilias Koen. Arlene is the chief instigator, inventor, and designer, while Ilias is the chief builder, programmer, and artist. In addition to DuKorp (MindRider's new parent company), Arlene and Ilias have led The DuKode Studio, a small design firm focused on spatial and scientific visualization. Their first startup, Hugebrow, won a National Science Foundation award in 2009. Prior to that, they both worked in the Science Bulletins group at the American Museum of Natural History.In 2013, Josue Diaz III became MindRider's main rider, social media guru, and soft-sensor maker. A knitwear designer at Theory, Josue joined the MindRider team through an Eyebeam's Computational Fashion Honorary Fellowship, and has helped guide MindRider's design and branding.Vanessa Mejia has been an electrical engineering intern on MindRider since January. She came to the team through the Brooklyn Tech Triangle Internship Program. She's helped design and assemble MindRider circuits.In 2011, Arlene took a sabbatical from DuKode to study at the MIT Media Lab. Inspired by an opportunity in 2011 to showcase work for the MIT Media Lab sponsors, she quickly conceived and built the first MindRider helmet. After a run of user interest and press coverage, including the Wired UK article above, Ilias encouraged Arlene to re-initiate work on the MindRider, which has its roots in DuKode's 2010 bike helmet project Lumenhattio.In 2013 we relaunched the MindRider project and transitioned it from MIT to NYC. We added GPS and data storage, so that the mind data could be mapped afterward.After conducting user studies on MindRider’s ergonomics, we also re-oriented the helmet’s brain-state indicator lights toward the rider (rather than toward the motorist, as in the original prototype).In 2014, we accelerated R&D to make the dozen MindRiders you see in the video. We 3D printed several prototypes, added Bluetooth to the system so that mind-mapping could take place in real time, expanded the mobile app, molded and cast plastic multiples of the helmet shell, and developed our own circuits and sensors from scratch. We are now ready to bring MindRider to you.We love the MindRider style we've created and have several working prototypes, but we welcome feedback from our backers on the following design decisions:As we get closer to making these final decisions, we’ll reach out to our Kickstarter backers for their input. MindRIder's team also includes Natalia Villegas (marketing and communications), Shay Krasinski (graphics, UI, and apparel), Tania van Bergen (power riding and community outreach), and Rob Hemsley (electrical engineering). Chris Willard (software development and audio engineering), Ben Tudhope (director of photography), and Libi Zhang (electrical engineering) have been invaluable to the MindRider effort.And thanks to Hello World Communications for their great gear, audio engineer Tom Myers, andJosh Woodward, who composed the song in our main video, ""Crazy Glue."" MindRider's advisers and supporters include Joi Ito and Dave Strand of the E14 fund, a new startup program for MIT Media Lab projects.Joi also directs the MIT Media Lab, and has been a great adviser on many fronts. Stanley Yang, Johnny Liu, and their team at NeuroSky have answered many of Arlene's and Ilias's questions about accessible BCI. Arlene's Media Lab adviser Henry Holtzman (now head of Samsung's NExD Lab) was a great champion of MindRider in its early days, and helped Arlene learn how to convey MindRider's story. As a BCI/HCI researcher and MIT postdoc (now Drexel CS professor), Erin Solovey helped our team get its bearings in the face of so many new consumer-grade BCI projects. Through her social cycling studies, MIT researcher Sandra Richter pushed MindRider to become a connected device for novice cyclists. Dan O'Sullivan and Luke DuBois of NYU gave MindRider some great new opportunities and resources after Arlene moved back to New York.Champion movie-maker and MIT HCI researcher Dhairya Dand created a catchy MindRider video just before the project was relaunched.Catherine Cramer and her team at New York Hall of Science provided great support and feedback as part of NYSCI’s “Maker’s Brain” initative.We'd also like to thankBen Cohen, Sue Schaffner, and Nikki Arendt of Gowanus Studio Space, where our studio is physically housed; as well as Eyebeam'sPaul Amitai, Marko Tandefeldt, Jamie O'Shea, and Roddy Schrock. Ron Citkowski shared with us excellent legal advice on preparing a hardware project.With the exception of a few parts that aren't available domestically, MindRider will be sourced and manufactured in the USA. We have connected with and developed price quotes for the entire MindRider production pipeline, and have paid special attention to New York State manufacturers for our custom designs, particularly the soft sensors and plastic helmet shell. NeuroSky manufactures the EEG chip in MindRIder, and it has been an incredible adviser and advocate to our development team.MindRider is an innovative new wearable technology, but its safety is based on cycling helmet constructions that have been tested and CPSC-approved time and again. Our initial product release is inspired by BMX and skating designs, and we've chosen an international manufacturer of polystyrene liners that are CPSC-approved at 140 grams per liner.MindRider will be assembled in Brooklyn, in our own facility with our own QA/QC (quality assurance and control), and the final MindRider will be CPSC-certified in the U.S. We are not against manufacturing and sourcing internationally, but QA/QC, as well as fair and equitable labor policies, are of utmost importance to us, so our plan is to keep the initial production run as local as possible and personally oversee all assembly. With future production runs after 2015, we may travel to international sources topersonallyoversee and transition the production pipeline.","Scaling, scaling, scaling! This tends to be the main challenge with hardware projects-- what is affordable and functional at the prototype phase is often not so at the small-scale manufacturing phase. This also applies to manufacturing in large volume.We've done our research, not just on the risks and challenges of scaling, but on the risks and challenges faced by the pioneering Kickstarter hardware projects that have come before us. Most Kickstarter projects succeed at mid-volume levels (500-2000 units), and we have a detailed production plan for this kind of manufacturing. We have also allotted a comfortable production period (18 months) to execute this plan. If there is a backer demand for a larger volume or a significant design change, we ask for your patience as we adjust our production plan and execution period.We also have incredible resources and mentors through MIT and NYU, and we are prepared to do our best through these resources. Arlene and Ilias, the lead makers on this project, have worked together for more than 10 years, and feel confident that they can lead a production team to release a meaningful, functional, stylish, MindRider v.1.0.",https://www.kickstarter.com/projects/1168534473/mindrider-maps-nyc-a-mental-picture-of-bike-riding?ref=discovery_category_newest,1168534473/mindrider-maps-nyc-a-mental-picture-of-bike-riding,"MindRider has been featured in The New York Times, MSNBC,Discovery Channel Daily Planet, Fast Company, Wired,Shape Magazine,CNN HLN, Boston Herald, PRI's Studio 360, WGBH, BostInno, Make,Discovery News, GizMag, KGW-NBC,WNYC, and many more.Why MindRide? As bike riding becomes a more common mode of transportation, it's crucial to understand, quantitatively, how the busiest and most tranquil streets engage our mind.  Having seen some of the individual MindRides, as well as MindRider map of combined rides, people really want to know more about    the data that MindRider provides. Combined with other kinds of datasets like traffic accident, bike lane, and demographic data, MindRider maps can help cities plan more bike- and pedestrian- friendly streets.Help MindRider Map NYC:We've been MindRiding our own streets here in New York for the past year, and are ready to show you how that service works by mapping the city, visualizing the data, and compiling our analysis into a poster and printed guide.Our team of MindRider users will set up a schedule to MindRide all of Manhattan, and some of the outer boroughs too, then publish a guide and poster so you can see and experience the city's mental signature, block by block.Why support this project?If you're a fan of cycling, maps, data, urban planning, cities, design, travel, or New York, this guidebook will give brand-new insights on the subjects you love. Even if you're not a New York resident-- say you're a visitor or prospective visitor-- this will be a really unique guide to understanding the environment of a major city. If you're a cyclist in New York, you can even take a MindRider tour with us and contribute your own data as you ride. All backers will have access to MindRider NYC Data in 2015.Above: A slideshow of some of MindRider's maps and riders.We'd love for you to share in making this groundbreaking guide and    map.Additional credits: MindRider's main makers for Summer 2014 are Arlene Ducao, Ilias Koen, Josue Diaz, Natalia Villegas, Hans Ma, Yapah Berry, and Shay Krasinski.

With our small set of MindRider helmets, it's quite feasible to MindRide all of Manhattan and some of each outer borough (Brooklyn, Queens, Bronx, Staten Island) to make a continuous map. If the weather is great in August-November, we might be able to map even more. If there is a lot of heavy precipitation in August-November, we will map just Manhattan. If weather is particularly inclement, for instance if there are hurricanes in NYC in August-November, we may push back our delivery schedule to early 2015, but this is a last resort."

Together we created a special set of fan art posters. The posters are inspired by the first 3 books in The Chronicles of Narnia. Dom and I, decided to follow the original publication order of the books. First, we started withThe Lion, the Witch and the Wardrobe. Then, we moved on toPrince Caspian and finished withThe Voyage of the Dawn Treader.Dominic and I were both inspired by Pauline Baynes and her illustration work for Narnia. Being able to create our own interpretation of these books has been a very exhilarating experience for the both of us.We'd like your help in getting these artworks screen printed. I hope you're ready to explore the wonderful world of Narnia with us, because here we go!In a brief essay entitled “It All Began with a Picture” C.S. Lewis explains what led him to writeThe Lion the Witch and the Wardrobe. Hesays:“The Lion all began with a picture of a Faun carrying an umbrella and parcels in a snowy wood. This picture had been in my mind since I was about sixteen. Then one day, when I was about forty, I said to myself: 'Let's try to make a story about it’ (C. S. Lewis. On Stories: And Other Essays on Literature, p.53).”All of the posters were designed using complementary colors.Pretty cool right? These posters would make great gifts. Each poster will be 18 x 24 inches and beautifully screen printed onto French Paper using 4 colors. All posters will be hand numbered. One poster will cost $45 (includes shipping anywhere in the US); $135 will buy the entire set (includes shipping anywhere in the US).As always I greatly appreciate your support.","Since all of these posters will be screen printed, production delays may occur. I will communicate any and all delays to you. Shipping the posters will require you to fill out your backer survey at the end of the project. The survey is very easy!",https://www.kickstarter.com/projects/17501467/the-mask-of-zorro?ref=discovery_category_newest,17501467/the-mask-of-zorro,"Producing an officially licensed movie poster is a lot of fun! It takes imagination, a lot of attention to detail, patience, creativity, legal work, exploration, knowledge of the source material, support from the fan community, 25 cups of coffee, a crew of screen printers, sugar, spice and everything nice mixed in with a wickedly cool designer. Throw all that into a crock pot, stir the concoction until it simmers and voilá! A work of art emerges! With your help, WE can produce the very FIRST officially licensed art posters to be crowd funded through Kickstarter.Hey what's up Kickstarter supporters! My name is Turrel. I am the Creative Director and Owner of Dzxtinkt Originals. Dzxtinkt is a new art company. We create artwork that draws inspiration from pop culture. At Dzxtinkt, we believe in the power of film. Great films deserve the best artwork. We also believe in challenging the status quo by offering people better art alternatives. Better choices. Better posters for the films that you love. The best artwork for the films that inspire you. If you're a person that shares our beliefs and if you're someone that is willing to help us stir the movie poster crock pot, THIS is the project for you.We would like you to help us produce a set of alternative movie posters for the 1998 Martin Campbell film,The Mask of Zorro. The posters are officially licensed which means they are all fully approved by Zorro Productions Inc (the company that owns all rights to the Zorro character). Grzegorz Domaradzki designed the posters and I handled the Creative Direction for the project. Zorro, the masked vigilante first appeared in 1919 in the All-Story Weeklymagazine. The character was created by Johnston McCulley. After decades of leaving his mark on pop culture Zorro has become an iconic character. He is now known for his foxlike agility and his superior sword fighting abilities. Don Diego de la Vega is the man behind the mask. He defends the people of Las Californias by fighting against corrupt, powerful, tyrannical authorities.HESPERUS score for Douglas Fairbanks' 1920 silent masterpiece The Mark of Zorro (1920)Steven Spielberg'sAmblin Entertainmentdeveloped the The Mask of ZorroforTriStar Pictures and released the film on July 17, 1998. The film earned critical acclaim and was a box office hit. Zorro is an inspiring character whose unbreakable concern for ordinary people makes him a hero deserving of the highest honor. He is no ordinary man. Don Diego de la Vega is an extraordinary hero. He is centered by a strong moral code. The mark of Zorro, ""Z,"" is one of strength. So, to celebrate 95 years of the Zorro character, Dzxtinkt Originals has partnered with Grzegorz Domaradzki, Licensing Works and Zorro Productions Inc, to produce a set of limited edition posters for The Mask of Zorro.We have designed 3 officially licensed movie posters for The Mask of Zorro:All of the typography on the regular edition poster is custom designed and written in English. For the Variant edition poster and the Kickstarter Exclusive poster, all of the typography is written in Spanish.Grzegorz has spent a lot of hours designing these posters. He has paid very close attention to detail, making sure that every subtle nuance has been captured. All of the actor likenesses are accurately depicted and the poster composition is well-balanced. We have finished designing the posters, just in time for Cinco de Mayo.Cinco de Mayo 2014 (May 5th, 2014) is quickly approaching. It will be a day to commemorate Mexico's1862 victory over France at the Battle of Puebla during the Franco-Mexican War. The victory is a symbol of Mexico's resistance against French imperialism, so Cinco de Mayo is a day to celebrate Mexican culture and heritage. Johnston McCulley created Zorro to be a nobleman who returns to Spanish California in the 1820s. The Zorro character is a major part of pop culture. Heis a symbol of resistance and he is a beacon of hope. Supporting this project will be a great way to celebrate Cinco de Mayo.You can preorder the regular edition poster for $55, the variant edition poster for $65 or the Kickstarter exclusive edition for $100. The entire set is available for $220. All of the posters will be 24x36 inches, expertly screen printed and hand numbered.We have always wanted to create official artwork for Zorro. So, when the opportunity presented itself, we were speechless. Getting the chance to work on a poster for The Mask of Zorro is a dream come true for us because we love what the Zorro character stands for. Pulse Advertising designed the theatrical movie poster for The Mask or Zorro 16 years ago so its an honor to be creating an alternative movie poster for the same film that Pulse worked on. Since Zorro is such a pop culture icon that is known for serving the community we've decided to completely rely on the crowd source funding community. We want you to be directly involved in the process of creating this set of officially licensed movie posters for The Mask of Zorro (a fan favorite Zorro film) because we are fans too, and we care about the fan community. Doing this project through Kickstarter and receiving your support is a great way to celebrate Zorro while also honoring his deep appreciation for strong communities. We know that you encounter a ton of projects on Kickstarter so we want to thank you for taking the time to consider this project. Thank you for your support.Be distinct. Be Original. Contribute.© 2014 Zorro Productions, Inc., All Rights Reserved ZORRO™ ","We don't foresee any risks for this project or pledge rewards because this project is fully approved by the copyright owner of Zorro. The only challenge that could arise would be an unexpected delay with the screen printers, which would delay the expected date of delivery. If any delays or complications do occur, we will notify you."

But somehow lost the usb stick and with that all of it's contents, And as much as you can lose the odd thing from time to time, The contents on it and the memories were priceless to me.The fact it was lost was one thing, but the person who found it had access to all my private photos and videos , which was the most upsetting thing to deal with. So I set out to design and build my password protected usb memory drive.I have made the secure transfer usb a popup password so every time you use it you have to put in a password, this to me is far greater protection then encrypting a usb as you may forget to do so from time to time.Now please let me introduce you to the team.The whole project has been developed by a team of just four people. The first person I approached was Paval a electronic engineer from the Ukraine, His vast experience in this kind of project has beenimmeasurable with his ability to modify the normal usb, To one that allows any operating system to allow a front end password access.When getting a design I wanted to have a logo that stuck out from the usb device and was white with a simple logo on top. I allowed Jeet then with that information to design the size and shape of the secure transfer usb as he saw fit, after a couple of attempts I think he got the design just right and a usb that looks good.The programming of the password front end was difficult at first but Don was more than a match for what Pavel needed him to do, The insert usb and click on the drive did not put up the contents but the password front end, This could not be software based because it simply could not get past the constraints of the operating systems on each machine, so with Don and Pavel working together they put in extra hardware to lift operating system constraints.Insert secure transfer usb and this is what you will get, a single screen that his hardware enabled to lock any access to the usb making it impossible to get to files, All drives sent out will have a prefixed password and can be changed to any backers liking.The rewards for this project are simple 3 usb sizes 3 prices, When contacting manufacturers the consensus was I had to at least have a minimum of 200 units for manufacture or it was not worth there while.The team and I have made the secure transfer usb as compatible as possible with as many operating systems as we can, compatibility was the toughest task to master and our biggest development headache.I only have a few things left to say other then please back my kickstarter a lot of time and effort has gone into this, what I wanted to set out to do already I think I have accomplished this, for that extra bit of protection I think that the secure transfer usb is for you, thank you.The secure transfer usb will go along the bottom of the cardboard packaging, covering the bottom usb image, this will then be covered in a plastic cover as it's outerpackagingFor larger orders please message me and we can discuss a deal","This is a working prototype and is ready for manufacturing, I need £5000 because the manufacturer has at least 200 minimum build run, on funding they will send me a few test kits, on satisfaction of that the fully hand assembled run will take 2 weeks to complete, because of the small order size I can have them air freighted to the UK from China then sent out to backers."

Every location is a live leaderboard that ranks the top three most viewed videos. This allows athletes to compete year-round, cuts down costs for hosting extreme sports events in public/private facilities, and allows athletes to interact with one another. Imagine an event that is sponsored by a local store or brand at Venice Beach Skatepark (California). Athletes have one week to upload and wrack up as many views as possible in order to win. The athlete with the most views gains ""street credit"", shows off their talent, and feels a part of a community that encourages the sharing of creative content. Extreme sports athletes want to participate in as many competitions as possible, no matter what size.

We have been running competitions for various extreme sports and we are looking to expand to other interests. We have been working with well-known professional athletes in the extreme sports industry such as Jamie Bestwick, Ben Wallace, and Brandon Loupos. The great thing about this app is that you can make a competition out of anything. Just as long as you think you can beat your friends.Tourney will allow you and your friends to compete against each other in a group setting, no matter what the sport or subject is.Here's how it works:1. Someone creates a competition with a 10-second video challenge and invites their friends to join2. A lineup is created based on whoever joins3. When it's your turn, you must record a one-time video within our app (you have 12 hours to upload, if you don't you're skipped)4. After everyone has recorded and uploaded a video, there is a 24 hour period of voting from the participants and the viewers (your competition is live)5. Whoever gets the most votes at the end of the day is the new leader. The winner gets to upload a new 10-second video challenge (start the whole process over again).As we mentioned, we have been working with professional athletes in the extreme sports industry to develop a platform that fills all competitive needs. Our app is primarily used by people who are trying to connect with friends in virtual competitions from around the world.Our team is composed of two founders:Thaddeus Lorenz has a B.S. in IT and a Business Minor from the Pennsylvania State University. He is responsible for mobile design/development, customer discovery, and overall product vision.Jamie Bestwick is a Monster Energy BMX legend with 13 gold medals in the BMX Vert event at the X Games. He is also the British Olympic BMX coach and provides industry insight and knowledge.We will be working with Gaylene Nagel who worked for EA Sports and was the Head of Lifestyle Marketing. She has experience bringing products to market and ensuring a successful launch.","1. Developing an app requires patience and a flexible schedule2. We will make sure to stay in touch with our contributors about schedule changes.3. We already have the basics of the app developed.

The project so far has run on a strict timeline and has meet all of it's goals ahead of time to date.,https://www.kickstarter.com/projects/kyledavisgames/machi?ref=discovery_category_newest,kyledavisgames/machi,"Want to try the game before you commit to backing our project?We have made the Print and Play version of Matchi freely available on our website:We have officially hit our third stretch goal!What is Matchi?Matchi is a beautifully adorned, simple, 2 player game that is easy to learn, yet flexible in it's strategic options. It's engaging enough for serious players, or casual enough to enjoy while having a conversation with a friend. Not to mention, it's a superb way to pass the time during the current lock-down.The game is presented in a classic Moroccan style lending an air of timelessness to it. It's perfect for seasoned board game players and for new-comers alike. We especially like that it does not take up a lot of room on the table, so it makes a perfect coffee date companion.The game comes with 8 full colour hexagon tiles, 6 dice, 4 blue player markers, 4 gold player markers, an instruction booklet (with a thank you page for backers!) and a beautifully presented box that is sure to catch the eye.(Images are of the prototype. The final product will differ slightly)GoalThe goal of the game is to be the first player to get all four of their player markers into the center tile.Included in the boxThe game includes the following pieces:Setting up the BoardSimply place the (7-12) Hex Tile in on the table. Next, place the 6 (1-6) Hex Tiles around the (7-12) Hex Tile. For variety, mix up the orientation of these tiles each round.Now each play takes their 4 player pieces of their chosen colour.Determine who will go first, and that player starts with 3 dice.Place the remaining 3 dice onto the Dice Pad Hex Tile which is placed off to the side in easy reaching distance for both players.Playing a TurnA turn is always started by rolling 3 dice. You will get to use more dice as the game progresses, but we'll cover that further down in the instructions.These dice are used to perform actions. Once all the dice have been used, or the player decides not to perform any more actions, the turn is over, and the other player begins their turn.Available ActionsThere are 3 actions available in Matchi:Placing a Player Marker on the BoardA player can place their marker on to the board anywhere around the outside of the board. The player marker is placed on a numbered space that matches one of their dice, or matches the combined sum of more than one of their dice (must be exact number).Move a Player MarkerPlayer Markers can only be moved to adjacent numbered spaces.There are 2 movement methods available in Matchi; move TO a numbered space and move FROM a numbered space.To move TO a number space, a player will use the number on their die (or combined total of more than one dice) that matches the number on an adjacent space.To move FROM a number space, a player will use the number on their die (or combined total of more than one dice) that matches the numbered space they are currently on to move to any adjacent space.While a player can navigate the entire board using the TO movement method, there is one exception to using the FROM movement method. This is when a player wishes to move a player marker into the center (7-12) Hex Tile. The FROM method is not allowed in this instance and a player must use the higher number as indicated on the center tile spaces.It should be noted that movement within the center tile or from within the center tile to outside the center tile is not subject to the exception to the FROM rule (these pieces can move normally in these cases).Attacking a Player MarkerWhen an opponent's Player Marker is on an adjacent space to your marker, you can attack that Player Marker. This is accomplished by following the rules of movement, but the player must produce two sets of acceptable movements from the dice.These two sets of movements do not need to be identical, they just need to be individually valid movements. Think of it as one set to move and an additional set to attack.Keep in mind that the same exception rule to crossing into the center tile applies to attacking as well.Also keep in mind that the attacking value is not the combined value of doubling the numbered space, but rather two distinct sets of valid moves. For instance, if you are attacking a player marker on the number 9 space, the goal isn't to get a total of 18 on your dice, but rather two sets of 9.So 3 dice showing 6 each (which equals 18) is not a valid attack, while 4 dice (2 showing 6, and 2 showing 3) can be divided up to 2 equal sets of 9, is valid.Extra DiceFor every player marker your opponent has on the center tile at the beginning of your turn, you will get to roll an additional die, and vice versa.Winning the GameAs soon as a player successfully moves their fourth player marker into the center tile, the game ends immediately and that player is declared the winner.By making a pledge, you will receive a copy of the game as well as be listed in the Thank You page in the instruction booklet. We are making this game because we truly believe you will enjoy it. It was made with a lot of love and we want nothing more than to share that with you.I'd like to personally thank you in advance for being a part of making this board game come to life!","Risks are genrally around the production of the game itself and coordinating with the production company to ensure the bill of materials remains within the budget. We don't want to comprimise on quality yet we also are working towards keeping it a fair price. We have vetted several companies and believe we have found the right partner to produce our game that meets our quality standards.One small hurdle we have overcome is an issue with the name of the game. While registering the game with boardgamegeek.com I discovered someone enjoyed the name ""Machi"" as much as I do. So I made the decision to update the name slightly to make it unique. And so ""Matchi"" is born. I believe we have a solid game with distinct artwork and have priced it fair and reasonably to ensure it's a quality product you will be able to enjoy for years to come. Having said that, I have always been very receptive to feedback and want to make sure we make something people are excited about, and if someone out there has feedback about how we can do things better, I will always listen."
https://www.kickstarter.com/projects/sullywrites/animal-a-webcomic?ref=discovery_category_newest,sullywrites/animal-a-webcomic,"Animal is a story that I'd like to share with the world as a webcomic, but I'm going to need your help to do it.If I'm being honest, it's an old story, almost cliche. But it's a story that I feel has facets that have not been explored fully. ""An innocent bystander with a difficult life is suddenly granted power beyond anything that they could have imagined!"" It's been done a million times. You've heard it, read it, and watched it on TV. Of course, Animal's ""innocent bystander"" is a dog. My goal when writing animal was to take a realistic approach to this scenario. Several of the major publishers have tried empowered animals, but I wanted to take it from a different angle. What happens when something that humanity has defined for years as an ""inferior"" creature to ourselves begins to grow beyond the box that has been defined for it?Specifically, this Kickstarter will cover the first thirty strips of the comic, the first arc or volume. This will be the introduction and will serve as the basis for the continuing story. With this arc, you will meet all the major characters and get a feel for their motivations.Animal will be illustrated as a comic strip by Artiom Zhukoff. It will be drawn entirely in black and white (With the exception of a color cover included with the hard copy) with Artiom's detail-heavy style. The realism and the heavy shadows of the art will, with any luck, add to the serious tone of the work. Lettering will be done by myself by hand. The timeline for Animal is simple. If completely funded, the website that will host the comic, as well as the first strip and the ""thank you"" page, will be up within one month. Following that, new comic strips will be posted weekly for no less than thirty weeks. This is the duration of the webcomic that the crowdfunding will cover. With any luck, we will be self-sufficient by then, and will experience no hiccup before the posting of the thirty-first strip. At that time, when that initial run is finished, backer rewards will go out, as the majority of them require the story to be complete! Get a better idea of what kind of rewards are available by checking them out on the side of the page, and see what might interest you. Additionally, below you can see a preview of the two shirts we're offering! When you select your size, you will select which style you prefer; hero or villain! Now, these are just mockups, so very minor changes might occur between now and when they are shipped, but nothing major will change on them. Animal was written by myself as my first foray into scripting comics. I've since worked on several more scripts, but this one holds a special place in my heart. I've never published a comic before. I've never published any of my writing (I've never even had the nerve to try). This will be a first for me on many levels... Be gentle.I am an Engineer from Mississippi by day, but I'm also a major comic book fan and have been reviewing titles for Comic Crusaders (Check out their website!) for several months now. My interest in writing comics came from the realization that not all of my stories could be told in prose. On any given weeknight (when I should be sleeping) I can be found scribbling ideas down into my notebook.My page as an author can be found here: https://www.facebook.com/SullyWrites?ref=aymt_homepage_panelAnd my Twitter account can be found here: https://twitter.com/Sully_WritesThe art for Animal will be coming to you all the way from Russia. A man by the name of Artiom ""Artey"" Zhukoff will be lending his considerable talents to the project in order to bring my clumsy words to life on the page. Below, you can find the bio he prepared for this project. ""Im drawing for 5 years. I was learning drawing skills in the private studio of famous sculptor Micheal Mlokhotskiy, The Strogonov Academy, in private studio of Andrew Fedorovitch, Moscow Architect Institute where we draw nude model.Now I live in Smolensk and have my personal studio where I teach students drawing skills.In 2013 we found Moscow Art Studio, where I did video tutorials about comics and drawing materials and found pro digital artists from game design industry to give us lectures and master classes.My goal is bringing the art in peoples live, to help them decide what they want in their live, become the mentor for my students and help them found happiness as being artists.My goal in comics is to become as skilled as in pencils and inks as in digital way, make more connections with American writers and help them realize their dreams.My dream is visit Comicon.""Artey's artist page can be found here: https://www.facebook.com/ZhukoffArtey?fref=tsAnd his Twitter account can be found here: https://twitter.com/Redde67Moscow Art Studio's Facebook page: https://www.facebook.com/MoskovskaaStudiaRisunkaYour donations will be critical in helping ANIMAL to become a reality! At the moment, ANIMAL is a well formed idea, but it is still only that. The script is finalized. The concept art exists. But it needs the generous donations of you, the backer, to take shape and be enjoyed by anyone interested. The contributions will ensure that:    The first thirty strips of the webcomic can be illustrated by Artiom,    The cover for the hardcopy can be professionally colored,    The website to host the comic can be created and maintained,    And the costs of the backer rewards can be covered! The price that has been set, $2,750 dollars is designed to cover these things. Any over-funding will be put into having more print copies of ANIMAL produced for sale through the website or at conventions, hosting the website for a longer period of time, or future comic projects. I will not be taking any of the money raised for a “writer’s fee” or anything crazy like that. I am being rewarded enough just by being able to tell my story. A more comprehensive cost breakdown can be seen here, explaining how much of the funding goes into each category, roughly, by my estimates. The most variable of the categories is obviously the backer rewards. While the cost of each individual item has been taken into consideration and I have received quotes for all of them, the profit margin does vary slightly from reward to reward. In order to avoid potential pitfalls, this project’s budget was formulated considering the least cost effective reward. The values seen below are rounded off (because nice, round numbers make me happy), but give a good idea of the portions of the project and their budget requirements.","Considering that the portion of the story that is being funded and promised for delivery is fully written and the illustration will be carried out by a full-time artist, risks for failure are minimal. Delays may be caused by a number of reasons, but for each potential pitfall I have been able to foresee, I have tried to come up with a contingency plan. Website: The most likely reason for delay could come from the creation of the website. I'm going to be honest and tell you I have little experience in this area, so it could cause problems when setting things up in the first month. However, I have contacts who have created and managed websites in the past so solutions should only be a phone-call or a Skype message away. Art: In the extremely unlikely event that that the project finds itself without an artist for whatever extenuating reason, a replacement will be found ASAP. Rewards: Physical rewards could experience a delay in delivery due to production times, shipping complications, or potentially due to myself traveling with my primary job. However these should be minimal at their worst and I will do everything possible to have the rewards prepared for delivery long before the perspective delivery date.",https://www.kickstarter.com/projects/sullywrites/odie-2-with-extra-feature?ref=discovery_category_newest,sullywrites/odie-2-with-extra-feature,"Odie is an aging corgi with a flare for the dramatic narrative. In issue #1, we saw him lost far from home. Armed with only his bravery and his cunning, he faced challenges familiar to anyone who has ever read through Homer’s Odyssey.In issue #2, Odie has been reunited with the family that he loves, and is embarking on their annual lake-side vacation. Unfortunately for Odie, that also means Kujo, his newly adopted brother, will be coming along for the ride. Odie will have to cope with his jealousy over being forced to share the family with another dog and work together with some strange new friends in order to track down a legendary prey. Essentially, Odie is a foil for re-imagining classic literature in a new and fun light! This first story of Issue #2 will deal with Odie's relationship to Kujo while mirroring the tale of Herman Melville's Moby Dick. As a bonus, there's a short story highlighting Odie's deteriorating mind while homaging Kafka's Metamorphosis. The comic is twenty-four full color pages by our talented artists, and features a thank-you page for all of the Kickstarter contributors in the back.Digital and physical editions of Odie #1 and Odie #2 will be available as part of this campaign. These comics are staple-bound, and printed in a gorgeous, high-quality gloss by Ka-Blam. In addition to the standard cover, this comic is also available in a limited edition variant cover printed on blue paper, with a foundation of white ink used to create a contrast between glossy and matte elements. This cover will be exclusive to the Kickstarter campaign, so don't miss your chance to snag one!  Just like last time, Elli will be taking requests for the sketch cover edition of the comic! If you select this reward tier, be sure to let us know what sort of illustration you'd like. Here are a few of the covers that she did for Odie #1:If you didn't have the chance to get one of our 5"" x7"" Odie sticker sheets in the last Kickstarter, they're back, featuring four glossy indoor stickers of everyone's favorite pup. In addition to that, we'll have four unique 1"" button designs available in a set!Elli and Mikael have whipped up a fantastic 11""x17"" art print of the entire cast of issue #2, decked out in some pirate garb. And last but not least, if you want to see yourself thrust into this world and drawn by our wonderful artists, you can make a cameo! You, or a character that you own, will be seen lounging on the shoreline in at least one panel. Of course, we do ask that you be reasonable with the appearance of yourself or your character, and we retain the right to refuse things that wouldn't fit within the setting.

With that comic, we all learned a lot, and have taken steps to stay ahead of the proverbial curve with deadlines and dollar amounts.

Even if they stopped making new movies right now, you could spend the rest of your life streaming movies and never get through them all.We could call it an embarrassment of riches, but that would be a lie: the vast majority of movies that you can watch over the Internet are utter crap. (Just like the vast majority of all movies available to watch in any medium.) And sometimes -- very very rarely, but sometimes -- stuff that looks like crap is actually worth your time and money.I am here to help. Every week, I highlight the best new films available to stream in both the US and the UK. You can see those recommendations at FlickFilosopher.com-- they're just part of what I do as a film critic with 17 years experience on the Web (and in print). But I can't keep up these weekly recommendations without your support.I don't want to have to stop making these recommendations... and I'd love to be able to cover more smaller, under-the-radar films that you might not learn about otherwise. (Because if you dig through the crap, there's something interesting stuff happening in the VOD area, movies that will never get to a multiplex near you but can be on a smaller screen in your own home... if only you know about them.)

If I haven't gotten discouraged already by the lack of female representation onscreen, I probably won't now. But there's always a small chance that quantifying and grading films will get me so depressed that I cannot continue. But I suspect it will only make me angrier and more determined.My hand might cramp up while I'm writing thank-you postcards, but I can soldier through that.Basically, I do not anticipate any significant (or even insignificant) obstacles during the course of this project. But I have always been directly accessible and responsive to my readers, and that will not change.

Funding for this project will cover the expenses of mixing, mastering, and duplication. It will also cover recording the last song on the CD, ""Safe Home"", written by myself and Bruce Foley. Mixing is digitally assigning levels to all of the musical instruments on a recording so that the end result is balanced and pleasant to hear. Mastering is taking the mixed recording and creating a master recording. Every CD made will be recorded from this master. Once this is done, some artwork is necessary to arrange the pictures for the CD in a nice order. The pictures are done, thanks to master photographer Pat Crowe. Finally, the CDs will be duplicated, shrink wrapped, and a UPC code printed for easy sales by companies like Amazon.com and CDBaby.comThe work thus far includes countless hours by the Emmy award winning recording engineer, Jamie Peck from Wheeling, West Virginia.

Looking forward to receiving our bells and having fun following Preschool Prodigies with our favorite music teacher!""-The Youngers""Watching someone work in their area of giftedness is a joyful experience, and watching Rob Young work with children – whether online or in school assemblies or in private lessons – produces this kind of joy. Our children are learning from Mr. Rob not only pitch and rhythm and coordination but also how much musicality brings joy and discipline and camaraderie.Rob Young is exactly the kind of music teacher that parents dream their kids will have: he is an extremely talented musician (of many instruments!) and a clearly experienced teacher who has a heart and special gift for working with kids. Best of all, his joy for making music is contagious – trust us!"" - The Bieler familyWilmington, DEHi ! Mr. Rob here...Here at Preschool Prodigies, I believe that that every child should have the oppurtunity to get a powerful and affordable musical education.That's why I created our podcast and our website; to provide children with a place to learn the fundamentals of music.Much like how websites like Starfall have changed how children learn to read, Preschool Prodigies is where any child can get the best kind of early music education: meaningful exposure to individual notes. From the animations to the acting, to the backing music and the editing, I created Preschool Prodigies to bring a powerful, effective and fun music education to children everywhere.Currently, Preschool Prodigies is a website and a podcast.This project will launch PSP into a small publishing company that produces books and videos designed to make preschool music and perfect pitch education easy, fun and affordable.I will continue to release podcast episodes throughout this release and beyond. The goal here isn't to replace our podcast, but rather to create a well sequenced and printed version of our materials for preschool classrooms and low-tech families.Perfect pitch is a powerful range of musical abilities that is invaluable to a musician (being able to identify a note without any reference, being able to sing a memorized pitch, etc).It is a skill attributed to the best composers and musicians and for a long time, was thought to be a gift of nature.Methods from the last 30 years have debunked that and shown that it is indeed a learnable skill.Though I knew it was a learnable skill, it was when I came across research about how children learn perfect pitch, that I wasinspired to create these videos and books.The research shows how children who speak tonal languages (such as Mandarin Chinese) have a much higher sense of perfect pitch than children who speak non tone languages (like English).It makes sense that growing up in a house where pitch is used in daily communication, that you would develop a good sense of pitch.What the study showed me that I did not know was that piano lessons, even at the age of five, were too little too late when it comes to developing perfect pitch (at least in most cases)!The training started too late and furthermore, focused on playing the piano, not solely on developing one's sense of pitch.The study also showed just how powerful MEANINGFUL EXPOSURE TO INDIVIDUAL PITCHis for developing perfect pitch. Indeed, this is an idea that shows up in other Perfect Pitch training programs.All of this got me thinking...All we need is a fun and easy to follow system for giving English speaking kids MEANINGFUL EXPOSURE TO PITCH, and we could increase the rate of perfect pitch by leaps and bounds!I researched other methods for teaching perfect pitch and over the last five years, I began adapting the ideas and lessons to make them colorful, modern, and TV-show-esque to make it both fun and easy for families to use.I also made sure to stick to the Chromanotes system, which is popular in music classrooms all across the world.Finally, the system had to be easy enough that a child could do it WITHOUT a musically trained teacher or parent. While there is still some parent involvement in PSP, it's not intensive, needed 100 percent of the time, or confusing to any non-musician.In both my private lessons and preschool music classes, I tested and tried all of these methods and ideas. All my students favorite lessons, games, songs and ideas have come together to make Preschool Prodigies.I have a ton of content already available at www.PreschoolProdigies.net if you'd like to check it out and get a feel for our lessons.For a full description of why I am raising money and what it's intended for, please click here!The short of it is...$8,500 for printing 1,000 copies of the PSP Lesson Book (120 pages of colorful stories that focus on the musical bells we reccomend as your childs first instrument)$3,000 in writing and production costs: (Film, edit and animate 120 minutes of music lessons, finish writing the six main story books, building interactive PDF's, buy a new microphone)$1,000 to print the audio CDs that accompany the books$1,000 to print the DVDs the will contain the 120 minutes of animated music lessons (6 20 minute lessons)That's the short of it.Definitelyvisit the Kickstarter Page on our websiteto get a better sense of the details as well to see what I've done so far to build preschool prodigies.It is my hope to be as transparent and clear with my goals and intentions in asking everyone to support my Kickstarter.For me, music has unlocked the habits of learning and self-impovement that I use to navigate life on a daily basis. It's my hope to provide not only a new and powerful kind of music education via Preschool Prodigies, but to help kids everywhere unlock the patterns of learning that music reveals.Thank you so much for choosing to support my project! I promise to be in touch with updates, bonuses, reach goals, and some new rewards soon!","When I really got the ball rolling on Preschool Prodigies 9 months ago, there were a lot challenges and problems that I needed to overcome (mostly technical, some changes to the pacing and formats of the videos, problems with inconsistent lighting, animations, I didn't know anything about acting, etc).I held off on launching this project and focused on our video podcast episodes while I worked out the kinks of production.Almost a year later, I am confident that my abilities to produce our content are both sufficient and still growing. Every element of PSP, from the website to the videos to the animations to the music is produced by me, Mr. Rob!My biggest hold up has been the amount of time and money I've already put into PSP, which is why I'm on Kickstarter. If people like this idea, then I will happily devote even more time and energy to create the 120 minutes of lessons I have mapped out, as well as all of the companion story books and interactive PDFs.So far, I've done almost everything on my own (my good friend and potential production assistant helped me with the pilot!) and it has been both a rewarding and exhausting project (which I have a feeling it will continue to be :-) ).I've already printed flyers to promote the Kickstarter and I've been promoting this Kickstarter campaign via my Podcast which is in iTunes ""New & Noteworthy"" for both Video Podcasts and Kids & Family.I look forward to any of the challenges that come my way via Preschool Prodigies because I really want to see the whole series come to life and bring perfect pitch education to kids everywhere!For me, music has unlocked the habits of learning and self-impovement that I use to navigate life on a daily basis and it's my hope to provide not only a new and powerful kind of music education, but to help kids everywhere unlock the patterns of learning that music reveals.",https://www.kickstarter.com/projects/psprodigies/preschool-prodigies-early-childhood-music-reimagin?ref=discovery_category_newest,psprodigies/preschool-prodigies-early-childhood-music-reimagin,"Final Day of Free Sheet Music!Why Kickstarter?This Kickstarter is going to help our homegrown music curriculum company pre-sell (and therefore fund) a high-quality brand of deskbells for use with our program!The funding of our own brand of instrument will also help us ship international with greater ease!! It's hard to find these kinds of bells outside of the US, and we're hoping to fix that!AND to top it all off, we're developing a digital version of the bells to accompany the real-life version (i.e. an app for iOS and Android), so that you can take your instrument on the go with you, or opt for a digital-only alternative.Check out our rewards and please consider sharing and/or backing our campaign!- Rob, Sam and Jeff (the PsP Team)Preschool Prodigies is a music curriculum for young kids! We combine colorful videos colorful bells to create accessible and fun music lessons!Check out the our first lesson, Hello C below!We're a self-funded company, and hosting this Kickstarter in an attempt to make 3 fast and high impact changes here at Preschool Prodigies. They are...Budget: $4,000(we have another $4,500 already set aside for this for what's going to be an $8,500 order)They will ensure high quality instruments, a large stock (which has been hard to lock down), and give us the chance to....Budget: $500/monthThis is kind of a byproduct of #1, in that having our own product means we can store and ship enough volume to keep this as an option through our warehouse.Without that product and system in place, International shipping is very difficult right now, for us processing the orders AND for customers trying to track and receive their orders. Reaching our goal would allow us to optimize international shipping via super slick integration between our online store and a dropship facility in California.This will expedite orders, keep international fulfillment open, and also free up our super small team to make more videos, provide more customers support and deal less with shipping and tracking issues.And an in an effort to provide an affordable bell alternative (with no shipping costs at all), this Kickstarter will also help us...Budget: $1,000That way we'll have a $2 bell alternative for anyone looking for a quick, consistent and digital solution! We have all kinds of cool design plans for a PsP app, but v1.0 will be a simple and sweet set of digital bells!1. Allow us to keep bell prices low, ship quickly and ship reliably. Right now we're sourcing from too many different places, trying to keep up on bell stock, and trying to adjust to crazy inflation and people competing on Amazon.2. Allow us to ship internationally to schools and families alike!So if you live in South Africa, Australia or China, you can simply place an order in our shop and your package will be on it's way to you with priority international tracking information! 3. By having a digital version for iOS and Android, we can introduce a consistent and affordable bell alternative that will coordinate with thecolors and graphics from our curriculum.With PsP Melodies, even if you don't have your instrument with you, you'll have plenty of free music lessons to take on the go via YouTube. Your kids will be singing and hand-signing in no time!Continuing to make free content will be A LOT easier once we offload the shipping process. We are SO CLOSE and we're hoping this Kickstarter will help give us the final push.Our small family-funded company recently invested heavily in a set of bells from China. They look good, but they don't sound very good :-/Some of the mechanisms are broken too... not cool!!Therefore, we're recalling almost all of them and donating a lot of the functioning ones to a school with no music program at all. We'll also give them access to the digital curriculum, for free.But to get back into the international bell-shipping game, we need to order 300 bells outright, which is essentially why we are here!We're not quite there though, so we thought that maybe we could fundthe final piece of the PsP 2016 Pie, byoffering some unique Kickstarter-only rewards.There will also be some PsP Shop prizes (like books and instruments and digital access) but the majority of the awards (like personalized videos and songs) are unique for the Kickstarter!Have a question or idea? Let us know! We tried to keep it short and sweet and not bore anyone, but we're happy to dive in on the deets with anyone who is genuinely confused, interested or curious! Email us at Mr.Rob@preschoolprodigies.com.","We made a mistake this summer by ordering bells from a manufacturer we hadn't previously worked with.Therefore, we are teaming up with our partners in chime at Rhythm Band Instruments to get high quality PsP Bells (that we can ship internationally) for 2017!!!"

Our sneakers are also made of long lasting anti-odour materials.Also...They are a shoe for every occasion. We believe that exterior styling should have a classic minimal design; this includes reducing over branding. As such our shoes can be worn in casual everyday settings like going to the shops, fishing on a boat, or kicking it with your G’s. BUT – they can also be worn for more special occasions such as going to the opera, presenting at a TED conference, or proposing to your loved one. We’ve got your back... or your feet to be more specific.The following sections outline our sneaker line and it's core functions...Finally a good use for Corduroy material! This style incorporates all the Klide Footwear benefits but also embodies a classic style that allows you to wear it in any situation, whether formal or informal.A sneaker that throws back to the timeless style of Fred Astaire and The Rat Pack. A true high cut sneaker that has the added Klide benefit of being slip-on.Sick of lacing up? How do we solve this? Our custom stretch-lacing technology expands to the size of your feet and ensures each pair is easy to put on, and fits to the form of your feet! Klide sneakers are held together by the power of greyskull (he-man strength 12mm stretch lacing). Our lacing method makes each shoe feel great, fit perfectly, and eliminates the time spent pulling on shoes, and lacing them up.Our special blended Merino Wool Insoles have antimicrobial properties which prevent the forming of odour causing bacteria. They basically absorb your stinky feet sweats, and naturally release the odour as they dry overnight. Our insoles are chosen specifically for use in this way, and are a calculated thickness to provide comfort for the life of the shoe. (It also means that socks are optional). The quality of each shoe is individually inspected, to ensure that it meets our high standard test: would we wear it? If it passes the test it receives our personalized brushed metal quality control pin. Unfortunately at this stage we are only making the following sizes for the purpose of this campaign. We will be looking at expanding outside of these constraints further down the track, including half sizes.Here's a video on how to measure your foot (It's an oldie but a goodie).During our development we spoke to a lot of people about our ideas, and took our time really trying to get inside the minds of our audience. Here are a couple of the things we found out...WHO DO YOU KNOW WITH STINKY FEET?WHAT WOULD YOU CHANGE ON SNEAKERS?If you're on the KLIDEFW BANDWAGON, then please help us increase our chances for success and share us around to your friends and family.","Sizing discrepancies may occur for international pledges, please see the attached sizing chart and pay attention to the measurement of your sizes in inches.Delays in manufacturing are always a risk, in order to offset this risk we will be overseeing the manufacturing process personally and have built this into our costs.We are confident that our distribution channels will operate as expected come time for shipping, however we have identified a number of alternate methods in case our preferred one has unexpected issues.",https://www.kickstarter.com/projects/klidefw/slip-on-sneakers-for-the-fashion-conscious-real-ma?ref=discovery_category_newest,klidefw/slip-on-sneakers-for-the-fashion-conscious-real-ma,"With our latest negotiations between us and our manufacturer going well, we are now able to release this awesome pair. Well need to get as close to $6,500 to do it but were going for it!Again, these beautiful sneakers are composed of luxury leather, laces that stretch, pressure padded insoles... but also add lavish suede.Lacing up your shoes sucks right? The problem is, laces make shoes look cool.Well what if there was a shoe that was the best of both worlds? A slip-on sneaker with laces that you never had to touch. A shoe that took less then 3 seconds to put on.What if those sneakers happened to also be a high end designer shoe, made from premium materials but without the hefty price tag?KLIDE | NEO 1.0 The first in an exclusive line, that features uncompromising quality, well thought out functional design, and beautiful aesthetics.We challenge you to try the most comfortable, and convenient high end shoes in the world. At these prices, you would be stupid to miss out!Luxury leather, form fitting neoprene, laces that mold to your feet, pressure padded insoles.A convenient, comfortable, high quality shoe.The first release in a exclusively limited collection. Each Neo is classically styled using the best quality materials, with the intent that it can be worn across multiple styles of clothing, in a variety of situations, and places.We wanted to make a shoe that was hot, but that also improved upon the wearable experience. We knew in order to accomplish this, we would have to look at sneaker design from a function and technology standpoint as well as an aesthetic one.What we have now, is something that perfectly fuses high end style, with new age technology.We need your help placing our first bulk order to launch our product from inception to reality. Please see our website for our wider collection.Sick of lacing up? So are we. Problem is, the current offering of slip-on shoes are a bit adolescent looking for burly men like us. On top of that, slip on shoes can sometimes be too tight or lose, depending on the ratio of heel size to upper.How do we solve this?Our custom stretch-lacing technology means you get slip-on convenience without losing the lace look. Essentially a special blend of lacing material with a high elasticity complex.The difference between our technology and existing slip-on methods, is that our laces literally expand to fit your feet and are therefore a whole lot more comfortable. In addition to this, the neoprene material we use on the vamp also has room to give if needed.We decided to use neoprene material because of its astounding natural benefits. But just to be completely clear:1. It forms to you. The high elasticity and flexibility of the fabric allows it to mold to your feet for the perfect fit -- just like a wetsuit does! You'll always have the perfect fit and you'll never have to worry about the material sagging or stretching out over time.2. Its soft & comfortable.Clothing items made from neoprene are as soft as the skin of a seal, which make them beyond comfortable to wear. It can be described as a cushioning fabric. Try it out and see if you can tell the difference!3. It self repairs. Sort of.Neoprene is extremely durable and able to withstand vigorous activities. It is also less likely to fade, and extremely difficult to crease. This means, that when you are wearing it, it may flex, twist, and fold, however as soon as you take it off, it will go back to its original shape on its own! handy if your an avid shoe fan, this is generally one of the pet peeves of shoe collectors.4. Its water & weather resistant. Neoprene is used as a waterproof material in many other industries. It is also very resistant to solvents. whilst the shoes them selves are not completely watertight, a bit of weather wont be a problem.5. Its different.We looked at a range of materials. We liked this one, and so it was just a matter of figuring out how to make it work! Its a very unique thing to use on a shoe, but we've fallen in love with it.Would we wear it?The quality of each shoe is individually inspected, to ensure that it meets our high standard test: would we wear it? If it passes the test it receives our personalized brushed metal quality control pin.We just want to make the world better...We are well aware of the great opportunities afforded us, and understand that not everyone in the world has the same opportunities.Our solution. Turn what we have into a revolutionary social enterprise, and share the profit around.

FloSmartis an electronic smart device that you attach to any common air filter. FloSmart is outfitted with a CPU and sensors that monitor air flow as your filter clogs - and lets you know when your filter's life is over.Blowing through a straw simulates the increased air flow that occurs through the air chamber as your air filter becomes clogged. Sensors measure the distance traveled by this flap until it reaches the DANGER ZONE triggering alerts to your phone. WASN'T THAT EASY?Buy a Flosmart and get a Return on Investment of 300% to 900%every year! When your air filter is clogged, your HVAC system is working harder and more energy is being used. And when it requires more energy to make your heating and air conditioning to work, it causes your energy bill to skyrocket. The Department of Energy says the average household spends about $2,200 a year on its energy bill. When you consistently change your air filter, you can save from 5 to 15 percent on your utility costs ($110 to $330 a year in average home energy bill savings).We are excited to bring FloSmart to the Kickstarter community first!Here are five benefits of replacing your air filter at the right time:1. Extend the life of your HVAC unit.2. Keep your heating & cooling costs down.3. Maintain healthy air quality4. Keep your heating & cooling system clean.5. A clean peace of mind. Replacing your filter is an easy, inexpensive step to take to save money, extend the life of your system and improve your indoor air quality. It also decreases the amount of energy your family uses.The fact is most people’s indoor air quality is not good, but it could be.Think about it, how often do you remember to change your air filter, once every six months, once a year!Neglecting your air filters can cause serious respiratoryproblems for yourfamily.Airborne pollutants, mold spores, bacteria, pollen, and pet dander. All accumulate to create indoor pollution.Often 5x WORSEthan your outdoor air!This is particularly important if anyone in your family suffers from allergies or asthma. Dirty air filters worsen the air quality and can exacerbate symptoms. If you have pets, it's even more important because pet dander will accumulate in the system and then spread allergens throughout the household. It's an easy fix to replace your filter and prevent air quality from deteriorating.The most common reason a heating and air conditioning system breaks down is because of a dirty filter. As dirt accumulates, air can't pass, or worse, the system overheats. The motor then has to work harder. In a best-case scenario, your unit will need to be repaired. In the worst case, if your unit is older, not replacing filters could put it over the edge and require you to buy a new one. Replacing the filter is an easy way to lengthen the life of your heating and cooling system.Shipped Right To Your Door!With FloSmart, whether you're at home or across the country, you will receive a text alert when it is time to change your filter, use the buy now link to order yourfilter right to your doorstep!Alerts will show:The FloSmart comes with 3 long lasting AAA batteries that will last up to a year. When the batteries are low an indicator will send you an alert when it's time to change.Watch Founder Kent testing a FloSmart prototype #2.Test results show that the FloSmart effectively monitors your filter's life!We've self-funded the development process for FloSmart to this point and we now have working, functioning prototypes that we've been able to both test and improve.Currently,we are in our 3rd stage of prototyping and 2nd phase of testing with actual working and functioning prototypes.We now need backers to help us push the product into production, pay for plastic molding for housing, and for the first mass production run.

Your efforts will help us secure a permanent space, the subsequent build-out and to purchase much needed equipment. I thank you from the bottom of my heart, for all of your love and support.Tradition. Growing up in South Bend, Indiana,I never really thought thatmy family had many traditions. Although I knewmy dad was of Polish decent andmy mom German,we didn’t do a lot of things that were nationality specific. One thingwe did do however, was eat real Polish Sausage. Always a staple at weddings and parties, it was simply something you just thought everyone had. Most people believe Polish Sausage is red and can be found at any grocery store. They may know it as Kielbasa, which actually means sausage in Polish. But this is not REAL Polish Sausage. Real Polish Sausage is not red! Real Polish Sausage has a grey tint to it and explodes with flavor. Real Polish Sausage CANNOT be purchased in central Indiana. Armed with decades old recipes and a love for cooking, Son of a Booshie plans to fill this void by openinga restaurant in Indianapolis. We will serve not only the highly sought after South Bend Polish Sausage, but many more of Booshie’s one-of-a-kind dishes that are impossible to find for miles such as, Pierogi, Hungarian Goulash, and German Potato Salad.  My experience cooking began when I was in college. This is whenI was first separated frommy mom’s home cooking.I lived off campus and for the first time had to fend for himself for breakfast, lunch and dinner.I started asking her mom for her recipes. The first thing that I ever made of hers was Cheesy Potato Soup with Dumplings. Although it wasn’t quite hers, it still turned out amazing. Fast forward a little to January of 1996. This is an important date in our little story as this is whenI moved to Indianapolis. This is key becauseI was unable to purchase Polish Sausage – REAL Polish Sausage, anywhere in Indy. Unbeknownst tome at the time, this is where it all started. There was nothing like it then, and there is nothing like it now. Growing up, the only Polish words I spoke were Booshah and Jahjah which meant grandma and grandpa. I always thought that whenI had kids, this is what they would call my mom and dad.  Well somewhere along the way, the ahh became eee.  Hence,my children called them Booshie and Jahjie.I feel that it is only fitting to name the company after the lady who taughtme to not only cook, but cook well.  ","The biggest risk we face is not opening soon enough.

This will not only be the most ambitious Maxxxwell Carlisle album, but also the most expensive! The concept album nature of this project (each song leading seamlessly into the next) requires extreme attention to detail and an unusually lengthy mixing process. There are no short-cuts when it comes to crafting an epic metal album!We are trying to raise $8,500 for the production of this album! This is a relative bargain in the world of music production. If/when we reach that goal we will shoot for a stretch goal that will provide the additional funding for a music video! With your help we can produce this album to it's full metal potential! Join us today! ","There are always challenges when recording and producing an album, however everyone directly involved in this project is experienced and passionate about their responsibilities. The largest risk is of course that this album will not be funded and the world will miss out on an amazing album and you will miss out on these potentially life changing rewards!",https://www.kickstarter.com/projects/732520546/raptor-command-a-heavy-metal-tribute-to-elon-musk?ref=discovery_category_newest,732520546/raptor-command-a-heavy-metal-tribute-to-elon-musk,"Our mission is to raise awareness of and promote Elon Musk’s futurist ideas and visions for the future of humanity through the medium of heavy metal music and subculture. The band is comprised of seasoned metal musicians who share a passion for technological advancement and Musk’s tireless efforts to push mankind into a bright, triumphant future.The purpose of this campaign is to provide funding for the finishing touches and manufacturing costs of our debut album Elon. Beyond that, we have developed a plan of ambitious stretch goals which will help carry our message and Elon's concepts and goals to all of humanity and beyond. These plans culminate in the development and launch of RAPTOR SAT-1, a CubeSat which will transmit our music and message all around the Earth and the universe!Thanks to the great response to our debut single and lyric video ""Elon: Champion For Humanity"", we know that there is massive public support for the work that Elon Musk is doing in his various outlets like SpaceX, Tesla Motors, Solar City, OpenAI, Neuralink, and Hyperloop. All of the songs on our upcoming album are inspired by Elon or these projects in some way. This is not just a concept album. The entire existence of Raptor Command is predicated upon the positive effect on humanity that Elon Musk's efforts will have. Our latest music video ""Fusion Reactor (In The Sky)"", is another loud and proud salute to the concepts that Elon is pursuing. With your support, we will be able to introduce millions of people to the concepts of sustainable, clean energy; making humanity a multi-planet species; a society that peacefully co-exists with an artificial super-intelligence, and an inspiring, adventurous future that everyone can look forward to.Basic Album Funding: (finishing touches and manufacturing of physical products) - $5,000Vinyl Bonus Goal: Everyone who pledges at the $150 Hyper Pack level and above will receive the Elon album on vinyl! - $15,0001st Level Stretch Goal: Burying a time-capsule filled with ambitions and goals for humanity, Raptor Command's music and videos, and predictions for the future. This will also include a PR campaign for sourcing public input and raising awareness of the capsule and overall project. - $50,0002nd Level Stretch Goal: Beaming a message to the TRAPPIST-1 solar system via the massive RT-70 radar transmitter in Yevpatoria. This level of funding will cover the use of the transmitter and the necessary encoding of the message. We will send a message including Elon themed concepts for the future of humanity, Raptor Command's music, and the names of those who made this feat possible. - $150,0003rd Level Stretch Goal: Development of the RAPTOR SAT-1 CubeSat, to be included as a secondary payload on a to-be-determined launch. The CubeSat will transmit Raptor Command's music, select quotes and excerpts from Elon's speeches, satellite telemetry, and the names of those who made the satellite possible. It will also take pictures with an on-board camera and transmit them via the Slow Scan TV format. Both the SSTV images and audio transmission will be receivable by anyone with basic, inexpensive, amateur radio equipment. We will also host a continuous, live audio stream from the satellite on our website. This funding level will cover the costs of design, prototyping, testing, and final manufacturing of the satellite, plus ground support equipment and development. - $250,000We want to stress that we do not work for any of Elon Musk's companies and we have no official connection with him or anyone representing him. We are simply a group of musicians who see the obvious benefits that humanity can reap from embracing the concepts of sustainable, clean energy, coexistence with artificial super-intelligence, and a future in which humanity is out exploring the stars and helping to insure the survival of our species. By funding this project, you will help insure that we can continue to operate independently (without any meddling from corporate interests or record labels), and in the best interests of humanity.","Regarding the manufacturing and release of our debut album 'Elon', most of the writing and recording has already been finished. Our basic funding level is simply to tie up loose ends in the mixing and mastering and the manufacturing of the physical product. We have full confidence that the album can be completed with our basic goal of $5,000. There are however, more risks and challenges associated with our stretch goals, particularly the Raptor Sat-1 project. Being based on the popular CubeSat format, the manufacturing of the satellite will be relatively straight forward, once the design is finalized. Even after the completed manufacturing of the satellite, there is still the remote possibility of a launch anomaly, which would undoubtedly destroy the satellite. Given current launch success rates, this would be extremely unlikely."

https://www.kickstarter.com/projects/726096520/dinnerscape-an-artist-in-residence-pop-up-restaura?ref=discovery_category_newest,726096520/dinnerscape-an-artist-in-residence-pop-up-restaura,"Dinnerscape is an artist in residency program that brings together artists from across a range of mediums to collaborate on a conceptual restaurant space.We will offer several ticketed dinners so that you can have a stimulating meal within our conceptual restaurant. Our dinners take place over the course of a month, are between 3 and 7 courses, and vary in price. After experiencing a Dinnerscape exhibition you get to purchase a piece of art. Plates and bowls, table and bench seats, napkins, silverware, books, photographs, light installations: everything is available for purchase in our online auction. In this way we hope you take a tangible piece of your experience home with you.The idea of Dinnerscape was born on a rainy spring day in Rome, Italy. I was in the tail end of my last semester of University and was frustrated with my experience in the art world. I loved the structure and inspiration that accompanied my time in University, but I still felt there was room for honest critique, and collaboration. I was tired of the conditioned niceties of everyday life interfering with constructive criticism. What is a critique, if not an opportunity to honestly evaluate someone's work, and in return receive assessment? I knew that my own work would have been better had my peers addressed me so, and this issue of honesty seemed two headed. On the one side a collective issue with ""being the bad guy"", and on the other side being unresponsive when honest critique was given: both of which seem rooted in ego. An artist's ego feeds the underlying competitive aspect of the art world that hinders innovation, and at times personal forward momentum. As artists, our time is continuously spent worrying about whether we will be the next prolific artist and we neglect to appreciate all the benefits of working alongside our peers towards a common goal. When artists assemble, intent on creating something considerable, and with their respective talents, the end result is astonishing. I wanted to create an environment that was established as an ego free zone. Where artists were compelled to let their guard down and encouraged to absorb the talent, wisdom, and experience of other artists. At Dinnerscape the key words are symbiosis and reciprocity. I want our artists to understand that you get what you give. But Dinnerscape is more than art or creative process, though they are very important pieces of the puzzle, it was born of my love of food. Good, clean, food. The kind of food that affects you in such a way that your entire experience is tied to the memory of taste. In my own art work I deal a lot with memory. How we create, harness,  and access memory. The best memories are tied to several senses simultaneously. Sight, sound, smell , taste, touch. All equally important, and equally fleeting. If those are our only ways of accessing memory then what a maddening thing it is to grow older and watch those memories fade. Perhaps this is why humans have developed a brilliant method of mental transportation through the acquisition of objects emotionally linked to experience. By creating these souvenirs we manage to give tangible form to emotional connection, and thereby prolong our access capabilities. The artists who participate in Dinnerscape are the loyal engineers of imminent nostalgia. We bring together artists with a common thirst for individual betterment through collaboration. We cultivate a group of individuals who will walk away from their artistic identity to work as one creative force. And together they construct, for you, a moment in time. A space that ensnares all five senses. Within a Dinnerscape space you will experience a meal unlike any before or after. And everything that surrounds you within this evening, is available for you to purchase. The energy of your meal, the people you met, the taste of your food, the light that surrounds you, and the smell of the coming course: all of this exists within your chosen souvenir. And these items have all been handmade by a group of artists who have imbued this work with their own energy, intention, experience, and care. Dinnerscape is about connectionI feel proud to be in this time and place. My generation is on the precipice of realizing a collective love of all things local, and community minded. The businesses I see popping up all around me emphasize locally grown; artisanal; small batch; handmade; organic. These may sound like buzz words at first, but to me they sound like hope. That we can, in this internet age, turn our eyes from our screens and seek emotional connection is inspiring. Or better yet, use our quickening technological capabilities to make possible all of these dreams through websites just like this one. How amazing to be a part of something so culturally defining and innovative as crowd funding.In the end Dinnerscape is a marriage between food and art, but also between you, the participant, and we, the creators. After all, we may have created a space for you to experience but, the memories you make are all yours and a work of art in their own right.Thank you for taking the time to get to know us,Jasmine SnyderWhat will we do with your money?We understand that you work hard, and we will work hard for you. The renovation or renting of a space will absorb the bulk of the money earned. We are lucky enough to have an 800 sq. ft. loft available to us, should we need it. However if we do decide to use it, it will need to be completely renovated. This means new floors, the building of a superficial wall, lighting, and paint (plus the inevitable costs associated with renovation). Currently our artists are creating with materials that they have paid for out of pocket, and Dinnerscape will be reimbursing them as well as providing them with a small stipend for their dedication. The majority of their earnings will come from the sale of their work during the auction that takes place over the course of the exhibition, but we believe their commitment and enthusiasm should be rewarded before that-- if only in a small way.IF WE RECEIVE MORE MONEY than we are asking, or if an opportunity presents itself, we are also interested in investing in a long term space, all our own. This means finding a space that already has a commercial kitchen (or at least the capability), and enough space for both studio equipment, and a permanent exhibition space. It would also mean investing in studio equipment (electric kiln, work tables, ceramic throwing wheels, computers... the list goes on). In the end the direction we go, for this first exhibition, depends largely on the money you provide us with, so please dig deep if you want to see Dinnerscape as a permanent part of the Bozeman Community. Additional costs include:Ingredients purchased through local farms, Marketing, and Licensing. If we are frugal and mindful, I believe we can cover all the necessary costs with $15,000. Hopefully, after ticket and art sales, we will have enough money to put towards doing it all over again with a new group of artists. If you are interested in being a participating artist in the future please donate now, and ensure our longevity!If you would like to be involved in ANY WAY beyond your Kickstarter donation please visit our website:  www.dinnerscape.comAnd don't forget to check us out on facebook, tumblr, twitter, and instagram. https://www.facebook.com/pages/Dinnerscape/360608584077081?ref=hlhttp://dinnerscape.tumblr.com/https://twitter.com/Dinnerscapehttp://instagram.com/dinnerscape","We have set ourselves up with a very reasonable timeline in which to complete each step of the Dinnerscape process. Our fund drive ends on the 23rd of May and our first exhibition will open in September. We decided upon September because of the abundant  local produce (we are committed to sourcing most, if not all, of our ingredients locally). This deadline allows three months for our artists to finish working on their contributions (a great deal of which have already been completed). During this time we will also be either renovating the available loft, or else tracking down a more permanent space. Because we have so many people working on this project we are better able to delegate responsibility. Our Chef will be in charge of communicating with local farms and our Graphic Designer will be in charge of Marketing. Our artistic director, Jasmine, will be steering this ship and taking care of everything in between from securing local sponsors, managing social media, and keeping everyone on task. We have designated October as the month in which all of our Kickstarter rewards are distributed. The key reason is that we want our artists to be able to focus on assembling the first Dinnerscape exhibition, before devoting themselves to the rewards. Many of the awards have already been started or even finished (our ceramicist has already begun producing cups, and our Graphic Designer has already finished the Photo Book. She will just need to order more copies to be printed), but we figure the extra time will ensure that you receive the highest quality rewards for your generous contribution.  Although we will work diligently in order to open in September we are aware of the possibility of setbacks. If something should delay our opening, we would simply move the opening, the primary draw back of course would be the waning availability of local produce. Because we are committed to live updates and consistent sharing of process you will know if anything unfortunate should arise that might effect our opening date.",https://www.kickstarter.com/projects/726096520/get-whipped-in-montana?ref=discovery_category_newest,726096520/get-whipped-in-montana,"Somehow we reached the $5,000 goal in ten days!

There is nothing more satisfying than knowing all of my hard work is appreciated so thank you! A thousand times, thank you!There are 17 days left on the clock...That first $5,000 will allow me to ramp up production and continue pushing the boundaries of cake, but now it’s time to move forward with something I’m deeply passionate about: a COOKBOOK!! Help me help you empower yourself and be a part of the cake revolution! You too can #takebackcake with a copy of Butter Bourbon & Botany. With our powers combined this dream will be a reality that you can actually hold in your hands!Butter Bourbon & Botany will be an artistic, and stylized anthology of the concepts, recipes, and ideas behind the Whipped ethos. We’ve talked about flavor, texture, and aroma being the pillars of quality at Whipped and my cookbook will delve ever deeper into the ways in which I develop cakes that are delicious AND breathtaking.This is your ""work hard"" chapter. I want to give you the building blocks to engineer your own show stopping cakes. Here you will find a total of 33 cake recipes, 11 types of frostings, 8 different curd recipes, jams, fruit butters, and ganaches! With suggested combinations for each cake recipe I’ll leave it to you to create something that satisfies your particular taste!Cake Recipes!Ranging from Balsamic Chocolate to Champagne, and Carrot ChamomileFrosting Recipes!A bevy of adaptable frosting recipes including Swiss Meringue Buttercream, Greek Yogurt Buttercream, French Custard Buttercream, and my famous Cake Batter ButtercreamFillings, Curds, and Ganaches!Compliment any cake and frosting combo you can come up with!Remember our old friend Flavor? Well this is her chapter. You’ve gotten a sense of what is possible with Butter, but Bourbon is all about flavor exploration. Re-examining ways to use some old favorites like lemon, caramel, and of course bourbon; taking a second look at some ingredients you might be familiar with and changing the context in which we use them (earl grey tea, rosemary, gorgonzola); and throwing in a few curve balls to really push the boundaries! I want to teach you how to create intriguing flavor combinations that will leave your guests with a sweet memory they can’t shake. In Bourbon you’ll find the techniques necessary to infuse maximum flavor without sacrificing texture and stability in your cakes and frostings. Working in the wedding industry, where there are trends aplenty and a brutal history of cringeworthy ones at that (I’m talking to you 1980’s), I am eternally dedicated to creating timeless cakes which means a return to nature. Organic ingredients are naturally delicious, colorful, and uniquely beautiful in their own right. In Botany I’ll teach you how to take something fresh picked and apply it’s inherent beauty to the surface of your cake (the cake below is covered in candied rhubarb!) I’ll also be including a chapter dedicated to my signature painted cakes where I’ll explain the tips and techniques I use to paint flowers, fruits, and plants while drawing inspiration from botanical illustrations and field guides.At Whipped natural inspirations and organic ingredients are the birthplace of ingenuity and creative exploration. My creative process begins with understanding these incredible plants and their uses, origins, and natural forms. Peppered throughout Butter, Bourbon & Botany you’ll find hand drawn illustrations of my favorite ingredients and bits of botanical information that will help give you a well rounded understanding of these incredible flowers, nuts, fruits, herbs, and teas.

What’s more: she has generously offered to work with me pro bono on this project, simply because she is excited about building her portfolio and creating a cookbook! Incredible, I know. The thing is: homegirl deserves to get paid! I have always intended to compensate her for all of her hard work once I establish a publisher and have the funding to do so, but wouldn’t it be better to get her some money upfront? It would sit better with me knowing that she is being treated with the respect and funding she deserves, straight out of the gate, not one or two years from now. My success with this cookbook is her success!	My journey begins with a Banana Cream Pie. At six years old I awoke one afternoon from a nap, with an overwhelming urge to bake. An assessment of the pantry yielded a pre-baked pie crust, whipped cream, a box of vanilla pudding mix, and bananas. My determination as I whipped, mixed and layered (heightened by the absence of any parental guidance while my mother continued to nap) yielded a pie so perfect in it’s completion that it took every ounce of my tenuous self-control not to tear into it by myself. I can still remember that pie like it was yesterday, and it stands today as a mascot in my pursuit of pastry adventure. I can hear it whisper: the greatest achievements are the ones pursued with passion, and at the behest of an empty stomach. You might be surprised how many people tell me they don’t like cake. Or maybe you wouldn’t. Maybe your one of them. If you are: you are not alone. I’m pretty sure what passes for cake in much of this country, is in fact stacked cardboard covered in sugar cream. You know what I’m talking about. The cake is dry and layered between some sugar filth that resembles frosting, but tastes so strongly of sugar, oil and nothing else that you begin to question words like “vanilla” and “chocolate.” That is not my jam. When you bite into a piece of Whipped cake I want you to experience flavor first, followed by texture, aroma, emotion, and somewhere down at the bottom sweetness. Sugar should never knock you upside the head. A good cake carries with it a history of celebration but is firmly rooted in the moment. You are experiencing a reward for being born, falling in love, surviving a horrible day, or playing a supportive role in the life of someone who deserves a bit of celebration for one, if not all, of these reasons. We all deserve to be celebrated. Special events and holidays serve as touchstones in a lifetime that is always moving too quickly. They are days devoted entirely to the creation and preservation of memories, and for that sake I pull no punches. I have chosen to contribute something decadent, perfect, and entirely fleeting. I make wedding cakes which means my life revolves around countless hours of fine tuning, problem solving, and creative thinking culminating in a work of art that will be completely demolished within hours of completion. It is a bittersweet pursuit I find strangely fulfilling. A cake is a celebration unto itself, and a wedding cake is next level celebration. It is quite literally baked in the name of love! A couple of years ago, with very little money to my name, a couple of kitchen aid mixers, and a passion born of failure and persistence, I started Whipped. Thanks to the support of many individuals, but especially Katalin Green at Montana Bride, I have connected with a wonderful clientele, and developed a portfolio I am deeply proud of. Now that I am facing a much busier wedding season for 2015 it is time to take Whipped to the next level, but I need your support to do so! The money you so generously pledge will go towards purchasing equipment that will help me as I tackle the wedding industry and embark upon my greatest adventure to date: a cookbook!!! Butter, Bourbon, & Botany will be an exploration of the ingredients, flavors, and inspirations behind my culinary approach. I have already begun to work on this enormous task but progress will be slow without a few key pieces of equipment.Hobart Mixer				$1,300 Pan Rack				$100 Misc. Equipment			$500 Computer				$1,300 Camera				$1000 Camera Lens			$300 Photo Studio Equipment (Tripod-Diffusers-LightBox-Reflector) 	$500	While I am lucky enough to have secured a wildly talented photographer (Justine Jane Cranford www.ruthlessphoto.com) to photograph for the cookbook, it is important that I have my own camera in order to ramp up my blog, gain exposure, and generally promote my business. A new computer (mine is several years old and on its last leg) will set me up to manage my website, write my cookbook, edit photos, and design for Whipped. The long term effects of investing in these expensive gadgets is immeasurable. Despite minimal materials at my disposal I have managed all of my marketing/branding up to this point, with a lot of support and exposure courtesy of www.montanabride.com, ( You can pick up your copy of Montana Bride Magazine today and read my article on interpreting cake trends Whipped style!) but it is now time for Whipped to live up to it’s potential! I know I can reach a wider audience and do so much more for this business with a financial push at this crucial stage!	I am so thankful to have found a home in Roots Kitchen & Cannery www.rootskitchencannery.com, where I am provided with a remarkably well stocked commercial kitchen. However I am desperately in need of a larger mixer to keep up with the busy wedding season I am facing. Believe it or not I have been doing everything out of two standard kitchen aid mixers and that is just not going to cut it anymore!! Those sad sisters are shaky, breaky, and looking pretty rough around their chrome edges. Miscellaneous kitchen equipment is just shorthand for all that fun kitchen stuff you know and love, and also some you may not: cake boxes, spatulas, sheet pans, bowls, cake circles, edible color dusts (magical!), and more. There just never seems to be enough money to make purchasing these items possible.Lest you think I would ask you to pledge and receive nothing in return, I have assembled a list of unbelievable incentives from cookies and stickers all the way to WEDDING CAKES!!! No joke! If you are planning to be married within the next year, now is your opportunity to get a screaming deal on a wedding cake, or dessert table. You pick the pastries, and the date, and I will do the rest!For those who are donating because they are jazzed about the cookbook, me too!! I am most excited about this latest endeavor. As is the case with writing a book, it will take some time, and lots of editing, and probably a few mistakes to get it right, but I am determined to make this a reality. Divided into three sections, my cookbook will be an artistic exploration of baking, composition, and decorating: focusing on flavor, and organic inspiration for a book that is refined and inspiring! I have already begun writing, and developing recipes for Butter, Bourbon, & Botany, and with your help I can make sure it is everything I envision it being. I will keep everyone posted on the progress of my first book, and you will all have first dibs on the first edition!For more photos please follow Whipped on Instagramhttps://instagram.com/whippedreams","There isn't too much risk, given Whipped is already an establish bakery in Bozeman, Montana. I have set October as the latest possible time to get my SWAG bags sent out, but if I'm really searching for an obstacle I guess it could take a little bit longer if I suddenly have a lot of fall weddings on the books. There is also the possibility that my cookbook will not be picked up by a publisher, in which case I will self publish. Nothing is going to keep me from getting that piece of literature on the shelf!"

The series is known for itsimmersive high-quality enhanced audio book style productions, which featurefull casts, professional voice acting, exceptional sound effects and originalcinematic scores.As of February 2017, theChilling Tales for Dark NightsYouTube channel has released more than800 audio productions, and is followed by 170,000+ subscribers, and has accumulatednearly 18 million views. Its programs have been prominently featured on theDarkMatter Radio Networkandthe world’s largest podcast network,PodcastOne, and its adaptations of horror classicshave been utilized for educational purposes in classrooms around the world, andas part of the Washington, DC-basedSeeNoSun Literacy Project.Over the course of its storied history,Chilling Tales for Dark Nightsand The Simply Scary Podcasthave accumulated hundreds of unsolicited fan testimonialsand iTunes 5-star reviews, and the team behind the series has had the pleasure of adaptingfiction penned by Bram Stoker award winners, as well as New York Timesbestselling authors. They've also featured guest performances by the likes ofrenowned fantasy authorPatrickRothfuss, as well as multi-million subscriber YouTube personalitiessuch asMark“Markiplier” Fischbach,TayZonday,Rob Dyke, andCryaotic.Having worked diligently to bring radiotheater “back from the dead” for more than 4 years, the team behind the audioexcellence ofChilling Tales for Dark Nightsandthe critically-acclaimedSimply Scary Podcastaredetermined to take their high-quality audio productions to the new level, byproducing the world’s first-ever fully-animated horror anthology televisionseries.Once successfully funded, any episodesproduced will be distributed to campaign backers, as well as used todemonstrate the potential of the series to networks such as Netflix, Amazon,SyFy Channel and others.The series is produced and directed by theduo of CTFDN creatorCraig Groshekandexecutive producer Jesse Cornett, and is illustrated and animated by anaccomplished team of artists includingDavid Romero,Giselle RosserandBo Mathorne(the filmmaker responsible for theaward winning short film, theBackwaterGospel).On account of its anthology-style formattingand penchant for psychological terror and suspense,ChillingTales for Dark Nightsis compared frequently to spiritual predecessorssuch as Tales From the Crypt, The Twilight Zone, Are You Afraid of the Dark?,Penny Dreadful, and Black Mirror. In spite of these comparisons, however,CTFDN’s animated incarnation will be unique in its field in several ways:Notably, theChillingTales for Dark Nightsanimated series, upon its release, will be thefirst series of its kind which could truly be considered a product of theInternet age. Drawing together talent from across the English-speaking world,including theUnited States, Canada, the UK and Australia, thecollaborative effort pulls together the myriad contributions of countlesstalents spread throughout the globe – the majority of whom have never set footin the same room together, or so much as spoken in person.Like its audio entertainment productions, theanimated series will rely not on multimillion-dollar studios and Hollywoodcelebrities, but on the incredible talents of a veritably unknown,widely-dispersed community of underappreciated and remarkably creativeindividuals owing no allegiance to any corporate studio or media entity. A proud contributing member of the onlinehorror fiction and creepypasta communities,Chilling Talesfor Dark Nightsand its producers take great pride in the fact thattheirs will be the first of its kind to feature an original cast comprisedentirely of independent voice over artists, and to rely exclusively on thewritten works of indie, unpublished authors for its episodic adaptations.If you’d like to learn more about the origins ofChilling Talesfor Dark Nights, visit their website, their YouTube channel,or check out theSimply Scary Podcast. Turn Off the Lights, and Turn on the Dark.Our immediate goal is to produce one or more high-quality animated horror productions suitable for public release, which can also be utilized as part of a major network pitch, which demonstrate the technical and artistic/creative capabilities of our team of producers and voice over artists.Ourultimategoal is to fund as many original episodes ofChilling Tales for Dark Nightsas possible, either in an animated graphic novel style, or in a fully animated style, depending on funding, and to release those episodes first to our campaign backers, and then to the general public. The more money we raise, the more episodes we'll be able to make (and the better the animation!).Full animation is exceptionally time-consuming, and thus expensive. Therefore, our initial goal is a modest one: to fund the production ofa single animated graphic novel-style adaptation (similar tothis music video)of an existing CTFDN audio production, “The Scarecrow Corpse,"" written by independent authorKristopher Mallory, and featuring a collaboration with 16+ million-subscriber YouTube Let’s Play gaming personalityMarkiplier. The original audio production can be heard as part of a compilation here:Funding beyond the initial goal will be applied first toward the production of a 100% original 15-minute pilot episode penned by online horror fiction and creepypasta legendMatt Dymerski, author of the wildly popular, top-rated and frequently adapted tale, “Psychosis.” The pilot episode’s story will be written exclusively for the series and will have never been heard or released elsewhere.The Matt Dymerski pilot episode, currently in the writing stage, will be adapted for television by Boise, Idaho-based writerJoshua L. Hood, a frequent collaborator with CTFDN responsible for stories such as “A Truck Stop Horror” and “False Prophet.”Whether the pilot is done in an animated graphic novel style (more on this below) or in a fully animated style depends entirely on the funding we receive.$160K will allow us enough funding to cast Robert Englund (the actor who portrayed Freddy Krueger) - in a significant role in the pilot. We are in negotiations with Mr. Englund's representatives already, and are in the process of receiving final quotes.Should both the “The Scarecrow Corpse” and the pilot episode be produced, and Mr. Englund's involvement confirmed, further funds will go toward the production of additional episodes, to be either fully animated or done in an animated graphic novel style, depending on the total funds received. The length of those episodes will also depend on the funding available.Production of the first two episodes has begun already, with storyboards, script drafts and character design art having been created. All that is needed is the funding necessary to compensate those involved with the project, and once that funding is received, production in earnest will begin. The first two episodes (or more) are expected to be released in 2017, with future episodes released on a timetable yet to be determined.As an independententertainment production company, Chilling Entertainment requires eitheroutside investors or advertising-derived funding to produce all of its programs.The team and plan we have assembled together provide a unique vision and aquality of storytelling and animation that we and our fans can be proud of. Wewant to blow you away, and it is increasingly difficult to attain that level ofexcellence with traditional partnerships, especially for a new intellectualproperty.The process of rounding upindustry investors to provide the amount of financial support necessary toproduce a world-class animated series would take a long time – years, usually.Furthermore, funding a project of this size and scope with inconsistent,unreliable and constantly fluctuating advertising revenue is impractical.If investors were to beinvolved to help fund the production of our animated series, those companieswould undoubtedly want a say in how the series is made. Inevitably, we would bemicromanaged, subjected to scrutiny, and a portion, if not all, of ourcreative control would be sacrificed to those bankrolling the project.Crowd-funding the animated series through Kickstarter is not only thefastest way to bring you an animated series ofChilling Talesfor Dark Nights, but also the best way to preserve the artistic vision ofour illustrators, animators, authors, production team and voice talent. Thismethod also allows us to retain creative independence and 100% of ourintellectual property rights.All the while, Kickstarter provides you – the fans – with a unique opportunityto help make possible a show you’ll love, produced by the dyed-in-the-woolhorror fanatics responsible for the Simply Scary Podcast! We know you, as fansof the horror genre, have an interest in seeing something like this happen – andwe love the idea that our fans will be involved and given the opportunity tohelp the series progress!The successful funding of this – our first Kickstarter campaign – will alsopave the way for us to expand our current programs and build upon the existingChilling Tales for Dark Nights universe, perhaps including gaining the abilityto work on additional series, or allow us to delve into other industries, such aspublishing and video games. The sky is the limit!Based on listener feedback, we endeavor to produce ananthology series. With possible exceptions, each episode will feature a singleenclosed story. However, we cannot and will not rule out an occasional“two-parter” or mini-series of episodes. This format will be reminiscent of live-action spiritual precursors such asTales From the Crypt, The TwilightZone, Are You Afraid of the Dark?, Penny Dreadful and Black Mirror.With that said, we endeavor to produce something totally original, whichreflects the collaboration between the many individuals involved with ourproject, each of whom have their own preferences and influences.The series will be 2D, with a hand-drawn look and feel. The art style fans of ours told us they preferred was DavidRomero's, particularly that of “Other Lily” and ""Midnight Snack."" You can view Romero's short film collection here:Romero is an exceptionally gifted illustrator and animator, capable of producing a myriad of styles, as is evident from his DeviantArt gallery. Romero’s art style, coupled with the clean, professional lookand feel of the work of his female counterpart,Giselle Rosser, will add a passion and expression to the characters in ourepisodes, which is guaranteed to match or rival the work of large corporatestudios.More of Rosser’s animation and illustration work can beseen on herTumblr.Fans were also partial to the artistic feel of Stephen Gammell’s work,which was featured in theScary Stories to Tell in the Darkbook series.As these books are favorites of series creator Craig Groshek and many of our voice artists, not to mention our illustrators, it is likely Gammell’s style will make it into the series.Lastly, the work ofBo Mathorne(producer of “The Backwater Gospel”) was highly prized by fans. Mathorne, based internationally, has spoken with our team and has agreed to become involved when it becomes necessary.Mathorne, like Romero and Rosser, is a remarkable multi-medium artist, capable of producing many styles. Mathorne’s animated graphic novel-style production of the music video for“Psalms of Withering” has been an inspiration to our entire team. More of Mathorne's stylistic capabilities can be seen on his blog. Our artistic team also takes inspiration from popular horror films such asSe7enand those in theSawseries, as well as from horror-genre anime programs such as Yamishibai (Theater of Darkness).Our ultimate goal is to match the quality of popular animated programs as seen on Netflix and other major networks, while retaining the look, feel and atmosphere of live-action horror films.You can expect our characters to be incredibly human in appearance, with expressions that project life-like passion, and our creatures to be monstrous, terrifying and nightmare-inducing.SO... WHAT'S AN ANIMATED GRAPHIC NOVEL, AND HOW IS IT DIFFERENT FROM A FULLY ANIMATED FILM?Simply put, an animated graphic novel is similar to an animatic (a rough, storyboard-like animation generally used to pitch a film concept to a studio), but far more polished and professional-looking.An ""animated graphic novel"" is about 85% of the way to full animation. Unlike a fully-animated feature, this style does not incorporate full-frame animation. As a result, it is far less time-consuming to produce, yet manages to attain a professional appearance. These pared down productions may also feature added effects, such as wind, rain and snow, in order to accentuate the simplified environments.Not familiar with the world of animatics? Take a look at our own, for ""The Scarecrow Corpse,"" here:If you'd like to get an idea as to what an ""animated graphic novel"" version of our animatic could look like, imagine the above, but with high-quality illustration, fluid motion, and special effects, as in this Bo Mathorne-produced music video:Or consider this Silver Fish Creative film, which was successfully used to pitch an animated film to Neil Gaiman himself:The ultimate goal, of course, is to produce fully-animated episodes, and we intend to do so, if we generate enough funds to do so, or if the series is picked up by a major network willing to fund it on a corporate level after we've made our pitch.An animated graphic novel approach to our first production still offers tremendous benefits, however, as it will allow us to produce our initial film far more quickly and with a modest budget, while still allowing our artistic team to show off its capabilities.Audio is our specialty. For years we've worked to combine great storytelling with stellar voice acting, custom sound effects and original scores to create immersive, engaging environments. But don't take our word for it. If you're unfamiliar with our work, listen to some of the playlists and compilations below to see who is behind the sound that makes these nightmares come to life.EXECUTIVE TEAMCraig GroshekJesse CornettILLUSTRATIVE AND ANIMATION TEAMDavid Romero(producerof “OtherLily”and “MidnightSnack”)Giselle RosserBo Mathorne(producerof “TheBackwater Gospel”)AUDIO PRODUCTION / SOUND DESIGN/ MUSIC COMPOSITION TEAMJesse CornettLuke HodgkinsonRonnie DickisonPROGRAM HOSTOtis JiryTELEPLAY WRITERJoshua L.

Social media is incredibly powerful!Whether you post, share, tweet, email or physically hand out flyers promoting our campaign, you can make all the difference!Thank you!","Making great horror content is challenging, with or without animation! Our animated series endeavors to blend our existing audio and story writing capabilities with a new visual medium to create a cohesive experience. It takes time to iterate and expand on ideas, and to do things right. There is a reason many amazing, original films and animated features take years to be released, or never see the light of day at all.The biggest risk is that our animated series will take longer to produce than anticipated. Potentially, we may generate enough funds to complete one leg of production, but not enough to fully complete the next. In the event of such a scenario, our plan would be to pool our remaining funds and partner with venture capitalists or other entities to get the series produced, or use whatever episodes did get funded to pitch a full series to the major networks on our own. This series is our livelihood, so we will do whatever it takes!",https://www.kickstarter.com/projects/craiggroshek/chilling-tales-for-dark-nights-a-scary-stories-col?ref=discovery_category_newest,craiggroshek/chilling-tales-for-dark-nights-a-scary-stories-col,"ABOUT CHILLING TALES FOR DARK NIGHTSChilling Tales for Dark Nights is a popular horror-themed audio storytelling brand, YouTube channel and podcast network, produced by Chilling Entertainment, created in late 2012 by author and lifelong scary stories fanatic Craig Groshek, and produced through collaboration between a multinational team of independent authors, sound designers, composers, illustrators and voice over artists. The series is known for its immersive high-quality enhanced audio book style productions, which often feature full casts, professional voice acting, Hollywood-quality sound effects and original scores. As of July 2018, the team behind Chilling Tales for Dark Nights has launched three iTunes 5-star rated horror podcasts through their Simply Scary Podcasts Network, and their YouTube channel, which features over 1,000 productions, counts more than 222k+ subscribers and 27.8+ million views.ABOUT THE ANTHOLOGYWith this fundraiser, Craig and the team behind Chilling Tales for Dark Nightsmake their first foray into anthology horror publishing, endeavoring to release one or more collections of original folklore-inspired scary stories, each of them illustrated by Simply Scary Podcast artist David Romeroin a sinister black and white style which may remind readers of the work of Stephen Gammell as featured in the Scary Stories to Tell in the Dark series written by Alvin Schwartz in the 1980s and 1990s.Each book in the series, which will be available in both eBook and print editions, will include 30 or more fully-illustrated tales of terror, written specifically this project by more than four dozen critically-acclaimed and recognizable authors from the popular Reddit NoSleep, creepypasta, and horror anthology communities. See the below section, ""About the Authors"", for a full list of those involved at this time.Stretch goals are set up to allow us to expand the single book into a trilogy and open up public submissions (see below for more information about our stretch goals, and how you can help expand the scope of the project to allow for your own story to be submitted for consideration).Each original story will be inspired by folklore and dark fairytales, intended to lend the fiction a unique, old-fashioned air of authenticity, as if you the reader are actually enjoying a tale passed down through generations, all the while allowing each author's unique flair and writing style to shine through.Each book will be produced in an eBook, paperback, and audio book edition, all in-house by the members of our team. The audio book edition will feature every story in a full-cast format, complete with sound effects and original music.Rest assured, though this is our first horror anthology featuring the work of multiple authors, it is not our first book. In 2016, we released author William Dalphin's 5-star collection of 35 terrifying tales, Don't Look Away. We are familiar with marketplace requirements, as well as adept when it comes to the editing and formatting processes.So far as audio goes, we've been producing high-quality audio horror for nearly 6 years, so you can rest assured we've got that covered. See below for a link to one of many examples of our work in the audio genre over the years. Or visit our YouTube channel,podcasts networks, or ourSpotifyprofile, if you'd like to hear more.Regardless of which version of the book you decide to enjoy, you can count on us to produce something beautiful, high-quality, and well-edited, that will make you proud to have supported it, and everyone involved proud to be involved.ABOUT THE AUTHORSMore than 50 amazing authors have already been contacted and are officially involved in the project as of the launch of this fundraiser.Among those involved are Reddit NoSleep ""best of the year"" award winners, award-winning horror novelists, past CTFDN writing contest winners, authors of a number of legendary creepypasta classics, authors/hosts of several popular horror-themed storytelling podcasts, and writers whose genre-defining work has been secured by Hollywood and the television industry for adaptation to films and more!The current list of those involved is as follows (in alphabetical order by last name) (click on their names to learn more about them):Robert AhernKevin David AndersonK.

WalkerMichael WhitehouseJonathan ""Bogleech"" WojcikChristopher Howard ""Slimebeast"" WolfS.C. YoungABOUT THE FUNDS NEEDEDThe funds required to produce each book in the series is approximately $5,000. This conservative cost covers necessary expenses such as illustration, cover design, licensing fees, Kickstarter-related charges, and administrative expenses paid to 3rd parties to ensure the final product is both accessible, pristine, and professional in appearance. In a marketplace saturated with hastily-constructed products, we want to make sure our books stand out and make you proud.The breakdown of expenses looks something like this per book:31% - Full-color Jacket/Cover Design and Interior llustrationsCovers the cost of a full-page (or two half-page) black and white interior illustration for each story in the book, as well as a handful of other embellishments to enhance titles and other sections of the book, and also a full-color wrap-around cover for the book.32% - Licensing FeesCovers the cost of a nominal fee to be paid to each contributor to the book at what each author has agreed is a fair exchange for non-exclusive 1st print rights to the stories penned specifically for this anthology series13% - Formatting and Editing ExpensesCovers the cost of necessary formatting and editing services to create fantastic-looking versions of the book for multiple electronic formats, as well as print versions.10% - Kickstarter Required Cut and Payment Processor FeesCreates a buffer to cover the 5% mandatory Kickstarter cut of proceeds, as well as a 5% overheard for additional mandatory payment processor fees.14% - Reserve for Audiobook Production, Buffer Against Cost of Production and Shipping of Physical Books and Rewards, etc.Any funds remaining after other major expenses have been covered will be used to offset the costs related to the production and shipping of paperback (and other physical) editions of the book, other rewards, and (if possible) to compensate those involved in the production of the audio book edition of the book.STRETCH GOALSStretch Goal # 1 - More Chilling Tales for Dark Nights (Volume II)$10,000In the event we reach $10k in total funding, we will officially produce a series, and a full 2nd book, with its own cover art, and a minimum of 30 additional stories not included in the first book. Like the first, it will be fully-illustrated, and made available in eBook, print and audio book editions, utilizing the funds provided.Stretch Goal # 2 - Chilling Tales for Dark Nights III$15,000In the event we reach $15k in total funding, we will officially produce a full 3rd book in the series, with its own cover art, and a minimum of 30 additional stories not included in the first and second books. Like the first two, it will be fully-illustrated, and made available in eBook, print and audio book editions, utilizing the funds provided.ALSO UNLOCKED AT THIS LEVEL: PUBLIC SUBMISSIONS!That's right! Up until this point, all authors included in the volumes have been hand-selected and invited to participate by the project creators. But if we reach our $15k stretch goal, we will open up public submissions and another approximately 30 slots spread out across all three books in the series!Want your chance to be included in the series? So do we! Please spread the word and help us hit their tier, so that we can increase the sizse and scope of the project and make these additional slots available.Stretch Goal # 3- Chilling Tales for Dark Nights Special Edition Hardcover Treasury$20,000In the event we reach $20k in total funding, we will officially produce a special limited edition hardcover treasury edition of the anthology, with its own cover art, including all 90+ stories from the first three volumes, and a minimum of 10 additional stories not included in the earlier books. Like the 3 individual volumes, the treasury will be fully-illustrated, and made available in eBook, print and audio book editions, utilizing the funds provided.MORE ABOUT OUR STRETCH GOALSOur goals for the project are fairly straight-forward. $5,000 covers the cost of the first book, with 30 stories in it.Stretch goals for a 2nd and 3rd book in the series are set at $10,000 and $15,000, respectively, with each tier covering the added expense of producing another book of equal quality, with 30 additional stories in it, produced in the same fashion.An additional final stretch goal is to cover the expense related to the construction of a limited run of hard cover and/or leather bound treasury, containing not just the contents of the first 3 books, but an additional 10 or more stories not included in the earlier volumes, which can only be found in the 100+ story treasury.Want to see 3 books, and the treasury collection? So do we. But above all else, we want to produce no less than the first book, and so, we are attaching future volumes as stretch goals, and not as the initial goal.With your help, we can make our dream of a chilling series of folklore-inspired short scary stories a reality, and not stop at just one.With 55+ authors ready and willing to contribute, it's simply a matter of covering necessary expenses. We'recovering expenses related to many ""hidden costs,"" such as preliminary sketches, concept art, ISBN numbers, and the production of the audio book, which itself involves the collaboration of three dozen talented voice talents, editors, composers and sound designers to make possible.All we ask is the assistance of those who would like to see these books become a reality in helping to make them exceptional, by providing us the much-needed resources to attract quality authors and to compensate one extremely talented illustrator for his many hours of work.Thank you for supporting this project!HOW AND WHEN DOES THE BOOK BECOME A SERIES?Our initial plan was (and still is) to produce at least one volume of stories, with no less than 30 stories included. The initial fundraising goal was set with this goal in mind, to ensure that the first book is produced with your help, fully-illustrated, in electronic, print and audio book editions.The book officially becomes a series when we reach our first stretch goal of $10,000 and have the funds available to fund a full second book, and becomes a trilogy when we reach $15,000, the amount needed to fully fund a third book.In the event we fall somewhere between $5,000 and $10,000, we will make a decision regarding the best way to proceed, which may involve proceeding with a 2nd book, or simply expanding the first volume's size. The final decision regarding the number of books, their page counts, and the number of stories included therein will be made once the campaign has ended.HOW WILL YOU DECIDE WHICH AUTHORS ARE INCLUDED IN WHICH BOOK(S)?This will be a determination made at the discretion of our creative team, and with input from backers and authors, once the fundraiser is complete and the full scope of the book and public interest in it is more clear.In the unlikely event we reach only our initial goal, we will be seeking to include as many authors as possible in the first volume, as funds allow.ABOUT THE ILLUSTRATOREach of the 30 or more tales in the books of the series will be rendered in bone-chilling black and white by veteran illustrator / animator David Romero. The series and each story are in capable hands under the influence of Romero's digital pen, which has been bringing episodes of the Simply Scary Podcast to life for years. To see more of Romero's portfolio, visit his DeviantArt gallerytoday.WHY KICKSTARTER AND CROWDFUNDING?Crowd-funding this anthology series through Kickstarter is not only the best way to get this project funded and in your hands quickly, but the most surefire way topreserve the artistic vision of the project's creator, illustrator, voice talents, and myriad authors involved in its production.This method also us to retain creative independence and 100% of our intellectual property rights, while producing the electronic, print and audio book editions without the hurdles, setbacks, red tape, and delays that traditional publishing often suffers from.By crowdfunding the project, you the readers and listeners are truly in control of the size and scope of the series. Kickstarter provides you – our devoted fans – with a one-of-a-kind opportunity to help make possible a high-quality final product produced by and for those who live, breathe, and... dare we say, die... for scary stories and the horror genre.So, why not help us make this book, and the nightmares of the dozens of talented authors involved, come to life?Turn Off the Lights, and Turn On the Dark.","All in all, this project is fairly simple. We're making at least one book, and if all stretch goals are reached, up to four (including three individual volumes and the treasury). Like with any project worth its salt, this one will take time to put together. With each additional volume added, an additional 2-3 months of production time will be necessary to produce the later volumes. The goal of October 2018 is based on delivery of the first book.  If all stretch goals are reached, we expect the 2nd book to be available by December 2018, the third available by March 2018, and the  treasury available by April 2018.We have the connections and contacts necessary to produce a high quality book (or series) in a much quicker time than a traditional publisher, and don't expect to run into any major problems. However, no one is perfect, and with dozens of moving parts, there is always the possibility of delays.What we guarantee is that we will stay in touch through the duration of the campaign and after, to keep every one of our backers abreast of any issues, in the rare chance thy do arise, and that we will be transparent about any such complications.We remain available through social media, our website, and our YouTube channel, as well as via email, should there be any questions or concerns.Thank you for your support!"

With the edges mastered, labels are added to the center squares and a whole new level of difficulty is derived when choosing to include the rotating 4 color centers into the game play. A complexity that will make a quantum physicist sweat and send you to puzzle heaven (if you can do it...)Made a mess of the puzzle? The pieces can easily be reset, colors push onto the body to be configured as you wish with many, many, many combinations possible.Why we need youWe have a working and tested prototype with design protected by some unique intellectual property.

With a stamp of design and manufacturing quality on our product we will use well suited branding and commercialisation partners to make the maximum possible impact. Injection molding can have a high capital expense, especially when aiming for the high quality manufacturing this product demands. We plan  to work with a trusted manufacturing partner to ensure the results that we want, and in good time.

Additionally the position and orientation of the color keyed  center pieces leads to only one (very tricky) resolve. With a captivating colorful form, The Armadillo Cube is an object beckoning you to pick up and explore.For a casual spin, you can most easily solve one individual edge. Then much like the traditional Rubik's and other 6 sided cube puzzles, you can have a crack at one layer, that is four edges. To go a step further you can attempt matching the edges to a color coded center piece...etc. etc. Ultimately all edgecolorsand all center colorsare all matched and aligned, So good luck with that.Iterative design detail has gone into the internal mechanics with speed play and robustness in mind. Tools have gone through tweeks and adjustments to achieve a top notch look and feel. Quality materials and tolerance manufacturing were a priority for manufacturer selection.With a long history of people pulling labels and unscrewing fasteners to reset their messed up, apparently unsolvable cube puzzles, a de-skinning functionality has been incorporated. With a Lego like construction one can easily remove to reset the colors, just like new. And for those of you that memorize the corner positions, the whole color layout can be changed up.Your funding will kick start our very first production order, and secure for you one of the first ever Armadillo Cubes. We have also put up further discounted offerings for multiple Armadillo Cubes as they would also make a great original, and not seen elsewhere gift for any age.

He holds an official personal record on a standard 3x3 of 10.02 seconds. Working with the new challenge he currently solves the Armadillo Cube in just under 5 minutes.""The Armadillo Cube feels unique, it requires more focused attention to keep on track and there are more steps to think about.""

The last year has been quite an amazing ride… and it just keeps getting better! Over the last year we have won two major business plan competitions, taken 2nd place in another, received university and State of Montana grant funding for research, and now our greatest feat yet… A NEW COMMERCIAL KITCHEN!Since the cricket farm started in January, we have been struggling to find a place to process our crickets. We were very fortunate to find support at the Livingston Food Resource Center in Livingston, MT and are grateful to them for the help. Unfortunately their facility is 45 minutes away… over a mountain pass! It is expensive for us to drive ourselves and employees to the kitchen to be able to process our food grade products, not to mention the dangers of going through the pass in the winter time. Now, however, we have a chance to change that!Our awesome landlord has recently started building us a space for a new commercial kitchen. The catch? This means that now we need to buy our own equipment. Oh, no! This is where YOU come in. We need your help to make this a reality. We already have some amazing products being produced, but with the new kitchen we will be able to bring even more cricket goodness to the world, and even better we will be able to reduce our costs and pass that savings right onto you, our loyal customers. This means that we can lower prices while increasing profits and bring our products to an even larger crowd: the world over.Kickstarter is a big part of it. The support, the orders for awesome gifts and prizes, helps a lot. We will have a lot of ongoing expenses though. Luckily, we have found a great way to cover these. Gallatin County currently has a shortage of commercial kitchen space available to rent and the spaces that are available are extremely expensive. So what we plan to do is find a few local Montana made, innovative food companies that are just waiting for a space. We will charge them a reasonable fee, not the exuberant amounts currently being charged, then we will help them grow their businesses as well! This hourly rental of our facility will help pay for our lease, utilities, insurance, and licensing for the kitchen. Even better, these customers will allow us to hire a full time kitchen manager.By supporting us on Kickstarter not only are you helping to save the world for future generations (crickets are good for the world), but you are helping to create American jobs now!Wait… I can save the world by supporting this Kickstarter campaign?Why yes… yes you can, and here’s how!our crickets use 2,060X less water, 14 times less feed, produce 80X less methane, and use less than 1% of the comparable land mass. This means in our small, 2,000 sf facility we can produce nearly 50,000 lbs of crickets per year!!!! That would take 25 cattle 2 years and a whole lot more resources to produce the same amount of protein.Not sold yet? What if I told you that you could save lives too? Crickets are known for being very high in protein, but many people don’t know that they also have twice the amount of iron per pound than beef does. According to the World Health Organization (who.int) iron deficiency is the leading cause of nutrition related illness in the world. Horrible diseases like anemia and pica are caused by a lack of iron in your diet. In most of the developed world, it isn’t a big of an issue as many underdeveloped nations, however it hits closer to home than you may think!For women in the U.S., 16% in the age range of 14–50 years consumed less than the Estimated Average Requirement (EAR) for iron. By using our cricket powder in breads, cakes, cookies, shakes, ect. we can significantly increase the iron consumption on major populations back to safe levels. However, right now our powder is too expensive for many people to afford. By having the kitchen nearby, and at essentially no cost to us through renting out the space, we can significantly decrease the costs of the powder and make it more accessible to more people. So yes, YOU can help to save lives just by supporting our Kickstarter campaign.Thank you for your time and support. We hope that you make the choice to support us today so that we can help others tomorrow!","We absolutely have risks and challenges associated with this project.  It’s possible that our license gets denied (though we already hold a wholesale food permit so that is unlikely), or we might not be able to book enough clients to keep the kitchen running (we already have 3 clients on the waiting list!), or that a zombie dinosaur could come out of the mountains and eat everyone creating a zombie apocalypse that then the world as we know it!  This is Montana, we’re known for dinosaurs, so I won’t completely discount that possibility.We are prepared to tackle these possibilities (except the dinosaur thing, I really don’t think that anyone can prepare for that, sooo… sorry?).  Not only do we already have our Montana Wholesale Food Permit, but we also work very closely with both the Montana Dept. of Agriculture and the USDA, along with the FDA and Montana DPHHS.  We also work with Montana State University in the Entomology and Biochemistry Dept. to ensure that we have a detailed understanding of our feed and its effect on the crickets as well as best practices.Additionally, we will have all orders ready to ship out by the end of November, so you can have everything ready for great holiday gifts too!",https://www.kickstarter.com/projects/1475454815/cowboy-cricket-jumpers-made-with-supercrickets?ref=discovery_category_newest,1475454815/cowboy-cricket-jumpers-made-with-supercrickets,"Cowboy Cricket Farms has sold cricket based food products all over the world and now we have 3 new flavors of our famous Jumpers, whole flavored crickets, and amazing new packaging to boot!

They seriously taste like BBQ chips and are made from real ingredients.Original and Smokey Jumpers are guaranteed by 20 December anywhere in the US if you pre-order the ""Holiday Specials.""The original are unflavored whole crickets. From the high quality of our cricket feed, our unflavored whole crickets taste like a sunflower seed. They have a nice crunch which goes wonderfully on salads and tacos.Right here:Introducing .....Wasabi Jumpers! Think wasabi peas but a whole lot better. For a spicy blend, they are strangely addictive, but they won't make you cry (like that one time I thought wasabi was guacamole). Try adding some to your next sushi roll.But why SuperCrickets?SuperHumans like Mike Ergo:A USMC veteran, father, and kick-ass Ironman Triathlete! He's Powered by Crickets at every race and is just one of thousands of SuperHumans that have joined us around the globe to bring crickets to the masses.NUTRITION!!!!Crickets are a high protein, great tasting snack and can help boost your heart health, immune system, brain function, and cognitive performance. Paleo and Keto friendly, non-GMO, gluten free and made with all-natural, preservative-free ingredients.Iron deficiency is the leading health concern of the World Health Organization. Up to 80% of the world's population has an iron deficiency and 30% have anemia. We can fix this through diet and crickets are a perfect way to do this! They are rich in bio-available heme iron which is easily absorbed in your body.Protein is more than just muscle. Your body can create most of what it needs from the food you eat, but not everything! Crickets have all 9 essential amino acids (the protein that your body can't make itself), meaning that crickets will keep you stronger than plant protein. Crickets pack quite a punch with 2 X the protein compared to beef too!Omega-3 fatty acids are a natural anti-inflammatory that have some huge health benefits. They are proven to fight depression and anxiety, decrease ADHD symptoms, and even promote brain health. We know what you're thinking - ""I get Omega 3s from fish."" Well you also are getting a dose of mercury. No, not the awesome but sadly deceased singer, the heavy metal that can accumulate in your blood stream and can cause issues with your nervous system.Let's be honest. Would you rather eat a delicious cricket or an anchovy?In other words... crickets are freaking AWESOME - High in omega-3 and no mercury... okay, so what else ?Water is essential to life on Earth! Unfortunately, our current agricultural practices waste millions of gallons of water every day. Crickets are considerably more water efficient than cows meaning more safe drinking water for a growing population.A lot of the land and water used for agriculture goes to growing feed for livestock. If we reduce the use of feed then we reduce both water and land use as well! Our feed is all made in the USA with super high quality grains and grasses ... you know, what crickets actually eat. NO CORN and NO SOY in our feed!Cows are nasty! They make tons (literally!) of methane and other greenhouse gas emissions each year. Live stock produce more greenhouse gasses than all of the cars in the world combined! But our crickets don't! Little butts make little toots and with how efficient crickets are they don't make much waste at all.Crickets don't need much room. Since they are grown indoors and vertically they take less than 1% of the comparable land mass to grow the same amount of protein. That's crazy! This land savings means that we have more room for schools, houses, parks, and most importantly we can stop deforesting our planet!We are a veteran-owned company right in Montana creating jobs for a hardworking people!People should know where their food comes from and how it's grown. Here's how we make our Jumpers, from start to finish.Step 1: FarmersAll of our crickets come from the amazing farmers in our Network of Partner Farmers, which is the first of its kind in the USA. Just like co-op farming in dairy or berries, each one of these farms are independently owned. We've created a whole new industry in Montana and the surrounding states that has in turn created dozens of new jobs. Support for us is support for over 6 independently owned cricket farms.Farmers like Derek:Step 2: FreezeWe harvest the crickets in a humane and sustainable way. Each cricket is harvested towards the end of its life (crickets only live about 8 weeks). In nature, crickets would go into stasis (hibernation) as the weather gets cold enough. In the Spring time the youngest, strongest crickets would wake back up and keep living their cute little cricket lives! What we do is put the adult crickets into the freezer and after about 5 minutes they are in stasis. After about an hour they are completely frozen, painlessly, and unable to wake back up.Step 3: DehydrateWe don't roast at a high heat like most. No, no, no! We cook them low and slow! This means more time, but also more flavor, and more nutrition since high temperatures denatures protein and kills nutrients. It takes about 7 hours, but by keeping the temperature below 180 F we make sure that all of the awesome protein and fats that are naturally in our crickets stay there!Step 4: FlavorNow comes the good part! We hand toss the crickets in organic safflower oil grown in Montana then add the spices. All natural and all delicious! Step 5: RoastTo sear on the flavor we roast the crickets for just 3 minutes. Long enough to get the flavoring to stick, but not so long that we destroy any nutrients along the way.Step 6: BagThe crickets are almost ready for you! We measure them out into each bag by hand then seal the bag... ready for you to enjoy!Step 7: ENJOY!Now it's your turn. Open up a bag and enjoy with your favorite recipe or as a snack. Take on a hike, or chow down at home. Share with friends... or keep them all for yourself!It's your choice!We are no strangers to the challenges of small business owners. 4 years ago, we were in Bankruptcy Court with our 3 children, the youngest being a newborn. We lost everything: 2 houses, 1 business, and our car. Both of us are veterans; Asking for help was one of the hardest things we ever had to do. But, for about a year prior we struggled with feeding our children. When we walked out of Bankruptcy Court we looked at each other and declared we would never own a small business again. Little did we know our experience with food insecurity changed us forever. It was less than 2 years later when Kathy was drawn to edible insects.After attending Montana State University’s Bug Buffet, Kathy was hooked on bugs as a sustainable food. She went home and told James ""we needed to start a cricket farm for human consumption"". He thought she was absolutely nuts! But Kathy wouldn’t let it go and convinced him to look into it. We spent the next 6 months doing market research and found out the US edible insect market was a growing industry with positive implications for health and the environment. Who would have guessed that bugs could be the number one solution to help stem climate change? When comparing pound per pound (crickets vs cows), crickets use 2,060 times less water, 40 times less feed, and produce 80 times less methane than cows!Cowboy Cricket Farms turns this amazing food source into consumer products. Chocolate Chirp Cookies, flavored crickets, and Cricket Powder are just some of our product offerings. However, we are expanding and growing. Not only are we expanding our product offerings, including more flavors of our delicious whole roasted crickets, but we are teaching others how to be cricket farmers to increase our supply. During our first year, we quickly learned we couldn’t produce nearly enough to meet our demand. We struggled daily and came up with a solution! We started our Network of Partner Farmer program, the first co-op initiative for cricket farming. So far, we have inspired and given the tools and training for 6 independently-owned cricket farms to start and become a part of our Network. Many of whom have quit a conventional job to do cricket farming full time. We have another 12 partner farmers in the final stages of onboarding and over 200 applicants. From our amazing program, we quickly became the largest producer of the Common House Cricket in North America. We did this by believing in people not robots and by giving our knowledge for free through our YouTube channel.We've created some amazing rewards for you!Want to try out each flavor?

The 3 new flavors are still being finalized, but here's the info for the Original and Smokey Jumpers:","Cowboy Cricket Farms has worked hard to reduce as much risk as possible, but there's always going to be something that could get in the way of success.  Here's what we see as the biggest threats and how we plan do solve them:Limited Production Quantity - Food grade crickets are a limited commodity!  Luckily, through our Network of Partner Farmers, Cowboy Cricket Farms is the largest edible insect producer in the USA.  This means that we can ensure enough production for our expected sales.  If there is considerably more demand than expected it could result in a delay in production for later orders.Food safety - All food operations have an inherent risk.  At Cowboy Cricket Farms we are FDA registered as well as licensed by the State of Montana.  Additionally, Kathy has a background and several certifications in food safety to include HACCP and ServeSafe.  All of our team is trained on proper food handling.Fulfillment - We will work as hard as possible to get things out on time, but sometimes unforeseen issues arise.  To reduce the likelihood of late orders we have already done the hard stuff!  The recipes are completed, products sourced, and packaging designed.  Now we just need your help to to get it all put together."

Product testing happens out in the woods and on the streets-- not in some test lab. Years and years of creating shoes (and redesigning them) have added up to an amazingly unique understanding. We know how to make the highest-quality product.Colombia has a rich tradition making textiles from some of the world's best materials. A huge aspect of our quality comes from the local talent there as well. Producing in Colombia gives us the opportunity to hand-select top materials that come in from all over the world--  suedes from Argentina, glues from Spain and Germany, etc. This gives SCg amazing control over the entire process, to guarantee quality. We had tried working in China earlier in the company's history, but that quality was just not what we thought SCg shoes should be about.Because we're co-owners in the family-run factory in Colombia, we can buy in greater bulk and we pass those savings on to customers (you!).

When he went to return them, they stated, “These are skate shoes, and since you weren’t skateboarding when you broke 'em, we won’t warranty them.” Right then and there, Steven decided he’d make his own d*&m shoes!Soon after, the 2001 X-Games Gold Medal was won in SCg Shoes. More shoe models in the mid-2000s made more X-Games appearances. Several pockets of riders across the USA were stoked on SCg Shoes and wore them daily. In 2008 we made a huge jump in craftsmanship, by moving all production to Colombia, South America (a place legendary for their textile and leather industries).

We have several different pledge tiers listed, with a green button to Back This Project. Immediately following the conclusion of our successful campaign, we will request your shipping address and your size/color choices. Thank you so much for your support!Steven Caro, Founder  Please note: SCg shoes are more form fitting compared to many other brands in this segment, especially at the ball of the foot.  Since we only use high-quality natural suedes and leathers, the shoe will stretch to fit YOUR foot. This prevents the foot from shooting into the front of the shoe when you stomp down when riding. This can take a few rides in them to stretch to where you don't notice the fit.. If you have a ""wide"" foot or want a less snug fit, you may want to add 1/2 size larger. For women's size conversion, you would typically take your size in a woman's shoe and subtract 2 to get your mens size. Example, a woman's size 8 would be a men's size 6. However, to have a better idea of what size shoe you should order, lets get you sized up. Side note, if you have questions or need some help, please feel free to contact us and we'll get you sorted!Footwear sizes have always been all over the place and different from brand to brand, and sometimes within the same brand depending on where the shoes were made, specifically to region. To make our sizing more uniform and specific, we base our sizes off of the Brannock measuring device. We have a size chart with lengths for you to refer to to ensure your size.Ladies in the US, please subtract 2 sizes from the US sizes below (ie: US Ladies size 9 = US size 7).1.  Place your heel against the wall, standing with your foot over measuring tape2. Take note of the length to the end of your longest toe, and then add .5CM. That is the length you will use for the size chart. Our opinion, measuring in CM is easier for this and more precise.3. Our shoes should feel snug around the ball of the foot, for the first week or first few rides. Then, they will form to your foot and become extremely comfy! *After the campaign’s success, we’ll contact you to ask for your choice of color and size.Don't worry, first returns are Free.","Weather -  As we experienced with hurricane Maria, unusual weather can cause US shipping ports to slow down. A recent batch of shoes was held up in customs due to this, for an additional 3 weeks as the port of Miami came back online and internal problems sorted.Markets - The fashion industry is inherently fickle; styles and trends come and go. Since our products have a timeless style, they're less susceptible to these fluctuations. ""Quality, it is said... never goes out of style.""Production - From design work, to manufacturing, to exporting, there are many areas that can be difficult or run the chance for problems while making a shoe. Luckily, we have set ourselves up to be as self-sufficient as possible. For example, all product design is done in-house. Manufacturing & quality control is also handled on-site by our team in Colombia. We have a great relationship with the manufacturer, and we usually work with them directly to ensure quality and to handle any situation that may arise.

While living in Greenville, road trips became the norm. Later that year, on a road trip down to FL, Steven easily busted through some brand new skate shoes while riding his bike. When he went to warranty them, they stated, “These are designed for skateboarding, not bike riding, sorry, we can't warranty them.” It was from that back and forth about the blown up shoes that Steven decided he’d make his own d*&m shoes! Through the rest of the year the search was on for who could make the shoes for him, and by the start of 1999, the very first SCg Shoe's were made and sold.Soon after, the 2001 X-Games Gold Medal was won in SCg Shoes.

Thank you so much for your support!Steven Caro, FounderPlease note: SCg shoes are more form fitting compared to many other brands in this segment, especially at the ball of the foot. Since we only use high-quality natural suedes and leathers, the shoe will stretch to fit YOUR foot. This prevents the foot from shooting into the front of the shoe when you stomp down when riding. This can take a few rides in them to stretch to where you don't notice the fit.. If you have a ""wide"" foot or want a less snug fit, you may want to add 1/2 size larger. For women's size conversion, you would typically take your size in a woman's shoe and subtract 1 to get your mens size. Example, a woman's size 8 would be a men's size 7. Side note, if you have questions or need some help, please feel free to contact us and we'll get you sorted!Footwear sizes have always been all over the place and different from brand to brand, and sometimes within the same brand depending on where the shoes were made, specifically to region. To make our sizing more uniform and specific, we base our sizes off of the Brannock measuring device. We have a size chart with lengths for you to refer to to ensure your size.Ladies in the US, please subtract 1 size from the US sizes below (ie: US Ladies size 9 = US Mens size 8).1. Place your heel against the wall, standing with your foot over measuring tape 2. Take note of the length to the end of your longest toe, and then add .5CM. That is the length you will use for the size chart. Our opinion, measuring in CM is easier for this and more precise. 3. Our shoes should feel snug around the ball of the foot, for the first week or first few rides. Then, they will form to your foot and become extremely comfy!*After the campaign’s success, we’ll contact you to ask for your choice of color and size.Mens Size ChartWomans Size Chart","Weather - As we experienced with hurricanes Irma and Maria, unusual weather can cause US shipping ports to slow down. A recent batch of shoes was held up in customs due to this, for an additional 3 weeks as the port of Miami came back online and internal problems sorted.Markets - The fashion industry is inherently fickle; styles and trends come and go. Since our products have a timeless style, they're less susceptible to these fluctuations. ""Quality, it is said... never goes out of style.""Production - From design work, to manufacturing, to exporting, there are many areas that can be difficult or run the chance for problems while making a shoe. Luckily, we have set ourselves up to be as self-sufficient as possible. For example, all product design is done in-house. Manufacturing & quality control is also handled on-site by our team in Colombia. We have great relationships with our manufacturer's. We work with them directly to ensure quality at every stage, with every part/item and are prepared to handle any situation that may arise. Shipping/Importing is handled by our broker that has well over 20 years in the business."

Then hover your mobile device over the page, and see how all the characters will come to life.More and more often, we are facing the problem that children spend huge amount of time behind mobile devices and computers. As a consequence, children spend less time playing valuable educational games or drawing and reading and spend less time on the overall well-rounded development.It is becoming extremely difficult to make children who are born in the age of information technology to be interested in something educational and useful that is not related to new technologies.Since the young age, we often hand our kids a tablet or a phone and turn on a game for them to play, but the tablets and phones are the future. So how to turn this into exiting and positive experience that is also educational?We started thinking about this problem, and began looking for a solution on how to make children interested in doing meaningful activities on their own. We thought of an idea to create a solution that will combine children’s beloved tablet with typical educational toys. The idea is founded on the principle of Augmented Reality, which is based on the result of children’s creativity coming to life on mobile devices.One of the advantages of our coloring book is that the drawing will not come to life until the child completelycolors in the characters. To make the drawing come alive using the application installed on a mobile device,every page of the coloring book has to be coloured completely.After this is done a small miracle happens: a flat image of the drawing will appear in the form of a live three-dimensional scene, where everything is decorated with the same exact colors.All the characters become interactive and respond to touch.This way, page after page, children will create their own world. They will meet new characters and play fun and educational games, which will undoubtedly develop creative thinking and install thirst for learning new things.This will help develop children’s imagination since they can choose the colors for their characters and createthem with their own hands. Each coloring book is a separate story with its own plot, and every page offers aunique experience of a magical world where children can play with all the characters: they will be smiling,singing, crawling, jumping and laughing.""Thanks to Arnimate, a unique augmented reality experience designed specifically with children in mind, coloring is more than just filling in the lines: It’s a fully immersive experience..."" Read moreThe main character of every coloring book is a robot called Arni. From the very beginning Arni captivates you with an amazing story, in which you interact with him in many ways. In the story he used to live on a distant bright planet, but one day a mysterious rain fell and washed away all the colors from the surrounding world, and the world froze. Arni went on a space journey to find help eventually arriving to planet Earth. Unfortunately this ominous cloud passed through here too, and made all his friends loose their colors. Despite all, Arni found the children and asked them to help him color the frozen world with bright colors so his friends will come to life.STORY OF ARNIWe work closely with experts in the field of childhood education. They help us select the most suitable material for perception and education. We tirelessly worked on creating the scripts, 3D models, and the software. We selected only the best drawings and characters that children liked the most and that were recommended by the experts. In order to finalise our first book, create second one and finally realise our first project, we need your support.Unlike in the case of our competitors, the user can interact with all the objects and the characters bytouching the touch sensor of the mobile device. In response, the objects will move, make sounds and will benicely highlighted. All the characters will talk, laugh, run, play and entertain the user in highly interactivescenes.We have created especially beautiful and diverse surrounding world in all the scenes. Almost every elementof the world is an interactive object. Greater number of characters adds liveliness and energy.The scene comes to life only after the drawing is completely colored. This feature keeps children’s interest in coloring from the first page to the last, motivating children to dream and helping them to develop their imagination.There are mini-games and one complete game in the scenes of our product, which definitely makes the process of child’s interaction with the coloring book more interesting, and entices him or her into the creative process even more.We have come a long way in creating Arni coloring books. In order for us to release the first adventure, to finalize and deliver it, we need your help! Only you can help us by backing our project and sharing it with others. Let's help Arni and bring back colours to his planet!","The first live coloring book is almost ready, second one is 30% ready. We have made a lot of tests of each drawing in our App which is ready. We are very confident that everything will be done on time or earlier  The real risks are printing and logistics. We already agreed about book printing with the printing house.

This is an important condition in our companion animals, and it should not be dismissed as simply a result of inadequate training or socialization.Leaving your pet home alone for extended periods of time dramatically increases their chances of experiencing depression.If pets have no physical stimulation while at home, they can quickly become obese, leading to heart problems and other physical ailments.Featuring AutoStart and AutoStop functions, Gomiball continuously moves in irregular patterns through an evolving algorithm. This keeps your pet engaged and their mind stimulated, lessening the probability of depression.Unlike basic toys, GomiBall is able of 12 different interractions. The smart interractions of GomiBall help your pet to play for a long time without even growing bored.DurabilityNo matter how strong your pet is, the GomiBall can keep up! Made from rugged polycarbonate plastic that is approved by the FDA for pet play, as well as vegetable inks, the toy is both durable and anti-bacterial to keep your pet safe.We chose to go with Kickstarter and crowdfunding for many reasons. One of those is because manufacturing and production is expensive and we need the help!

The story is set in a psychiatric hospital in London in 1956. In that time period, scientists experimented with the new drug LSD.In this film, the main character Harry Thomas gets LSD to deal with his repressed guilt. He encounters his worst demons in a journey through his subconscious.Lenght: 8.5 minutesGenre: DramaThe story plays with the differences between medical treatment, self-medication and substance abuse. The use of LSD to treat alcoholism makes us think of the way attitudes towards drugs can be manipulated by their function.The hallucinogenic properties of LSD provides very exciting opportunities for visually exploring the unconscious mind.The lighting and sound will try to recreate the grand spectacle of films like The Great Beauty and The Great Gatsby as well as showing the influence of the unreliable perspectives of films like Inception, Shutter Island and Donnie Darko.The use of slow-motion and variable frame speed will be particularly effective in this regard. The use of tracking and dolly shots will create a personal and subjective journey trough the party, focusing mainly on the characters from his past.The money that we hope to collect with this Kickstarter campaign will be spend on transportation, a big set filled with fancy props and furniture and crazy costumes, hair and make-up.We have a big dream and we hope you want to help us realize it.",There are no risks because we are support from the European Film College with equipment and post production rooms.,https://www.kickstarter.com/projects/1800785908/intergalactic-moving-services?ref=discovery_category_newest,1800785908/intergalactic-moving-services," “Intergalactic Moving Services” is a sci-fi comedy about two moving men, and best friends, Waheed and Lasse, who are forced to work as smuglers for the local mafia boss Isamu. One day they in protest refuse to deliver a package, which was an organic eel looking weapon, that Isamu wanted to use to get superpowers. It quickly turns out that Isamu isn’t happy about that, so they end up in his torture cellar, where they are near death. While they are about to say goodbye to their lifes, they get rescued by Isamu’s alien secretary, who turns out to have a lot more to offer than you'd think, especially with that eel looking weapon. This experience makes them all realize how important it is to act, instead of just closing the eyes, and how true friendship really is the most important thing in the end.( Before VFX )Creating a different worldTo create a different world, we would focus a lot on set design and props.

A low quality fret board makes even the nicest musical instrument sound out of tune. I know - I've built them. Below, you can see a Guitar I built some 25 years ago. I love it, but the fretboard is definitely sub-par. (I could have bought a fret board for the guitar, as it is a relatively standard fretboard. I was just too darn cheap back then.)Over the last few years, the digital revolution has changed the way we do things. CNC machines quickly and accurately make parts. 3D printers do rapid prototypes in plastic and even metal. But the lowly fretboard is still often made the same way - slotting one painstaking fret at a time. Until now. Using a Raspberry Pi for a brain and an Arduino for a controller, this machine will slot a fret board with only a few taps on the built in touch screen.Below is a video showing me fabricating an aluminum part on a $25K Tormach PCNC 1100 machine. I include it to show that I know CNC, and am not just a dreamer. My proposed Simple Slotter machine is designed around many low cost off-the-shelf components and CNC cut aluminum parts. Tweaking and modifying is only done where absolutely necessary. The result should be a surprisingly low cost but high quality machine.

This includes the off the shelf CNC parts (linear rails, lead screws, stepper motors, and electronics) and their timely delivery.  It also includes the custom CNC cut parts.  Long lead times have been built into the project to address the potential supply issues.  I have a limited ability to machine the CNC cut parts myself.  If large quantities of machines are ordered, I will need to farm out production.  However, funding levels have been chosen so that this can be done without jeopardizing the project.",https://www.kickstarter.com/projects/morrismodels/kinetic-engine-art-laser-cut-model-kits?ref=discovery_category_newest,morrismodels/kinetic-engine-art-laser-cut-model-kits,"Morris Models engine kits are a unique combination of mechanics, history, and art. They are precise and intricate artistic representations of historic engine genres. They are also accurate and interactive. The internal parts are clearly visible. When you turn a Morris Models engine power shaft, all of the internal parts move as they should. Accurate enough to be used in a classroom, these models take engine art to new heights. Designed for convenient wall display, they are a must have for your favorite modeler, engine enthusiast, or teacher. Last year, our successful Kickstarter campaign launched our business. This year, we are breaking new ground. In this Kickstarter campaign, we are offering more engine models and improved kits. In addition to the precision CNC laser cut plywood parts from last year, we are now offering precision CNC cut shafting. These new parts will make for easier and more accurate assembly and for better working models.Measuring about 10.5 by 10.5 inches, our single cylinder engine kit was inspired by the same air-cooled lawnmower engines that taught generations of mechanics.The cam and combustion chamber have been split into two and placed on either side of the piston to allow all the moving parts to be fully visible. This engine features twin cams, a 2.5 inch bore, and a 2 inch stroke. It has a little over 50 parts. Expected construction time is around 1 to 5 hours. It makes a great introduction to our engine models without the large scale commitment. This is our easiest piston engine kit to assemble. We believe this kit requires an intermediate skill level to successfully assemble.Links: Manual and Assembly Video.The Wankel Engine has been a favorite of gear-heads for a long time. Instead of using pistons that reciprocate inside cylinders, this engine features a single triangular rotor that spins inside a carefully shaped trochoid chamber. Guided by an eccentric shaft and gearing, the rotor maintains contact with the sides of the housing. Ports are machined into the side housing or the chamber wall, and open and close as the rotor moves past. No moving valves are required.Our stylized, flattened cutaway version was inspired by the Mazda RX-8 engine. Unlike many of the tiny plastic model Wankel engines available, our model is large enough to easily see – even from across the room. Our model is about 11.5 inches wide and tall, and is almost the same size as the engine that inspired it. It features a true trochoid design, engraved “seals” on appropriate parts, movable apex seals, and twin non-functional spark plugs. Click here to see a video with more details.Like a real Wankel engine, our kit has very few parts. This makes assembly very quick and easy. Expected completion time is about 1 to 4 hours. We believe the construction of this kit requires an intermediate skill level.Links: Manual and Assembly Video.Our V-twin engine model was inspired by the iconic Harley® Sportster® engine which was introduced during the 1950’s. Our model has been rearranged to give the best view of all of the moving parts, including the four separate camshafts. A nonfunctional carburetor helps to complete the look. It has a 2 inch bore and stroke, and the pistons feature engraved piston rings. This kit also includes a three speed operational transmission. We feel that this is one of our most artistic models.This model is about 14 inches tall and 17 inches wide. It has around 350 parts. Assembly time is estimated at about 5 to 15 hours. We believe that this kit requires an advanced skill level to assemble. Links: Manual. (Video will be produced shortly.)Our 7 cylinder radial engine kit was not patterned off any particular engine, but was heavily influenced by the Wright Whirlwind and the Pratt and Whitney Wasp engines of the 1920’s and 1930’s. This engine was designed to show off as many of the moving parts as possible. Stylistically, it echos many of the architectural and decorative Art Deco elements of the time period. It measures about 17 inches in diameter with a 1.75 inch bore and a 2 inch stroke. The crankcase houses a highly authentic master and articulating rod arrangement, and the valve case houses an authentic 6-lobed retrograde cam plate. This kit has more moving parts than any of our other engines.This engine kit is an advanced building project, and contains around 500 pieces. Expect to spend between 10 and 30 hours building the model.Links: Manual and Assembly Video.The WWI Rotary Engine shares a name with the more modern Wankel Rotary engine, but nothing else. At first glance it looks very like a radial engine, but it is not one of those, either. The entire engine spins along with the prop. When comparing this engine with our radial engine model, you get an appreciation for how engine design advanced in the early 1900's.Our rotary engine was heavily inspired by the French Clerget series of engines. It features an authentic master and articulating connecting rod system in the rotating crankcase. The forward valve case features a simple but elegant gerotor-like valve mechanism running on twin eccentric shafts fastened to the front of the stationary crank. This mechanism seems to be unique to the Clerget engine (click here to see a video of the inside of the engine). The exhaust dumps into the open air in front of the whirling cylinders while on the bottom part of the engine’s rotation. The intake is through a hollow crankshaft on the top half of rotation. Our engine has a stroke of 2 inches and a bore of 2 inches. It measures about 16 inches in diameter. Since the whole engine spins, it is difficult to interact with unless it is mounted to some type of base.This engine kit is an advanced building project, and contains around 450 pieces. Expect to spend between 10 and 30 hours building the model. Links: Manual and Video not yet complete.This engine was definitely inspired by the Continental and Lycoming engines that power most of today's production light aircraft. It was also our first engine with more than one row of pistons. In order to see past the first row, we developed a unique skeletonized format for this engine where the piston runs back and forth on tiny tracks. It has the same valve arrangement as a Lycoming O-320. Our most detailed model to date, this engine was designed with a flight instructor's office in mind. Unlike our other engines, this one is designed to be held together by bolts or screws. This allows it to be easily disassembled and reassembled. Even the connectingrods can be attached and removed from the crankshaft. The engine is full of authentic details right down to the cooling fins inside the pistons and twin decorative spark plugs. This model contains around 350 pieces, and will take about 5 to 25 hours to complete. It is about 17.5 inches wide and 7 inches tall. It can easily be mounted to a wall, but it is also at home sitting on a shelf. We rate this kit as an advanced skill level build.Links: Manual and Video not yet complete. If you wish to order more than one model, please physically adjust your pledge amount. Add the full Kickstarter price (a significant discount over the retail price) of whatever models you would like to your pledge. If you are in the US, no additional shipping is needed. Outside the US, please add an additional $10 per engine in shipping. You will be given an opportunity to specify which additional models you want when you fill out your reward survey at the end of the campaign. Additional engines that are not fully paid for cannot be shipped. Assembling a Morris Models Kit is a unique experience, combining aspects of jigsaw puzzles, fine woodworking, and engine work. Our kits will come with a detailed step-by-step construction manual. Most of our engines will also have detailed construction videos. The videos follow along with the steps in the manuals, so that if you are having trouble with a particular step in the manual, you can quickly find the appropriate section of the video. We use Elmer's Glue-All glue on our prototypes. However, any glue that works on wood may be used.Our engines are assembled layer by layer out of 1/8"" (3mm) Baltic Birch plywood. Wherever possible, small holes are included. This allows you to pin the parts in position while gluing the layers together. In most cases, we recommend that these alignment pins be removed before the glue dries. Our kits range from the 10 layer single cylinder engine kit to the 35 layer opposed aircraft engine.Before assembling, you should locate all of the parts and gently sand off any splinters with fine sandpaper. You may also wish to remove traces of smoke and laser scorching with alcohol or fine sandpaper. Some of the parts in our kits have to be a little thicker or a little thinner than the others in order for the engines to spin freely. These may require you to sand away some of the material on these parts. While not required, access to a power sander is definitely helpful for this process.Our kits may be assembled without any additional finishes. This is how we have assembled all of the prototypes shown here in photos and videos. It is also possible to stain, paint, or varnish the models, but only thin finishes should be used. Care must be taken when selecting paints, stains, or other finishes because these could interfere with the glue chosen to assemble the kits. We are aware of people who have successfully used oil based and acrylic finishes on their kits in order to colorize them.Our engine kits are not powered, and they do not include working ignition. Many people have added motors to spin the engines, and we are aware of at least two people who have added LED lights as spark plugs. However, we cannot help you with this process. We welcome you to check out the forum on our web site, and to post details of what you do with our kits.The engines shown in our Kickstarter Introduction video were temporarily powered by a Milwaukee 18 volt drill. Because of the wooden bearings, we do not recommend that our kits be continuously motorized or spun at high speeds. Nevertheless, the video (which is not sped up) shows you how fast we are willing to spin our engines. Morris Models is a small, family owned business. Our models are cut on our own in-house CO2 laser cutter. We have developed our own proprietary cutting systems that minimizes scorching, smoke, and after-flash damage - but it does not eliminate it. Our prototypes are typical of the cutting process. Take a close look at our prototype models to see what your parts will typically look like.While on the subject of looking closely, please also notice the burrs on the hand-cut dowel pin shafts on our prototypes. If this Kickstarter campaign is successful, these will be upgraded to custom manufactured CNC cut parts. These will be cut with much closer tolerances and will have a much better appearance. Any models purchased through our web site will not have these upgraded shafts until all the Kickstarter rewards have been delivered.","This project has very few risks associated with it.  We have already demonstrated with our previous Kickstarter that we are capable of producing quality models and delivering what we promise.  The CNC machinery we need to make our custom parts is not particularly complicated.  Should we have more backers than anticipated, we are fully prepared to farm out the production of these parts to other local businesses. It is our goal to deliver all of our promised rewards early or on-time.  One of the ways that we intend to make this happen is to produce all of the laser cut parts as soon as it is apparent that the Kickstarter will be successful.  This will allow us to much more quickly fulfill orders as soon as the new pins are available.  We intend to manufacture these parts in-house.Our single biggest concern at the moment is  the global supply chain and its potential interruption with the Coronavirus.  It is possible that this could effect our ability to get small parts.  However, we have substantial stocks of materials and parts, and do not believe that this will become an issue.  Nevertheless, should parts and supplies become unavailable, delivery of rewards may be halted until alternate suppliers can be found.  If this becomes a problem, we will notify you immediately."

Everything began with the landing of my son Victor. He is the hero and pioneer who travels through the universe of Babynauten. Seeing the world through his eyes was the first lesson. At the same time keeping one’s eyes on the practical elements that make the daily routine easier for both.How many tears flow in the first months while getting dressed and undressed? Every appointment turns into a fight of time and the daily challenge of putting all together. It seems you always need a hundred things. Each single piece of my collection is inspired by everyday situations, everyone with kids knows.It's a practical body for newborns made from a colorful sweater material. Robust on the outside, it is unbelievable fluffy and soft within. An integrated hood, mittens and a detachable button-on scarf makes everyone's life easier. With this first model Victor geared up to start and caused a lot of enthusiasm. He grew bigger and Babynaut N°2 for toddlers and N°3 for his first own excursions outdoors followed.Made for indoors and outdoors these jumpsuits combine many clothes into one.Victor has grown up to a Meganaut. The time changes the demands and the child’s activities. Totally different problems have to be solved like damaged trousers, mobility when rollicking around and excitement when getting dressed saves time in the morning.Babynauten as well as Meganauten is a colorful building blocks system. Every single piece is practical, combinable and modifiable. Robust and comfortable this children's clothing is great for romping around and without getting changed your little one is perfectly dressed for the next birthday party.We want to determine ourselves the materials that are used for the manufacturing with our great partner in Greece and aspire to make a sustainable, environmentally friendly and high quality product. We say NO to the throwaway culture.We want to satisfy you and your little ones with our great and colorful collection. To make this heart’s desire and our dream come true we need your support! Unfortunately the time is short. And a small part of the financing is all that's missing.Our expedition continues and I am very excited where it is going to take us. I hope we all together can achieve this goal.",All Babynauten pieces we sell are waiting for you at our warehouse. What you buy will be shipped into your kind hands. The brand new Meganauten collection is in production process in Greece and will be finished around October.,https://www.kickstarter.com/projects/swiss-advance/multifunctional-picnic-blanket?ref=discovery_category_newest,swiss-advance/multifunctional-picnic-blanket,"The Swiss Multifunctional Picnic BlanketOur handmade picnic blanket consists of high-quality cotton. It is made of two layers and is free of synthetic materials. The bottom layer is made of Scottish waxed cotton canvas, which is water-repellent and insulating. As a result, the moisture of the soil or the meadow cannot get through the picnic blanket.The top layer consists of a soft organic cotton fleece and therefore offers additional comfort. No synthetic components are added to the material, which means that there is no static charge. The fluffy, cuddly soft fleece is absorbent, breathable and easy to care for. The brass eyelets and the push buttons create many options to use it for example as a tarp.Use it as a simple sleeping bag by closing the push buttons lengthways. You can also close two buttons at both ends and make a kind of poncho that keeps you cozy and warm in the evenings around a campfire. Or just use the blanket on the sofa at home on cold days.We also add 19 m of hemp rope, which is made in a Swiss rope factory. In total there are 5 pieces of rope: 1 x 6 meters (236.2 in) and 4 x 3 meters (118.1 in). On each corner of the blanket is a brass eyelet. Together with the rope you can easily make a shade sail between trees or you can create a windbreak.By the way: Applying additional wax to the canvas increases the water resistance as well as the durability and lifespan of the blanket. As with a conventional wax jacket, it is worth pampering the canvas with extra beeswax every now and then.The design and idea for this picnic blanket is a tribute to the well-known Swiss army blanket. Whether in a gray-brown or gray-green basic tone - it is always decorated with a bright red bar that is embroidered with a white cross. It has not been produced in Switzerland for almost 20 years and the production facilities have been closed. It is now manufactured in Italy.The Zelttuch 64, a tarp used by the Swiss army and scouts, also inspired us. Unfortunately, the production of Zelttuch 64 in Switzerland was also discontinued. This is mostly due to the costs. The costs rise and the existing customers are no longer willing to pay the price at some point or new customers fail to appear.Our society is fast moving. Things no longer have the same value for many people as they used to. But we believe that this does not apply to everyone. There are many like you and me to whom quality is important and above all who do not want to participate in the throw-away society. For this reason, our multi-purpose picnic blanket is almost handmade in a sewing school (Nähwerk IDM) in Switzerland. Of course, they also work with sewing machines ...At IDM the olive green canvas and the gray cotton fleece are cut and sewn. The blanket is embroidered with our logo in bright red. Of course, a red line should not be missing to pay tribute to the Swiss army blanket. However, it is a fine, reduced, red stitching. Our eyelets and snaps are made in Switzerland and attached to the picnic blanket at IDM.Our high-quality multifunctional picnic blankets for camping and home use are manufactured in the Bernese Oberland (Thun, Switzerland) in the IDM sewing workshop. On the one hand, the IDM is a training center for clothing designers and clothing sewers on the other hand, it is a center of excellence for textile solutions. The learners should be trained in a realistic work environment. From the second year of training onwards, they already implement real orders in the production studios.Hand wash at 30 °C, do not bleach, do not iron hot, do not dry clean or tumble dry.Kickstarter Supporter – Cotton Patches:You like our concept and would like stay updated on the progress of the campaign: Get two embroidered cotton patches.

The costliest and in almost all cases, the vital component’s skimped on by the vast majority of action camera companies.Without a purpose built microprocessor you will never achieve fluid and faultless footage, likewise, without a quality lens you are left with results that are lacking in various departments and as for the battery, you need a quality power source in order to shoot footage continuously and without the constant worry of the battery running flat.The microprocessor gives the camera the ability to capture high frame rates of footage through to the ability to write the captured data to the memory card quick enough to stop a bottleneck of data which results in patchy video playback.We had an idea of what we wanted but we needed to understand exactly how to match key components and then fit them into a case that would match up with similar products on the market. We know that many people have large stocks of accessories that work with a multitude of action cameras so we had to make sure that we were compliant with existing fittings.After working with some leading camera developers and designers we started the project byutilisingan existing camera case with the standard 6cmx4cmx3cm size so that we could try and achieve a camera that we could fit into a type of “industry standard”. This was actually a great start as it gave us a readymade prototype design, in turn saving us months of potential development and prototype designing enabling us to move directly onto the component list rather that spending the time on size development.The issues that did however prove very difficult along the design path were that we chose to utilize several new functions which included a touch screen rear section, a super-fast Wi-Fi system and a cooling area around the microprocessor which would allow the user the ability to shoot footage, swap batteries and/or memory cards when expired and then continue to shoot further footage without concern over the temperature of the camera. This may not seem like an issue faced by the average user but remember that our number one aim was to build a camera for the most extreme of conditions so each eventuality had to be reviewed during the design and process stage.We had various options for the micro and although the cost is prohibitive, we opted for the NTK processors because it allowed us several factors that we felt were vital for our final product.Once the option of microprocessor was chosen we had to confirm the lensthat we would be using for our cameras and although the options were varied, we quickly opted for the wide angle approach using both the 166 and 170 degree wide angle lens with 16mp capability.The battery proved quite a simple choice, Li-ion 3.7v low consumption, slow drain batteries were the only option, these assured us of meeting the demands of the microprocessor, the power needed to allow continuous data transfer and the slow depletion of charge allowing for extended shooting time.Now for the big problem, we had all of the components needed to build our prototype camera but the cost per unit was a staggering £1243 for components alone. This sadly meant that in its current guise, we would never be able to manufacture the camera and sell it to our initial target market of the average action camera user.This left us with one option; we had to travel to the world’s leading electronics district, Shenzhen in China so in February 2017 we flew from the UK to China.We met with various suppliers and electronics manufacturers including the manufacturer of the microprocessors and lens and we sat down to discuss our project and what we were hoping to achieve.During this trip we were able to convince suppliers to provide us the parts needed to build our camera at a price that meant we are able to become competitive within the marketplace whilst supplying the highest quality end product. The only requirement that we needed on our part was the purchase a laser printer for the main boards of the camera and an assembly robot to fit the components of the camera onto the main board. With this secured we were ready to go into production of the camera and finally put our project into production.With one trip we were able to not only acquire the equipment needed to build our cameras but also to secure a deal for the supply of the components at a price that meant our cameras can be made and sold at a price that was not only competitive but meant that we could charge a “middle of the road” price for a “top of the line” product.Our current position is a world away from our starting point; we have so far achieved the following:18 months after our initial idea of building our own extreme action camera and the first prototypes have been made and tested and the results are nothing short of stunning.We have not only managed to build an action camera that can shoot the highest quality high definition 4k footage but we have achieved it at less than half of the price of similar devices on the market and we couldn't be happier but this is where Kickstarter comes to our aid.We now have the ability to take these cameras into full production but the initial setup cost is the only thing we are lacking and so this story on Kickstarter begins. With your help we can start our business and provide the highest quality, action cameras and for your help, we are offering you a camera that will blow your mind.So far we have the design and stock components to build over 4000 cameras together with the microprocessor and lenses needed to make our dream a reality.      With your help we can raise the funds needed for the outer casing which is vital to the project and which makes our camera design so different from others on the market place. We have the material needed to make a case that limits vibration when the camera is moving at high velocity which in turn results in the smoothest and most vivid footage but in order to mold these new cases we need the investment for the design and tooling which is required to mold the cases. With this new case our project will become complete and our dream to provide a world leading action cam will be complete.Your investment will enable us to have CAD drawings completed for a new housing and to have the molds made and the cases produced which will complete our project and allow us to start selling these amazing action cameras.With our project complete we will finally be able to provide an action cam that anyone can use and that allows you to take footage in Ultra HD like this:What we will use the KickStarter money for:We will use the money raised by our Kickstarter project to secure the tooling to manufacture the case for our cameras which will enable them to be used in the most demanding and extreme conditions.We have reviewed many materials for the case and have chosen the finest available to enable us to be securely confident that we will produce and provide the best mobile action camera available on the market today. Each material has been selected for its varying properties which when matched together will be nothing short of breathtaking.For the outer case we have chosen Polyether ether ketone (PEEK), it is a colorless organic thermoplastic polymer in the polyaryletherketone (PAEK) family, used in the finest engineering applications.PEEK is a semi crystalline thermoplastic with excellent mechanical and chemical resistance properties that are retained to high temperatures making it the ideal choice for the camera surround which allows the internal camera to be protected against even the wildest of extreme conditions so whether you are shooting footage whilst dropping from a plane at 20,000ft or if you are flying a drone over a volcano, our camera will be the perfect choice.The inner seal and dampening cushions of the camera are made from high grade Polyurethanes which are often used in the manufacture of high-resilience foam seating, rigid foam insulation panels, microcellular foam seals and gaskets; this makes the ideal material to remove vibration from the footage during exhilarating experiences like base-jumping and racecar driving.The buttons and springs of the case are made from Aircraft grade Aluminum and stainless, these were chosen for the lightweight properties and anti-corrosion properties.We have made our cameras waterproof through the use of the seals above and so the screws and buttons for the case cover must of course be waterproof.We are also utilising a vibration seal on the lens cap, a world first in the Action camera market and we think vital if you want to lower the ""blurring"" effect when skydiving and when using in high wind instances.As with the case, we will also be using the same grade materials for our car securing pads as these will offer incredibly strong wind resistance and ultra-strong grip to the vehicles body or glass through the suction cup.With the Kickstarter funds we will have the tooling made and the first batch of cases completed, ready for early distribution in July 2017.","The main challenge of our project is the tooling needed to complete volume production. At the moment we have the ability to produce the cameras within the price budget we have set but we would have to use standard type cases to house the cameras and this would mean the loss of some valuable functions like gyro correction, stability under extreme wind conditions, wide angle footage etc. In order to achieve our goal of the most usable action camera on the market we need to raise the money to manufacture our own tooling to injection mold our own camera case that allows both wide angle footage as well as being strong enough to withstand air speeds in excess of 300mph for the most extreme of conditions.Design and tooling will cost £19,800 and the remainder of the money we are raising will  be used to make a production run of the initial 4000 camera cases and finalise new functions on our App which will be in the Android and Apple stores. We will then invest further as business expands to add more functions to the App based on customer feedback and personalised requirements.We plan to ship all cameras to investors in July of 2017. Here is a breakdown of our schedule given the backing of kickstarter.Day 1 - Kickstarter funding secured.Day 2 - Instructions given to tooling manufacturer to release designs for the outer case.Day 9 - Acceptance of chosen design from those submitted.Day 10 - 50% deposit paid to tooling company for the machining of the injection moulding machine.Day 14 - Initial batch of cases run for sample testing.Day 14-18 Time to evaluate the samples and to alter tooling if needed.Day 21 - Sign off on tooling.Day 22 - Initial production run of 4000 production ready 2020 Action Camera Cases.Day 23 - Collection of cases.Day 24-28 Build of initial 4000 2020 Action Cameras.Day 29 - Ready to ship to backers.During the initial 22 days, we will be building the first order of cameras together with testing them and placing them in the correct batch order ready for the case arrivals and immediate dispatch to backers.We have pre-prepared staff ready for building to commence given the kickstarter backing success.",https://www.kickstarter.com/projects/2020cam/2020cam-the-worlds-leading-high-end-sports-action?ref=discovery_category_newest,2020cam/2020cam-the-worlds-leading-high-end-sports-action,"The Beginning:As with so many people around the world, I was looking for an action camera that provided exactly what I needed, not just a ""one size fits all approach"" but something special, something that would allow me to shoot ultra-high definition footage in real world applications where wind resistance puts huge pressure on the camera and in turn causes vibration and a loss of fluent, clear, usable footage.Over the years I had purchased and used most of the action cameras on the market from the cheaper £100 units through to the ""market leading"" £700 ones and although some were ""decent"" quality, they all lacked at least one of the 6 vital ingredients I was looking for:It is one thing to have an affordable action camera but if the footage is poor or the battery life is measured in minutes then its value in real world applications is worthless, likewise it’s no good to have a quality camera the average user simply can't afford!I decided that it was time to design and develop an action cameras that with incredibly high quality fittings can easily be used within a multitude of applications and that would give the highest quality results even in the most demanding of situations and more importantly, at a price that is affordable.

We had an idea of what we wanted but we needed to understand exactly how to match key components and then fit them into a case that would match up with similar products on the market, I guess this is the stumbling block for most camera companies, to get the desired components into a small enough case that is fit for the purpose of the action camera market yet at the same time do it at a price point that makes the item competitive yet makes vast profits.

Whether you need waterproof case for racing, biking, hiking or watersports, or if you need something dustproof, the 2020Cam case adds great value to your action camera.Audio:During our initial Kickstarter we had been asked a few times about the audio side of the action camera and although this really wasn't something we were overly concerned about because our aim was for ultimate picture quality and use, we realise that buyers are the people we must listen too so if it is a ""wanted feature"", we must listen.So with that in mind, we are going to be fitting an upgraded mic system to the camera unit, the ultra sensitive ""dynamic duo"" by Voice Technologies Industries gives us a leading jump on the action cameras currently on the market. Normally used for spy cameras and hidden recording, the dynamic duo will yield superb sound for our cameras.So, now for the price - its FREE, a free upgrade on all of our cameras with our kickstarter project packages.Please make sure that you subscribe to our Kickstarter page, we will be updating and answering questions daily.2020Cam","Risks and challengesThe main challenge of our project is the tooling needed to complete volume production. At the moment we have the ability to produce the cameras within the price budget we have set but we would have to use standard type cases to house the cameras and this would mean the loss of some valuable functions like gyro correction, stability under extreme wind conditions, wide angle footage etc. In order to achieve our goal of the most usable action camera on the market we need to raise the money to manufacture our own tooling to injection mold our own camera case that allows both wide angle footage as well as being strong enough to withstand air speeds in excess of 300mph for the most extreme of conditions. Costs:Design and tooling of case mould will cost £19,800 The cost of building the initial 500 cameras will cost £2640 in additional labour.Final design/build/testing of app will be £17,500 We have invested nearly £100,000 so far into this project getting us to this point and are so close to moving forward and into full blown production.We had in fact run a Kickstarter project last month but having never done anything like it before we realised that we had missed some vital information viewers needed to invest with a full understanding of what they were actually investing in.Even with the above in mind we have continued to work on funding and have secured a further £25,000 so are only £15,000 short of making this happen.We plan to start shipping cameras to investors in August of 2017.

https://www.kickstarter.com/projects/nwelixirs/bangkok-is-back?ref=discovery_category_newest,nwelixirs/bangkok-is-back,"Hello family and friends!!!! Yes we are back again with another awesome project. This time we are raising funds to bring back our NW Elixirs Bangkok Hott.After a slow 2014 in retail spaces we decided to pull back production of Bangkok Hott and begin to phase it out. In 2015 we had completely phased out production. However our loyal fans reminded us over and over they wanted it back. By 2016 we had stopped producing our Bangkok Hott completely, focusing in on the continued development of our World Hott Sauce Award winning Hott Jolokia.When GQ Magazine listed NW Elixirs as one of 2016's 10 best gifts for men under $100 and we were featured on Live With Kelly, where guest Anderson Cooper drank our Bangkok Hott Straight from the bottle, things really changed. Bangkok Hott is back in heavy demand and we want to get it to you.Bangkok Hott is one of our most diverse sauces, combining fish sauce, agave, garlic, ginger, Thai chilies, lemon grass, rice wine vinegar, and lime juice. Not only will it compliment all your Thai Cuisine but anything else you want to bring to the next level of delicious.This project is very straight forward as far as production. Our recipes have already been tested in the proper facilities, our labels are completely designed, and we are ready to go straight in to production as soon as the project is funded.","The biggest risk involved here is betting on the new fish sauce we are working with to be the best option for our sauce. It is totally organic and sustainable sometimes that can lead to flavor suffering. Another risk is the potential that there is a back up of sauce production. We work  closely with a food manufacturer who is very busy, which means that production could get bumped out a week or three.",https://www.kickstarter.com/projects/nwelixirs/new-from-nw-elixirs-bangkok-hott-and-rojo-hott?ref=discovery_category_newest,nwelixirs/new-from-nw-elixirs-bangkok-hott-and-rojo-hott,"Portland-renown Chef Andrew Garrett takes his love for spicy food to another level with these new NW Elixir sauces. Rojo Hott -- a blend delivering deep tones of cumin, roasted red chilies, roasted garlic, onions, thyme – is perfect for marinades and braising smoked meats and roasted vegetables. Asian cuisine, meet Bangkok Hott. This sauce is designed for any stir fry, grilled fish, or grilled vegetables. Thai chilies, basil, agave, fish sauce, garlic and chili flakes create our only non-vegetarian sauce. As always, you’ll never find any refined sugars, gums, or gluten in any Elixir sauce. ","We've been producing some of the world's best sauces for a few years. The biggest risk we face is an overwhelming response to our newest sauces. If we’re lucky enough to encourage more than 1,500 people to try these products, we’ll need more production time. That could push our next 1,500 backers rewards out another two to three weeks."

I, Tony Griffin, will start...Today, I am writing you with the hope of getting a lot of support. Asking for help has never really been a strength of mine, even to a fault. I’d like to tell you a story though, and by the end of it, I hope you feel empowered enough to support my mission. Here goes…I spent the majority of my life living in the greater Philadelphia area, in the borough of Bryn Athyn, Pennsylvania. I am quite proud of where I was raised and am humbled by the moral foundation the community helped me to develop. I was taught that, above all else, a life of love is actually a life of being useful and loving the neighbor. I hold that to be very true. I spent my higher education practicing that very teaching. After graduating with a degree in American History at Bryn Athyn College in 2010, I began teaching at my alma mater – The Academy of the New Church. It was there that I believe I found my passion. I learned that I love learning, educating, motivating, and helping others – specifically young adults. I saw teaching as my career and had no reason to do anything else. It was the fall of my second year of teaching that my perspective changed. October of 2011 I lost a dear friend. The last conversation I had with him revolved around pushing myself mentally, physically, and spiritually – not just relying on reputation. After his passing I knew I had to get out of Philadelphia and spread my wings. I knew I needed to put my faith to the test and I for sure have. No step has been easy the last two and a half years, but each step is my own and I am proud of it.Today marks a year since I decided to have a healthy relationship with food. Throughout my teenage years and even through my twenties I used food to be the way I controlled my parents’ divorce, anxiety, depression, and even self consciousness. The interesting thing was that food was just the manifestation of all my issues just in the form of lbs. I called my brother that day to ask for help. I asked for him to be on the phone every time I went to the store, anytime I went for a run, anytime I was weak, and he was there. I am here nearly 50 pounds lighter, but frankly who the hell cares, it wasn’t about being skinny, it was showing two things, someone believed in me and most importantly, believing in myself. I can say I know now that I love food and in the best non-indulgent way possible. It was when I started this journey of responsible eating and fitness that I realized I wanted to share that joy with others. I want other people to know there are healthier options, there are people to talk to about eating issues, and there is support for the road less traveled. I decided then that I wanted to work with food and I wanted to make it for others in a way that they wouldn’t feel shame or guilt about what went into their bodies. So, for the past year, every professional and personal decision I have made has been working to realize this dream. I quit my accounting job to start in the food industry in hopes of starting my own business. Many of you saw posts on Instagram, Facebook, and maybe even saw me on the streets of Denver making food for people. This is where my heart is. I left my job as an accountant last winter where I learned how to balance the books, and run the financial ends of a business. After I left the accounting gig I started up with a Cheesesteak food truck. I loved every second of it, from the community we built, to making damn good cheesesteaks, and even to sharing a piece of my life with others. I knew when I got that taste of the food truck life that it was a great business opportunity and it was a great way to share my story with others. Unfortunately, the cart lit on fire in May and I had to look elsewhere for income. It was then that a friend of mine, Chris Teigland showed up and took me under his wing. Chris was trained under A+E’s Americas Top Chef, Hosea Rosenberg. I have had the pleasure of learning how to make delicious, healthy, local, and beautiful dishes for people popping in for a bite at the winery I cook at, or at a catered event. I have had the opportunity to cook for the Food Network, the US Department of Agriculture, and this month I get the privilege to serve Microsoft. In a very short time I feel I have been given a crash course on how to run a business and I am confident I have the tools to take cities by storm with a food truck.For me though, its not all about the food. It is about the community that you build. I want my truck to be a hub for ongoings in the neighborhood. I want to play local music, display local art on the truck, ask a local artist to design the truck wrap, and even feature community inspired meals. When someone walks up to the truck to get a bite to eat, I want them to have a story behind it. I want each customer to walk away satisfied physically, morally, and spiritually, that’s what I have to offer. I want people to come to my food truck over their lunch because it is the best way to spend their one hour break – where they can meet up with other regulars and share a laugh, good music, and good food. I am asking for you to picture this and to believe in me because I believe in me.As I mentioned before, usefulness may very well be the most important word in my vocabulary. My mission is this: to educate, empower, inspire, and nourish one meal at a time. I plan on doing this by being straightforward with my ingredients, offering my recipes so that others can make tasty healthy meals themselves, and most importantly to give back. I will be giving back to those less fortunate in Denver, by offering meals, sponsoring causes, and running fundraisers. It is time for me to pay it forward and I believe this is the avenue I am supposed to take.Here is the hard part – asking for help. Being in the food business, money isn’t really in surplus. Here is where you come in… Starting December 1st, 2014 and ending January 5th, 2015 I will be running a Kickstarter to raise approximately $20,000.00 for my dream to come true. That is a lot of money. That should cover the cost of a truck/trailer, an LLC, county fees, commissary fees, and truck storage. So, if you have $1.00 or $1,000.00 consider giving your money to a cause that will genuinely help others. Please let me be a vessel to serve others – to educate empower, inspire and nourish the world. It would be my pleasure. I appreciate your time so very much! Stay tuned for a link on my Facebook and Instagram page December 1st!Now, a few words from Duncan Herder...I will spare you the details of our plan since Tony covered most of that above. Instead, I want to briefly share with you, the past several years of my life up to this point so that you have a better understanding of how I got here and how I fit into the food truck operation with Tony.Those of you who know me, know that I am a pretty weird guy, but the good kinda weird… if that makes sense. Anyway, I am sure most of you can agree that I’m generally a pretty happy, optimistic, outgoing and ""excited about life” kinda guy. Being active, surrounding myself with people and keeping my creative juices flowing is something I need to have in my life in order to feel like I am really thriving. In September of 2007, I went right into college straight out of high school without having a clue what I wanted to do. I had hopes that a major would come to me over time. After my first year of college, and unsuccessfully finding a major, I dropped out and figured I'd eventually find my passion and continue school elsewhere. After a couple years, I gave online classes a shot in pursuit of an associate’s degree in Web Design and Development. At first I was super excited about what I was getting into, but after a couple semesters, it slowly began to dawn on me that the career field I chose was more about pretending to have found my passion to distract me from the fact that I had absolutely no idea what I was going to do with my life. It sucked seeing the years go by with so many people around me graduating and starting a career in something they seemed to love, while I kept myself busy working different jobs like being a security guard at a museum, lifeguarding, cleaning, and getting up at 5am. to work at Panera prepping food. After several semesters and a couple years of adding and dropping classes in search for my passion, it just wasn’t the type of creativity I was searching for - I needed something that involved more connection with people and I needed something that challenged me and forced me to use my creativity in a much different way - the problem was that I still had no idea what I wanted to do, so I planned to continue going to school to keep myself from feeling like I let myself down and anyone else who was supporting me.After my Fall semester in 2013, I went into Christmas break unsure of whether I was going to continue school or pick up more hours at work and drop out. During this same time my relationship of 4.5 years ended and the year 2014 was off to a much different start than the previous years. I was still planning on continuing school, and starting a career in the IT field until a single Skype chat with Tony changed my life… literally. Within the first couple weeks of January, 2014, during one of our frequent Skype chats, Tony asked me if I would be interested in moving to Denver and living with him and we even discussed the idea of starting our own food truck. At first, it all seemed a bit farfetched for me to pick up and move so soon, but the more we talked about it, the more I realized how good it would be for me; even if I ended up moving out to Denver just for the year. Later that night, I decided I was going to make Denver my new home. I wanted a change in my life, I wanted to experience life in a different part of the country, I wanted to start living more freely and let my heart guide me, I wanted to put myself in a position that pushed me out of my comfort zone and ultimately force me to become a much more confident, independent person, I wanted to surround myself with people who share a similar passion for life and feed off their energy to make my life more meaningful. Here I am, approximately 9 months later, in Denver, living with my two best friends and working as a server at Balistreri Vineyards. My life is like night and day since I moved and I absolutely love the city of Denver.Alright, let’s get to the important part; the food truck. The food truck scene is really booming if you didn’t already know that, and Denver is one of the top cities for the food truck industry. Something that I love about food trucks is that you have creative freedom to make any food that you want to make and you are constantly surrounded by all types of people. It’s a vey exciting industry for people like me who have a lot of energy and love socializing. It would be such an amazing opportunity to use my creativity to make all-natural food that means something to me and not only looks and tastes delicious, but also stands out to people and potentially creates lasting memories for them. Food is something we all rely on to survive and there are so many different ingredients, with so many different ways you can incorporate them into dishes to create food that is unique and delicious. My hopes are that Tony and I can get enough donations to get us on our feet so we can start sharing our passion for unique, natural, delicious food with the rest of the world. As Tony mentioned above, he has learned a lot from our friend and chef Chris Teigland, and I’ve also learned my fair share while working with Chris. I believe Tony and I have what it takes to run a successful food truck and it’d be so appreciated if you would give us your support while we pursue our dream.Let me just finish by saying that Tony originally started hashing out this dream a while back and then told me about it and offered me to join him in his dream. Although this may not necessarily be MY dream, it's still something I am very passionate about. A food truck would allow me to let my creative side run free, while also keeping my outgoing, social-butterfly needs stimulated with all the people I would be surrounding myself with. That is what I believe my passion is - surrounding myself with people and using not only my imagination and creativity, but also my outlook on life to hopefully make everyone else happy.SO, here is the gist of what we’re asking for:$20,000.00 gets us comfortably on the streets of Denver with a food trailer. Obviously if we are able to raise more money so we can start to have the conversation of a larger scale truck and a bigger operation. But, for now, here is what $20,000.00 gets us...1.) Food Trailer2.) Pick-Up Truck (To pull the trailer)3.) Generator4.) Appliances and Cookware5.) Legal Process (LLC, fees, permits, etc.)6.) Branding (Truck Wrap, Promotional Items, etc.)7.) Food Trailer Accessories8.) Startup CostsThanks everyone for taking the time to read this. Please share this with everyone!Happy Holidays,Tony Griffin and Duncan Herder","As we briefly mentioned above, we both have spent the last few years in the food industry. We have experience in accounting, food preparation, food service, and most importantly, the food truck industry.

Please let us be a vessel to serve others – to educate empower, inspire and nourish the world. It would be our pleasure. We appreciate your time so very much!Now, a few words from Duncan Herder...I will spare you the details of our plan since Tony covered most of that above. Instead, I want to briefly share with you the past several years of my life up to this point so that you have a better understanding of how I got here and how I fit into the food truck operation with Tony.Those of you who know me, know that I am a pretty weird guy, but the good kinda weird… if that makes sense. Anyway, I am sure most of you can agree that I’m generally a pretty happy, optimistic, outgoing and ""excited about life” kinda guy. Being active, surrounding myself with people and keeping my creative juices flowing is something I need in my life in order to feel like I am really thriving. In September of 2007, I went right into college straight out of high school without having a clue what I wanted to do. I had hopes that I'd find a major to pursue soon enough, but that time never came. After my first year of college, and unsuccessfully finding a major, I dropped out with hopes that I'd find my passion and continue school elsewhere later on down the road. After a couple years, I gave online classes a shot in pursuit of an associate’s degree in Web Design and Development. At first I was super excited about what I was getting into, but after a couple semesters, it slowly began to dawn on me that it felt more like pretending to have found my passion to distract me from the fact that I had absolutely no idea what I was going to do with my life. It sucked seeing the years go by with so many people around me graduating and starting a career in something they seemed to love, while I kept myself busy working different jobs like being a security guard at a museum, lifeguarding, cleaning, and getting up at 5a.m. to prep food at Panera Bread. After several semesters and a couple years of adding and dropping classes, college just wasn't for me - I needed something that involved more connection with people and I needed something that challenged me and forced me to use my abilities in a much different way than college had to offer, the problem was that I still had no idea what I wanted to do.After my Fall semester in 2013, I went into Christmas break contemplating whether I'd continue pursuing something I had no real drive for. During this same time my relationship of 4.5 years ended and the year 2014 was off to a much different start than the previous years. I was still planning on continuing school, and eventually land a career in the IT field until a single Skype chat with Tony Griffin changed my life… literally. Within the first couple weeks of January, 2014, during one of our frequent Skype chats, Tony asked me if I would be interested in moving to Denver and living with him and we even discussed the idea of starting our own food truck. At first, it all seemed a bit farfetched for me to pick up and move so quickly with no real immediate plan, but the more we talked about it, the more I realized how good it would be for me; even if I ended up moving out to Denver just for the year. Later that night, I decided I was going to make Denver my new home. I wanted to change my life, I wanted to experience life in a different part of the country, I wanted to start living more freely and to start doing what felt right. I wanted to put myself in a position that pushed me out of my comfort zone and ultimately force myself to become a much more confident, and independent person. I wanted to surround myself with people who share a similar passion for life and feed off their energy to make my life more meaningful. Here I am, approximately 9 months later, in Denver, living with a couple of my best friends and working as a server at Balistreri Vineyards. My life is like night and day since I moved, and I absolutely love the city of Denver.Alright, let’s get to the important part; the food truck. The food truck scene is really booming if you didn’t already know that, and Denver is one of the top cities for the food truck industry, thanks to the expanding brewery scene. Something that I love about food trucks is that you have creative freedom to make any food that you want to make and you are constantly surrounded by different people, with different backgrounds. It’s a very exciting industry for people like me who have a lot of energy and love socializing. It would be such an amazing opportunity to use my creativity to make all-natural food that means something to me and not only looks and tastes delicious, but also stands out to people and potentially creates lasting memories for them. Food is something we all rely on to survive and there are so many different ingredients, with so many different ways you can incorporate them into dishes to create food that is unique and delicious. My hopes are that Tony and I can get enough donations to get us on our feet so we can start sharing our passion for unique, natural, delicious food with the rest of the world. As Tony mentioned above, he has learned a lot from friend and Chef Chris Teigland, and I’ve also learned my fair share while working with Chris. I was alongside Chris when he took 1st place in the Denver Winefest Pairsine event, in which he and many other chefs in the Denver area created a couple dishes to go with selected wines. I have been very fortunate to have spent the last year in the food industry learning from one of the best up and coming chefs in the area. I believe Tony and I have what it takes to run a successful food truck and we'd appreciate any support while we pursue our dream.Let me just finish by saying that Tony originally started hashing out this dream a while back and then told me about it and offered me to join him in his dream. Although this may not necessarily be MY dream, it's still something I am very passionate about. A food truck would allow me to let my creative side run free, while also keeping my outgoing, social-butterfly needs stimulated with all the people I would be surrounding myself with. That is what I believe my passion is - surrounding myself with people and using not only my imagination and creativity, but also my outlook on life to hopefully make everyone else happy. Food creates memories for everyone and I know our food will be no different.SO, here is the gist of what we’re asking for:$5,000.00 gets us comfortably on the streets of Denver with a food trailer. Obviously if we are able to raise more money, we could start to have the conversation of a bigger operation. But, for now, here is what $5,000.00 gets us...1.) Inverter Generator2.) Appliances3.) Truck Wrap4.) Startup CostsThanks everyone for taking the time to read this. Please share this with everyone!Tony Griffin and Duncan HerderFollow Us:Facebook: https://www.facebook.com/theoptimisticonionTwitter: @theOOFoodTruckInstagram: @Optimistic_Onion","As we briefly mentioned above, we both have spent the last few years in the food industry. We have experience in accounting, food preparation, food service, and most importantly, the food truck industry.Honestly, we both feel extremely confident that we have the personalities, tools, and the passion to run a successful food truck business. Both of us are independent, intelligent, and honest guys who are loaded with integrity. If there are any setbacks, we have a support system in place to tackle any problems that may arise."

I enjoyed the playfulness of the writing, and the artwork has a retro style that is enjoyable to look at. You can't ask for much more!""- Dan Thompson, ""Rip Haywire"", ""Harley""""You know what you'll get when you ask a dog a question, but cats are never predictable. Enjoy the unexpected in this delightful collection."" - Bill Holbrook, ""Kevin and Kell"", ""On the Fastrack""My name is Charles Brubaker and for the past few years, I've been writing and drawing comics professionally, having appeared in publications such as MAD Magazine and SpongeBob Comics. I have also created webcomics such as ""Ask a Cat"", ""The Fuzzy Princess"", and ""A Witch Named Koko"".This Kickstarter is to fund the first ""Ask a Cat"" book.I've been drawing ""Ask a Cat"" since 2014, and while I have put out mini-comics collecting the strips, I never compiled them into a proper book form, until NOW!This will be a 6""x9"" perfect bound, 128-page book collecting the best of the ""Cat"" strips from 2014 to early 2017! Topics that Cat covers include what to make for dinner, whether pancakes or waffles are better, cat elections, Thanksgiving, and many more!REWARDSThe book will be available in both digital and printed formats. There are a few original art available as well, plus stickers, buttons, and bookmarks.Backers can get the first ""Ask a Cat"" mini-comic, originally released in 2015. They always sell out at comic conventions!You can double the cats if you want a copy of ""The Fuzzy Princess"" comic book to go with ""Ask a Cat"".I will also offer the pencil print-outs used to traditionally ink the strips! I pencil the comics digitally with my tablet, which I then print out on legal-size paper so that I can ink them onto a sheet of Bristol Board with my lightbox. A lot of these pencils have edit marks and corrections made, a perfect opportunity to get a ""behind the scenes"" look at the strip! In addition, I will do an inked drawing of Cat on reverse.Original ""Ask a Cat"" comic arts are also available, selected by yours truly!! Early strips were drawn on 11""x17"" cardstock (huge!), while later ones were drawn on 11""x14"" Bristol board.INSPIRATIONI've had my comics published in numerous places for many years now, but while I've been in newspapers and comic books, and had my own work published in zine and comic book format, I've never had my cat strips professionally bound in a book format before. This inspired me to start this campaign to finally fulfill that goal.SHIPPINGI will be shipping both to US and International via USPS. If you're outside the US, your country's postal service will do the final delivery. If you feel that your country's postal service is unreliable, we can arrange for an UPS international delivery (to be subsidized at your cost).COSTThe money raised will be used for printing the books, shipping, and Kickstarter fees. That's it! Like I said, all the comics were drawn previously, and all marketing and promotions will be dealt with myself.","Risks are minimal for this project. All the strips are drawn, and the interiors are all laid out. Only thing left is to get it printed and have it shipped to the backers. Having self-published in the past, I'm aware of what to expect.Of course, things could get delayed, and if that's so, I will keep everyone up to date on the progress.",https://www.kickstarter.com/projects/bakertoons/the-fuzzy-princess-vol-1-color-edition?ref=discovery_category_newest,bakertoons/the-fuzzy-princess-vol-1-color-edition,"The Fuzzy Princess is an ongoing comic about a cat princess who must embrace humanity after getting lost on her travels.I'm Charles Brubaker, writing in from the royal kitty castle!

I always dreamed of having it put out in color, however, and made it my goal to do so.This is where this Kickstarter come in, to reprint the first book volume in color. It's not just a color version of the black and white books, I'm also adding new materials: title-page illustrations for each chapter, behind-the-scene sketches, as well as remastering old comic pages, with cleaned-up art and dialogue for clarity and general improvement.The book will be in 6x9"" paperback, 192 pages long, collecting the first 13 months of the webcomic (October 17, 2016 to November 17, 2017).REWARDSI'm offering a variety of rewards: the book itself, original art, stickers, prints, and more! Here's a handy chart showcasing what I offer (each additional rewards are highlighted for easy reading)EDIT (2-17): 100% backed!Thank you all who backed my project! Means a lot that I received so many support.At this stage, stretch goals aren't too feasible, but here's one I can do. In the $40 tier and higher, I'm offering 4 stickers. If I reach $5,100, I will add a 5th sticker of Kuma and Chiro at no extra cost (EDIT 2-18: STRETCH GOAL MET! Backers who pledged the $40 tier or higher will be receiving this sticker!)If anyone wants this sticker, you can change your tier to the $40 tier or higher and receive this, along with all the other rewards in the set!","I have previously published several paperback collections of my comics, including an “Ask a Cat” book, as well as 11 “floppy” issues of “The Fuzzy Princess”.

Well, that's up to a very divided and volatile casting team. The play has been aptly described as ""an exploration of the nature of bonding and friendship amidst the chaos of the casting process.""On October 27th, 2016 and May 5th, 2018, ""Rebound"" had public staged readings at K/Q Playwrights and HB Studio, respectively. The extremely positive audience reactions and feedback we received at both readings convinced us that the play deserves an Off-Broadway production, which brings us to the fundraising we are attempting on Kickstarter.Rather than send the play to literary agents and theater producers, and wait for a response, we've decided to go grass roots with our Kickstarter Campaign, and raise the funds necessary to produce the play ourselves.

Once a spiffy place to stay, the property has been on the decline for many years. Many in the community saw the potential for the place to shine, but the collective fantasy was beyond the expertise of most. Enter Brett and Nikki Woodland (of restaurants Bloom and Nectar)—a couple with the vision and experience to leap. When the previous lease ended, Brett and Nikki sprang into action, connecting with property owner Bethine Kenworthy (of the Kenworthy Theatre) and presenting their dream—a fresh take on the Mid-Century Modern motel.Well, you never know what you’re going to find in an old building…You may have noticed Brett and Nikki donning Carharts, sleeves rolled up, working a third shift renovating the Motel. (First and second shifts are in two busy restaurants, and raising an active family with three young children. They have extended far, committing resources, time and a tireless work ethic. In brief, the costs are outpacing their efforts and resources.This transformation will be a fresh take on a place that is full of potential. The name change to Monarch Motel winks at the 'Royal' past, and anticipates the metamorphosis.Preserving the Mid-Century Modern bone structure, Brett and Nikki are drawing on European inspiration for the overall vibe of the motel. Their affinity for French and Danish design is grounded in great use of small spaces. The result? Crisp details, tasteful, hip—a fresh backdrop for amazing artwork... a place that is authentic to Moscow—a bit elevated.The Monarch Motel will celebrate the creative community, featuring work by local artists, designers and craftspeople in the rooms and public spaces. The vision is to keep creatives connected to the Monarch Motel as a permanent feature. Discussions of offering an artists’ residency are underway. Brett and Nikki are hoping to find collaborators to make the vision a reality.Each room is taking two months – they have been relying on themselves and a few part time workers for all of the remodeling.There are three brand new rooms available with new everything, and one suite very, very close to being done. Three more new rooms will be done by the end of July. There are ten old rooms available that have been freshened and are being rented in their un-remodeled state (at a screamin' deal) to help meet costs. They have scrubbed the daylights out of the place!Bill Woolston, photography on locationDonna Woolston of Appearances Marketing, visioning, guidance,cheerleadingThe community is rallying! Others will be mentioned as we go!Through the Kickstarter Campaign Brett and Nikki hope to raise enough money for seven rooms—the minimum to have enough rooms to propel forward. According to Brett, “Seven more rooms will put us over the threshold, so we can continue on with our vision.” Beyond the interior, Brett and Nikki will also be overhauling the landscaping, adding an outdoor patio and firepit, as well as retaining 26 parking spots.Brett and Nikki are excited to bring a swanky new place to the community. “The Royal Motor Inn is an icon in this town, but for all the wrong reasons,” Nikki says. “With its central location, it needs to be a place that people who live here can be proud of and would want to put somebody up in… We need a place that reflects our town as the art-loving, creative and hip place that it is.”Moscow is a vibrant college town in rural north Idaho known for its creative community. The town marches to the rhythms of two Universities—football games, parents weekends, alumni events, and on any given weekend residents and visitors alike must select from a multitude of arts events to attend.The motel is the only large place to stay within easy walking distance of both downtown and the University of Idaho. Brett and Nikki anticipate it will be a hot spot for visitors. The thriving downtown has restaurants, bars, retail, an athletic club, a yoga studio, a theatre and an award winning gallery yards away. For outdoor aficionados bike rentals are a few doors down and the Paradise Path is within shouting distance.Through their businesses Brett and Nikki have contributed time and resources to great causes and non-profits. The list of partners includes Backyard Harvest, Without Décor and the University of Idaho Prichard Art Gallery.“In the nine years we’ve owned Nectar, we’ve thought about how the Inn could be so much more,” Nikki says, “but it was just a grand idea. It became something we talked seriously about five years ago, which is when we felt that we were really part of this community. We care deeply about what happens here. Moscow stopped being a place where we are for the moment and became where we want to be for the rest of our lives. We want our hometown to be the best that it can be, and that means having businesses that are owned by people who live here, that contribute to the betterment of our community, and care about the future of this town.”It’s more than a refresh—Brett and Nikki are taking the Motel apart and applying their craft and creativity—making it an establishment Moscow can be proud of.Brett says, “Moscow needs a place our visiting friends and family can rest their heads and soak in the best of what this town has to offer. The giant bonus to our community: a shiny beacon of hospitality in the middle of town!”The remodeling of each of the seven rooms pencils out like this:","Preserving this mid-century motel is a priority. The biggest challenge is that the old building has unknowns. As much as Brett and Nikki plan, there are factors out of their control. With the first few rooms, they have gained a better understanding of what they might encounter and have adjusted their budgets accordingly. To keep the project on budget Brett and Nikki are doing most of the work themselves, and while they have contractors for the specialized work like electrical and plumbing, they have been working very long hours to keep the project moving. They know they must keep pace to get more remodeled rooms available to the public.Brett and Nikki have built a team that understands the challenges they face. With the support of a community that really wants to see this project succeed, they have been able to tackle each challenge in their way and will continue to do so.Challenges that could arise after successful funding are minimal. Moscow and nearby Pullman have waves of guests in for University events. For events such as graduation, both towns sell out of rooms. In the summer things slow down a bit. Brett and Nikki plan on offering packages that appeal to the regional and local crowd, capitalizing on arts events, partnerships with downtown businesses and showcasing outdoor culture.",https://www.kickstarter.com/projects/1975336790/revitalize-the-sign?ref=discovery_category_newest,1975336790/revitalize-the-sign,"With Your HelpThrough this Kickstarter Campaign Brett and Nikki hope to raise enough money to revitalize the sign outside on the corner of 6th Street and Jackson Street.

And this time, we know you like biltong :) 300 backers from our last Kickstarter and 300% growth over the last year can’t be wrong. You have proven that you’re ready for dried meat in it’s purest form. Free of MSG, syrups or sugars.Never again will you return to the world of plastic, unrecognizable cooked beef. No way Jose. The day we met was a game changer. For you and for us.This year was filled with excitement and progress! We've partnered with the phenomenal Homeless Bus inour giving, been a go-to high protein, snack for the lovely Whole30 crowd. We've been voted best beef jerky in America by EatThisNotThat, and we're launching with our first big box retailer in October, right in Brooklyn.Do you like a challenge? Do you like a surprise? (in a good way!) Do you like to explore and pronounce new words? Then say this along with us: Zulu Peri Peri!Brooklyn Biltong was founded with two goals in mind, one to introduce biltong to America, and two, lend a hand while doing so. That is still our mission, and now that you know the great taste of original biltong, it’s time to advance your taste buds.To tickle them in all the right ways, we have just the answer in the form of, garlic, ginger, cardamom… and here’s the kicker.. Cayenne pepper. Did that make you sit up straight, bright eyes? If it’s too much, our original flavor will still be your trusted fall back compadre, but we’re convinced you will fall in love with this new one. We love the Kickstarter platform for its practical benefit. ie (funds are needed) but what we really love is all the new backers and friends we get to meet and share our story with during each campaign. Excitement is the name of the game and introducing a new flavor, in this case, a “wild” one, is definitely exciting! You get to know about it first and also help us make it a reality.Logistically speaking, we have grown into the need for a fourth box! Yes, that’s 4 now. The funds for this KS will be used to get that 4th box and also introduce the Peri Peri flavor. We have to file paperwork, purchase full printed bags and yadda yadda. Basically, the funds will be to set up a meeting between your taste buds and Zulu Peri Peri!With your help, we can expand our production and get our new flavor ready to meet the world!We need help supporting: Our tees are printed on American Apparel 50/50, great quality, American made, and always, awesomely Brooklyn!We are excited to be introducing this new flavor, and we can't wait to share it with you. We want to thank our loyal Biltong Tribe for coming on the journey with us, and welcome any newcomers to the Biltong revolution! All the best,Ben and Em","Though we are confident in making Zulu Peri Peri happen, there are more often than not some hold-ups when working with food. We will do our best to take them in stride, remain transparent with our friends and customers, and keep you updated on when you can expect the flavor explosion!",https://www.kickstarter.com/projects/2060933398/aip-approved-carnivore-biltong?ref=discovery_category_newest,2060933398/aip-approved-carnivore-biltong,"We're so happy to introduce an AIP approved version of our biltong today! We've had many requests from our customers for an option like this. We've heard how hard it is for you guys to find simple enough snacks that won't cause you to flare-up.And when everyone else can eat whatever they want, you guys have to scrutinize over labels and when a popular snack like biltong is not available, all you can do is hope that someone will bring it to the market. We're about to change that :)When you deal with an autoimmune disorder you can only eat certain food. Food that won't cause inflammation in the gut. Most of the time these foods have to be free from spices. Obtaining high protein snacks that fits this criteria is not easy.When it comes to meat snacks you can basically only eat the meat with salt. When we heard about this need from our customers at Brooklyn Biltong it became our passion to introduce a version of our biltong that fits this requirement.Naked Biltong! Biltong is South Africa's version of beef jerky and very simple by nature. The biggest difference being it is air dried, instead of by heat, and that way the finished product is more tender and flavorful. And because the meat flavor is not cooked away, we don't have to add all kinds of sugars, corn syrups or even spices to bring back taste.Biltong made with only salt and apple cider vinegar will remind you of a simple steak and it is completely AIP approved. With this simple ""Naked"" version of our biltong, you can enjoy as much as you'd like and not be concerned about breaking out.It's the perfect fit for the #carnivorediet on the go.We established what we call 'Eat and Feed.' Because our Biltong is a grass fed, sustainable, protein rich nutrient, we give away 10% of our profit in the form of actual Biltong to local Brooklyn organizations. We've most recently been donating to Chips, who works with City Harvest in distributing the Biltong into hungry hands.Keeping it tight with black and white, these bio-washed fabric caps feel broken-in already. We got fancy with our awesome new logo, and had it embroidered in white on the front, because you know, embroidery = kick-ass.Repin’ our roots, these ‘Kickstarter only’ Brooklyn outline shirts are made with a super soft tri-blend. They are white heather fleck, pre-shrunk, and pre-your new favorite tee!What we are planning, and how you can help!With your help, we can order the first round of bags in two sizes and take care of the R&D costs. We already make biltong at our USDA facility so this is all that's needed tobring Naked Biltong to your hands and mouths :)We need help supporting:We are very excited to get our Naked Biltong in your hands and provide you a solution to you high protein snack needs. We want to thank for supporting this mission for everyone that needs this product.All the best,Ben and EmAssets to share available here: https://bit.ly/2Lf5nvu","Though we are confident in our estimated launch dates, our timeline for recipe approval is not guaranteed. Our last experience with the USDA was about a month, but if something were to hold it up, it would in turn affect when the Biltong gets launched. But even though growing pains cause challenges, we believe fully in Brooklyn Biltong's future, and of re-launching from a place of strength!"
https://www.kickstarter.com/projects/thehopefuls/thisyear-t-shirts?ref=discovery_category_newest,thehopefuls/thisyear-t-shirts,"We are all waiting for something. A certain Chicago baseball team has waited 104 years to win a championship.Others wait forcures, family members to return, or to reach a lifelong goal. This is a T-shirt for that dream.My Kickstarter project was inspired by a certain Northside Chicago professional baseball team. Year after year, their fans perennially believe that this year could be the year. So I thought, why not design a T-shirt that encapsulates that hope and desire. So I created the basic design, transferred it to a linoleum block, hand-carved it, and printed it by hand onto the fabric, so each shirt one is one-of-a-kind. It would definitely be easier to mass-produce these, but that would take all the romance (and sweat) out of it. Waiting is hard. So should the creation of this t-shirt.This is my dream. Yes, I would love to see the bleachers at a certain Northside Chicago professional baseball team FILLED with these T-shirts, but I need your help to get there. I am hoping to initially produce 100 shirts, in hopes of gaining traction with fans and see where it takes me. My goal is to spread as much optimism and hope as I can in Chicago. If this project goes well, I will offer other fabric and paint colors (because hope comes in all colors). Everyone has a dream. I hope it's ""THISYEAR""!P.S. I hope to have all rewards out by opening day!!!",,https://www.kickstarter.com/projects/thehopefuls/the-hopefuls?ref=discovery_category_newest,thehopefuls/the-hopefuls,"For the past 19 months I have met incredible people on the streets of Chicago--over 500 individuals. They've told me their triumphs and tragedies, and allowed me to take their portraits as well. They are beautiful, they are inspiring, and their faces and stories need to be seen and heard. So I've decided to make a coffee table book to make that happen. My goal for this book is to create awareness and financial support for people experiencing homelessness. I think they'll inspire you too.I am SO excited about this book. The finished size will be 12""x12"", hardback, featuring both full color and black and white images. Several months ago, I had a ""first draft"" printed, just to see the image quality and layout. I've received some great suggestions from my colleagues and the final draft will be even better! The cover will better represent the contents, more of their ""stories"" will be featured, and more images will be included. I am working with a fantastic book company whose customer service is incredible, their technicians are skilled, and their turnaround is quick. The hardcover book will have a full-color dust cover, bar code, and ISBN number. WHERE WILL THE MONEY GO? As I mentioned, proceeds from this book will directly benefit the homeless. 60% of funds raised will go toward the printing of the book. The remaining 40% will benefit the homeless. Some examples from people I've encountered are: offsetting daycare costs for a single mother who is working and going to school, a wanna be entrepreneur who wants to be a soap maker helping to get him started with supplies, purchasing used smart phones to allow the homeless to access the internet and make wifi phone calls to stay connected with potential employers and family, public transportation cards to get people to/from work, sleeping bags, shavers, clothing, toiletries, boots/shoes, and funds to help individuals get identification (birth certificates/Social Security Cards/IDs). I have numerous people in mind for these funds that I've met over the past 19 months who need all the above! These are things that I wouldn't be able to pay for on my own, but having the funds to help supply these items when needed would be a huge help. Everyone's needs are different and if the funds were available, this could be a life-changing opportunity for them.That being said, if this project far exceeds the goal, I will give any unneeded funds to selected homeless organizations in Chicago. Please contact me if you have any additional questions or concerns. My desire is total transparency. ","Turnaround time for publishing this book (100-500 copies) is about 15 days.  Should this campaign blow up, the fulfillment time might take a few more weeks.  I don't foresee any other obstacles, since the book assets are in place and the layout is nearly complete."

I had heard a thing or two about this region which was built up as being an anomaly in our mostly flat state.Armed with both a DSLR camera and by medium format film camera I set about capturing the landscape in a series of photographs which portray both a sense of adventure and a sense of lonliness.In the months following I have been working on curating these images and assembling them in the form of a photo book which I believe represents my vision.Whilst coming up with a final selection of images I have also been working of the design of the book in collaboration with a number of my peers and professors.The final result of this journey are the 72 pages of ""Hard Sun Lonely Sky"", and I really hope that you can recognise the many hours of hard work that has gone into what I believe is a truly worthwhile series.A small selection of images from the series can be viewed here:http://www.timpalman.com/stirlinglight","Given that the book has been almost completely finished and is ready to print I can't foresee any major challenges ahead.

If you missed out you can purchase your copy HERE.At the beginning of 2016 my family and I travelled the 40km south along the train line, moving to the new development suburb of Wellard on the fringe of the Perth Metropolitan area.Perth is the most isolated city in the world, and also one of the most sparse, as a result of poor housing affordability. Young families looking to own a home and a patch of grass large enough to play backyard cricket on have been forced outward, either north or south into the satellite estates which seemingly erupt out of nowhere.Wellard is a photographic document that investigates the nature of the Domestic Dream in 2017.Photographed from 2016-2017 these images reflect on the concept of the Private Estate,identifying a culturally rooted desire for security and exclusivity which inevitably leadsto separation and isolation. An autobiographical body of work, Wellard expresses my ownstruggle between a desire for both security and freedom.Wellard was featured in Issue One of Negative Feedback Magazine. It has thus far been exhibited at Arthouse Dine at the Art Gallery of Western Australia and Paper Mountain Gallery in Perth, Western Australia.

The project is fully costed and if successful will fall below the target goal.Also having had involvement with the successful Kickstarter Campaign for Negative Feedback Magazine (https://www.kickstarter.com/projects/negativefeedback/negative-feedback-zine) I'm sure I have all the required tools to ensure a successful campaign, from social media promotion to fulfilment."

https://www.kickstarter.com/projects/larksounds/larksounds-send-revival?ref=discovery_category_newest,larksounds/larksounds-send-revival,"We are the Gregory’s and our music ministry is called LarkSounds. We are a family of nine in Dallas Texas where we Pastor Victory World Outreach. Our journey to this place started almost 23 years ago. While the journey began in Montgomery Alabama, God has moved us all of over the world. I (Chris) was saved in 1995 during a Gospel service at Kirtland AFB in Albuquerque NM and Calandra was saved in July 1996 during the Summer Olympics in Atlanta Georgia. We served in the Gospel service under Pastor Christopher and Patricia Ross and it was there God demonstrated that He loved us. A year later (in 1997), God sent us to Okinawa Japan.  It was in Japan that God spoke His predestined will for our lives early on. For four years, under the discipleship of Apostle Richard and Clara Brown, we learned to walk worthy of the vocation wherewith we are called. After this, God sent us to Colorado Springs Colorado. It was here through the ministry of Pastor Ron and Marie Jones that God opened the door for ministry. After five years of ministering in a diversity of areas from choir to Drug and Alcohol ministry we were sent into Phoenix to plant a church. In Phoenix, over the span of eight years the floodgate of music and song came and LarkSounds music was used to bless that church tremendously. Now that we are in Dallas (since September 2014), we believe that it is the time to take the music to the next level.    The bird known as a Lark is known for its elaborate songs in flight. We too are called to minister as we soar on the wings of God. The vision of LarkSounds began in 2000.  As I (Calandra) began to seek out what my name meant, I discovered that there was a bird called a Calandra Lark. From my youth, I would write and sing and had thoughts of someday creating music. It was during this time that the desires of my youth began to meet with the timing of God. It was from these humble beginnings that LarkSounds was born. LarkSounds is based on Psalms 32:7, “Thou art my hiding place; thou shalt preserve me from trouble; thou shalt compass me about with songs of deliverance”. LarkSounds includes Children’s Music, Choir Songs, Praise and Worship and even jingles! We have seen so many that have been delivered from a place of depression, discouragement and despair with the music from LarkSounds. The songs are all based on the word of God and remind the believer that in the midst of trouble, God is a very present help. This is our first recording endeavor, a clarion call for the church at this critical time in history. With war, natural disaster, terrorism and social issues plaguing our world, we believe the message of this project is God’s message of warning, encouragement, and hope. All of the songs for this project are original songs includingthe title track, “Send Revival” being the theme of the whole project. As you listen to the songs, our desire is that the urgency, expectancy and excitement that builds in your heart might manifest itself into action in your life.This brings us to why we need you. We would like to release in September 2015. We have made tremendous sacrifices of time, talent, and resources to begin this good work. Although we have spent a considerable amount already, we really need your help to push this project over the finish line. Money, fame and fortune are not our goal. We believe that the blessing of God will overtake those who follow hard after Him. We would, however, like to give those who have been blessed by us (and who will be in the future) the opportunity to sow into what we believe (and hope you do as well) is a worthy endeavor. We need to raise a total of 5500.00 to make this dream a reality. With your gift to us, it will be used for:1. Artwork, Printing and Advertising.2. Recording, Production and Distribution,3.

We are a family of nine in Dallas Texas where we Pastor Victory World Outreach. Our journey to this place started almost 23 years ago. While the journey began in Montgomery Alabama, God has moved us all of over the world. I (Chris) was saved in 1995 during a Gospel service at Kirtland AFB in Albuquerque NM and Calandra was saved in July 1996 during the Summer Olympics in Atlanta Georgia. We served in the Gospel service under Pastor Christopher and Patricia Ross and it was there God demonstrated that He loved us. A year later (in 1997), God sent us to Okinawa Japan. It was in Japan that God spoke His predestined will for our lives early on. For four years, under the discipleship of Apostle Richard and Clara Brown, we learned to walk worthy of the vocation wherewith we are called. After this, God sent us to Colorado Springs Colorado. It was here through the ministry of Pastor Ron and Marie Jones that God opened the door for ministry. After five years of ministering in a diversity of areas from choir to Drug and Alcohol ministry we were sent into Phoenix to plant a church. In Phoenix, over the span of eight years the floodgate of music and song came and LarkSounds music was used to bless that church tremendously. Now that we are in Dallas (since September 2014), we believe that it is the time to take the music to the next level.Why Are We HereThe bird known as a Lark is known for its elaborate songs in flight. We too are called to minister as we soar on the wings of God. The vision of LarkSounds began in 2000. As I (Calandra) began to seek out what my name meant, I discovered that there was a bird called a Calandra Lark. From my youth, I would write and sing and had thoughts of someday creating music. It was during this time that the desires of my youth began to meet with the timing of God. It was from these humble beginnings that LarkSounds was born. LarkSounds is based on Psalms 32:7, “Thou art my hiding place; thou shalt preserve me from trouble; thou shalt compass me about with songs of deliverance”. LarkSounds includes Children’s Music, Choir Songs, Praise and Worship and even jingles!  We have seen so many that have been delivered from a place of depression, discouragement and despair with the music from LarkSounds. The songs are all based on the word of God and remind the believer that in the midst of trouble, God is a very present help. This is our first recording endeavor, a clarion call for the church at this critical time in history. With war, natural disaster, terrorism and social issues plaguing our world, we believe the message of this project is God’s message of warning, encouragement, and hope. All of the songs for this project are original songs including the title track, “Send Revival” being the theme of the whole project. As you listen to the songs, our desire is that the urgency, expectancy and excitement that builds in your heart might manifest itself into action in your life.Why We Need YouThis brings us to why we need you. We would like to release in September 2015. We have made tremendous sacrifices of time, talent, and resources to begin this good work. Although we have spent a considerable amount already, we really need your help to push this project over the finish line. Money, fame and fortune are not our goal. We believe that the blessing of God will overtake those who follow hard after Him. We would, however, like to give those who have been blessed by us (and who will be in the future) the opportunity to sow into what we believe (and hope you do as well) is a worthy endeavor. We need to raise a total of 5500.00 to make this dream a reality. With your gift to us, it will be used for: 1. Artwork, Printing and Advertising. 2. Recording, Production and Distribution, 3. Travel, Rewards, and Legal.What You GetWe know you are here to be a blessing to us, however, for your support we have prayerfully selected some gifts that we would like to send you to show our gratitude for your investment into the will of God for our lives. These are in no way meant to repay you, but to remind you that LarkSounds is grateful for your contribution. Check out the rewards tab for details.

Well, as the owners of a small Pet Boutique, my husband, (an artist) and I (a teacher) realized there was only one thing that can make Paint Night's better - our pets. So, we are determined to break new ground at our pet boutique/paint studio by incorporating everything people love about the paint and sips with everything they love about their pets. My husband, Ron, has created original artwork pieces that allow people to easily personalize their painting to incorporate their furbabies! But it doesn't stop there! Our art studio is going to have something for everyone. We will be offering art, classes for all ages, private parties, paint and sips, and unique cutting edge art ideas, such as ""Pinterest Nights"", offering assistance to started but never finished Pinterest projects, ""Repurposed Project"" days where people bring in their ""garbage"" finds to get assistance on repurposing them into a beautiful and unique pieces, and, of course, ""Dog Days"" where people are invited to come and paint with their pups. We will also a Graphic Design class, where clients can create their own graphics that we can then print onto hundreds of different substrates (we have a Logojet printer), such as phone cases, tote bags, coasters, placemats, etc. We are currently offering classes out of our pet boutique, which is slow during the winters, but as summer approaches and classes get larger, we need to expand into the vacant store next to us. We are hoping to raise enough money for our first years rent (the landlord insists on 1 years rent in advance) and other start up fees, such as the construction costs for opening the connecting wall, and art supplies.",Minimal Risks - we already have a following from our Pet Boutique - we are just expanded to create more room for the studio.,https://www.kickstarter.com/projects/pawcassotreats/chicken-strips-and-veggie-strips-handcrafted-dog-t?ref=discovery_category_newest,pawcassotreats/chicken-strips-and-veggie-strips-handcrafted-dog-t,"We own Pawcasso Art Studio and Pet Boutique (I know, strange combo, but it works!) in Westhampton Beach, NY. We opened as a Pet Boutique in July of 2015 but then expanded to include an ""animal-centered"" art studio in March of 2016.At the Pet Boutique, we noticed our customers were always looking for healthy treats for their dogs...something other than the typical treats available in big retail stores. My love of cooking led me to become interested in learning more about the treat industry and what is out there. So, for the past year, I have been playing around with different recipes, ideas, looks, etc., that appeal to both pets and their humans. Well, I am excited to say I found what my husband and I (and, of course, our taste-testing pups) think is a win-win product! We are now ready to take the next step in our latest venture.The first set of treats we are going to be producing are our Chicken Strips and Veggie Strips. We use locally raised chickens to make the chicken treats and the vegetable treats feature a delicious combination of locally grown organic vegetables.I am in the process of having our treats analyzed and then registered with NY State. Since our products are made from just one or two completely pure ingredients, the testing and approval should go quickly. After that, we want to start production. So, this is where you come in...We need the funds to produce and package our treats. ","Since there are a lot of treat choices out there—we need to make sure our product is the one people choose. We are hoping that our unique packaging will help us stand out from the crowd. We plan to sell our treats at local farmer's markets and small pet shops/boutique's throughout Long Island. (We also plan to tap into our friends and family to help us put our product in other states). We are confident our great-tasting product will keep bringing pets and their humans back for more!Our other obstacle is one we hope to have: Not being able to keep up with the demand. In that case, we will need to find someone/somewhere who can help us with production but, as I said, that is a problem we hope to soon have!"

Each features in their own story which intertwine with one another as they’re forced to confront their own egos and immaturity.   We have Tanner, a gay musician recently kicked out of his hippie commune house who gets involved in a plot to sell a stolen work of a art on the blackmarket. There’s also his brother Milstien, a disgruntled AV Club film critic who blames an ambiguous plot device for destroying his relationship, causing him to stalk the local filmmaker he holds responsible. These two find themselves staying with their brother Walker, an unbalanced painter and street artist eagerly looking for acceptance - both from a prestigious New York art school, and from the people in his life... Such as Sammy, a feminist punk who volunteers at the art gallery where Walker's first show is going up, entangling her in the dangerous exploits of all three brothers - though she might be the only one smart enough to survive them.Sexual misadventures, dangerous amounts of Mexican food, indie rock street performances, city-wide streaking, elaborately choreographed song and dance numbers, mysterious lights in the sky, and the beheading of beloved Hollywood actor Mark Whalberg. It's all about what it means to really grow up in the windy city... even if you're growing up real slow.Who is making The Lake Effect:Marc Wilkinson is an experienced writer and director from the heart of Illinois. After living in Chicago for four years and graduating with honors from Columbia College, he pursued a film career in Los Angeles, where he worked from producers like Jon Shestack (Air Force One, Bring It On) and Zev Braun (Tour of Duty, The Gabby Douglas Story). While there, in addition to directing nearly a dozen music videos for a wide range of artists, he also wrote and directed his first feature film, Sunset Rock, which is currently in the final stages of post production:Hometown Hero Productions was formed when Marc moved back to Illinois to join forces with TLE producer and actor Tyler Amm, who had just wrote and directed his first feature, River City Panic. Together with Rebecca Wilkinson and a loyal crew of friends and contributors, the team made the horror comedy Grace's Room this past summer - honing their skills and gaining even more resources which leave them well equipped to continue making feature films expanding in quality and professionalism for years to come!Our team includes great people like Tyler Koontz crafting an original score, Nick Swartz as production designer, Rebecca Wilkinson heading the production team, Trevor Mccandless doing visualization and promotional art, Sam Michaels leading the Grip and Electric teams, and many more!Cast wise, The Lake Effect has the amazing Heather Call, Ryan Ziegler, and Tyler Amm making up the principle cast! Just look at their beautiful faces:Look and Feel of The Lake Effect:If you like Ferris Bueller's Day Off, Drinking Buddies, or Francis Ha, you'll like The Lake Effect.It could also be described as The Darjeeling Limited, set in the world of The Blues Brothers, but with all the heart and sadness of Happy Christmas. Except it's Thanksgiving. And everything is worse.This film will have a clean, professional and cold look - locked down & tightly composed shots, filmed with a matched pair of Canon 7Ds and a full kit of Rokinon prime cine lenses, which we already own. Blues, greys, white and purple will play heavily into our color palette. These will be low grain, sharp, steady and high-contrast images, playing into the stark architecture and chilly atmosphere of Chicago.This is a 6 million dollar film that we're going to make for 6 thousand dollars. It's going to be big, weird, and a little emotional. The Lake Effect has the heart of a coming-of-age family drama, but the drunken brain of a selfish black comedy. The film will also have an original score composed by Tyler Koontz - here a sample of what it will sound like in the test footage above! Organs, plunky pianos, nostalgic melodies and quirky but emotional beats. Koontz is an amazing talent, and we're so pleased to have him on this project. Here more from him athttp://www.tylerkoontzmusic.comWhy make The Lake Effect:The Lake Effect is a film about creativity, about morality, about feminism and about the idea of ownership - both how it relates to art and to our relationship. We hope to make a heartfelt film that explores some heavy thematic issues, but in a fucking hilarious and authentically Chicagoan way.We love the filmmaking process and want to see independent film production expand in Illinois. We believe their is a strong audience for this sort of nuanced, somewhat weird film. We want to provide you with both laughter and questions - warm your heart while we also make you throw up.This movie will be as fun to make as it will be to watch.

We need to hire a professional audio recorder to get great sound on location, which is was our biggest challenge with my last film, Sunset Rock. We also need to get food for our crew, costumes for our actors, and set design. Finally, we need post production funds to guarantee a great color grading and audio mix, and to submit our film to festivals all over the country!Teaser Poster:","We've built a project with time and budgetary constraints in mind throughout all facets of production. We want to make a hilarious yet touching feature film that looks and feels professional, but we know the importance of budgeting resources. With three indie feature films under our belts, we are well rehearsed in taking what we have and making a lot from it. Attempting to shoot an entire feature length film in 9 days with only $6,000 is a tall order, so we addressed this issue immediately upon beginning preproduction on this project.The short filming schedule is a reflection of the dedication to streamlining our production process as much as possible. We have assistance from local restaurants and business owners to use their locations for cheap or free and to maxamize our shoot while minimizing our costs. With our hard working and mostly volunteer crew, we will be able to shoot two camera setups simultaneously, guaranteeing that we get enough coverage in a short enough time to see our film through completion.This project is also made up of professionals and/or students of film who are dedicated to producing a quality piece of entertainment. Everyone on board has devoted their autumn to rehearsals, production meetings, creating art, shot lists, and schedules. They are already hard at work and will guarantee this film is not only completed, but is done to our exact vision and to the best of our ability.There will always be hiccups when it comes to film production, but we are prepared to meet every challenge head on. The Hometown Hero Productions team has survived huge shoots on little to no money and even less sleep. With your help, we are confident that The Lake Effect will be a smarty, funny film full of feelings and fun that we will all love together!",https://www.kickstarter.com/projects/marcwilkinson/room-to-believe-a-1999-coming-of-age-disaster?ref=discovery_category_newest,marcwilkinson/room-to-believe-a-1999-coming-of-age-disaster,"Room to Believe is a 90’s set young adult film about hope, loss, weird small towns, first true loves, and making movies with your friends. When a diverse group of teen filmmakers from across the country discover their ""prestigious"" cinema camp is anything but, they band together to make their first movie, falling in love & discovering themselves while stranded in a strange coastal town. Told non-linearly over the course of one magical, ill-fated summer, Room To Believe looks to inspire hope & spark positive conversations -- while maybe making you nostalgic for those sun burned months of your childhood. If you've ever felt guilt over a sudden loss, shot an alien invasion on VHS tape, or had a emotional epiphany halfway through a beachside funnel cake, this movie is for you.Imagine Almost Famous meets Adventureland, with the heart of Short Term 12 and the structure of 500 Days of Summer. But with more homemade robot costumes.Our cast includes the talents of Rattryna Yim, Kemp Connelly, JessicaOberhausen, Francisco Espinoza, andCoco Fernandez! Over the course of this campaign we'll be sharing more about them, as well announcing more members of the cast! These are immensely talented young people who are passionate about the project, and we're grateful for this opportunity to work alongside them!Room to Believe is written & directed by Marc Wilkinson, a filmmaker from the cornfields of Illinois. After directing dozens of award-winning short-form projects, Marc made his feature film debut with the YouTuber indie-drama ""Sunset Rock"". He recently wrapped production on his second feature ""Honeycrisp"" and currently serves as a showrrunner for the CW docu-series ""Case Files: Chicago"".

We are contributing our own funds, borrowing everything we can, and maxing out credit cards to make this film real - that's how much we believe in the story. We're hoping to raise at least $5,500 through this campaign to cover initial expenses, but the more we raise, the better the final film will be - and we'll be unlocking stretch goals along the way to give special new perks once we're past our goal!We want to connect emotionally, especially with a young audience growing up in a scary time, who might need a laugh, or a moment of inspiration, or just to see a reflection of themselves on screen, dealing with the same problems they might be facing, and to know they're not alone.

I can't wait to see it!""""When I heard Randy was launching Monomyth I knew without a shadow of a doubt this was going to be something really special. I can only hope to be a part of it. I can't wait for the world to enter into the fantastical world of Monomyth!""""Randy Bishop is a proven creative force in animation.  I would get in line for anything he was doing but throw in ancient mythological characters and now I'm pushing my way to the front of that line! Go Monomyth!""""An epic that breathes new life into our favorite mythology""The world of Monomythis one where all ancient mythologies actually exist at once. All of the ancient mythological gods, monsters, heroes, and magics are carefully woven together to create a unique world with its own set of political, social, and spiritual problems that the characters are forced to deal with.The story itself revolves around a small group of characters who are swept into an epic journey together that earns them the unwanted attention of gods, monsters, and men in equal shares.The term ""monomyth"" was actually coined by Joseph Campbell, who was a brilliant man with a passion for mythology and storytelling. The word monomyth literally means “one myth”. Campbell theorized that all stories are variations of one greater narrative, that there are common patterns woven through most great myths, regardless of where they come from.AurechA formidable looking fellow; Aurech is half frost giant, half Norse god. Apart from the occasional visit from his mother, Aurech has lived in isolation ever since he can remember; the only other living creatures he ever associated with being the kind that don't talk back. With his limited worldly experience comes an almost painful naivety that causes him pain on a regular basis.Despite, (or perhaps because of), his lack of anything remotely resembling social skills, Aurech is a deeply insightful individual. He sees things in people that they sometimes don't even see in themselves. He is a fiercely loyal friend, and a ferocious protector.RainneRainne is a woman with skills. Having been recruited for ""The Flames of Ra"" as a child, Rainne grew up in a world of espionage, politics, infiltration, and assassination. Everything she does is done with decisive action and exact precision. She has become accustomed to success, so when things go terribly wrong on one of her assignments and she finds herself hunted by her comrades, she has a hard time adjusting to life as a fugitive, and an even harder time relying on others for help.Rainne is stubborn and has a hard time coming to grips with change; but when she does, she embraces it wholeheartedly. She knows how to commit to something.Nibicus (Nibs)Nibicus is an obnoxious, clumsy, but quick-witted opportunist. He is a spirit who has coasted through life largely unconcerned with the greater workings of the world around him. Even when the forces of gods, monsters, and more converge in a conflict revolving around his companions and himself, he has a hard time taking things seriously. When others seem to be weighed down by the world around them, Nibs will step in to assure them that life isn't as bad as all that.I'm a subdued person on the outside. But rest assured that on the inside I'm brimming with passion and creativity. This project means a lot to me and I hope you can catch a glimpse at my vision and that you'll donate what you can. I asked my brother to do a little dance so that I could express my enthusiasm vicariously through him. Feel free to watch it here:Animation is expensive. That’s just the way it is. Telling the entire story of Monomythis going to take a lot more money than I could ever confidently raise on Kickstarter. The story will take a trilogy of films or an animated series to tell, but raising hundreds of millions of dollars just isn’t in the cards. The money I raise on Kickstarter will go toward producing an animated short with a self-contained story that will introduce one or more of the three main characters. It’ll give people a little taste of what that film trilogy or animated series could be. I really think that a little taste will generate a lot of interest in the future of Monomyth.I want the short to be cinema quality, so I’m sparing no expense to make it so. It's going to be the kind of thing you'd expect to see on the big screen.Dor Shamir -- an amazingly talented man -- has agreed to lead a team of artists as my creative director. To give you an idea of what the short will look like, here are some samples of the quality of work that has been put out by Dor Shamir and the other artists who will be involved:Dor was also kind enough to do a rendering of a model of Nibs that Christopher Wright and Leticia Reinaldo Gillett did for the campaign:Leticia and Dor are both amazing artists who have been generous with their time and talents in helping me promote Monomyth.You can see more of Christopher's work here:ReelsYou can see more of Leticia's work here:PortfolioYou can see more of Dor's work here:Blog  FacebookIn addition to the short itself, I’m going to produce an “Art of” book to act as a companion to the short film. The two together will be used to pitch Monomyth to studios and potential investors. I’m depending entirely on Kickstarter to fund this project which is why the funding goal is so high. But trust me, none of the money will go to waste. The book ""HEADS"" has been added to some of the incentives!I’ve tried to think of incentives that I would want to see as a campaign backer. There are a number of digital incentives because I need to keep most of the money to go toward the production of the short and the book. The physical incentives are a bit more expensive for the same reason.Originally, I had three different short films planned. Each of the three films would show the origins of one of the main characters. The stories are touching and meaningful, but they're also complex in a way that makes them expensive to animate. In order to fund the script that I'm most excited about, I'll need to raise roughly $2,000,000. That's a verylarge number. The other two scripts will be somewhat cheaper, but not by much.I've written a fourth script that tells a very simple story. It's enough to give audiences a little insight into the characters' personalities and spark some interest in the story. I've kept it simple to keep the cost of the film down, but if we can raise enough money, I have some ideas that I know will leave people desperate for more.I’ve wanted to tell this story for years, but getting it done always seemed like an impossibility to me. Producing a CG animated project is a huge undertaking and one that I couldn’t even begin to accomplish on my own. I don’t have a lot of connections in the animation industry. I don’t have a lot of wealthy friends that I could approach to ask for funds. Kickstarter is a miracle. It allows people to pledge any amount of money to a project in order to see it funded. It’s marvelous!","Some of the incentives may take longer to deliver than the estimated date. Since I'm providing a variety of different rewards that I'll be obtaining from a variety of different sources, there are a lot of opportunities for things to go wrong. I've tried to plan things out carefully so that I don't run into that sort of thing, but sometimes it's inevitable. Everything will be completed and shipped as soon as it's humanly possible to accomplish.The biggest risks associated with animation are probably unforeseen expenses in the production process. I've tried to set my funding goal with a tiny bit of cushion just in case I run into some surprises. If worse comes to worse, I can cut pieces of the film out to save some money.Outsourcing the production of the film to a studio presents a lot of potential problems. Delays in production are a definite possibility. I'll do everything I can to make sure that rewards are delivered on time and that",https://www.kickstarter.com/projects/randybishop/nuggets-volume-1-the-art-of-randy-bishop?ref=discovery_category_newest,randybishop/nuggets-volume-1-the-art-of-randy-bishop,"About the Artist:Randy Bishop works in the animation industry as a character designer.

https://www.kickstarter.com/projects/943723707/fuse-ensemble-recording?ref=discovery_category_newest,943723707/fuse-ensemble-recording,"Hi Everyone! Thanks again for checking out our Kickstarter page. I'm Gina Biver, founder and composer/director of Fuse Ensemble, a new music ensemble based in the Washington DC area. We’ve been performing together for over seven years, premiering  the work of contemporary  composers, while collaborating with media artists, kinetic sculptors, visual artists, choreographers and film makers. The music we perform is what some call contemporary classical; we use electric and acoustic instruments and live electronics or background audio. Other names for it can be avant-garde, electro-acoustic, post-minimalist, art music, modern music, downtown modern, etc. Our musicians are classically trained, but have also performed jazz, improv, rock, new grass and other styles. We are thrilled to be working with percussionist Scott Deal for this recording. If successful, this kickstarter will provide funds for the professional recording of five of my newest compositions, which total just about an hour of music.. They will be recorded at Cue Recording Studios in Falls Church, VA, produced and engineered,and then mixed and masteredby Parma Recordings’ production and engineering team. The finished product will be marketed and promoted by Parma, then distributed via Naxos. I can't even describe how exciting it would be for us to work on this project! And yeah, unlike the recordings that just end up sitting on our website, this one has the potential to reach SO many more people!  But we have to fund it first. . .  Here's a little more detail about each of them, if you're so inclined: 1. No Matter Where, for prepared piano, violin, clarinet and prerecorded audio (a track of rolling tabla drums, trains, and other 'traveling' sounds that I recorded on roads, bridges and train stations) is based on a painting by artist Jackie Tileston entitled ""No Matter Where, (Not Pictured Here)"" andwas premiered at the Kennedy Center Millennium Stage in 2010. 2.The Cellar Door, for piano, cello and 4-channel audio is aboutJung’s theory of Individuation.  The audio track represents the unconscious, with its live sounds of waterphone; the piano and cello represent the conscious life. The audio travels from the rear to the sides and finally the front of the listener in a deliberate confrontation between the conscious and unconscious lives. This piece was premiered at the Corcoran Gallery of Art by Verge Ensemble in 2011.3. Mirror, for piano, violin and spoken word, was inspired by the poem “Empress in the Mirror” by Colette Inez, who I met on a hot summer day at the artist retreat VCCA. Notes by Ms. Inez state  “Sitting before her mirror a woman takes on the conflicting roles of cruel court lady and palace drudge. The vain empress and her serving girl are both imprisoned in the poet's imagination"". Mirror was premiered at the Kennedy Center Millennium Stage in 2012.4. Girl, Walking, for electric guitar, flute, contrabass. The idea for Girl, Walking, came about while I was reading ""Far from the Tree: Parents, Children, and the Search for Identity"", a monumental work by Andrew Solomon.  I started to think about how we can create our own identity, yet some of who we are is inevitably beyond our control.  I wondered how all that we were born with, plus the myriad list of events that unfold in our lives -- even the secrets we hold -- all conspire to form our identities.   I created a piece that would flow through five sections that would be shaped as it went along through improvisations on the part of the bassist, guitarist and flutist... improvisations that would unfold and force the unexpected, awakening new shapes and realities while the repetitive nature of the guitar maintained a continuing, eternal presence underneath it all.   As for instrumentation, I knew the piece needed to have electric guitar (for so long the tool of my expression, my rebellion, my comfort) and flute, as a smiling nod to my precious Mama, a talented flutist.  As for the teacups, well, they’re always around me when I work. Girl, Walking was premiered by Fuse Ensemble at the Atlas Performing Arts Center in Washington, DC in 20145. We Meet Ourselves, for marimba and triggered voices, another piece conceived during our Jungian season, is based on a quote by Carl Jung that reads: ""We meet ourselves time and again in a thousand disguises on the path of life.""  In it, Scott can hit certain bars on the marimba that will trigger an audio clip of spoken words. In the first section, they just speak out while he is playing the given melodies.  In the middle section, he can improvise with these parts, having just one speak at a time or create a full cacophony of voices at once if he so chooses. This piece is so fresh it's going to be premiered this coming season!! I’m inviting you to come and join us -- to be a part of this project. We have many ways in which you can do this, so please have a look at our REWARDS page. This is an amazing opportunity for us -- and you can help make it happen! ","The first challenge in this project is that I will need to continue to fundraise a few thousand dollars beyond our kickstarted funding goal of $8,250.00. The tricky part for me was to choose a number that seemed attainable so that the kickstarter would be successful, but not so high as to risk that it wouldn't go through, so I decided to ask for a little less than we need.  Times have changed, and many artists are trying hard to fund projects any way they can.  I've done a lot of grant writing to help fund our activities over the years, but many of the grants I've counted on in the past have become far more competitive, with online applications that don't take much time, and so there are a lot more people applying.  But there are still two or three grants I will apply for to get that final amount, and hopefully the grantors will be more likely to fund the rest once once they see that I've gotten almost all of it already from the kickstarter.",https://www.kickstarter.com/projects/943723707/fuse-ensembles-new-music-release-on-parma-recordin?ref=discovery_category_newest,943723707/fuse-ensembles-new-music-release-on-parma-recordin,"Fuse Ensemble - our electro-acoustic contemporary classical music performing group - has just signed a record contract with PARMA Recordings, which is tremendously exciting for us! As we announce this, we're heading into our tenth year together, but up until today we have only made self-released albums. Now that we've signed with PARMA Recordings, we can benefit fromthe experience of top-notch music industry professionals, and gain international distribution of our upcoming recording through Naxos (one of the largest distributors of independent classical record labels in the world). Wow!This Kickstarter was created to garner support from our community for the initial funding of the project. We need your assistance to move forward! Pledgers will have their pick of several fun rewards -- everything from digital downloads and T-shirts to the chance to perform with Fuse Ensemble onstage!

After this Kickstarter is fully funded, we will still need to pull together about $1K, but we didn't want to make our goal larger than we thought we could get and jeopardize it going through.

Founded in Paris in 1971, they provide emergency aid to people affected by war, natural disasters, lack of healthcare and epidemics. It's the best thing I could think of to do at this time. Thank you.Who am I?Hi, I’m Jess and I’m a self-taught artist from the UK, currently living with my family in the county of Surrey. Through my artwork, I’ve been lucky enough to have made some amazing friends around the world, who have always been supportive of new paintings, and projects. I’ve often been asked when I am bringing out a new set of postcards, bookmarks, calendars etc, using the many images I have. I’d love to fulfill some of those requests and hopefully take you along on the journey too! A couple of years back, I had great success with a small Kickstarter project (you can see it here) and have been wanting to expand my line of available artwork and items further since, so here it is!What am I hoping to achieve?There are already a few items in my little Etsy shop, 'Castle On The Hill' which you can find here. Ultimately, though, I’d like to have a whole range of fun goodies for customers to choose from and also eventually run my own shop from my own website, but that’s a couple of steps further in the future…With this project, I’d like to fund the painting of new images depicting vintage 1950s/60s ladies alongside Parisian Landmarks, and then, using those images, the printing of postcard sets and printing new packaging.BackgroundOver the past few years, I have been painting tiny character images onto French book pages in 'ACEO' form (small, affordable art pieces measuring just 2.5"" x 3.5""). I don't have a formal background in art, but have been working full-time (or as full-time as possible with a young family) as an artist and illustrator since 2007 (and before that in my spare time).I am lucky to have been selling these online to a very loyal and lovely fan base and am now in the midst of painting six larger pieces so I can hopefully expand the stationery line further.Expenses : How much do I predict I'll need to cover costs for this Project?I'm keeping these prices as low as I can for you, without leaving myself without! Shipping is not included in the pledge levels, covering light but sturdy packaging and the Post Office costs only :)Postcard printing - £450Packaging paper, archival printing paper, card, cellophane sleeves, printing toner etc - £375Time spent packaging, printing, cutting etc (approx 60 hrs) - £300Cost of shipping (approx) - £950 -1500Painting the Originals - £1,375Kickstarter Fees and Tax - £350Stretch Goals: If we're lucky enough to raise more than the amount needed here, I also have a few other ideas for extra items on the ‘stretch goals’ list below: Add-OnsYou are able to add little extras to any existing pledge by just choosing any of the options below and increasing your pledge by the amount shown. *Colouring pages: Three jpeg images of the Parisian buildings (pictures below the 'Rewards' image here, emailed directly to you and ready to print out and colour - £3* One set of 'Parisian Landmark' postcards with envelopes - £5 (available to ship Jan-Feb 2016)* One set of 'Parisian Lady' bookmarks - £4 (Available to ship early December 2015)* 8"" x 10"" print of 'Parisian Landmarks' image of your choice - £12 each.Having already painted a few larger pieces (full book-page size), I'd would love the opportunity to create some with more detail, including recognisable, well-loved structures around Paris. That's where you come in - a little bit of extra financial support while I finish creating these images and print up some affordable reproductions would be so gratefully appreciated, as it means I'll be able to order a large print-run for lots of different postcards and sell them at reasonable prices. These will be available here as your rewards :)What do you receive in exchange for your support?I'm making a lot of smaller rewards to fund this project, so you can get as much out of it as possible ;) Here's the lowdown:I've also added a few new rewards!£3: THE COLOURING PAGES£55: THE PRINTSSix 8"" x 10"" prints of the ""Parisian Landmark"" paintings.I am currently updating the packaging, so part of this project is raising funds for more lovely quality card for printing that too ;) I love product design, and my new obsession is to make the packaging look like vintage books :)I am hoping that, with your help, we can create a new, cohesive look for all these postcard sets.The new paintings are created upon book pages, which are mounted on acid-free card using ph-neutral adhesive to discourage yellowing on the surface of the paint. Paints used are acrylics, which are durable, yet can look like watercolours, which allows the book page text to show through.A couple more 'Paris Landmarks' paintings - these have already been painted and would not work on the postcard measurements, but prints can be made ;) Here are a few preliminary sketches so you can see which direction they'll be taking:The Paintings:In all, there will be six new 'Landmarks' paintings:""Eiffel Tower"" ""Jardin du Luxembourg""""Arc de Triomphe"", ""Sacre Coeur"", ""Pere Lachaise Cemetary"", ""Palais Garnier Opera House"". I'll keep you updated with the progress of each painting as the project moves along.Thanks so much for reading and I hope you like the look of the project!Video music: Thievery Corporation - Decollage","A note regarding shipping: I will keep you up-to-date. I'm confident we can keep up as far as the smaller rewards and November/December shipping goes, but as we near the holiday period, things will become busier, so I'd like to let you know now that if you are hoping for holiday gifts, there is a small chance they might not make it! Other than that, everything should go fine. I have given rough estimates for the original paintings, as they sometimes have a life of their own - sometimes going very smoothly and working out great, other times needing more time and work. Of course, this goes for the postcards made with these images, too!",https://www.kickstarter.com/projects/crystalforests/the-crystal-forests-an-intuitive-oracle-card-deck?ref=discovery_category_newest,crystalforests/the-crystal-forests-an-intuitive-oracle-card-deck,"Funding reached! Everyone is getting their decks! 🎉First stretch goal reached! Stickers and bookmarks added! 🎉Second stretch goal reached! Exclusive enamel pins added 🎉NEW reward tiers added! GOLD gilt-edged card decks are now available too!Hi. I‘m Jess.Welcome to the Crystal Forests, a series of 42 hand-watercoloured images which, with your help, I will be creating a card deck, incorporating the deep wisdom of the ancient woodlands with the beauty and guidance of crystals.How to use the cards:I would like to clarify that there is no right or wrong way to use this deck. It can be used as a method of divination; a focus for meditation; support for training yourself in new, healthy habits; an altar piece (or multiple ones!); or 'just' decoration.Each card will be accompanied by a page in the guidebook, which will explain the experience of taking a walk through the crystal's corresponding forest. For those of us who feel refreshed and revitalised by the natural world and who may be drawn to woodlands in particular, this can bring a whole new outlook to the day (or night) ahead, or the situation we may be looking to find clarification upon.Creation and innovation is so important to us as a society. My hope is that, whatever we humans create, it‘s for the purpose of elevating, to become part of the world around us and to help lift us, inspire us and remind us to be the best we can...even on those days when it feels the world is crumbling around us. Even in those moments... ESPECIALLY in those moments, I want you to realise you can still do amazing things.That's why I’d like for you to contribute a little bit of yourself to this project.That’s why YOU get to VOTE on the design for these cards.How does the voting work?As we go through the campaign this month, I will send out a polls about the card design, such as font and text boxes, and the design for the reverse of the cards too, which you can then vote on.The first poll: Voting for font, has concluded and you can see the prototype cards below for the chosen font.The second poll: Voting for text block (background for the text), has concluded.The third poll: Voting for the design on the reverse of the cards has concluded.There will also be two other decisions to make after the campaign: whether or not we want extra prompt words and a choice of card box designs.I just love the idea of having you on board through the design process! Of course, we won't please everyone in every way, but we can get as close as possible this way :)I am currently working on The Crystal Forests series of paintings - each a forest image, based on a different crystal. Having completed a third of them already, I’m so excited to immerse myself in this project for you.Just in case you don’t know me:The idea for The Crystal Forests first came to me shortly after we had completed the successful Kickstarter campaign for last year’s Wisdom of the Forest - An Intuitive Card Deck. (If you don’t yet have a set, you can order one through the Kickstarter here too 😊)The forests of our world are the perfect places to meditate, to find a magical stillness we cannot easily find elsewhere. There are so many lessons to be learnt from the forest - lessons of hope, danger, inspiration and calm. It’s where so many of our ancient legends are based and where so much beauty can be appreciated. Its essentially where we can reground and reconnect with the deepest wellsprings of our being.Back in April, while home-schooling my youngest daughter, she asked for a painting lesson ”Like your forests, but in sunset colours.” Of course, I obliged and soon realised that some of my crystals would make awesome inspiration for different coloured forests. Then I began meditating with these images and sharing them online. People began asking me if these new paintings were going to become a card deck and saying they would love one if it ever happened.After much deliberation on whether I should or not, some sweet followers and friends of mine convinced me that, yes, this new card deck project definitely should happen and SOON. So I began work on writing this campaign up for you now, so I can use the darker months working on the rest of the artwork before printing up our full deck of cards. We will be moving house over the next 8 weeks, then it’s the Christmas craziness, so I knew I had to fit it in before then.So here we are.Turns out the campaign is falling directly over the most beautiful, spookiest month (yes, that bit was half-planned and half-coincidence) AND we begin AND end this Kickstarter journey on a Full Moon (an absolute unplanned and beautiful synchronicity!) 🌝I‘m initially having a small run of card decks professionally-printed here in the UK for this campaign, to keep prices low and quality as high as possible.If we’re successful, I can go on to print larger quantities.Reward tiersCollaboratorsI'm so grateful and excited to be working with some amazing people on this project.

With recent developments worldwide during 2020, some manufacturing methods have been slowed down, but only by a couple of weeks in most places.

Our heroine, 17-year-old Valerie, a champion diver (as in diving board, not scuba) hits her head during a routine dive at the local pool. She starts to drown but is given mouth-to-mouth and rescued by a merman named Wyn, who's trapped in the pool.Initially Valerie thinks she is going crazy and hallucinating a merman. But she learns that her mind isn't making him up; it's because Wyn saved her that she can now see him and others can't. In this world merpeople are invisible to human eyes in water, because of their camouflage, but above surface anyone can see them.Wyn and Valerie become very close as they get to know one another. Valerie gives Wyn the encouragement to overcome his shyness, and Wyn help Valerie to face the grief she'd refused to confront for over a year. But what's confusing to both of them is why Wyn's captors have trapped him in a public pool surrounded by people. Then Valerie finds out that his captors are moving him to a secure scientific facility in just three days. He's sure to end up pinned and dissected like a frog in some biology class. So Valerie has to save him. It's not until Wyn's stuck in a fish tank bungeed to the back of a beater pick-up truck and Valerie's staring down the barrel of a gun, that she realizes she's in love, with Wyn.This novel is a clean romance. The protagonist is seventeen and there are conversations about some mature situations but there are no sex scenes.

I spent a year editing the manuscript myself and through beta (test) readers and then sent out more than forty inquiries to agents and publishers over the course of two years. None of them expressed any interest.Even if I don't make it to my goal (which I'm hoping and praying and going to work my butt off to make sure this kickstarter gets funded), I will still publish this book. It will just have to wait until I can get the capital to make the thing properly, and therefore take much longer.I want to do as much as I can to support local artists and economies. I'm going to be using many people and companies to do so many things. Some of these things are - making a fun family-oriented book launch event, using local artists and camera techs from my community, giving students at the local university a chance to try out the skills they're learning in a practical but paid application, and bringing fun and knowledge about literacy to kids and teens.This is a book that can pull in a fan base; I've created a world with merpeople who have their own languages, culture, and physical abilities. No matter what happens, this book will become a reality, but it would be amazing if some of you came along for the ride and experienced it all with me.I'm a mother to a four-year-old boy and an eighteen month old girl and I also work part-time each week on my writing. My husband of eight years has long since come to accept the overflowing bookshelves we have as a permanent part of our home decor.I am also LDS. See: My Faith - Being LDS or Mormon.org.Having this faith will always have an influence on my opinions, my life, my writing and how I conduct myself.When I read I love to devour books that help me escape, my favourite genres being fantasy, science fiction or romance, which is probably why I write in those genres. I love my blogs and crafting new posts, in addition to discovering so many new awesome reads through book reviews. See my blog: DanielleWAM On top of the Lasera series (which is six books and five planned short stories) I have at least fifteen other writing projects on the back burner.

Yellow pieces of paper were taped to the front door. Though he couldn’t read them from the curb, he recognized them as foreclosure notices. They’d become commonplace all around town. A blood-curdling yowl rose from the backyard.-	From “What You’re Called to Do” by Dale Cameron Lowry in Untethered: A Magic iPhone Anthology Our smartphones organize our lives, find our locations, and sync with all our other tech. We sleep with them beside our pillows. Yet… their workings are a mystery.For all we truly understand, they could be made of magic. (I mean, do you know how yours works? Could you take it apart and put it back together?)In this anthology, twenty authors explore the intersections of magic and technology. In some of these fictional pieces, that means the phone itself is explicitly magical (such as taking the perfect selfie every time). In other short stories, they run magical apps (like when a tech company keeps a mythological creature chained up in its server room).Some stories skate closer to science fiction with stories where Siri has become sentient (and she’s not impressed with how you ignore her turn-by-turn directions). Others go for a more classic horror-fantasy approach (with demon possessions).Every single one of these stories has something interesting to offer—from philosophical jumping-board to hilarious entertainment. Which will be your favorite? Sure, everyone loves technology and magic. And we’ve been hanging out with smartphones for quite some time. But what tipped the scales to make this anthology actually happen?It’s all due to the success of anthology editor Janine A. Southard’s 2015 novel, Cracked! A Magic iPhone Story. That book stars an explicitly magical iPhone (found by story gamers in modern-day Seattle) which not only sends its users on terrible dates, but also sucks their life forces.Cracked! A Magic iPhone Story has won a Cygnus Award for SF/F in 2016 and been quietly growing its audience for the last year. So Janine wanted the chance to read what other people made of her “magic iPhone” concept, and wow did the speculative fiction writing community go for it. We already have the drafts of these twenty stories in hand. And Janine (the editor) has run Kickstarter projects before. This means we’re a low-risk project. We need your help to get everything cleaned up, published, and out the door, but we’re ready to move.The cover seen above is the actual cover. On the inside, you will find an incredible line-up of authors who use all sorts of storytelling, ahem, devices. Janine A. Southard has run four Kickstarter projects for novels.

My Story: I am an undergrad student, currently attending the University of Toronto, and I am double majoring in human bio and neuroscience. So where does fashion, design, art, and gemstones fit into the mix? Well, art and design came naturally from a very young age; from painting portraits of family members and friends, creating handmade cards during the holidays or spending hours creating sketches and painting in sketchbooks.

Each of our Pop Ups is done with purpose, so we choose a local non-profit to partner with and fundraise for. Our first Pop Up was with the WOW Center in Miami for our Inaugural Pairings event.

Consumer expenditure on entertainment has moved to dining out rather than traditional forms like going to the movies, so we have to put emphasis on this in our ambiance.	Consumers habitual demand for new and innovative tastes & options has flooded distributors with too many options thus giving leverage back to the retailers, so we have to operate as a consumer connection point for the Miami beverage community. Word of Mouth marketing programs rule the food and beverage world, saving us thousands of dollars in marketing expenses. We will give them something to talk about."

I came here searching for Jazz and I found much, much more than that: I re-encountered my family roots of flamenco and I ""accidentally"" discovered a deep passion for the musical spirit of Brazil... After all these years of immersing myself in this life journey the sound I was so eager to find, found ""me"", and so a truly unique fusion concept came about. I aim to represent this sound in the recording ofmy third studio album. The album will be a full length CD entitled “Azucar, Canela”.Here is a sample of one of the songs that will go in this albumThe production of my other two albums were entirely funded by myself but there comes a point in every artist's career when, in order to take things to the ""next level"" one needs to ask for some external aid and so I need ""A little help from my friends"" ;)This album aims to reach beyond what’s purely “entertaining” in order to create a unifying journey where three musical cultures, three countries (Spain, Brazil, US), and three different types of “blues” converge. The fusion of flamenco with the flavors of the old and new continents will not only preserve flamenco, but also help to take it further into the future.Grant applications have been submitted to cover the cost of post-production part of the album (CD printing, CD release promotion/publicity, etc...) BUT, because of the time constrains, where your help is really needed for is to enter the studio, and do the actual RECORDING - while taking care of the parties involved in the recording process (studio costs, artist costs, producer's fee, etc...)From the bottom of my heart I thank you in advance for your support.BesosRebeca Vallejo","The main obstacle to face after the completion of the recording would be not acquiring the money necessary to complete the post production phase of the album (meaning that none of the grant application go through favorably for the project) BUT, having a audio finished product it is much easier to approach ""the private sector"" (potential donors and investors) who may be interested in providing what the grant system might fail to."

My Co-founder and I were out by ourselves, and being our first time there, we had no clue where to go. We hopped around from bar to bar getting frustrated by the outcomes of all of them.We would go to one bar and the drinks would be way too expensive. So, we would go to the next bar and it took us 45 minutes to even get in just to find out it wasn't anything like the drunk guy we talked to at the last bar who SWORE to us it was the best bar in town. This went on all night until we finally found the perfect bar for us.We began to talk about how hard it was for us to find the right bar for us and that we wish we knew what the bars were like before we walked in. This would make it so much easier for us to decide which bar to go to and thus.... Bar Surge was born!With the design done and a developer in line to build the app, we plan to launch our Beta Version in late January-Early March of 2020.With your help we can build the best nightlife guide.... and when we do, we will help you make the most of your social life at the bars and restaurants you love!","Our campaign is All-Or-Nothing.

Ragtime was America's first popular music, published in mass quantities, and helped define American music. We can credit Jazz, Swing, the Blues, Rock & Roll, R&B, Be-Bop, modern Pop, Rap, Hip-Hop, and modern classical music having its roots in Ragtime. Orchestras of the time recorded and shared this music with the masses, although today, very few orchestras exist that perform ragtime era music.I am Andrew Greene, a 21 year old college student at the University of Maryland, College Park. Several years ago, I organized the Peacherine Ragtime Orchestra to perform, preserve, and share ragtime, theatre, dance music, and silent films with live accompaniment. The Peacherine is one of two professional ragtime orchestras in the United States, dedicated to re-creating the musical era found between 1880 and 1925 in a historically correct manner. The group primarily consists of music students from the University of Maryland, and Towson University.The orchestra itself is a recreation of a standard 1910 theatre orchestra: 2 Violins, 1 Viola, 1 Cello, 1 String Bass, 1 Flute (Doubling on Piccolo) 1 Clarinet, 2 Cornets, 1 Trombone, 1 Percussionist, and a Pianist (Doubling as conductor). All of our orchestra arrangements are the same arrangements that existed during the late 1800s/early 1900s. We have a library of around 2,000 orchestrations, along with several hundred piano/vocal pieces of music.We released our first CD, ""That Teasin' Rag: Vintage American Arrangements from the Ragtime Era"", in May of 2011. Since then, The Peacherine and I have had the pleasure of performing in several states, in venues ranging from original Vaudeville/Silent Picture Palaces from the early 1900s, to Colleges and Universities, Community Concert Associations, Ragtime Festivals, and more.In our short lifetime, the orchestra has been called one of the best ragtime orchestras in the United States (Hot Jazz Saturday Night, 2011), we've been featured on many radio stations, and our first CD, ""That Teasin' Rag"" has been called one of the most satisfying ragtime collections available. Reviewer Jack Rummel writes that ""The Peacherine Ragtime Orchestra has issued a first-class debut CD and a great future beckons for them!"" (Rummel, 2011)Peacherine and I would like to tackle another CD project, to better preserve and share America's musical heritage.We would like to produce a CD of Ragtime, Theatre, and Show music from the early 1900s, focusing on music created in the famous Tin Pan Alley and music from popular shows of the time. Scott Joplin, Irving Berlin, George M. Cohan, Eubie Blake, George Gershwin, Jerome Kern, and other composers would be strongly featured, along with rarities by Rudolf Friml, George L. Cobb, Jean Schwartz, Abe Olman, Mel B. Kaufman, and others.The CD will be entitled ""I'm Just Wild About Ragtime: The Ragtime & Theatre Music of Tin Pan Alley and Broadway"".The full musical selection would be picked from the following (list subject to change):1.Beautiful Night: One Step (1918) by Rudolf Friml2. The International Rag (1913) by Irving Berlin3. Overture from ""Shuffle Along"" (1921) by Noble Sissle & Eubie Blake4. George M. Cohan's Rag (1910) by George M. Cohan5. Come On, Papa! One Step (1919) by Edgar Leslie & Harry Ruby6. I Ain't Got Nobody (And The Neutrality Rag) (1916) by Young & Warfield7. All She'd Say Was ""Uhm-hum"": Fox Trot (1920) by Emery, Zany, Van & Scheck8. Swanee: One Step (1918) by George Gershwin9. The Bantam Strut (1914) by Arthur C. Morse10. The Dublin Rag (1917) by Jean Schwartz11. Alexander's Ragtime Band (1911) by Irving Berlin12. The Old Timer's Waltz Medley (1917) arr. by M.L. Lake13. Selections from ""Oh Boy"" (1917) by Jerome Kern14. The Grizzly Bear Rag (1909) by George Botsford15. Top O' The Morning (1907) by Albert von Tilzer16. More Candy: One Step (1917) by Mel B. Kaufman17. I'm Just Wild About Harry (1921) by Noble Sissle & Eubie Blake18. Over There! (1917) by George M. Cohan19. Alabama Jubilee: One Step (1915) by George L. Cobb & Jack Yellen20. Mother Machree Waltz (Featuring: When Irish Eyes Are Smiling) (1914) by Chauncey Olcott & Ernest R. Ball21. The Piano Rag (1914) by Russell Franck22. The Winter Garden Rag (1913) by Abe Olman23. The Turkish Towel Rag (1912) by Thomas S. Allen24. Strut Miss Lizzie (1921) by Henry Creamer & Turner Layton25. Scott Joplin's New Rag (1912) by Scott Joplin26. Magnetic Rag (1914) by Scott JoplinMany of the above pieces have never been recorded in their original orchestrations (Overture to Shuffle Along, George M. Cohan's Rag, Come on Papa, All She'd Say Was Uhm-hum, The Bantam Strut, The Piano Rag, Selections from Oh Boy) and many others have not been recorded since their original recordings in the ragtime era.Paying musicians for their time is the bulk of the expenses for the project, which would come out to be around $5000. The musicians are all professionals or conservatory students in the New York City, Philadelphia, Pennsylvania, and Washington, DC areas, so they need to be paid for their time, along with travel expenses. We'd need to raise $2000 that would cover recording costs for Rivermont Records, of Lynchburg, VA, which would release the album through their Rivermont label (with a printing of 1000 CDs). The recording itself would take place in Annapolis, MD, in the middle to latter part of 2013 (currently aiming for September). The remaining $1000 would cover costs to purchase the first set of CDs from Rivermont, along with other incidental recording fees over the weekend.In addition to the CD, I would provide a 20 to 40 page set of liner notes, giving detailed histories of the composers, the music itself, Tin Pan Alley, Broadway, and the era in which the music was composed. Vintage photographs from the time period and scans from the original sheet music will be included in the notes.Once the physical recording and liner notes are completed, the music will be mastered by Rivermont Records, and sent to a plant to be published/printed. This will take anywhere between 1-4 months to complete after we record. After the plant has finished printing the CDs, then we will be able to sell via our website (www.peacherineragtime.com), via Rivermont's website (www.rivermontrecords.com), through Rivermont's distributors, Itunes, Amazon, and other venues.","The main challenge with this is presenting the music in the most historically accurate, professional manner possible. Since many people are familiar with the more modern ragtime style, we want to share what audiences back in 1910 would have heard, in order to present the most authentic sound possible. To do this, my musicians and I will gather and listen to original recordings from the era of bands and small orchestras to hear how the music was presented originally, in order to recreate that experience for modern day audiences.Minor challenges include researching the music, composers, the era, and more for the liner notes for the CD. We currently have copies of all of the orchestral arrangements, but I'll need to spend time researching about the backgrounds of each piece and composer, which will take time and effort. I will be making trips to the Library of Congress and private music collections to study the music carefully, and will be gathering books and other scholarly material on Tin Pan Alley, Broadway, and the era to write informative, scholarly liner notes.Another minor challenge will be picking a date when all of my musicians are available to record. Since we are planning a year out, however, that should not be too great of an issue, and we currently discussing with all twelve a weekend that would work. We've picked a venue to record in Annapolis, MD, that has great acoustics and comes at a very low cost to us, so it's just a matter of finding a weekend where the 12 musicians are not involved in other projects/concerts.",https://www.kickstarter.com/projects/peacherineragtime/jazzin-the-blues-away-a-new-peacherine-orchestra-r?ref=discovery_category_newest,peacherineragtime/jazzin-the-blues-away-a-new-peacherine-orchestra-r,"The Peacherine Ragtime Society Orchestra (www.peacherineragtime.com) is returning to Kickstarter to help fund our fourth recording project! After successfully completing two Kickstarter albums, Step With Pep and Elite Syncopations, we're now returning to help fund our next project, and this is a very special one!In February 2018, Peacherine acquired the theater orchestra collection of legendary ragtime pianist Johnny Maddox (1927-present). Mr. Maddox is one of the leading ragtime piano players of all time, selling over 11 million records (with 9 gold singles), has a star on Hollywood Boulevard, and had a career performing with musicians including Patsy Cline, W.C. Handy, Joe Jordan, Lawrence Welk, Ted Lewis, Tony Pastor, among others. Mr. Maddox collected these 2,000 historic orchestrations orchestrations throughout his lifetime and preserved these in his own immense collection of American popular music.We are teaming up with Johnny's protege, ragtime pianist Adam Swanson (http://adamgswanson.com/) to record an album of music pulled directly from this historic collection, featuring ragtime piano solos, ultra-rare and never-before recorded orchestral selections, and of course popular favorites that you know and recognize.Our new CD: Jazzin' The Blues Away: Music from the Johnny Maddox Collection will feature around 20 selections of ragtime, dance, and theatre music from the turn of the last century. Favorites by Scott Joplin, James Scott, George Gershwin, W.C. Handy, John Philip Sousa, etc. will be featured, along with novelty pieces featuring members of our orchestra, notably singer Bill Edwards (Of the U.S. Navy Sea Chanters), Corey Sansolo, trombonist, and of course, Adam Swanson on piano.The tentative track listing includes:As part of our recording, we're also looking to shoot our first MUSIC VIDEOS! We're hoping to share more of our music via the web, and we'll be shooting two of the above selections with video, AND we will be recording TWO MODERN PIECES IN RAGTIME STYLE (titles TBD)!At the core of this new recording project will of course be the Peacherine Ragtime Society Orchestra, ""the premier American ragtime ensemble"" as hailed by The Washington Post. Over the past eight years the PRSO has become one of America's leading ensembles dedicated to the preservation and performance of America's first popular music: Ragtime. We'll be performing the music on this album using the ORIGINAL period orchestral scores, period performance techniques, and will be using several vintage instruments to get the most authentic sound possible (including our c. 1918 J.G. Richards & Co. ""Traps"" Drum Set, with all the fixings!).Reviews of PRSO's previous Kickstarter CD, Elite Syncopations:""Tremendous feeling for the music in these performances... PRSO has the real sound of the period down pat, whether in a march like Sousa's ""Semper Fidelis"", or a blues like W.C. Handy's ""Beale Street"". Needless to add, their rags are exquisite."" - Fanfare""The PRSO's Elite Syncopations belongs in every ragtime lover's library."" - Fanfare""Impeccably performed."" - The Syncopated Times""Plenty of variety, played in a sparkling fashion which positively exudes good spirits...evocative of the sound that once would have been heard emanating from a park bandstand on a balmy summer’s afternoon.”– Barry McCanna, Sounds of YesteryearIn addition to the recorded tracks, the CD will feature a booklet of liner notes written by Andrew Greene, chock full of information on the selections, composers, cover art for the sheet music, rare photographs, and more!We have funding in place to pay all of our musicians for their time, but need the last bit of funding to make our next CD a reality! Your support will cover:We're very excited to make our new CD and music videos a reality, and we won't settle for anything but the best quality to bring you some of the best music from the Ragtime era. We thank you for your support!","This is PRSO's third project to be helped funded via Kickstarter, and we are confident that we will keep this project running smoothly. We're following a successful formula used in recording our most recent CDs, using a recording studio (Arts Laureate) and engineer we've used previously with superb audio quality. We will be using Rivermont Records' CD pressing plant for our CD manufacturing. Past projects have been delivered on time and within budget. We have a mailing list with 700 supporters and we will be pre-selling CDs to these patrons during the manufacturing process. We will keep backers updated on all progress on the album."

These stories will be exciting, pulse-pounding adventures that throw the reader head first into tales of terrifying monsters and hardened monster hunters (Valons).With this anthology, we will be going for a nostalgic vibe (much like Dragonlance or Forgotten realms) mixed with a slightly darker, grittier feel. Also we strive for relatable characters, emotional depth, and perhaps even some life lessons. We captured this perfectly on our first anthology, and we are confident we can do so again!The world of Harthx is a vibrant setting filled with many different races, whether your looking for classic, unique, mix breeds and mutants.

These pulse-pounding stories will center on strong female characters and female empowerment. Each tale takes place along The Crystal Coast, which is a Mesopotamian-based area of the Dragonband setting, rather than your typical European-style fantasy setting.From women who have taken charge of entire nations, to those who must break the chains that society has bound them with to prove they are equal to their counterparts.These are the Women of the Crystal Coast.Note: Thanks to Stretch Goals getting unlocked, all backers will receivefree digital copies of Joshua C. Chadd's story Tanked, Joel Norden's Duskblade, & R.J. Batla's Novel Tempus.Here are the authors we've brought together for this anthology.Bonus Stories UnlockedBesides the awesome theme, gorgeous artwork, and some phenomenal authors, many of you might be wondering what the Dragonband setting has to offer. So, here is a little bit about it. This anthology takes place along the Crystal Coast on the continent of Draston. The Crystal Coast region is a Mesopotamia based area that not only draws on ancient civilizations such as the Egyptians, Assyrians, Phoenicians, Babylonians, Minoans, and others but mixes in unique Dragonband monsters, cultures, magic and races. Some of our favorite aspects of this region and era of the setting are both things you don't often see in fantasy. Bronze metals, as iron and steel metallurgy haven't been discovered yet, which provides a nice mix-up, as well as a significant step away from European-medieval style fantasy. The next one is magic. Though there are several different types of magic in the Dragonband world, Arcane magic is affected the most, as a paper hasn't been discovered yet. Arcane magic users such as wizards must read and study their magic to replenish their spells, and with the lack of paper, this leaves cuneiform clay tablets. This aspect really limits wizards as it makes ""spellbooks"" fragile and cumbersome, which results in wizards being more of a city type magic user, as they can leave their spell tablets at home and return every night to replenish and study them. On top of that, this area brings forth a host of unique races, as well as some much-loved ones. Jheldi, Cyclopes, Minotaurs, Halflings, Kobolds, Symeon, several types of giants, fairies and others. Keep an eye on the updates, as we will be posting a few to show off what our writers have gotten to work with. :)   *****  $6500 UNLOCKED - Author Pack  ***** Three bonus stories will be added to the Women of the Crystal Coast anthology.

Why is your project almost half of the other anthology goals? -- A: Well, every project is different. Our anthology is rather simple and straightforward. And actually, this project will cost more like 8k-9k total. We've taken steps forward before the Kickstarter launched and have already covered part of the project. We wanted to provide you all with a smaller goal amount, and we wanted to show our dedication to this project.-- Q: So, what if the price runs over what you've planned somehow? -- A: We've also prepared for this by ensuring we have extra funds off to the side to guarantee we don't leave you all hanging with a project that's caught in limbo from miscalculations on our part.-- Q: Not all stories are finished, so can you guarantee that all the authors will provide their stories? -- A: A significant portion of the stories are already completed, but we do still have some that we'll be waiting for. This is why we've hired professionals writers, people we know and trust to get the job done. But, if something does happen, we've planned extensively to cover ourselves. Not only do we have back-ups we can turn to that we trust. If the back-ups were to fail somehow, we have lots of connections with people who would love and are totally willing to jump on this project.-- Q: This is your first Kickstarter project, can you handle it if it succeeds? -- A: We are entirely confident that we can. This will be the 3rd anthology we've published so we understand the problems that we will have to face, and also how to overcome them. As for the Kickstarter, we've spent the past three years studying other publishing type projects on Kickstarter, talking with those who have succeeded with their crowdfunding projects, and read lots of books that teach you how to handle Kickstarters. Bring it on! :)--Q: Do you have plans for Dragonband in the future if this KS succeeds?--A: Oh yes! This is just the 1st step in a much larger plan for the Dragonband series. If this succeeds, We plan on attempting novels, and hopefully gaming rpgs after that. Maybe even a board game if things go well!"

This gives us time to create the full storyline, graphic design and if it is as popular as we are hoping it will be... we'll also be able to get a mailing house on board within that time.Our first plot is set in India, and we already have a sourcing firm on board to help us source some super keepsakes for the boxes.This project carries little risk. We are already established, know what we're doing and used to mail-order. This is just a change in delivery mechanism and tempo for us."

Our vision is to make a very funny game that will make you addicted immediately. We will be designing very unique animations and nontraditional character interactions that will make you want for more.How our game will be different?In most running games the player has to avoid obstacles but usually they are just objects like trains, boxes, pipes, bombs and so on but almost never - other characters. That's exactly what we will be concentrating on! We want 30% of all the obstacles be various characters, like doctors, children, nurses, other old people and animals like dogs and cats. Some of them will be easy to go through and some a little harder, requiring the mastery of the skill.Why you will love it?Everyone likes to crack jokes and everyone likes to laugh. We will make sure that Alfred (the main character) will do exactly that! He is an old fella in a young man's body that has something to say about everyone. From funny compliments to nurses and mocking expressions at doctors, to grumpy old-man-like whining about the retirement home and things that surround him, he will have hilarious comments for everything which will change the way you play games!Currently our team consists of 3 animation and visual effects professionals:Karolis Mikalauskas - In charge of art direction, rigging, technical direction, level design, programming and management. Click here for personal website and demo reel.Romario Marshall - In charge of concept art and animation.

In addition, we would be able to hire other artists who would help us create all the extra content that would help us compete with all the big mobile games on the market!Any extra funds will be used to add extra content and promote the game.The way you play Escape From Raisin Ranch is all up to you! Whether you are a ""jumper"" or a ""slider"" we will make sure to provide you with different animations and dynamic camera angles to get you immersed into our world! The controls will stay similar to mobile game standards: by swiping your phone's screen up the character will perform a jump and swipe down will activate the slide/roll. Left and Right swipes will be used for switching lanes. We will be introducing the Double-Jump which will be a must-use-feature to get through certain mini bosses and obstacles. Our goal is to create a lot of unique ways to avoid being busted while maintaining smooth and sharp gameplay that will keep you on the edge of your seat.In addition to a mobile release, we will also be releasing a modified version of the game to fit your personal computing systems:In our presentation video we introduce the first prototype of the game to give you a general idea and feel of Escape From Raisin Ranch. In the final version the environment will be expanded with a lot more depth and detail. We will be posting updates to the progress as the campaign moves along.

How about mean doctors trying to spin you like a pizza pie and take you away? Nothing comes your way when you master dodging and double-jumping skills!My teammates and I are proud to present Dream Dodger. We are introducing a brand new concept to mobile gaming by bringing in ideas from the ""Dream World"". Have you ever wondered what it would be like if you could create amazing worlds with just your mind? The main character, Alfred, is doing exactly that!Run in a candy-like colorful environment. Dodge the stylish furniture and enjoy funny animations all over your journey. Be prepared to slide under Nastasia and double-jump over Doc or be taken down! Collect as many energy canisters as you can and grab the refreshments to unlock double-jumps. We hope you enjoy the beginning of this great journey!Watch a video review of Dream Dodger Lite on YouTube by Kyle Kay GamingCheck it out on the App Store here and Google Play Store here.Here is the link --> Click HereHow our game will be different?In most running games the player has to avoid obstacles but usually they are just objects like trains, boxes, pipes, bombs and so on but almost never - other characters. That's exactly what we are concentrating on! A big portion of all the obstacles in Dream Dodger are other characters. It requires a mastery of the skill to get through them but that's what makes the game more addicting - the challenges that come with it. Since the action takes place in a dream our creative possibilities are endless. 99% of the games take place in a specific location and time in history. We don't have to rely on that factor so it allows us to bend the rules that other games aren't able to. We are taking advantage of that by creating unique characters and environments. Laws of physics don't apply to Dream Dodger either so be prepared to see original and funny power-ups in the final release of the game.Why you will love it?Everyone likes to crack jokes and everyone likes to laugh. We will make sure that Alfred (the main character) will do exactly that! He is an old fella in a young man's body that has something to say about everyone. From funny compliments to nurses and mocking expressions at doctors, to grumpy old-man-like whining about the retirement home and things that surround him, he will have hilarious comments for everything which will add to the enjoyment of the overall experience.The way you play Dream Dodger is all up to you! Whether you are a ""jumper"" or a ""slider"" we will make sure to provide you with different animations and dynamic camera angles to get you immersed into our world! The controls will stay similar to mobile game standards: by swiping your phone's screen up the character will perform a jump and swipe down will activate the slide/roll. Left and Right swipes will be used for switching lanes. We are introducing a Double-Jump which is a must-use-feature to get through the Doc and tall obstacles. We are creating unique ways to avoid being busted while maintaining smooth and sharp gameplay that will keep you immersed in the experience.PlatformsBesides Alfred, you will be able to unlock 5 other unique characters:Each one of them will have interesting names and 5-6 different outfits that you will be able to choose from. Take a look at the concepts of these Dream Dodgers.We are working on implementing turns and elevations to the level. As you travel along your path the game will either turn to the side or you will be taken on a ramp that goes up or down. Each time a turn or elevation takes place the environment will have a different look to it. Essentially what we are doing is combining a lot of different levels together in one to give the viewer an ultimate experience with a smooth yet intriguing scenery change. Take a look at the concepts of the first environment.Our team consists of 10 computer graphics professionals:Having a talented team is great but it's not enough when it comes to polishing and finalizing a product. Funds received will be used for legal and business matters, forming a company and marketing of the game. In this super fast-evolving industry of mobile games it's hard to stand out without any capital no matter how good your game is. Your contributions will open doors to the world by allowing us to reach out to many gamers around the world who are waiting to play a game like Dream Dodger but just don't know about it yet.We would like to thank you for all your donations.

We meet Quinton in high school as he saves another kid from being bullied by violently beating the assailants. Quinton's grandfather, Pops, realizes he needs reinforcements to rein in his well-meaning but ultimately undisciplined grandson. He enrolls Quinton in a local martial arts school and through martial arts, Quinton finds himself. Fast forward a few years later: Quinton is now an MMA world champion; however, Pops has developed Alzheimer's disease. Though Quinton has faced many challenging obstacles in his young life, his grandfather's illness may be the toughest yet. Just Bake Cookies is an original coming-of-age drama written by Quinn Early and directed by Cameron Early. This story has personal meaning for the father and son duo - much of the Quinton-Pops relationship is based on the relationship Quinn had with Cameron while raising him. Both working stuntmen, Quinn and Cameron have been able to share some great experiences together on the big screen on projects such Bright, All Day and A Night, and The Tax Collector as well as TV shows S.W.A.T. and Seal Team. They are ecstatic about the opportunity to collaborate on a project that hits very close to home.This amazing project wouldn't be possible without producer and stunt coordinator Joey Box. Mr. Box has Been in the industry for more than 30 years as a Producer, Director, Stunt Coordinator, and Actor and has been instrumental in the development in such films as Oblivion, Star Trek and War of The Worlds.Just Bake Cookies will also be used as a vehicle to help raise money for the fight against Alzheimer's, the disease that took Quinn's mother's life.Ann Early was diagnosed with Alzheimer's in 2008 and passed away in 2013.
