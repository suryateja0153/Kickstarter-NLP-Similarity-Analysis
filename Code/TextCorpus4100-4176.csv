It was believed that the Nillius had hunted every last one of them to extinction then disappeared themselves. Now rumors are flooding the  galaxy that the humans are back. Alien Spike follows the journey of four teens, an adolescent alien and a childlike robot in their struggles to find their way in a progressively more difficult galaxy to survive. With the threat of war looming in deep space and political struggles mounting, they may have to rise to a challenge no one else is willing to face.From ancient evils and cruel lycanthrope space pirates to odd alien customs and cultures. They will have their work cut out for them in finding a their way.The goal of this Kickstarter is to publish Alien Spike’s First art book, charms and posters. Any remainder will go to cover the cost of running the comic itself.The goal of the webcomic on alienspike.com it to make a rich and diverse galaxy of characters and species. When I develop a species I don't just pick a single gender, I design it as a whole. Spike Torlaz is from a mono gender  species called Lazerian that still need a mate to reproduce and live in a nearly pure democracy. The Torken are mainly binary species that had been under the rule of a Matriarchy and cast system for eons. Each and every species is designed with a unique culture behind it from daily customs to breeding and warfare.The art book will be filled with never before seen concept art. There will notes about the in depth planning of many species, even some you currently know little about. Of course there will be plenty of art for the Well known species and locations.Every book will be signed!The Music by Skipspace - Get a digital copy of all the Music made for Alien Spike so far. Stuff like this:","This is my first venture but I have worked in the printing industry before and I know the snags that can arise.

You can read the webcomic @:alienspike.comThere are many things to look forward to in Alien Spike:During the Kickstarter I will be attending 4 conventions.If you will be there feel free to come talk to me.Also I will be working on the new illustrations that will be in the book. I will be streaming live every Tuesday and Wednesday from 6pm-9pm on https://picarto.tv/HihoshiThank you so much for considering my kickstarter.","Printing and shipping takes at least 8 weeks for the books. I am having the art cards and limited poster printed locally. So the only issue I see coming up is printing delays.There is a stretch goal that will delay printing by about a month if it is reached to allow me to make the content.I know how to work with print shops. I have been printing with print shops for years including major advertisement print runs numbering in the several 100,000. Shipping in mass is new to me, but if this Kickstarter is wildly successful I will hire a distribution company to help.I don't foresee any major problems."

We've designed and developed the band to be comfortable and sleek for every day use.The idea first came to light after Paul received a power bank as a gift. When he started using it a close friend made the comment that it would be better if it were on your wrist, but the spark didn't happen there. A few weeks later David had his first experience with a power bank at a music festival. After losing two power banks and struggling to keep his phone and GoPro charged, he knew there had to be a better solution where you could keep it on you without any extra effort. Once back David brought up the idea to Paul and they ran with it from there. Right away they knew they were on to something.The boost band houses a circuit with Mini USB input and USB output making it universal to any device. It also has a 1,500 mAh capacity battery.This would give an iPhone 6(1800mAh) about 80% extra battery life and a samsung galaxy S5 (2800mAh) about 50% extra battery life.The band is made of a thermo plastic elastomer with a cover fitting that securely holds the components in place within the band.We've fully designed and developed the product we just need help bringing it to market and mass producing it.The reward we're most proud of is the Patriot Boost.

Please share this campaign and help us reach our goal to make the Boost Band come to life.PROTOTYPE",Our biggest challenge is meeting our funding goal to bring this product to life. Without reaching that goal we will not be able to mass produce the product at the needed volume to reach the retail value. Also if we have a large demand for the band there will be a delay in receiving it for the quantities over the original goal. This delay will be about an additional 14-30 days for the second and third batch. This is due to the manufacturing speed of the volume.,https://www.kickstarter.com/projects/361874782/boost-band-wristband-phone-charger?ref=discovery_category_newest,361874782/boost-band-wristband-phone-charger,"Boost Band is a wristband that can charge any device on the go. You NO longer need to carry around a bulky brick in your pocket. There is now a wearable option that will charge you enough to survive. We have designed, developed and tested it around the nation at music festivals renting our first prototypes out for unlimited charging. The feedback was incredible and helped us mold the product into what it is today. We are now launching a kickstarter to help us scale production and bring this product into the retail space.To Charge the Wristband you simply plug the cord into the micro usb and then into the outlet.To charge any device on the go simply plug a cord into the USB port then into your device.The Boost Band houses a circuit with Micro USB input and USB output making it universal to any device. It also has a 1,350 mAh capacity battery.This would give an iPhone 6(1800mAh) about 50-60% charge and a samsung galaxy S5 (2800mAh) about 30-40% charge. Our goal isn't to give you 3 or 4 full charges but to give you a convenient solution to help you get through the day.The band is made of silicone with a plastic cover fitting that securely holds the components in place within the band.We traveled the country renting our first prototypes out for unlimited charging. Meaning, whenever our wristband died people would come up to our booth and swap it out for another freshly charged one. Our festival customers have been very influential and helpful in giving us feedback to help steer this product in the right direction.

Right away they knew they were on to something.The majority of the funds are for scaling production but there are some fees with shipping and import taxes as well as Kickstarters fees and credit card processing fees.Q: How Much of a Charge Will I get?A: The amount of charge you get is all subjective to your device as well as how many apps you have open or your bluetooth being on.Q: How do I charge the wristband?A: To charge the wristband simply plug the micro USB cord into the micro USB port and then plug it into the wall, or laptopQ:How do I charge my device?A: To charge your device plug your devices cord into the the USB port on the side of the wristband. Q: How will I know when the wristband is done charging?A: Look at your device and if it stops showing its charging indication then the wristband is drained. To conserve energy we have eliminated an battery level indicator on the wristband as it takes power to show the power.Q: When will they Ship?A: First Batch pledges will ship a few days after the campaign ends. Second Batch will ship the following month of October.",We have taken care of all of the production risks and fully developed this product already.

Maybe 5-10 wands a day without help.",The first risk is my timeline not being accurate with timing of molding the chocolate wand. Most of my other projects timeline weren't always perfectly accurate due to ballpark figures they have to make due to never have done it before. I have molded 3-d chocolate pieces for years but never ever have I made a chocolate 3-d wand.The second risk would be this project not getting enough attention to make it’s goal.

I'll cut to the chase - I'm looking for a modest amount of funding in order to buy the requisite studio equipment to start my own podcast, The Wednesday Waffle - namely a top-of-the-range laptop and audio interface, 4 condenser microphones, and the requisite cables, stands, and software. The funds will also be used to set up and maintain an accompanying website.The Wednesday Waffle will be a weekly chaotic foray into the pressing issues of the day, whatever they may be - feminism, technology, geopolitics, bronies, Angel Delight - no subject is off limits. The show will be around 2 hours long, and will feature myself along with a revolving cast of some of the funniest men and women you have yet to have the pleasure of hearing, all from different walks of life. Scheduled guests include local community leaders, professors, stand-up comedians, start-up entrepenurs, and prominent performers from the UK death metal scene, all of whom have different ways of looking at the world. The one thing we insist on is free speech - no one will be censored; everyone will be heard.To tell you a little about myself, I am a full-time writer with a background in journalism and local radio broadcast. I am extremely passionate about politics, music, and culture. I have enjoyed my time as a radio presenter, but have always found public radio to be extremely restrictive in terms of what you can and can't say, as well as format. Starting a podcast is therefore extremely attractive to me, in that the constraints on speech and time are far less stringent, allowing for a full and frank exchange of ideas, which in my view is healthy for all involved.The Wednesday Waffle will be based in Liverpool, UK, and will ALWAYS be ad-free. We want to keep the podcast free-to-access in the medium term, with donations obviously welcome. In the long-term we plan to run our main podcast as a subscription service with a nominal monthly/yearly fee, in lieu of advertising.Any questions, please feel free to ask! Thank you so much for your support.Alex H","We understand that the podcast marketplace is an incredibly highly-saturated one, and the level competition is overwhelming. However, we are confident that we can establish our podcast as a cult hit, and continue to grow with each edition.Our main challenge at this moment in time is purely financial.

We hope that you will appreciate our vision, and help us to bring entertainment and intellectual stimulation to thousands of people in the future.",https://www.kickstarter.com/projects/alexholbourn/karibu-a-revolution-in-millennial-media?ref=discovery_category_newest,alexholbourn/karibu-a-revolution-in-millennial-media,"As well as providing the highest quality of written content, such as reviews, interviews, and opinion pieces, Karibu will produce a great deal of original multimedia content. Our aim is to thrive across multiple platforms, producing regular video content & podcasts, as well as endeavouring to cover the world’s most popular events, such as E3, Glastonbury, and Sundance.Unlike our competitors, we will not bow to the neo-progressive narrative perpetuated ad nauseum throughout millennial media. Nor will we wallow in the fear-mongering of the world's prominent conservative media outlets. Instead, we will bring you quality content and in-depth coverage that is fervently passionate, as well as being reasoned and knowledgeable.As well as reviews, opinion pieces, interviews, we will run our own dedicated news channel, providing reliable, up-to-the-minute coverage of the whole of pop culture universe.Without wanting to give too much away, here’s a brief overview of what you can expect from us:MusicTechnologyGamingTV  FilmAll funds raised from this campaign will go towards producing the high-quality original content mentioned above, as well as covering our office rent and bills, design & hosting costs, and - most importantly - paying our contributors. We will also need to cover the cots of promotional materials - posters, stickers, badges, etc - as well as things like office equipment and software. These costs will be broken down further in our regular video updates, on our Facebook page and here on our project page.The costs involved in producing the amount of original content that we aim to produce are sizable. Once the site is live, and begins to generate revenue, the content will be financially self-sufficient. However, in these early stages, we need your help to turn our vision into a reality.Karibu is a movement, and this is the first step. We are, currently, a compact operation, but we want to be up there with the foremost entertainment media outlets of the world, bringing passion, sincerity, and integrity to the debate. We genuinely feel that we have the potential to become a powerful voice for a group of pop culture fanatics who have been horrendously misrepresented in millennial media coverage. We hope that you’ll consider becoming a part of that. Thank you.","Our main challenge in the months leading up to launch is our lack of capital and resources - we are 100% confident in our vision, and have assembled a brilliant team of writers, journalists, and experts, all of whom have the passion and professional connections to make our collective dream a reality. However, without the requisite capital, it's difficult to make things happen.Another challenge to overcome is our relative inexperience in running a business - professionally speaking, our founders come from a journalistic/creative background, and are inexperienced in the 'nuts and bolts' of running a business. To address this, we have involved a number of senior business leaders from the communications industry, who are vastly experienced and have offered us their invaluable advice and expertise. This relationship will be ongoing, up to the August launch and thereafter, and we believe this will be greatly beneficial to everyone involved with Karibu.We are a bright, resourceful team of people, confident and capable of overcoming the challenges that stand before us. We look forward to repaying your faith in us."

Sponsoring great events like this year's University of Northern Iowa competition pitting sumo robots from around the world, SainLABS helps bring awareness and support to build an Open-Source community and show people the power of robotics.Students try their skills in a practice tournament. Stay tuned for blueprints and more information on the SainLABS mobile unit. After talking with Iowa STEM Council coordinators, we are working on getting details to take our Mobile LAB to schools and clubs throughout the state, with plans to expand even further! We will soon be releasing a blueprint and 3d model. ","Building a community takes a long time, a lot of work, and more importantly building, trust within the community. The engineer groups we have met with are very excited, as is the public; but it will be difficult to address the large range of needs with our current resources. Fortunately, we have spent the last year developing prototypes models within the electronics and robotics community. We have established several partnerships with groups in Cedar Falls, IA, including local makerspaces and the North American Robotics association, which holds an annual MiniSumo Robot contest at the University of Northern Iowa. SainLABS is also working with Iowa Governor's STEM advisory council.In Kansas City, we have established partnerships with groups such as Make48 and Hammerspace, another local established makerspace right in the heart of Kansas City.

All you need is:The Blocks Team is composed of 4 parts: 1.BDS Blocks2.Screws & Fasteners 3.Physical Equipment Kits4.Power SupplyBDS Blocks:The BDS blocks are made from unique materials and designed into different shape. When spliced with the screws and fasteners, it forms a more stable 3D structure and displays smoother physical properties.Screws & Fasteners:These special design accessories kits help splicing and physical transmission in the process. There are 2 kinds of common screws and fasteners for different usages.(1) For block and block combination(2) For block and physical transmission equipment kits combinationPhysical Equipment Kits:The physical equipment kits such as these in the image play a great important role in the transmission work.Power Supply:Electric wheel gears need this! By block splicing and srcew locking, the building blocks can be built into a more stable and perfect 3D structure.With physical kits such as gears, bearings and other accessories, the toy can complete physical actions like levering,wheeling, transmission and more.Children can complete the block toy building according to the manual, or they can splice it to any other thing with their imagination!Recently, STEM has become a trend in education. STEM is a curriculum based on the idea of educating students in four specific disciplines: science, technology, engineering and mathematics. These STEM skills do help a lot when children in school learning even long last till they have grown up.Blocks Team is developed under this background. We mix kids’ favourite brick toy and STEM concept into this fancy new toy.Blocks Team help kids building and finish classics actions of physics, enhancing kids’ engineering ability through physics accessories such as lever, gear, pulley, bearing and so on. Blocks Team are all about promoting learning through fun and enforce the necessary engineering skill children will need in the future!No matter their talent, ability or what language they speak, children ages 5 can play and learn with Blocks Team. No wires, tools and codes needed. It's simple and safe.These are some of the case studies we've collected so far where Blocks Team is suitable to introduce engineering thinking.-- Kindergartens-- Early learning centers-- Elementary schools-- Homeschooling-- Special needs classrooms and inclusion programs-- Afterschool programs-- Technology clubs-- STEM curriculum-- Gifted programs-- Public Libraries and Community Centers-- Maker Spaces-- Tutoring-- Technology campsLongicornScorpionElephantOctopusBeetleLadybirdSharkHorseGiraffeSika DeerTo increase the interest of this toy, we inject 2 kids’ favourite elements into Blocks Team：Comics:  We had invited a famous taiwanese cartoonist to design a comics for Blocks Team and now there are some initial CHINESE editions as free comics book gift into the toy storage box to you!AR Technology:  Augmented reality (AR) is a live direct or indirect view of a physical, real-world environment whose elements are augmented (or supplemented) by computer-generated sensory input such as sound, video, graphics or GPS data.THUSKids can use mobile devices to interact with their Blocks Team creationstake, taking photos with Blocks Team characters and playing game through AR.We're partial supported by great partner, but there is still a huge part of this equation missing. YOU!!Your backing will allow us to amass enough orders to begin a full-scalerolling production and the shipping fee, we need your help to get this toy out off the ground.What's more, your backing do encourage us and build our confidence for we would know how a great number people are surrounding and backing this product!Regardless of the money you support, we do request every backer send your photo to us. We will build up a offical website later and everyone of you will leave your photo on our kickstarter contribution memory wall!","Risk and challenge 1:Our team has no experience in Kickstarter, we try every force to introduce our products and convey the concept of this science toy - Blocks Team, detailly to all of you in the content. Although we know it is still incomplete and can be displayed better. We focus on our product basically and believe that finally the product itself will tell the truth and its value.Risk and challenge 2:For inviting a taiwanese cartoonist to design the comic book, the initial edition book is in CHINESE, which may lead to your dissatisfactions. But please note that this is a free gift to your children, the cost is coverd by us. We believe that kids will enjoy it the same no matter if they can figure out the language. However, we will publish a english version and even making it into animation if Blocks Team is deeply loved by a large number of kids.Risk and challenge 3:The blocks team has been cooperating with an excellent manufacturer partner with many years of experience creating electric block products, and we're glad to inform you that our product design has been finalized. We've been continually perfecting and improving the quality of the product for months now. We are now proud to say we're very close to being ready for amass production. However, there’s always a chance that we may run into unexpected changes or issues due to outside factors, and delays or cancellations are never completely out of the question. If that is the case, we’ll refund your pledge in the result of a cancellation.Unless it's beyond human control, we are fully confident in our abilities, manufacturing plan, and delivery time. Our strong development team possesses all the expert knowledge and experience needed to make this happen, and we are determined to deliver a fantastic product with no delays or issues."

While struggling with his wife's death he tries to help others to lift his spirit. After meeting a young women in need of his help he realizes he starts to fall for her. He begins to care for the young lady so he does everything in his power to help her. After investigating and trying with regular rituals he realizes that he will need to go deeper into the occult. Seeking help from darker rituals and darker forces, he sees that he has become consumed with dark thoughts and emotions.Discovering the darkness involving the young women he tries his all to stop what is to become of her and the child.Characters in this film areNatas/Brujo- The Main Protagonist. After his wife's death he has promised to help anyone in need of being cured and cleansed from witchcraft. Suffering Depression he meets a young women that reminds him of his wife After hearing her situation he is drawn to her more and more while trying to help her. Demanding him to enter further into the dark occult.Lucy- After leaving her abusive boyfriend she begins to have strange occurrences with her and her unborn child. She begins to suspect something is wrong with her child far beyond medical reasons. Suspecting witchcraft she seek help and finds Natas. Feeling protection from him she falls for him every second she is with him.Will go to several things that are needed to make this happen. For starters we need a 4K camera that is capable of working in low light scenerios.We will not buy the equipment as we will rent it to at least save some money, here are more items we will rent to make this camera work to the fullest.Here's also what we need to record in 4kEven though it doesn't look like much of a price, with shipping of the items the prize goes up, and we also want these items insured in case anything goes bad. Not only will we rent this equipment but lights, Memory cards for the Recorder, and we will use our lenses and other cameras that we personally have.What the real cost is, is for cast and crew, No one wants to work for free. Especially for something that requires time. So our main actors have to get paid good and some of them are out of town. That means we have to get them a place to stay. The crew as well, some crew members will be local but others that have bigger roles won't be. Now in each day of shooting days we all need to eat. So it's having to provide food and drinks to all of our Actors and Crew Members.Another thing the money will go to is having to pay for locations and boring legal stuff to have permission to shot at some locations. Props are needed as i don't have witch artifacts and clothes in my closet. So when you put the cost of the Equipment,Actors,Props,Crew,Location,Food, Beverages and Insurance, the price sure adds up. I personally would never be able to afford this as I make 2$ above minimum wage and I use that to pay my bills and school. Well enough of me realizing how broke I am. We need you to help us raise the money to pay for all these things.Look at is as if your buying the DVD, the perks actually do cost to make. So just consider it as if your buying the Walking Dead season 5 DVD pack. My goal with this film is to show everyone horror is not dead. That the genre of horror does not always have to be B movie material. This film will have Neo-Realism and beautiful Aesthetics. I will focus primarily on the story and visuals. I want to stay way from cliches and bring you something so original it becomes a classic.I feel that the internet is a powerful place, that is why you always hear of great project being funded by the people.

Weneed honey jars and bears, lids, labels, boxes, tape, and other supplies topackage the honey; and, bottling machine. 1,000 containers to fill is just toomuch work to do by brute strength making the bottling machine a smart andeffective use of funds. BEENATIVEBACKGROUNDBee Native began in the spring of 2012 by our nowDirector and Apothecary Peter Jacobson with the express intent of providingdirection and assistance in the implementation of a long absent recipe fornatural, raw honey. The initial fields were located in the western part ofWashington State on land loaned to the project. Honey from that year was usedto feed the bees over the winter. The loan of the land extended into 2013 withthe honey from that harvest given to the native community and food-banks. Our Mission“To produce and develop premierequality raw, kosher/halal bee specialties and herbs, characterizing thestewardship of trust and loyalty to our customers.”Our Vision""To bee recognized the world overas the premier producer of exquisitely impeccable raw, kosher and halal beespecialties and herb products anywhere in the Global Marketplace.""BEENATIVE PROJECTBee Native is a project of individual NativeAmerican and American Indian members living from the Western Regions of theUnited States through the Great Plains. Their intent is only to produce andpresent this unique honey to all nations. Their research led them to Peter andthey approached him for help. Peter agreed to the project and to perform hisconsulting and assistance service for free. Peter still is working for free butwe are thinking about changing that some day. We employ over 300,000 honeybeesthat are specialists in producing the most wonderful honey. They are seasonalworkers and we keep them around during the off-season because they are justthat good at what they do!BEENATIVE 2014The project hasproduced very well for the past few years with our just completing the 2014season with 1,000 lbs of honey to get to market.We areconfident that our honey will not just integrate well but also far exceedcurrent honey industry standards when we get products into the communitymarket. For 2014 we will provide our rewards and ship pending orders. In 2015,we will continue our present operation with product distribution being focusedon public events such as multiple local and regional Farmer's Markets and allfour of the Washington State Fairs (4.3 million visitors in 32 days).

He holds a PhD in Allied Health, a MS in Botany and a MS in Public Administration. He has decades of business experience in both senior management and CEO/COO levels. His biography is available on Linkedin at: http://www.linkedin.com/pub/cephus-peter-jacobson/8b/448/788Message from Peter:    I am driven to make an intervention in the present state of bee colony reductions and to help them once again bee a strong part of the ecosystem. It is true that without bees we will not eat.   I have a passion for facilitating the resurgence and support of native pollinators who are an integral part of our food chain. Honeybees have no idea what a pumpkin or squash flower is. They are programmed to other types of flowers and berries. Native pollinators have no idea why anyone would hang on a snapdragon all day but thrive on their disposition towards native plants like the squash and pumpkin.   I am driven also to produce the finest culinary honey, pollen and venom on the globe.   I will appreciate anything that you can do to see us through project.        Happy Holidays to you and yours!                            - PeterBIOGRAFÍA Peter ha estado involucrado en este proyecto desde 2012 Tiene un doctorado en salud aliada, un MS en Botánica y un MS en Administación Pública.

HNY Bee Specialità scoperto e mostra che differenza un progetto altruistico può fare per una comunità ha bisogno e la costruzione di una comunità globale sano attraverso Native Bee. Un piano per aiutare una comunità attraverso una stagione di produzione del miele divenne ben presto una passione per il nostro apicoltore e farmacista. (Abbiamo finito la terza stagione e ha iniziato la quarta stagione) Ape background NATIVE Native Bee iniziò nella primavera del 2012 dal nostro direttore Peter Jacobson farmacista e ora con l'intenzione esplicita di fornire orientamento e assistenza per l'attuazione di una lunga ricetta assente per il miele naturale, grezzo. I campi iniziali sono nella parte occidentale dello stato di Washington su un terreno dato al progetto. Il miele che anno è stato utilizzato per alimentare le api durante l'inverno. Il mutuo fondiario è stato esteso fino al 2013, con la raccolta di miele che dà i banchi alimentari comunità native. la nostra missione ""Per produrre e sviluppare la qualità di uscita specialità kosher / ape ed erbe halal, che caratterizza la gestione della fiducia e la fedeltà dei nostri clienti."" la nostra visione ""Ape riconosciuto a livello mondiale come il principale produttore di specialità kosher e halal prodotti delle api squisitamente pulite e di erbe in qualsiasi parte del mercato globale.""

Esso è destinato a produrre e presentare questo miele unico per tutte le nazioni. La loro ricerca ha portato a Pietro e venne a lui per aiuto. Pietro d'accordo con il progetto e di svolgere i suoi servizi di consulenza e assistenza per libero. Pietro continua a lavorare gratis, ma stiamo pensando di cambiarlo un giorno. Abbiamo oltre 300.000 api che si specializzano nella produzione di più meraviglioso miele. Sono i lavoratori stagionali e tenerli lì durante la bassa stagione, perché sono così buono in quello che fanno! BEE NATIVE 2014 Il progetto è stato molto buono in questi ultimi anni con il nostro appena concluso la stagione 2014 con 1.000 chili di miele sul mercato - questo è dove stiamo chiedendo aiuto. Abbiamo la capacità di fornire i rifornimenti necessari per ottenere il miele per la comunità al nostro primo anno di attività dei fondi - in nero. Abbiamo bisogno di vasetti di miele e orsi, tappi, etichette, scatole, nastro e altre forniture per confezionare il miele; e la macchina imbottigliamento. 1.000 contenitori da riempire è troppo lavoro da fare da forza bruta macchina imbottigliamento facendo un uso intelligente ed efficace dei fondi. Ci sarà anche api in grado di raccontare le nostre donne che lavorano duramente tutto il loro duro lavoro sta andando a fare un sacco di gente felice questa stagione di festa! Che davvero alzare il morale offseason. Siamo fiduciosi che il nostro miele integrerà non solo buono, ma anche molto più alto di quello attuale standard industriale di miele quando arriviamo prodotti sul mercato comunitario.

Lets getthe Honey Wagon* on The Road and Take the Sting out of a stickysituation. (*Choose another name to be blazoned on the truck -see ""rewards"" for details. There is only one opportunity.)Help us finance and build a repurposed salvaged truck to anew sales food truck to bring the absolutely best raw local honey and beespecialties to the communities of Washington State.With the launching of the truck next spring our bees will danceand flowers will sway, the wind will blow, the sun will shine and unicorns willfrolic in the fields. (Well, maybe not the unicorns or sunshine - itis Washington) The truck and permit (cost: $11k) including tax, licensing andinsurance.Tires, general maintenance, road ready preparation ($2k)Conversion to propane ($500)Fabrication to a storefront (cost: $3K)Paint & Lettering put on the outside (cost: $2K)PROJECT TOTAL: $18,500.00Thereis no smarter way to get a mobile store front than to repurpose asalvaged or surplus vehicle and convert the engine to propane. Savingtons of steel and plastic and reducing emissions by a boat load -and - still able to go to where the people are who want you!We need to get the vehicle during the fall so we can work on itover the winter to get a jump on spring 2015.Everything we need will be cheaper during this time of the yearand there will be much less competition at the auctions.We will look for an all purpose type of vehicle, one of threetypes:1. Food Truck2. Low Body Truck3. Low Body BusWe know where we can pick any of these up today, but will bedetailed in our inspection of them before we buy to make sure we get theabsolute premium for each dollar you partner with us.All money weraise through Kickstarter will go directly to the Honey Wagonexpenses.Any additional money we might raise willgo to further updates to make the truck nicer and more reliable. If we raise asubstantially larger amount (I don't know why you wouldn't want to givejust a little more?) I can start to work on our ""Stretch Goals"" thatare listed at the bottom of this page.One thing we would love to do, isinstall a display case on the opposite side of the truck, which would allow usto serve from the other side at events, and on one way streets that only haveparking on our left side (there are actually quite a few locations we wouldlove to be able to serve, but currently can't because we can only serve fromthe passenger side).Here is My StoryMy name is Cephus. My family and I arecommitted to a clean and healthy food supply. The health and sustaining of beepopulations is our critical focus. We work for product labeling and againstGMO's, Monsanto and the agencies supporting them. We believe in supporting allof the producers of real, whole, raw honey and bee products and want to assistthem in getting their products to market because exposure brings purchases andpurchases to return customers.In 2012 I was approached by a group ofindividual American Indians who asked me to help them produce a native honeythat is special to their culture. I agreed because I had the expertise and theythe need - but I had to limit my time to only one planting season. Well, thatwas three seasons ago and I am as dedicated to them as I could ever be. I am adisabled veteran and medically retired making this a hand-in-glove propositionfor my creating some income and my quality of life.The honey is absolutely remarkable! Weleave it raw and strain it only one time. It is produced under both kosher andhalaal regulations, and is pure, full of all its goodness and tastes so verygood! We produce a proprietary golden honey and darker than dark honey.I have 1,000 pounds of the specializedhoney and the need to get it to market - just not the means besides theInternet. The net is fine for some things but this wonderful manna from heavenshould be available locally to the folks who would most enjoy it. I want toprovide that opportunity in a variety of ways - all using the Honey Wagon:How I Will Use the Food Truck - Thisis the fun part!1.Tosell our labeled brand of native honey and other bee products.2.Tosell other honey consigned from other producers of the finest local honey. Our Brand:OurBrand will be the prominent product(s) for sale, advertising, etc. Other Honey:Iwill solicit other producers to consign a small amount of their honey to selland raise exposure for their product. Individual producers cannot afford toattend all of the places we plan to go or to pay for the fees associated withfairs and farms. But, if they consign to me, they can get exposure and a fewbucks.Thisis why I need a rather large vehicle because I will be transporting a big loadand a great variety everywhere I go.Sodoing I will be a great asset to the producers and to the customers of thoseproducts, as well as, establishing our vehicle as the epitome of our brand andthe place where the community can always get their favorite honey's or try anew one.Itis a win - win!Where I Will Use the Food TruckPublic Events 1. StateFairs:I will attend the four major statefairs in Washington in 2015.2. PublicEvents: I will attend public events like SeaFair, Bumbershoot, Taste of Tacoma,etc.3. Farmer'sMarkets: I will attend four Farmer's Markets each month of their seasonaloperation: (Month 1) Sequim Lavender Festival Farmer's Market, Tacoma, ProctorDistrict & Northwest Harvest; (Month 2) Steven's County Farmer's Market,Tacoma, Proctor District & Northwest Harvest; (Month 3) TriCities Farmer'sMarket, Tacoma, Proctor District & Northwest Harvest; and (Month 4) YakimaFarmer's Market, Tacoma, Proctor District & Northwest HarvestPrivate EventsWe will have our operations calendarprepared by January 2015 and will leave predetermined space for requests, suchas:1. NonProfit Organization activities2. Weddings,birthdays, anniversaries, corporate retreats, etc.3. Rodeo's,dances, and just about anything else.The followingare some of the items on our wish list to help make ourproject even better.If we reach $16,500: We’ll be able to add a sink &bathroom. We can have self-serve dispensers where customers who bring theirown containers can purchase our honey at a discount of $1.50 lb; and add a fullsize mechanical awning to shade the customers and products on the working sideof the vehicle.If we reach $17,200:We’ll be able to upgrade the interior towhere it will be comfortable for me and another worker to sleep when we are onovernight or extended stay trips.If we reach $19,200: We’ll be able to get wirelesscommunication equipment and television connections for use in remote locations.If we reach $21,200: We’ll be able to upgrade the interior of the driver's compartmentfor safety and comfort and/or the retail section as necessary. Purchase a goodand sturdy vehicle cover for those times we are stationary to protect thevehicle and product (Like summer sand storms in places like Yakima and theTriCities; wind storms on the Olympic Peninsula and others as we encounterthem.Even More?We will be able to purchase a trailer to match the vehicle where wecan bring a large volume of inventory with us wherever we go. We will add amenities tothe trailer and/or vehicle. Upgrade equipment for increased sales. Othernecessities for the direct and specific use of this project.We will be able to exponentially expand the number a selection of the honey's that we can bring with us to each event & add more and more local producers -as well as- adding a longer reach to more and more communities.We can repurpose additional vehicles, get a warehouse for centralized storage and provide new job opportunities.MIEL FOOD TRUCK SALES MIEL DE VENTE Food Truck Permet d'obtenir le miel Wagon * sur la route et prendre le Sting sur une situation délicate.

En 2012, j'ai été approché par un groupe d'Indiens d'Amérique indiviualqui m'a demandé de les aider à produire un miel indigène qui estparticulière à leur culture. J'ai accepté parce que j'avais l'expertiseet ils la nécessité - mais j'ai dû limitermon temps pour une seule saison de plantation. Eh bien, c'était il ya trois saisons etje suis aussi dévoués à eux commeje ne pourrais jamais être. Je suis un ancien combattant invalide et médicalement pris leur retraite en faire une proposition à la main dans la main pourcréer mon certainrevenu et ma qualité de vie.Le miel est absolument remarquable!Nous laissons brut et égouttez-le uneseule fois.

I am down right nit-picky and a stickler for value and serviceability. I won't buy a pig-in-a-poke or a dressed up three-legged mule, as they say.There are always risks in a project such as this but I have been around this block before. I want the vehicle to last as long as I do and to run better. Each detail of the project has been planned to the enth degree with my eye towards integration of the road store front into where we are now.Production delays are a fact of life. Well, yes but they also can be ameliorated with the requisite knowledge, skills, abilities and passion. I have all of those in ample amounts.Our window for completion by spring is a short one but ample with the types and condition of the vehicles I have scouted out.If the unforeseen happens, I can roll with the punches but I always do what needs to be done to meet my deadlines and honor my promises. The challenge will be to set fire under you to get you as excited and as passionate as I am about the project.

https://www.kickstarter.com/projects/wowflutes/power-alpine-gems?ref=discovery_category_newest,wowflutes/power-alpine-gems,"The purpose of Power Alpine Gems is to bring Grid Power to our rockyard and ranch located in the beautiful Summit, UT. There is an end-of-line power box already situated within 1,500 ft of our property in the adjacent property. This end of line power box has been a problem for the power company as well as the landowners that have it because there are many power surges.One such surge back in 2008 blew up a motor on a farmer's well andstarted a brush fire that nearly destroyed our ranch. The scars of the fire are still visible with dead cedar trees covering the lower foothills.Bringing grid power from this end-of-linelocationto our ranchwould limit the surges and our ranch and rockyardwill also be revived. The well will then have the power to bring crystal clear water up from 400 feet in the ground. Alpine Gems will have power to make the production of ringing quality stone more effective and efficient. An old prospectors dream will continue to blossom and flourish.We have spoken with the local power company and we have determined several options that would get us the grid power we need. The First Option: Approx. Cost = $9,000 - Bury an underground cable ourselves and hire out a certified electrician to complete the required connections on each end. This includes renting a trench digger and digging a trench along a proposed power easement of about 3,500 ft in length. The Second Option: Approx. Cost = $25,000 - We pay the power company to install the underground cable and complete the required connections on each end at a higher cost. The Third Option: Approx. Cost = $32,000 - We pay the power company to install power poles at $5,000 a pole which may distract from the surrounding beauty.A couple of years ago our ranch and rockyard was vandalized by local scrappers. Theperpetrators caused upwards of $70,000 in damages (not including ongoing expenses) for a mere $200 in scrapped copper and other metals. They took a sledge hammer and wire cutters to the generator so that they could get to coiled wiring within. They damaged and destroyed many of the power boxes near the generator and within the buildings. They ruined the pump on our well, and smashed the switches. They broke into the buildings (kicked the doors in), and attempted to remove the main copper wiring that fed from the generator house. They cut wiring and copper plumbing out of the buildings, and took all of our construction materials including copper piping. We have had ongoing expenses and headaches using small portable generators to keep Alpine Gems functioning. Not to mention the expense for purchasing and hauling fuel. We have had to haul water as well for use in the cut-shop and for watering our animalsGrid power at the ranch will help Alpine Gems in many different ways. It will bring water back which will bring life back to the fruit trees and garden plots. Water is also a necessity for Alpine Gems rockyard. It allows us to easily determine rock color and organize more efficiently. Grid power will allow Alpine Gems to grow by bringing necessities this day in age such as internet, and computers and will light up the ranch at night to dissuade scrappers and other would be criminal activity. Our ""Rock Dynasty"" has been somewhat of an oasis to the families associated with our business, Alpine Gems for nearly thirty years. Paul and ArJean Lamoreaux, the Founders of Alpine Gems and Minerals have been making sculptors within the art community happy since 1965. Paul was ageologistand a prospector at heart and absolutely loved the outdoors. During his explorations he discovered gold and staked some claims. He leased these claims to a mining company that proceeded to produce upwards of $80 million over the life of the operation. Paul used his 2% proceeds to grow and build his Alpine Gems and Minerals business. He had some beautiful structures built on the property, had a well drilled (he went 300 ft deeper after hitting water in search for gold) and he was well on his way toachievinghis dream of a future haven for his business and family.This dream wascut short as his health began to decline and the doctor bills rose. The buildings included an unfinished 7,000 sq ft house with a wraparound dock that had five bays for truck deliveries, as well as an unfinished cut-shop and lower rock shop.The buildings have remained unfinished for nearly twenty years. Paul was verysuperstitious and built all the structures to last another depression. He also decided on generator power to keep the placeclosed to outside influence. We intend to make the dream of the ""Rock Dynasty"" a reality. Getting grid power to the property is just one obstacle in the road ahead but with your backing we can continue to build the dream of Paul Lamoreaux, an old prospector.We have many great rewards that include our Gem quality Alabasters. Alabaster is a form of gypsum, the same gypsum that are in nearly every home in the US - in the form of drywall. Alabaster is a harder more compressed gypsum that also forms in many unique and beautiful colors. One of these colors is our Translucent Orange Alabaster. This color is rare within the mineral kingdom as it is only found within our quarries and in Egypt. Alpine Gems has been called the Baskin Robbins of Alabaster because of the many unique colors that we offer.Alabaster is a Gem Quality gypsum it also is very easy to carve. It is between two and three on the hardness scale and can be polished with sandpaper and water. Because of its ease of use Alabaster is a good choice for beginning sculptors as well as expert level. We would love to continue to be the number one supplier of Alabasters in the US and we appreciate our backers for making our job easier!*Special thanks to Behind Closed Doors Productions for our videos!","As with any project that is undertaken there are always risks.  The risks that we determine to be highest are the risk of associated costs on the project that were unintentionally overlooked in the planning stages.  There is always something that one did not expect, as we cannot foresee the future.  We are confident that this project will succeed and we have done our homework in researching the cost of connecting to the grid in our area.Another challenge that may hamper the project is working with surrounding property owners to come to a clear understanding of boundaries that the project will operate under.  We are related in some way to the majority of the surrounding property owners which may result in easier agreements.We also have the challenge of implementing power within structures on the property once the grid connection is established.  This is not really a concern with fulfillment of the kickstarted project as we have been operating without power for some time.",https://www.kickstarter.com/projects/wowflutes/the-great-southwestern-suzuki-adventure?ref=discovery_category_newest,wowflutes/the-great-southwestern-suzuki-adventure,"*Please Note: This Kickstarter is the only place my images are being offered & sold.My Name is Nathan Cowlishaw and here's my Instagram:http://instagram.com/talking_tree - My skill as a photographer is 15 years and running and have engaged similar journeys before. I know what is required to complete this entire project. It is certainly something that is achievable. Read on!This will be a 60-90 day photoshooting expedition into the heart of the American Southwest (that my friends, followers and backers) will get to be part of as I report daily to tell stories of America and its history through its rural decay, Indian reservations, and the sprawling rugged beauty of wastelands, swamplands and plains that define the Unites States. As this story unfolds, I want to follow in the footsteps of those who came before us and find those people who are living in the present who continue to tell their story.These places will soon be gone or forever changed.I want to be a documentarian. I want to capture what is quickly disappearing, what is there now, and start trying to interpret what the future may hold in store for usl I've made it my life's work to document these places in the Southwest for future generations who will be able to look back on my work and see what things once looked liked.I am utilizing Kickstarter to achieve some ofthesegoals through a thoroughphotographicexpedition that will take me further than I have been able to go before and I would like your help.I've spent my life visiting various places in the Southwest but I have have yet to undertake such a prolonged and detailed journey such as this. According to Roadtrippers - I can complete the main route in 166 hours if I drove non-stop but I will be following many byways, tangents, dirt-roads and trails that are not on the main road. The route according to Roadtrippers is about 6099 miles not including thestretch I'm taking fromFarmington, Gallup, Flagtaff, Kingman and onto Las Vegas. In total, Iwill be covering upwards to 9,500 miles!There's an important artist's statement that I need to add about my body of work:I will not separate the human element from the natural scenery in my landscape photography because there is no such thing as ""pristine wilderness."" This is a false construct because humans are a natural part of the landscape. I wish to utilize what I see photographically as a way to educate people through imagery with a more objective story of American History. There is no such thing as virgin untouched wilderness. In fact, the falsity of this myth is a by-product of Manifest Destiny that runs strong in other causes such as the Environmental Movement. We need to be aware of where this idea started at its roots!The journey will start and end in Cedar City, Utah and will traverse down Nevada's Extraterrestrial Highway passing by the Alien stronghold of Rachel and onto Goldfield and Tonapah, Nevada. From there, I will venture through the Mojave Desert of Southern California, visiting and exploring every nook and cranny of along that rugged and beautiful route, searching for decay, solitude and other things that have been forgotten to the normal buzz of history. For example; I want to explore the underbelly of Palm Springs, California, and find the more alternative truth; the story of the original inhabitants of Palm Springs; the Indigenous Cauhilla people who called it their homelandslong before the white boosters came in from Los Angelos, took over the entire valley while inventing their snowbird community filled with newly designedCountry Clubs and desert retreats...Several stops will Salton City, and other small communities in Southern California. There are minimalist landscapes to be found here that are often overlooked and still ripe for new interpretation and definition!Next will be Needles, Yuma, Tucson and Bisbee, Arizona as well as other parts of Southern Arizona down along the border of Mexico. The excursion will cover most of the rural communities at the extreme southern part of the Southwestern borderlands. The route will traverse along 1,600 miles of the United States & Mexico border. I will be tent camping, while enjoying the crickets. I pull my camera out in remote areas and capture the Milky Way outside my tent and coyotes will be hollering off in the near distance.I will be doing a lot of photography work in Texas, starting with El Paso. The time spent in Texas will be around a month or more. Some towns on the list include Hollywood filming locations, historical locations, and towns such as Paris, & Odessa. I will also be hitting all the major metropolitan areas; Houston, San Antonio, Dallas, and Austin (just to name a few) and their surrounding rural communities. A venture up to the pan-handle of Texas may unfold but most of the trip (in Texas) will be traveling in the Southern regions, closer to the border - then a parallel path will be followed back west when returning from New Orleans, Mississippi, and Oklahoma City.I will be documenting the beauty of these rugged landscapes in the form of story-telling, art, photography & regular updates.I will report weekly, if not daily via social media including but not limited to Instagram, Tumblr, Pinterest, Facebook, Twitter, and Youtube.The truth is often discovered or witnessed when exploring and gathering data from both primary and secondary sources as well during those times when an explorer is investigating in the field or following the footprints of those who have come before us.I will also exploring the mysteries and folklore that is inseparable part of Southwestern culture and landscape such as UFOs, Aliens, Bigfoot, Skinwalker, haunted houses, ghost towns, and abandoned places of mystery.. I will be exploring the histories and stories of different areas such as New Mexico & the Roswell Incident, etc! I will also look at the people who haunt these landscapes and live in these colorful communities. My strongest desire is to locate some of the most isolated parts of the United States off main thoroughfare and go off the grid if the opportunity presents itself?The journey will lead also to Oklahoma and into the Midwest swamps of Louisiana & New Orleans where the excursion will reach its final chapters before returning to where it all began in Iron County, Utah...We are offering some excellent rewards to those that pledge to our project. Thank you for stopping by! :)A random but cool and personalized post card sent from location. Postcards will be collected on the journey, while en-route. Will include a warm thank you and can be sent internationally. Nathan Cowlishaw will hand sign each!A thank you in the form of a signed 5x5 inch professional print on archival quality paper. Choose an iconic Southwestern landscape signed by Talking Tree. You will be notified in the survey after we are successful of your choice of prints.A thank you in the form of an 10X10 inch print of an iconic Southwestern landscape of your choice signed by Talking Tree.A super warm thank you in the form of a 12x12 print of an iconic Southwestern landscape of your choice signed by Talking Tree.A 60-page photo chatbook of Talking Tree's images from the trip! These will be taken during the journey and uploaded to Instagram while in route. This was an idea that was suggested by @Oxfordhaus, one of Nathan's followers on Instagram!A 60-page photo chatbook of Talking Tree's images from a specific state in the desert southwest!Choose from Nevada, California, Arizona, New Mexico, Texas, Louisiana, or Oklahoma.Instagram Meet and Greets with Talking Tree while he's traveling through different regions. Meetup locations will include a delicious meal: Either Lunch, Breakfast or Dinner and a photoshoot with Nate. He can teach you what he knows about photography.

The mounting blocks hold the print away from the wall for a contemporary float effect. No frame needed!Printed on heavy duty PremierArt Water Resistant Canvas, then finished with a dry lamination process that is UV and water resistant.The canvas is stretched and then wrapped over a 1 3/8"" thick wooden frame. Your photo extends to cover the sides of the frame for a beautiful presentation.Note: Since the outer edge of your photo will be used for the sides of the frame, not all of your photo will be visible when an admirer views it from the front.To create MetalPrints we infuse dyes directly into specially coated aluminum sheets, creating truly archival works of art. These MetalPrints showcase a revolutionary new medium that is highly durable, waterproof, weatherproof, and ultra scratch-resistant. The unique printing method gives your photos a vibrant luminescence with incredible detail and resolution.Choose from High Gloss and Satin finishes.Each print has rounded corners for your safety and the surface can be easily cleaned with any commercial glass cleaner.Metal Prints come ready-to-hang with two 3/4"" thick lightweight foam blocks and aluminum plate with pre-drilled holes. MetalPrints sized 30x40"" and up are backed with an inset frame for added stability. When hung, these stunning prints will float off the wall.Because we will be promoting the Utah UFO Festival during the entire trip, this is an extended networking mission to connect like-minds and adventurers into our community. That is the main goal of this Kickstarter; to build a strong community. Nate will do the best he can using his photography to document and tell the stories, which will require a lot of time, effort and work on his part to produce something beautiful and unique from all of these experiences.Please keep in mind that international shipping can take anywhere from 2-6 weeks, though I will keep backers updated as shipments are completed. US packages will come with tracking, but unfortunately, international packages will not as it's too cost prohibitive. These are special kickstarter prices. Once I start selling these items in my website (when I am funded) the prices will be higher. For now I am keeping them as affordable as I can as a thank you for helping make this possible!A trip accompanyingTalking Tree, with his friends, into the deep bowels of Mother Earth onto the Havasupai Indian Reservation inside Grand Canyon in Northern Arizona; excludes airfare, food expenses, and you must have your own camping/backpacking gear. We will drive from Las Vegas, Nevada for a 5 hour journey to the trail-head and backpack down into the canyon in the middle of the night when it's nice and cool. It's 115 fahrenheit during the day. You must be physically fit as the hike can be strenuous and tiring. They do have helicopter services and horseback services but those expenses cannot be covered by Talking Tree. This trip covers gas to-and-from Las Vegas, Nevada, and all entrance fees into Havasupai.Our biggest Reward islimitedto only ONE spot! - Includes a trip with Nathan Cowlishaw to Havasupai June 17-22, 2015! *Airfare not included!Pledge $9,550 (or more) and get $15,000 dollars worth of creative coaching, services and other exclusive goods as a thank you for being our biggest backer. This is where Talking Tree will take time out of his day for up to a year, helping and training you, etc!This reward is exciting for Talking Tree and will begin some time after the photography expedition is complete. It is our token of appreciation to you for making our project a success!The Apprentice will receive six months of service with our company, Roadrunner Agency, to build social capital for your business, or brand and it can be personally tailored for an artist, photographer, etc. Includes services for Twitter, Tumblr, Pinterest and Instagram. You will continue to post content to your feed but Talking Tree will promote your social media feeds to hundreds, and thousand of people and encourage them to follow you. He will also help you to develop a better marketing strategy that will enhance engagement with your community. The retail cost that Roadrunner currently charges is twelve hundred dollars a month on a six-month contract.  That is over $7,200 in social capital services. To see one example of our most recent work check out Bar 10 Beef: http://instagram.com/bar10beef- We were able to grow their following to 1,500 people in less than two months. We also trained their team on how to develop their strategy to attract more people to their community.The Apprentice receives a Micro Four Thirds camera setup to match the same one that Talking Tree is using on his expedition: a Voigtlander 25mm F0.95 lens (a personal favorite), and a premium Olympus mirror-less camera. Comes in a nice Clik Camera Bag (made in Saint George, UT), a 64GB Memory Card, and a fine art 40x40 metal-print of your choice signed by Talking Tree. To top off this Apprentice we have included 24 separate training sessions one-on-one with Talking Tree via Skype Video or in person, depending on geographic location. These sessions include training on professional photography and marketing yourself on Instagram more effectively. I will teach you A LOT in these personalized sessions.  Oh, almost forgot, you get a 22kt Gold Wowflute EBE Whistle delivered in your choice of Orb!Estimated completed delivery: May 2016After seeking feedback from backers, we decided it would be beneficial to post itemized DETAILS on exactly where project funds will be used. We wanted to have a bit in reserve in order to pull this Kickstarter off effectively without having to fly by the seat of our pants or the skin of our teeth. So here’s the rudimentary breakdown:Prelaunch Expenses:Marketing Expenses:$800Video Production costs: $500 - Included gas, trip expenses, and post production video work (that gopro time-lapse sure takes a long time to process!)Estimated Trip Costs:9,500 total miles = 6,600miles + 30% for detoursAverage Travel per day = 143 milesFuel consumption:25 mpg = approx. 6 gal. / day = $25 / day (super cheap because its a four banger Suzuki!)65 days @ $25 = $1,625Tires / repair = $500$0.50/mile for wear / tear on personal vehicle = $4,750Emergency (tow & garage) = $1,500 (better to be safe than sorry)Hotel 14 x $45 = $630 (camping under the stars is preferred - but sometimes a rundown motel makes for good photography #ruraldecay! ;) )Truckstop Showers $12ea average = $555 (this covers all the days where there is no hotel stay)Campsites / RV parks = average 45 days @ $25 average = $1,125Food per diem $25 / day = $1,500 (it always seems to be more than you expect)Budget for National Park fees = $80 for year passState parks / Museums fees = $300-400 (this is a bit cheap - some museums (wax in hollywood) are $40/person - got to capture the uncanny valley too!)Kickstarter Fees 5% = $750 Credit Card Processing 5% = $750$13,965 running totalAs you can see we are coming quite close to our Kickstarter goal without adding in the costs of reward fulfillment after the trip which will most likely come out of our pockets.Lost Opportunity Cost:Roadrunner Agency absence = $4,500 (unfortunately bills don't take an absence - got to pay people to run things)Reward Fulfillment:Most rewards will be from content acquired during the project trip and will be produced afterwards.","I've already got experience traveling for month long journeys. I know what I can and can't handle and what I will need to do to complete this project. I can handle it for sure. :)Traveling long distances, taking side routes, will all involve a hunt for the deepest nooks and crannies of America's most rural  areas nestled in Desert Southwest. We are talking landscapes that inspired filmmakers like the Coen Brothers and movies like, ""Paris, Texas."" There is risk associated with everything I am doing as with any adventure that is undertaken but not common. Between March-August the bulk of our work is fulfilling the expedition and securing an immense portfolio of priceless Images from the trip will be used to fulfill the rewards for the Kickstarter campaign. This special portfolio of images will be created for backers to choose which selection they wish to have printed. All orders will be processed starting as soon as the 2015 Utah UFO Festival concludes in Southern Utah at the end of August. All orders will begin shipping from the end of August to September!All rewards offered through this Kickstarter Project will be the end-result of a 2-3 month journey into the deep Southwest, from Southern California to the swamplands of Louisiana, up to Mississippi, Oklahoma City and all the way back through the Southwest. All of it will be a creative networking journey in search of the truth and the mysteries of the Desert Southwest. Places visited will be many major historical sites, haunted places, farming communities, ranches, wilderness areas, national parks, state parks and several Native-American Indian reservations! A story will be told both photographically and interpretively from the heart. It is a project in the making that has been the dream of a life-time."

Bryan began scultping almost immediately after I approached him with the idea, and I believe what he created is truly something amazing.Each Mothman figure will come bagged in poly bags with packaging inserts, instructions on arm attachment and stapled header cards, just like classic Sofubi! The figure wil include the several Variants / Paint Options, which you can check out in the Rewards section below.We thought the campaign needed a little cute to it, so Bryan and I brainstormed to come up with a little thing we call CryptoZoo Plushies. We'll be making a plushie to accompany each of our vinyl figures.The Mothman Plush is based on concept art by Bryan Doell. We went through a prototype process with a plush manufacturer, which included making several different versions. After we got them just right the manufacturer sent us two finished samples. They stand 9"" Tall, have hard plastic domes for eyes, and feature 4 bendable wings. We couldn't be happier with them. If we are funded, we're ready to mass produce the next day, and should have them withing 12 weeks. Retail price will be $29.99, but kickstarter backers get theirs for $24.99.

I’m Shaun Hadley, collector, nerd, amateur artist and a huge fan of the unknown. As far back as I can remember, I was fascinated by the strangest creatures from around the world. No amount of books, television programs, stories or movies could ever satisfy my hunt for the truth. Because it’s out there!Stemming from my love of monsters, I also developed a love for Kaijus, and began collecting vinyl Japanese toys. Particularly Godzilla and the US Ultraman series by Dreamworks. My brother would import Bandai figures for me through his comic book store, many of which are broken and battered from intense Kaijus battles, and most of which still remain in my collection to this day.In June of 2018 I had the idea to combine the two, and produce a line of figures devoted to the monsters I grew up loving. After messaging Bryan Doell, of BDCharacterlab things started happening faster than you can say “It’s Nessie!” And now, we are ready to make our own figures! But I’ll let Bryan tell you about himself!Greetings fellow Inhabitants of Earth! I'm Bryan Doell, amateur FX artist, costume fabricator, toy hoarder, and Kaiju enthusiast. My love of all things cryptid dates back as far as I can remember, Dad has always been a true believer and always had loads of cool books and collectibles growing up so I got a great ""education"" from the start. I remember not being able to sleep after being introduced to the glowing red eyes of the Chupacabra while watching Unsolved Mysteries with Mom. Flash forward, I met Shaun over a year ago when he hired me to make him a classic Godzilla suit and we hit it off instantly, with at least a few bars of Kaiju conversation on a daily basis ever since. When Shaun told me about his Cryptid figure idea, I knew it was fate...my wife, Kasia, and I had been talking about starting an Indy toy concept for weeks prior and this had just the right feel. Ideas started flying and within two days, I was sculpting a prototype!","Cryptid Kaiju is a passion side project for us. The only real risks involved are the potential failure of the Kickstarter, as well as meeting the goal dates we set for ourselves. We want to have these In your hands as soon as possible! Its only Bryan and Shaun, so our biggest challenges will be keeping up with demand.

In the years since, we have remained steadfastly committed to that mission, but we have expanded our operation to New Jersey, New York, Texas, and Florida. Our plan is to keep on expanding, soon to Virginia and Alabama, and keep on making as wide and as positive an impact as possible. We meet with active duty soldiers, wounded warriors, veterans, their families, and other community members constantly, raising funds for charities that support our military and our wounded warrior organizations in addition to children’s and first responders’ charities.It has been fifteen years since our launch, and we remain as motivated as ever. We would now like to do something even bigger. Serving communities during flood, tornado, and hurricane disasters in Louisiana, Texas, and Florida, we know that we could make an even greater impact if we were equipped with a multipurpose vehicle. Our idea is to use a multipurpose vehicle to extend our reach further than ever before and to distribute food, water, coffee, blankets, coats, and other supplies in our communities’ moments of need.Shuttling our members wherever they need to go, the multipurpose vehicle would represent a bold step forward for The USA Cheerleaders. Other uses would include passing out care packages to the homeless population, collecting and distributing gowns for school dances, and collecting and distributing school supplies for teachers and students in need. A group of patriotic, professional cheerleaders, we want to do everything we can to show our respect and our support for our military, the flag, and our country.

We are also offering sponsor spots to those who want to associate their brand or organization with The USA Cheerleaders! We have set a lower fundraising amount in order to make the MPV a reality, but the larger MPV (pictured) is what we are aiming for. It will allow us to do more outreach.Driving from the East Coast to the West Coast and back, we will use the MPV for national and local community support. We know that we are doing important work, which is why are so enthusiastic about ramping up our efforts further and getting our organization out there. Let’s show the brave men and women of our military that we are with them all the way and that we notice and appreciate all their sacrifices!Beyond making a monetary contribution, you can help out with this campaign by sharing the campaign link with all your friends and family.

https://www.kickstarter.com/projects/1473985686/fast-phillys?ref=discovery_category_newest,1473985686/fast-phillys,"Hi,My name is Steve Hodges and My wife Sheri and I have a serious passion for food! I grew up in the Philadelphia area with an Italian mother and great food was always a big part of my life. We have many dishes we love and have learned to create and recreate.There are quite a few that we would love to share with the world and maybe someday we'll get that opportunity ? But The one thing we have shared is our Cheesesteak and People love it!Growing up a very creative singer songwriter guitar player person trapped in the construction business the thought of being in the food business was only joked about when people would come over, eat our cheesesteaks and say ""you should sell these sandwiches people would love them"".Sheri and I my wife of 20 years would labor all day doing drywall and come home and cook amazing meals for our kids.We would plan it all day and it didn't matter how tired we where we didn't stop. As time went on I became a general contractor and sheri and I started our own construction company.We did everything together and were always trying to find a better way for our family.Then came 2007! The economy tanked and our company's work dried up,of course we had no idea how bad it was going to be.We decided to invest in some equipment for the company. We where looking at trailers and came across this concession trailer and both looked at it and said wow wouldn't it be cool if we got that and started selling cheesesteaks part time until work picks up? We decided to go for it and bought the trailer. Neither of us had ever worked in a restaurant before( except sheri had worked as a waitress briefly). So we got to work finding the right ingredients.We searched out the right meat and bread,then we figured out the perfect amount of meat and cheese to make it authentic and amazing and it was!! We found a gas station that would let us park in front and sell our food.Our trailer was small so we called it LITTLE PHILLIES.Our cheesesteaks were anything but little,They were overflowing with delectable rib eye steak on amazing Philadelphia bread! It wasn't long before it started to catch on.We did something different then most mobile kitchens and started giving out menu's with our cell phone number and started taking pick up orders.We also worked steady business hours so people knew when we where there That worked beautifully! Then the news paper wrote about us and it went crazy! We woke up the morning of the article with no idea what was about to happen. We got there opened and the whole parking lot was full of eager Cheesesteak fans! We sold out that day in 3 hours!Shortly after It became obvious to us that we had out grown the trailer and set our sight on a empty restaurant only 2 blocks from our location.The place had been empty for years and nothing ever made it there.But we decided to go for it! People loved our Cheesesteaks some much they kept coming back for more! We opened in early 2008 and got even busier. We started by forwarding our phone so we had those steady orders coming in as soon as we opened. We added many more items to our menu like hoagies and fries drinks ECT. We soon had a booming business! We didn't stop pushing we wanted everyone to know us so we made our own T.V commercials and radio jingles increasing our business even more. Unfourtunatly after the sixth year Sheri became ill and it became very difficult to keep the business running because it had always been the 2 of us doing it with our help and it just wasn't the same.The business was still doing well and was well known so we decided to sell it.We sold it at the end of 2014.I decided to go back to contacting and concentrate on Sheri's health.We had sold the restaurant for a good amount of money considering it was selling over 50.000 sandwiches a year when we leftand had a great reputation But lost most of that money to medical cost and surviving trying to start a new business.Needless to say we built a great business as it is still up and running strong after10 years! Although we have heard people say that it's not the same since the new folks took over. Sheri and I where the main cooks and even though we did teach people how to cook them no body cooks them like us!That brings us to now! Sheri is getting much better and we miss doing what we do best! Little Phillies was great but it had many limitations and barriers that stopped it from it's full potential. We could not duplicate it the way it was set up and we really wanted to so our sandwiches could be available in many areas !We know from our extensive experience what the problems were and are,but after much thought we have come up with a great new reinvention of our sandwiches. Our new restaurant will deliver our amazing sandwiches in a fast food setting probably doubling our old numbers in the first year.It will begin in a much better location with many more potential customers and we are sure to get press immediately when we announce it's opening!We really have high hopes for raising enough to pick up where we left off.Sheri and I feel like we sold a big part of us when we were forced to sell our restaurant.I want her to feel the inspiration again because I feel it will bring her to full recovery and after a 3 year break I long to have us doing our thing again.We love it and people do to.We know we can do it better then before with a little kick start.   ",As with any new business especially food getting attention and getting people to try you and then giving them something they want again and again is the challenge . We have a big advantage in our area because we had more articles written about us then any other restaurant owners.We will have a lot of people that will come out of there way to try it when the news paper writes about it and we know they will. We will also be in much better location if we are able to secure it soon.The place we have picked out that is available now is perfect! Also our new product is amazing and we know exactly how to set it up.Another problem new restaurants face is help.We trained many of our family members and can get all the help necessary to get up and running.We will teach them the new system and they will be glad to help! They have a lot of experience and can handle and have handled super busy situations.Also our process will be much easier then our old one so training new workers will be fairly simple once things are up and running.Some people that open restaurants don't know the best places to purchase their products.We know all the distributors and we know exactly where to go for all the things we need.Not to mention 7 years of restaurant experience owning managing and cooking .,https://www.kickstarter.com/projects/1473985686/valconis-king-of-macaroni?ref=discovery_category_newest,1473985686/valconis-king-of-macaroni,"Valconi's King of Macaroni offers the best macaroni combinations on the planet!I grew up with an amazing Italian mother from Italy and my mom loved to cook!She made the most incredible food we were all totally spoiled when it came to food! Being a food lover myself I grew up in Philadelphia exposed to many great foods and the best bread anywhere! One of my favorite foods besides the great Italian I was blessed with was Cheesesteaks! I could eat one everyday and never get tired of it! Well I never at that point thought of getting into the food business but that changed when I got older. I moved to Florida and missed my cheesesteaks! So my wife Sheri and I decided to start in a little trailer and sell cheesesteaks ,just to do it on the side and feed my craving to share with everyone one of my childhood favorites. After all everyone in my family would beg me to make them at home. To make a long story short when people tried it they went crazy over it! We quickly had to move to a restaurant.We became famous in our area and built it into a thriving business. After 7 years and rising sales every year we got a great offer and sold it.After almost four years out of the food business and losing all our money trying to return to the contracting business, we are missing sharing our food creations and our old family recipes! We realize that we have so many other great foods that we make at home that people will love equally ! At the same time we wanted to incorporate our proven product into our new one. So now we have combined our famous recipes with macaroni and lasagna! As I mentioned this restaurant is named after and is inspired by my mother and her great recipes! She recently passed away and we miss her dearly! One of my favorites if not my favorite growing up was lasagna! I was taught by my mom how to make it and the sauce which helps make it so spectacular! We served it for a couple days at our old restaurant and people came back for months wanting more! We weren't setup for that there so we didn't pursue it .We know people will love it though! Our menu for Valconi's is offering totally original versions of that Classic dish.I know my mother would love this stuff!When we had our restaurant we offered some great other food choices besides cheesesteaks but discovered that if we had to survive on those things we wouldn't survive.So thats what makes us so different then your average Italian restaurant.We have old family recipes plus our new ones. We have incorporated them into the favorite food dishes. Our focus is not to emulate but to reinvent and rejuvenate our favorites to everyones liking . Please look at our menu on our website. https://www.kingofmacaroni.comWe think we have a great new product and we are thinking very big! We just need a kickstart! We need to secure a mobile unit !We think a truck would be best but a trailer would work.With that we can promote daily and build our brand easier then with what we have set up now. We have had many newspaper articles written about us over the years in our area and us with a new food in a new mobile unit will most definitely get us a nice write up.Our plans go much bigger then that we plan to market and ship our product on line as well as open brick and mortar locations. But we have a trademark pending and are setting it up for super growth! Once we get going the sky is the limit! We are hopeful that we can raise enough to get a mobile kitchen up and running within the next couple of months and if all goes right we will back in an awesome new restaurant within a year or so and who knows from their maybe many locations soon after.","Every restaurant faces many challenges to make it work and do better then survive. We know from having created a successful product that branding is so important.We plan to get attention and we know how from past experience ! We also know that once people try our food , we will thrive.It's just that good!If you help us get started you will have done something great because this has huge potential and people will love it!"

My name is James Truswell, I'm 21 years of age and i am the Founder and Co-owner of Vis Vires. I am so passionate about my brand of watches, I never stop working as it is my dream to drive the Vis Vires brand to its full potential. The main reason of my passion being that i have worked for every single penny i own since the age of 16 and I've took a leap of faith.. and invested a huge amount of money for somebody my age into a business, which is great in the respect that it is all self funded! However, i can never stop innovating! I've designed a new model of our current watch which will be the best quality of its kind for the price you will be paying! With my current range of watches, when i am selling to a customer, i like to be open and honest and when they ask why they're such a good price for the quality? i have to explain my background and how i want to make a beautiful classic watch affordable for anybody. I have always loved minimalism, it is in my eyes, a true vision of elegance! You can see this is all of my designs, bold colours and a minimal dial. Anyway, the reason i am launching this campaign is to create a new model of timepiece! Imagine this, a swiss movement, sapphire glass, 316L stainless steel with the most luxurious leather or my bold design of nato bands, for just £150! Its no exaggeration when i say this timepiece will be the best of its kind for the money and i can create these for both men and women.The pledges on my kickstarter page save you a huge discount from RRP and as soon as our kickstarter pledge finishes i will have no choice but to put the prices up to RRP, even though they are VERY affordable for the quality of watch we are creating. For the lower amount pledge you are saving a huge discount on our current model of watch, and we are reinvesting this money to create our new model and any money we receive over the pledged amount will be reinvested into marketing and customer service.""Capture your moment in time with Vis Vires""Perfectly complimenting your Timepiece comes a branded display box and another elegantly branded cardboard packing.Although We're a fairly new brand - Celebrities such as James Hill & Austin Armacost (winner and runner-up of i'm a celebrity big brother) are wearing Vis Vires timepieces!","As i currently own Vis Vires, i know the exact procedure that i need to pursue to complete the task.

First of all, thank you for checking out our new project. We have created a timepiece featuring a Swiss movement, sapphire glass, 5ATM water resistant, crafted from 316L Surgical standard stainless steel and still keeping a minimalist, sleek and timeless design.We're here to take on all other watches under £200 and bring out one of the finest quality watches in the market for £130 and we need your help to fund our project. We are able to bring this watch to market at such a low price because we are able to cut out the 'Middle Man' and deliver our products straight from us, to you! There are many, many watches on the market from £150-£250 that are no where near the standard of this watch!More about Vis Vires -We self-funded our original timepieces last October, while they are taking off and growing the Vis Vires brand we have learned a lot about our market and what is needed. This is how we have come to the conclusion that an aesthetic 5ATM waterproof, sapphire glass and swiss parts watch is missing from the market and we want to capture it! We currently sell our timepieces worldwide from Chesterfield in the UK, We've exported to the USA, Canada, Australia, UAE and most european countries and gathered a following of 12.5k on instagram and we only launched October 2015! Coming from a modest background, we believe everybody should have the opportunity to own a high quality watch for an affordable price. Our watches have featured on the red carpet, celebrity profiles and more importantly, genuine people! It's great when people understand our brand name and get inspired from us, for those who don't know Vis Vires is the latin meaning for Power, Strength and Force, bringing us together as a family.. a Movement!

It is an exposé of the background actor industry, and the conquest of one fan to learn all he can about his favorite background actors. His travels will lead you around film sets, behind the scenes, and up close and personal with a lot of the crew and cast. What else does the funding of this project go toward, you might ask? Crew needs, including, but not limited to:EditorsDirectorsGripsElectricSoundCastCatering (this one is very important)Production Assistants (Someone has to get our coffee)Most importantly, film festival submission fees and associated costs.So many people and needs go into a well done project.

And unless he can find a way to stop it, Nick himself is fated to be the unwilling key that will release the terrors from their bondage and allow them to enslave, rape and torture mankind.At sixteen years old, in the small town of Sheridan Wyoming, Nick has nothing more on his mind that hanging out with his friends and chasing girls on a stormy Friday night in July.  Life becomes much more terrifying, however, when a close friend becomes the victim of a demonic possession during an innocent teenage party. As Nick helplessly witnesses more and more horrifying, supernatural events, he is must confront the possibility that God has finally lost patience with his creation, and left the world defenseless.Nick and beautiful, young Beth Tellie are thrown together as demonic forces attempt to cohere their cooperation in the enslavement of humanity.  As the small town falls apart, the couple seeks safety in the Catholic Church and end up with an unlikely ally in the new priest, Father Marco.  Together they search for a miracle that can save mankind.In the end, it will be up to Nick alone, and he will have to choose between allegiance to humanity and survival. THE DEAD WALL runs 95,000 words and brings the raw teenage honesty of THE BREAKFAST CLUB to the tangible horror of THE EXORCIST.THE DEAD WALL has already established a huge following in the western part of the country as well as overseas. We have sold over one-thousand units due to our social network campaigns. Please check out www.facebook.com/patrickcvanslyke as well as www.pcvanslyke.com. I think you will be with the dedicated fan base. THE FORSAKEN TRILOGY will make an excellent and easy cross-over to movie or TV format.I have written two sequels about Nick Davis and his fight for humanity.  Along with THE DEAD WALL, they are entitled THE FORSAKEN TRILOGY.  The second novel, BETRAYL AT THE GATE, is 95,000 words and the final novel, THE FINAL SACRAFICE, is 92,000 words.My publishing credits include numerous short stories, most recently, MR. GRIM, in the anthology FROM THEIR CRADLE TO YOUR GRAVE published by Cruentus Libri, THE FLIP TOP KIDS, in the June, 2013 issue of COVER OF DARKNESS magazine published by Sams Dot Publishing and finally, BIBLE CAMP in the anthology SPIRITUAL AWAKENINGS published by G.is.g Publications. I have also just finished my fourth novel, THE QUANTUM GATE.I grew up in Sheridan, Wyoming,  and my most vivid and cherished memories are of my high school years and the friends I loved.  My intent in writing FRACTURES IN THE DEAD WALL is to bring the quiet beauty of Sheridan into a reality where terror lies just below the surface of small western town life.","The issue with publishing today is that literary agents and publishers will not take a chance on new works unless they have a large social media following. This costs money. Once the following is large enough the publishers will take the project and run with it, sometimes using it to make movies.

https://www.kickstarter.com/projects/982137916/granturismo-magazine?ref=discovery_category_newest,982137916/granturismo-magazine,"Between blogs, news sites, discussion forums, and videos, motoring enthusiasts have an almost limitless supply of outlets from which to get their information. But once in a while, it's nice to jump off the fast track, unplug and relax a little with a great magazine. Not just any magazine, but a truly great magazine. And for those of us who love European cars and motorcycles the most, the choices are few. That's why we're creatingGranTurismo magazine.Two questions almostalways arise when presenting the GranTurismo concept: why European cars andmotorcycles, and why do a print magazine?WhyEuropean cars and motorcycles? Theeasy answer should be that the automotive space is huge, and choosing a smaller nichehelps define the scope of our work. But the truth is, everyone working on GranTurismo has a genuine passion for European vehicles. Some of the most storied and long-lasting brandswere born in Europe and remain among the most fascinating today.Just askany valet to list his favorites; chances are good they’ll be Italian, German orEnglish.From Mini to Mercedes, or Vespa to MV Agusta, there’s anundeniable common spirit that binds enthusiasts of all these vehicles.European cars and European motorcycles make for a natural pairing. Many of the great European carmakers were involved in motorcycles at some point in their history. Some, like BMW, still produce both; others, like Audi, are finding mutual interest between cars and bikes among their owners. Either way, we see it all as ""motoring.""Why botherwith a print magazine? After years working in the digital side of automotive media, I discovered there werejust as many limitations working with pixels as with print. Web publishingdemands lightning speed to create and produce work—often at the cost of quality—andthe ADD-like nature of readers bouncing from one site to another makes itdifficult to sustain and engage an audience.To produce the kind of deeper,more engrossing content that my fellow contributors and I wish to focus on requires a more immersive environment, and a high-quality printmagazine is still the ideal medium for this type of experience. We’vestudied the best of what’s already out there, looked for opportunities to makeimprovement, and started with a clean sheet to build the kind ofmagazine that’s worth picking up to read and hold onto.We’re not completeluddites, though. We know people love the convenience and functionality oftheir digital devices as well, and that’s why we’re offering GranTurismofor both iOS and Android tablets. Either way, you’ll be getting deeper, moreengaging content than any blog or website can deliver.The MagazineOur goal is to producea true 21st-century motoring magazine of the highest quality in terms of bothcontent and production. GranTurismo willfocus more on experiential stories than simply information; it will be asmuch about the journey as the machine that takes you there. Beyond the usual newvehicle stories, GranTurismo willfeature a mix of retrospectives of iconic models from the past, insider stories,travel chronicles, personality profiles and lifestyle insights that only anindependent publication could hope to capture. Regular departments will examinetechnical topics, the latest gear and accessories, European motorsports,second-hand and collector vehicle trends, and major events. Eachissue will close with a spectacular full-page image that will also be availableas a free hi-res download.We’ve taken thestandard magazine format and literally turned it on its side. By rotating thepages to a horizontal layout, we’re able to bring you the most stunningmachines in the world in their natural orientation—wider than tall. No morebeauty shots broken up by the seam. GranTurismo will be printed in a larger format (11x9 inches)than most other magazines, printed on high-quality stock (80# text weightinside, 100# cover weight outside), and perfect-bound for saving and passingaround. The digital version will be a fully responsive, interactive publicationavailable for iOS and Android devices, sharing its basic content with the printmagazine, but optimized for the digital experience.Reaching the fundinggoal of $24,873 will allow us to cover the cost to create, produce anddistribute the inaugural print edition of GranTurismo, including thedigital version. Subsequent issues will be funded by advertising as well assingle-copy and subscription sales of the magazine. First-year production will be bi-monthly, with the plan to move to monthly publication in the second year.The TeamBryanJoslin, Editor in Chief - Alifelong European car enthusiast and motorcyclist, Bryan has owned German, Swedish, French, English and Italian vehicles and hasworked with European cars and their owners since 1991. Prior to GranTurismo he was Managing Editor of Motivemag.com and Editor in Chief ofkilometermagazine.com. His articles havealso appeared in both EuroTuner and european car magazines. A Volvo and a Land Rover currently occupy his garages.Karl Funke,Managing Editor-Karl started his automotive career after college, writing  for several of Primedia's (now SourceInterlink)performance enthusiast magazines. He left his post last year as Managing Editor of europeancarmagazine, on which he worked exclusively for the previous eightyears. His current ride is a Jetta TDI.JeffBuchanan, Motorcycle Contributor-Jeff is a 30-plus-year veteran of the motorcycle industry, having served as amechanic, test rider and journalist over the years. He co-founded and worked as Editor in Chief of Robb Report Motorcycling. He currently works as afreelance motorcycle journalist and writes a column forSport Ridermagazine.NancyTurner-Atkinson, European Contributor- Nancy lives in England where she runs a collector car consultancy and managementservice. Her day job keeps her in close contact with owners andcollectors of classics and exotics. In her sparetime, she's a freelance writer, contributing to HuffingtonPost(UK) and TopGearLIve. She drives a Porsche and a Mercedes at the moment.John Dagys,Motorsport Contributor- John is one of the motorsport scene's up-and-comingyoung talents. From his home base in the Chicago suburbs, he travels the worldcovering sports car racing for Speed.com.andSpeedTV. In addition to writing, John is also a talented motorsportphotographer.Doug Carter, Creative Director - Doug is a Chicago-based graphic designer with a 20-year career in print and digital design. On the street he drives an M3, but he's also an experienced open-wheel racer. He is responsible for helping develop GranTurismo's unique visual style.Ian D.Merritt, Director of Photography-Ian is a Chicago-based photographer who shoots for a wide variety of clients (most notably Bentley Motors, Chrysler Group LLC, Sharpie Pens). He previously worked as staff photographer and photo editor at Cars.com, and in addition to shooting all things four-wheels, Ian also has a great eye for capturing the look and feel of a lifestyle.","The biggest risk for any new magazine is longevity. Getting the first issue out the door is one thing, but making it work for six, ten, twenty issues and beyond requires a business plan. While there are no guarantees, the GranTurismo team is comprised of professionals with years of not just writing and producing content, but also managing the day-to-day operations of a publishing business, both print and digital.The second big risk, directly related to the first, is sufficient audience growth to attract advertising support in the long term. The GranTurismo staff is well established among the communities of enthusiasts for whom we are creating the magazine. We'll put these connections to work to grow our audience from the ground up. Our marketing activities will put us at many of the same events as our target readers, where we'll have a further opportunity to connect.",https://www.kickstarter.com/projects/982137916/granturismo-magazine-the-best-of-european-motoring?ref=discovery_category_newest,982137916/granturismo-magazine-the-best-of-european-motoring,"In an age of blogs, fanzines, discussion forums, viral video and non-stop social media, there’s no shortage of sourcesto connectcar and motorcycle enthusiasts with their passion. While all those “small bites” of content can be fun, once in a while it’s nice to indulge in something a bit more substantial. We truly believe you still can't beat a great magazine – whether on paper or a digital screen – when it comes to losing yourself in your favorite subject. For those of us whose lives revolve around European cars and bikes, however, the options today are few.That's why we're creating GranTurismo magazine. And we need your support to make the first issue a reality.The MagazineWith GranTurismo we’re starting with a clean-sheet philosophy and building a thoroughly modern, magazine-based media brand specifically for the priorities of our readers. The magazine will live in two forms: a high-quality print version for readers who appreciate the tactile experience and archival value of paper, and a digital version for those who prefer the convenienceand enhanced features of a tabletmagazine. At the core of GranTurismo's content will be a unique blend of new and classic European vehicles (cars and motorcycles alike), complemented by coverage of all the great products, personalities and experiences that make living with a European vehicle more than just a transportation choice. The fusion of traditional “buff book” features – technology, motorsport, and vehicle stories – with a distinct lifestyle perspective will set GranTurismo apart from traditional motoring magazines.We’re also taking the conventional magazine format and literally turning it on its side. By rotating the layout to a landscape orientation, we’ll be able to present the world’s most fascinating machines in their natural setting – wider than tall. No more epic shots split at the gutter.GranTurismo will be printed in America bi-monthly in a large format (11x9 inches) on brilliant, high-quality stock (60# text weight inside, 80# cover weight outside), and perfect-bound to save and to pass around. The print version will also feature additional content that can be accessed by simply scanning images in the magazine with your phone or tablet, using our dedicated app to bring the printed page to life without ugly QR codesspoiling the experience.The digital version of GranTurismo will be a fully interactive publication for iOS and Android tablets. Digital content will originate from the print magazine, but will be optimized for the screen experience with unique layouts and pagination, in addition to enhanced features like photo galleries, animations, and embedded audio and video assets. Its release will coincide with the arrival of the print version, with no lag-time penalty for digital-only readers.European MotoringEuropean cars and motorcycles have a unique appeal. They’re often chosen not for rational reasons, but because they tug at an emotional part of our inner self. They make a statement about their owners, expressing their appreciation for performance, style, luxury or heritage. They’re cherished and pampered, considered part of the family. They’re raced and shown, driven to extremes and to exceptional places. They are more than just transportation, they’re an extension of the soul.For those of us creating GranTurismo, European cars and bikes are truly a way of life, an all-consuming passion that started with the purchase of one special vehicle and led to so many other great people, places and experiences along the way. We can think of no better term for this than “motoring.” And no other magazine celebrates European Motoring like GranTurismo will.CraftPublishingRecent years have been tough for traditional magazine publishers. Part of the problem involves an old business model thatrelies on attracting as big an audience as possible on which to base hefty advertisingrates, which is why you can get a subscription to most of them for less than abuck per issue delivered. They lose money selling you the experience to boostheadcount for advertisers. On top of that, they’re still figuring out how to selldigital ads without cutting into their print revenues.Our approach is a little different.First, GranTurismo is a niche publication; therefore we can’t expect to attract as largean audience as a general interest magazine. And that's OK. We’re producing a specialty productfor a specific audience, and we’re hoping our readers will value our workenough to spend a few bucks for it. Second, while we’ll still rely onadvertisers, we will work to ensure that only the most relevant products andservices make it into the publication. No male enhancement ads, no 8-pageinserts for rubber floor mats–you'll see those in the magazines at your barber shop anyway.Finally, we’re starting from a zero baseline interms of costs, without the bloated overhead of a traditional publication. We all come from backgrounds with lean budgets and short staffs, so we're prepared to do a lot with a little.We like to compare GranTurismo to a good craft brew. We’renot cranking out a watered-down product to appeal to large masses, but rathercrafting a specialized product for those with a more discerning palate. Continuing this analogy, as independent “brewers,” none of us expects to get rich from GranTurismo; we’resimply looking to make an honest living doing what we love, and perhaps enrich thelives of fellow enthusiasts in the process.Why We Need Your SupportYour support is crucial to getting the first issue of GranTurismo produced. Meeting this goal will allow us to create the content for (paying the writers, photographers and designer), produce (including printing costs and digital license fees) and distribute the first issue, as well as begin work on the second issue.From the time this campaign closes, we will need approximately three months to acquire content, lay out, produce and distribute this initial issue of the magazine, which is why we've set a target delivery date of December 2013. After the initial launch, we plan to produce GranTurismo on a bi-monthly basis.In the long term, we expect to fund the magazine through ongoing single-copy and subscription sales, as well as advertising, which could take at least two or three issues to begin acquiring. Without your contribution, the first issue won't be produced.","The biggest risk for any new magazine is long-term viability. Getting the first issue out the door is one thing, but making it work for six, ten, twenty issues and beyond requires a business plan. In addition to this Kickstarter campaign, which we are using primarily to build our audience, we also have an investor-funded capitalization plan to bring in the necessary funds to produce the first several issues, even if advertisers don’t show up.While there are no guarantees, the GranTurismo team is comprised of industry professionals with years of experience not only writing, shooting and producing quality original content, but also managing the day-to-day operations of a publishing business, both print and digital."

To go into the wild with minimal resources and see a fraction of what the old timers and pioneers had to perservere through,as well as see what positive reward can be reaped from this. Whether physical or mental. As well as keep journalistic log (updated via instagram every 2 weeks or so) and photos for the season.     This is also about learning what is really necessary to survive, and how self sustaining one can actually be in todays modern world with a bit of effort. And to document the successes and failures one may have in fairly new situations.Now I am no stranger to the outdoors, and extended stays outside camping are nothing new, but this project will bring on many unknown challenges that must be overcome. And I look forward to bringing that adventure to all of you. Without all the hard parts.   Now ideally the photo lineup will consist of many nature shots and wildlife pictures, of base camp, of meals prepared, fish caught if any, river otters seen if any, gold found and weights as well as time took to procure, pictures of sluice running, and any other rugged adventurer that may come along with me for the ride.All of this becoming a One of a kind superb 18 month calendar, and soft and hard cover journals for our donors(lvls. 4 & 5) as well as the ability for the general public to purchase photos, journals and or calendars from our adventures as well after the season is finished.","Risks and challenges are many when attempting a by hand solo gold mining expedition, and chances of injury are there, as well as insect bites, poison oak, rattlesnakes, landslides, ect... Now avoiding all of these risks are part of the story and coming out whole each year with something good gold to show is considered success.This I believe is something others may have an interest in vicariously but not the time or ability to do themselves.So I offer a glimpse into my world and I am happy to go on this rugged adventure promising a unique new way to look at nature for all of you to enjoy.*Note on all rewards, all digital images are for personal and in home use only. And no marketing rights to these photos are offered with any reward whatsoever.          -Thank you-"

The fact that we don't know the story of every soldier killed on the beaches of Normandy, don't know the story of every person with a screwdriver who built what landed on the moon, I think it's because we in the media are lazy, those who yell get the pub, those who are silent history will never know.I hope to tell the stories of the silent ones and I plan to do it through the simple pleasure of being inside the outside, sitting on a bank, sitting on a dock, or in a lawn chair out back by the pond Daddy built and fishing, but mainly listening....hey you want to go fishin'.db","Risks:  You decide when I put on Facebook who would like us to come and fish with them and tell their story, over 300 people applied in every state in continental America except Wyoming (got me as to why).  We also had applications from Australia, Canada, Italy, Japan, France and Spain but informed them that while I would love to fish with them as well, I can't drive to those places, which is the main deal.",https://www.kickstarter.com/projects/235823869/the-i-just-want-to-see-my-di-k-again-diet?ref=discovery_category_newest,235823869/the-i-just-want-to-see-my-di-k-again-diet,"I am a 66 year old sports columnist.I have been a reporter for almost 40 years.I have won several Emmy’s and writing and photography awards.46.2% of my meals last year were consumed at 72mph, or at 30,000 feet.Supposedly, according to my doctor, Beer is not a recognized food group, nor does eating jelly donuts satisfy his orders to “eat more fruit.”Apparently switching from “Scotch Neat,” to “Scotch & Water,” does not qualify in the medical community of “increased hydration.” And explain to me why if corn is a vegetable, why isn’t popcorn as well.I grew up in the 1950’s where my nutritional education was based on the simple premise of “cleaning your plate young man,” whereas offering to “mail it to the starving kids…” often meant “no Zoro and Rawhide on TV for you tonight.”I was 21 years old before I realized “Protein,” wasn’t a professional sports team.Starch was in my good shirts.Carbs were always 4-barreled and fuel injected.Tofu was what happened when you worn boots in the summer in Georgia.“I’m full,” was a serving size.Cholesterol was the money you put down on a house.If you are a regular arse guy like me, my age and girth, in a balls out profession, an innate inability to read labels or directions, you too have had all this health stuff sneak up on you.But then one Wednesday morning in a Best Western in Peoria while taking a shower before going out in subzero wind chills to cover a bowling tournament I happened to look down at my feet while lathering and saw to my shock that I no longer had a dick.To be journalistically correct and not faking anything, I actually could still pee through a penis, my own, but I no longer could actually see it, I had lost sight of “Beau.”I was fat, “dick-out-of-sight” fat (technically I couldn’t see either pinky toes either but that for some reason wasn’t as worrisome).But I’m way to old to suddenly learn about health and eating right and to be honest I attributed my long fat life partially to all of the chemical stuff inside hot dogs not knowing the difference in preserving my stuff and the stuff in hot dogs.But I do believe that there is a bunch to be said about still being able to see your dick.So, with that goal in mind I’m putting together what will be the most impulse bought diet book in the cashier aisle as a stocking stuffer for Christmas 2019, the I Just Want To See My Di*k Again Diet Book.A diet book for regular old arse guys who wouldn’t think of reading a diet book but who have also lost sight of old “Bo-Diddly,” down there.There will be no recipes, it will not be instructional, but will be filled with 101 quick and easy little tips that will be abled to be remembered while standing with a tray at the Wednesday Night All-You-Can-Eat-GRAND-Buffet.SIMPLE TIPS.For example like this one from a Kansas City Uber driver who told me, “I lost 65 pounds and went from suspenders back to belts in about a year.”“Wow, how’d you do that, any tips.”“Yep.”“What.”“Easy, “ he said as we pulled up to the airport.“What did you do,” I said as I handed him cash, “I could use a tip on losing weight.”And as I was closing the passenger door this was the quick and easy tip on how to lose weight that he told me.“Mister, just don’t eat anything bigger than your head.”Tip #1","No old fat guy will buy this book, every old fat guy's wife will though, as will the old fat guy's kids and grandkids.  No MD's will be harmed, or even bothered with talking to in this, no tips based on scientific facts will be used as for old fat guys anything with an asterisk is a buzz kill.  There is no truth to the rumor that the back cover will contain a coupon for the Thursday Early Bird Donut Buffet at Donut & Suds."

https://www.kickstarter.com/projects/diyengineering/steady-shot-bot-take-your-photography-to-the-next?ref=discovery_category_newest,diyengineering/steady-shot-bot-take-your-photography-to-the-next,"As a hobbyist, I recently found myself wanting to do more with my photography. Technology had reached a point where some very interesting specialized techniques like steadycam filming, time lapse and hyper lapse were within reach, tools were becoming more prevalent, as such, I pursued interests in the fields of Cinematography, HDR, Time lapse and Hyper lapse and their related tools.I quickly found that although there are a variety of options and manufacturers for sliders, steadycams, motion controllers, they were very specialized andexpensive for an average consumer. worse than that, few if any provide multi-purpose functionality.As I embarked into these fields, I was hit with the hefty cost associated to specialty equipment. An expensive ""slider"", ""motion control device"" (that was very limited in its movement), a ""steadycam gimbal"". The list goes on and on and the prices compiled fast.It occurred to me that there should be a tool for consumers that could provide multiple capabilities - advanced capabilities generally reserved for high-end studios - in a single platform. A useful multi-function piece of equipment that is easy to use that provides these high-end features, let's your creativity flow without major investment in multiple niche tools. A tool that can change with your interests and be what you need while encouraging your professional growth.Steady Shot Bot is designed for people into photography or film. Below are a few specific user types that it's particularly well suited for.Film Students:Get studio capability on a students budget. Steady Shot Bot is a great tool to allow you to shoot high quality cinematic shots with any standard digital camera. You'll love the steadycam Kit and the impact it has on the quality of your shots and resulting film quality will make you shine!Photographers: Ready to offer specialized techniques such as hyper lapse (""moving time lapse"") or a 3-axis stabilized video? With Steady Shot Bot you'll have one of the most capable tools. With tracking and remote modes of operation you can capture precise wedding, landscape video that comes alive. You'll also benefit from great automated shots with the intervalometer and 4-axis motion control to take your business to the next level. offering superior pan, tilt, roll shots and beautiful time lapse sequences. When you're ready, grab either the Motion or Pro Kit and you'll be up for any challenge.Marketing: Sell real-state fast by capturing beautiful, steady walk through that separates you from the market or Capture an enticing automotive walk-around that stands out from the competition with compelling visuals that drive interest. The Steadycam kit will give you everything you need to capture great marketing videos. The Motion Kit is best if you need to capture product review panning shots or video log intros that take your work to the next level.Casual Photographer:So you're a capable photographer and a pro at Diy projects, you want to build a motion control system that you can own and modify to your liking. If you're okay with assembling it yourself following clear and comprehensive instructions grabbing the Diy Kit is best for you. Save money on the price of the kit then hack it to your hearts content. It's all good, we're open hardware!Steady Shot Bot was designed to operate in multiple ways to provide broad capability.When you want to perform a Hyper lapse (a moving Time Lapse) it can be configured like the illustration below which is geared to be mounted on a slider or tripod to perform automated 4-axis movements over a period of time. With the built in intervalometer you can automatically control your camera shutter over IR or a wired connection. the device also performs bulb ramping while allows you to take photographs over a period when the light is changing without having to adjust your camera settings. it can also has some specialized movement and mirror lockup mode that help make it even more stable for sensitive shots.When you want smooth and steady video shots it can be configured like the illustration below which is geared to be carried around as a steadycam .Steady Shot Bot captures beautiful, steady shots using its 3-axis stabilized controller and light compact design. It's comfortable to hold and supports several usage scenarios including steadycam , Mono-pod, Hyper lapse with full Remote Control.The Stabilization supports a few modes of operation for gimbal-based control. The camera can follow the bot movement. As you carry the bot around the camera will track movements to smoothly in the bot's movement and always face it's designated front. The bot can also lock and track a position to keep the subject in frame while you navigate a complex path, for example while capturing a time/hyper lapse of a mountain face while hiking up a trail. For more dynamic needs, the bot can be remotely controlled by a director controlling the shot while another person carries the steadycam .A tracking shot can include smooth movements forward, backward, along the side of the subject, or on a curve..Steady Shot Bot captures beautiful, steady, tracking shots using its 3-axis stabilized controller and built in belt drive system. Up to eight presets can be defined that identify Start and End positions in 4-axis along with specific trigger inputs to automate the capture.Like the steadycam , Tracking Shots can follow your path of movement while moving along a linear track as well as performing a planned camera movement in while compensating for rail movement. a prime example would be performing a moving time lapse on a boat or suspended cable that is swaying while the stabilization compensates for the boat/cable movement automatically.Additionally, giving you real-time control of the field of view, the user can have complete control of the gimbal camera movement via a wireless remote control.The Steady Shot Bot features a remote control unit that is used to compliment the bot functionality by configuring preset positions remotely as well as full remote camera control when in steadycam / freestyle mode.The Steady Shot Bot.Designed as a multi purpose 3-axis stabilized consumer solution, Steady Shot Bot does all of the above. Seriously, it's the photo tool that you've been waiting for!Below are various configurations of the core Steady Shot Bot demonstrating its multi-purpose flexibility. Built upon an intelligent bot base, it is capable of dead-silent 3-axis stabilization, motorized Time lapse and Tracking Shots as well as dynamic freestyle steadycam and auto balancing mono pod capabilities.Steady Shot Bot is here to inspire your creativity,Steady Shot Bot will be available in 4 colors including Lime (as seen), Blue, Red and Black. Backers will be able to select their desired color once the funding campaign is complete.Demonstrated stabilization while mounted on a Mono pod.steadycam real estate walk-through with mirror demonstration of stabilization.Walking around the block with a mono pod and stabilized gimbal in follow mode provides a clean steady hyper lapse with very little effort.Jogging through the park back country looks clean when in steadycam mode.Shooting a time lapse sequence in the Valley of Fire state park.The Slider configuration used to shoot the above time lapse.Simple demonstration of a tracking movement on a slider.A lot of work has gone into making Steady Shot Bot the product it is. We have gone through multiple rounds of development to establish and prove outthe current design. Below is a small collection of parts that we're a result of that process.When possible, we employed the use of 3D Printers for rapid development and evolution of the design. For Diy users, all of the open source models are able to be printed on a standard FDM 3D printer.*As Steady Shot Bot is being finalized specifications are subject to change.Below is a high-level breakdown of the major activities remaining in bringing Steady Shot Bot through manufacturing.. The red line on the timeline represents our progress to date and the yellow task/flag represents this campaign.Remaining activities include Finalizing the production design, FCC certification (note: we have used all pre-certified components in our design to minimize this process), Development of Production Tooling, Manufacturing Assembly Procedures and Packaging. We have buffered 30% on all activities to account for any contingencieswhile ensuring the best chances ofmeeting all milestonesand look forward to getting started on this critical stretch of the journey we hope you're as excited as us!.This kit is for the individual that is comfortable with the assembly of hardware and electrical components. the Diy open hardware kit comes complete with all parts to build the main unit. Full detailed assembly instructions are provided online along with community support to help you through the process. Circuit boards are fully assembled but require full wiring and mechanical assembly to build the final assembly. (Advanced)This kit is for photographers that want to benefit from 4-axis motion control, stabilization and an intervalometer. take on the most challenging time-lapse and hyper-lapse on a slider, tripod or mono-pod. With an advanced intervalometer, take on holy-grail and astrophotography or try your hand at complex automated or remote controlled pan shots and take you skills to the next level.This kit is for cinematographers looking for an affordable multi-function steadycam setup that will get you going fast with everything you need to shoot and monitor quality steady video as your primary function. Remotely control the gimbal or leverage tracking mode to capture beautiful cinematic shots.This kit is for photographer that wants the full capability that Steady Shot Bot has to offer. Full steadycam Setup, Full Motion Control Setup, Hard Travel Case, a  Motion Sensor trigger and anadditional external battery. This is the full Steady Shot Bot Experience!Steady Shot Bot is a complex piece of hardware with lots of integrated parts, as such Tooling for injection molding accounts for 41% of funding expenses, all electronics and hardware account for another 32%. Specialized manufacturing assembly of the technical sub assemblies account for 15%, remaining amount is distributed across Development (finalization of production models /design), Software (Development of final software functionality) and Packaging (a quality package that will protect SteadyShot Bot during shipping) http://kickingitforward.org","We've done a considerable amount of research in the industry to plan for challenges other projects have faced coming to market. We benefit by standing on the learnings of many other teams and prepared for the challenges ahead.We have taken the time to test our design and challenge it in areas to expose it's vulnerabilities and we actively engage industry experts for feedback. We're confident that you'll enjoy using Steady Shot Bot as it is today, while we are finalizing production design, we are tempering our affinity to perfect with a pragmatic sensibility to get you a solid tool you'll love using. We have a clear scope and solid expectations for production quality.We have dedicated a great deal of time and expense to bring the Steady Shot Bot project online. I have worked to establish a gold standard for assembly and production of the Steady Shot Bot units. As we continue to work to define strict guidelines to ensure the highest quality of craftsmanship in every Steady Shot Bot we build. We have implemented buffers and margins to ensure that we can deliver Steady Shot Bot units according to our schedule. In many cases, we've used ""commercial, off the shelf"" products for many of Steady Shot Bot's electronic components and subsystems. This significantly reduces risk in design, development, production and operation. The gimbal stabilizer leverages the highly proven 32bit SimpleBGC gimbal controller to ensure we have solid functionality you can depend on. We have done a great deal of research and planning to carefully select our vendors and production facilities and have redundancy to ensure adequate resources to drive final production volume but plan to partner with a well established product development firm to overcome any unforeseen obstacles through the manufacturing process.All of the components used in Steady Shot Bot are pre-certified however we are required to obtain FCC certification on the final electrical design, there is a possibility that this may require some final reworks prior to production of the electronic components but we do not anticipate significant impact to the timeline by this activity as it is running parallel with our manufacturing process.Although, events can happen that are out of our control, such as postal strikes and natural disasters. We have identified multiple supply channels to enable us to adhere to our planned shipping date. International shipments could be affected by the local customs regulations and schedules. We pledge to provide good communication to all of our backers, surfacing project information as we have it. including milestone updates related to progress of timeline and any course corrections related to manufacturing or part procurement.Our backers will have 24/7 access to a dedicated section on our website where they can view videos, updates and strategies combined with our scheduled backer progress reports. This page section will be consistently updated until the last Kickstarter Steady Shot Bot is delivered.We plan to maintain a high standard of support but please beware that we do not have a dedicated support staff. As such, please be sure to refer to the FAQ and Kickstarter support center of our site. If your question isn’t answered by any of these venues, then by all means ask. We will be sure to provide an answer as soon as possible and incorporate it into these areas to share this information with all project backers.",https://www.kickstarter.com/projects/diyengineering/the-ultimate-retropie-handheld?ref=discovery_category_newest,diyengineering/the-ultimate-retropie-handheld,"It's time for an upgrade.

We wont sacrifice quality in any aspect of this device so order with confidence and expect the best when you receive your Limited Edition Retro ArtCade Handheld.The body of the device is made from an exotic hard wood resource. and as such, no two pieces are the same so you should expect some variation in color and pattern of the wood. Your device is one-of-a-kind, like a snowflake only made specifically for you, with care.To complete the project there are several activities that need to fall into place, below is a high-level timeline of the critical milestones through the fulfillment of the first batch of devices.for backing this project to make it a reality.","Every project has it's challenges, the Retro ArtCade is no different. some of the challenges I have identified early on are procurement of some of the more hard to find components. specifically the Raspberry PI Zero. To account for the fluctuation in price and availability I have buffered the price of several components to allow for worse case scenario which includes leveraging less optimal and costly suppliers should the demand or need arise. I have lined up multiple suppliers for each of the main components and will continue to seek more cost effective vendors through the campaign to ensure component availability.In addition to electronic components, Fine Hard woods are a rare commodity and as such suppliers and vendor inventories fluctuate. To account for the availability and fluctuation of the premium hard wood materials I have identified multiple potential hard wood suppliers as well as identified alternate manufacturing strategies should we face unexpected challenges in this area of the project.Producing a high quality product requires a close attention to detail and methodologies measuring machine and material tolerances, quality and consistency. It is a risk that I do not take lightly and am working hands on to build a validated process and supply chain which can meet the high standards of the Retro ArtCade. I expect this to be the most challenging aspect of the manufacturing process and plan to closely manage the internal scale rate to prevent any deviation in product quality as we grow capability.Communication is top priority. I will be transparent to the backers and community to ensure all noteworthy activities are shared, ensuring no surprises through the manufacturing and fulfillment process."

Our soap which looks like virus aims to give us power to kill the bacteria together by scrubbing our hands.The corona virus COVID-19 epidemic has significantly changed the public hygiene practices. Let's wash our hands more frequently and keep our hands clean with our Soap - SOAP HOPE. Let's overcome this hard battle with SOAP HOPE.-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------We believe the cold process method creates the best quality soap. Free your hands from artificial ingredients and drying detergents, cold-process method preserves the natural ingredients, which is skin-kind with a rich, creamy lather that perfectly clean your hands.Some plain soaps contain pesticides (MIT, CMIT, PCMX), fragrance allergens, additives and so on. Alcohols can cause dryness, irritation, breakouts and skin sensitization. According to U.S. FDA and U.S. CDC, antibacterial soap isn't the key to prevent spreading germs. What’s more, it may produce antibiotic resistant bacteria. The keys to prevent spreading germs are how you scrub your hands and the times you take.In order to maintain skin barrier health, we should keep our hands hydrated.-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------*In order to keep it all-natural, no fragrance additives are added in it.-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------As we have mentioned previously, SOAP HOPE looks like virus. There are many protruding corners around its appearance.All we want to say: No need to worry about those protruding corners.After a period of use, it will dissolve as a ball, instead of dropping its protruding corners.It also symbolizes that the bacteria will not enter into our body, just dissolve when we use SOAP HOPE frequently. Let's keep our hands clean by washing hand more.------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------Net weight: 3.5Oz /100g℮100g is enough for at least 1 month.pH value: 7-8*In order to keep it all-natural, no fragrance and additives are added.-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------As SOAP HOPE is a natural soap with the use of cold processing method, 1 month are needed for curing the soap.We will then deliver SOAP HOPE to the backers when it is fully dry.-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------Since late January, the world have been experiencing unprecedented changes and challenges presented by a global pandemic. Some of us are stressed, fear and anxiety, we make our hands super clean. In this period of time, we have washed hands more often with strong antibacterial products, but that made our hands dry and itchy. My friend sanitized her hands with alcohol based cleansers 3 times within 10 minutes!In the meantime, our siblings didn't clean their hands with soap.

We are outraged by the death of George Floyd as we have been by the deaths of exponentially too many black lives over hundreds of years that have been taken from us in the world as a result of systemic racism and the corrupt systems that support it. We wish We could help contributing a solution rather than more violence, in an effort to amplify this important issue.The voices of the black community have been silenced for too long and that silences has proven deadly time and time again. Right now is a critical time for the black community to be supported by all other communities so we can put a stop to something that is intrinsically wrong by the grace of god or whatever creator you do or do not believe in.It’s time for a change.We MUST show our love for the black community. Hence, We would like to deliver a key message on this issue via launching my product globally.“United we stand”.Doubtless, it symbolizes BlackLivesMatter. Stop hesitating to raise your fist still. We are all together. Give a hand to the needy.It is not only symbolizing to give a helpful hand to the black community, but also aiming to fight back and to combat this issue together. It is time to take an active step to convert this ridiculous situation. That’s why we use a fist to represent how affirmative and determination we are.We aims to sketch the impressive slogan “BLACK LIVES MATTER” in the middle of the sculpture to remind people the spirit of this sports.BLM Fist is a modern decoration, a symbolic sculpture perfectly for modern and contemporary interior design projects. The historic gesture can be placed at entryways, foyers, home offices, living rooms, dining rooms and bedrooms for both residential and commercial projects.Products not come from the minds of famous designers in the world.

With the 3D Sidekick you can do all this without leaving the original work surface, without remounting the part on another machine. This cuts setup time to mere minutes saving many hours of labor and shop time. And, you can do all this with inexpensive pellets instead of expensive filament, which saves money, saves on inventory and makes it easier to blend and color to your exact specs.Take your CNC machine and add The 3D Sidekick Direct Pellet Printhead to the side mount of the spindle, connect the control cable to the 4th axis input, plug it in to 110v, and you have just set up the printhead for 3D Printing.","Risks and challengesEight months of design changes, part sourcing, working with distributors on everything from electronics to plastic pellets.

The team, comprised solely of volunteers, was founded with the missions to help the people effected by the paranormal find answers and solutions, and to help move the field forward in general.Lately, I've realized that a lot of people who get into this field, or want to get into this field, because they see it on TV, don't actually know about all of the time, energy, commitment, hardships, training, and money that go into becoming a successful paranormal team.The Paranormal Project is the concept where I go to a specific part of the United States that needs a paranormal team, in season 1's case Dubuque, IA. I find 6 strangers, using social media, who are passionate about the paranormal and helping people, and I train, and turn, them into a successful paranormal investigation team. Every season is a new part of the United States, and a new set of strangers. You can watch the Pilot episode on Youtube:https://youtu.be/fdFGBVwQ9tgThe paranormal field, sadly, is not a cheap one. Production costs, equipment, travel expenses, and the price of getting into some of the haunted locations adds up fast. The paranormal has the most awesome fan base that I have ever seen, and I'd like to give each of them a very entertaining, but very informative show. One that doesn't use cheap scare tactics or suspenseful music. Just real video from each investigation. All the mistakes, frustrations, rewards, and victories that go along with being on a paranormal investigation team.If you want to see our team, our evidence, keep up to date with investigations, both in the Twin Cities and Dubuque area, you can see at: Our website: www.odysseyparanormalsociety.comFacebook: Odyssey Paranormal SocietyTwitter: @OdysseyDirector","If there's anything I've been become exceptionally good at, it's adjusting to unforeseen complications. Investigators could quit the team. I'll have to find new ones and begin their training. We could go awhile without getting an investigation, but we already have several locations, including private homes, who are just waiting for the team to make it to that level of training. Trying to get the team together in a timely fashion so we can either start an investigation, or complete one. I schedule everything so the most, if not all, of the investigators can attend. Money is also an issue when it comes to travel expenses, investigation costs, and most importantly the equipment for the new team to train on and then use when they're fully trained.

The SSC is no longer going to be hosting this event, so it's up to the paranormal community to come together once again to bring this cherished event back to Minnesota!Thru this campaign, we will be able to book the venue for the VIP dinner and the event in general.

I've always loved arcade games, they provided an excellent adrenaline rush and were excellent tests of reflexes and precision.Sega were known as the 'Kings of the arcade' my absolute favourite were their racing games, especially Daytona USA, Daytona USA 2, SCUD Race (Super GT), Indy 500 and Outrun. I've spent many a pound (£) trying to perfect Virtua City with the Expert car on Daytona USA 2 :)It's been my mission to try and re create that experience on Android and IOS. So I decided to create Raceway Heat, a classic arcade racing experience. If you have watched the video above of the pre alpha version you will be able to tell that its coming along fairly well :)This game will also re create the difficulty of the arcade games, so you will really need ""play"" to win, not like most modern games where all you need to do is out upgrade your opponents. I decided to go with the Stock Car type racing game because Daytona USA is the game I enjoyed the most. The Raceway Heat's main mission is to be a 'Pick up and play' game that you can have a quick blast with any time you feel like it (you know, just like the arcades :) )My main platforms are Android and IOS. Windows phone, PC and Mac should be possible but Android and IOS are the main formats I am aiming for at the moment.The code and is about 75% complete and the 3D graphics and sound are about 70% complete.On the code side, there is some physics code to work on, programming in the big crashes and balancing the AI.On the 3D graphics side we have five tracks completed (Oval, Raceway, Desert, Country side and Rome), and are halfway through the sixth one with more to be made.Graphics need to be added to the menu's and a more sound effects need to be added.The game will be very ""arcadey"" in its setup with a minimum of six tracks.Let's make this happen!","Making games is hard and time consuming. As with everything, there could be unforeseen hurdles and challenges.I have the main bulk of the programming done and are just tweaking things now.My main priority it getting this great game out on to the marketplace as soon as I can.The estimated launch date of February 2015 grows directly from this plan and resulting production timeline.",https://www.kickstarter.com/projects/micropi/micropi-play-the-ultimate-pocket-media-and-emulati?ref=discovery_category_newest,micropi/micropi-play-the-ultimate-pocket-media-and-emulati,"Our thanks to everybody that supported us, we will be back soon with a new kickstarter showcasing the final design case!",If everything goes as planned well will have the MicroPi : Play shipped out to our backers on or before our estimated times.

https://www.kickstarter.com/projects/kvh/shortfellas-feature-film?ref=discovery_category_newest,kvh/shortfellas-feature-film,"BACKGROUND:With Warwick Davis (Star Wars, Harry Potter, Willow, Life's Too Short) leading the cast, this comedy driven film has been developed by 24:25 Films. Producer Steve O'Brien and writer / director Richard Johnstone, already have a working relationship with Warwick who is also getting involved as an executive producer.This fast paced, comedy thriller about an ambitious slapstick diamond heist will match the high standards of any Hollywood film in cinemas today.That's a BIG ask but with the amazing cast and talented crew we have in place - along with the great locations you can see in our trailer - we hope you can appreciate we're capable of making this a truly memorable movie...one with sequel potential. (Please note: the trailer is the only test material produced so far, as the film is yet to be made).We also have some great rewards for backers ranging from access to the production diary, signed copies of scripts and posters as well as the chance to appear in the film alongside Warwick Davis!As a company we have a track record of delivering features and our writer / director Richard Johnstone already has his first feature out on DVD! The producer Steve O'Brien has also delivered nine features in the past fourteen years, so has the experience and the contacts to make this a reality.All the locations are in place, the stunts are planned and yes, we have a contingency plan for everyone and everything (but don't worry, we won't shoot without Warwick!).A full schedule has been drawn up. We have a budget (with a contingency figure included). The shooting script is ready to go; and we even have distributors lined up to view it!So with a strap line of ""Round up the Unusual Suspects!"" ShortFellas is very much a film that we have developed to encompass a main cast that is from the restricted height community with the intent of showing what they can do as actors.We are always on their side and want everyone to laugh with them and never at them.THE CAST:RICHARDJOHNSTONE - WRITER / DIRECTOR:Richard is the main writer/director within 24:25 Films. For nearly two decades he has worked with Steve on a number of television and short film projects including “Black and White”, ""The Guy"", “Hoax” and “Billy’s Present”. His films have been nominated for Royal Television Society Awards and screened at international festivals, including Cannes, Edinburgh, London, Clermont-Ferrand and Fantasporto (Portugal). Richard has also cut his teeth in the film industry by working on the sets of big budget films including “Purely Belter”.'ShortFellas' will be his second feature, following the success of his debut, 'Vampires' (formerly 'Bloodless'). The privately-financed horror enjoyed screenings at the Cannes, Berlin, Toronto and AFI Film Festivals before being acquired by Canadian Sales Company, Cinemavault. They successfully negotiated the distribution deal and 'Vampires' was released in the UK and Australia on the 12th October this year, with other territories to follow.Richard said, ""I'm hugely passionate about 'ShortFellas' and want to make it a big, fast-paced, humorous, enjoyable family movie!""WRITER / DIRECTOR AND PRODUCER OF SHORTFELLAS:Produced by Steve O'Brien and written and directed by Richard Johnstone, 24:25 Films have a new feature 'Vampires'(AKA Bloodless), which is out now and is Richard's feature directional debut. It is available on DVD in the UK and Australia.Here's the trailer for the 'Vampires' (AKA Bloodless):Having already worked with Warwick on the ShortFellas promo test trailer, the next collaboration was in 2014 when 24:25 Films shot Warwick's Reduced Height Theatre Company production of 'See How They Run' which also used an all short cast. Richard directed the video production, with Steve producing the six camera shoot at Manchester Opera House.The production utilised four of the ShortFellas cast: Warwick Davis, Francesca Mills, Jon Key and Pete Bonner. Here's a quick glimpse of the play:","As an experienced production company we’re more than aware of the challenges faced when making a feature film. We always allow plenty of pre-production time to plan the shoot and forsee any issues that may arise.In the case of ‘ShortFellas’ we have a number of ‘short’ actors who will be limited to the length of shooting days they can work and this is reflected in our schedule (we’ve allowed plenty of days for the shoot, as well as rest days for both the cast and crew).There are other issues we would face, including the weather (something no one can control) and this is also factored into our schedule (we have a number of contingency days to allow for this). The budget has been prepared by an experienced producer and will be monitored throughout the shoot to ensure we don’t ‘run out of money.’ Again, through our track-record (nine feature films produced or co-produced as well as numerous short films, adverts and music promos) we have proven we can complete a film on a modest budget (our last feature, ‘Vampires’ (AKA Bloodless), was completed on budget and received it’s UK DVD release on the 12th October this year with other territories to follow).",https://www.kickstarter.com/projects/kvh/kids-vs-halloween?ref=discovery_category_newest,kvh/kids-vs-halloween,"“A GANG of KIDS fight to save their town on Halloween when characters from horror trading cards are accidentally brought to life.”‘KIDS v HALLOWEEN’ is a comedy-horror inspired by classic 80’s movies including ‘The Goonies’, ‘Monster Squad’ and modern kids horror films such as ‘Goosbumps’.Target Audience: 6 – 80 year-olds, but predominately 6 – 15 year-olds.We aim to shoot the film over three weeks in and around Whitley Bay later this year using a professional cast and crew members, along with talented ‘newcomers’ who will receive their feature film debut.Trading CardsWe are very pleased to announce that the owners of the Top Trumps trading cards have given us permission to use their cards in the film. Here's a quick look are some of the characters.SynopsisNorthern England. Present day. Eleven-year-olds WILL, MATTY and GREG are filming a short horror film to enter into a competition. While shooting a scene in a cemetery, WILL leaves some of his ‘Horror Trading Cards’ by one of the graves. The MONSTER CHARACTERS depicted on the cards are brought to life and terrorize the local town – these include ‘THE MAD MAGICIAN’, ‘THE RISEN DEAD’ (ZOMBIES) and the ‘CIRCUS OF HORROR’ (CLOWNS).WILL is terrorised at home by another MONSTER CHARACTER, ‘THE EXECUTIONER’, but manages to escape, only to be chased by ‘THE RISEN DEAD’ to a local skate park where his brother, PAUL(14), along with RICHIE(14) and GAZ’(14), save WILL.GREG is attacked by ‘THE LITTLE KILLER’, while MATTY is chased by ‘THE FREAK’; both boys manage to escape to WILL’S house, where they meet up with WILL, PAUL, RICHIE and GAZ. WILL realises he’s to blame for the MONSTER CHARACTERS coming to life.WILL’S MUM and sister, TILLY(9), are kidnapped by ‘THE GHOUL’, trapping them in a tomb in the cemetery. THE MAD MAGICIAN leaves clues for WILL, PAUL and the other BOYS to follow to try and find WILL’S MUM and SISTER.Meanwhile, the other MONSTER CHARACTERS run riot in town, terrorising KIDS out ‘trick-or-treating’. This leads to a showdown between WILL, PAUL, MATTY, GREG and other KIDS as they battle the MONSTER CHARACTERS on HALLOWEEN, with only their courage and friendship to help save their souls!The CastWe plan to use all local cast within the North East area, particular those in and around Whitley Bay. Auditions have been taking place with professional actors from theatre schools and casting agencies and we have a number of the key roles filled, but are looking to secure further roles from the pledges available (please see below for details).This is a low-budget film and should be a good experience for actors looking for a start in the industry.We have recently cast two young local actors, Benedicte Western and Dylan Duffy. They have both been helping to promote the film with a photo shoot which will help the press release to start the crowdfunding campaign. We have also added four more talented actors to the cast; Katie Marshall, Poppy Oxberry, Harriet Townsley and Alfie Hunter from Fox Castings.LocationsThere are great locations in and around Whitley Bay. The coast line has several beaches and there are many other picturesque backgrounds including the coastal pathways, lighthouse, skate park and the newly renovated Spanish City as well as some creepy-looking locations to help add to the atmosphere of the film.The CrewWe have an award winning crew that have worked with us for many years, so everything from sound recording to special effects make-up is covered.Here's a trailer for our last film 'Vampires' which was released on DVD in the UK, but was also released in Australia and New Zealand under the title of 'Bloodlust':Previous filmsWriter / Director Richard Johnstone and Producer / Director of Photography Steve O'Brien have a track record of making children's stories and have completed several short films together including the following which have had festival screenings and won awards:Where the money goesAs a production company we pride ourselves on the strong talent and production values of our films, even those on a micro-budget. As well as a professional cast and crew, slick special effects make-up, editing and a strong soundtrack will help to produce a high-quality finished film, all the way to deliverables and a premiere screening at a local cinema. And, just like our previous film, ‘Vampires’, we aim to release the film on DVD/BluRay.","We’re passionate and committed to the project and have worked hard on the budget to ensure we can deliver a professional, finished film within the shooting timescale. We have the support from numerous locations and facilities in the Whitley Bay area and have produced a schedule that will take into account any weather issues we may encounter. We have a proven track record, having produced or co-produced 9 feature films over the last 15 years (many of which have been released on DVD and screened at International Festivals) and are confident we can overcome any unexpected challenges on the journey to complete the film."

That’s why we created Tempi. It’s your personal thermometer when you’re at home or on the go.Tempi is an accessory for your Bluetooth enabled smart device – like the iPhone, iPod and android devices. You simply pair Tempi with your phone using Bluetooth, and the temperature is displayed on Tempi’s free app. Tempi measures temperatures as low as -30ºC (-22ºF) and as high as85°C (185°F).Tempi answers a typical question: “I wonderwhat the temperature is where I’m sitting, walking, sleeping, skiing… etc?” Or“I wonder what the temperature is where my baby is sleeping or outside early inthe morning? Tempi was created because, we believe, nothing beats knowingwhat the temperature is in your immediate surroundings. So stop using old technology. Tempi is the smart way to get your personal temperature.You can wear it on the go,or use the base and place it anywhere you like to measure temperature. Use it inside, outside oranywhere in between. Tempi is there for you.We made Tempi to be just the right size. Not too small and not too big. We've looked at other wearable devices (such as Misfit Shine). The Misfit shine we thought was too small to handle so we made Tempi a bit larger even though we didn't need to.And here's how it compares to Misfit ShineHowmany times have you asked this question: “I wonder what the temperature iswhere I’m sitting, walking, sleeping, skiing… etc?” Well, wonder no more… Wecreated Tempi because, we believe, nothing beats knowing what the temperatureis right where you are.We’ve always been interested in temperature. About10 years ago we had a concept for a similar standalone device but did not acton it. And recently we backed a KickStarter project which measures localtemperature but that did not fulfill our obsessive temperature needs; you haveto plug this gadget into the phone’s audio jack and keep both exposed to theelements to get the temperature. While it’s a very nice product, we wantedsomething to continuously measure temperature at home and outside withoutlimitations. That’s when we decided to develop Tempi and we’re so glad we did.We’re already using it in several locations around the home and office and welove it!!Tempiconnects to your iPhone (and soon Android devices) through Bluetooth - BLE tobe specific. A free app connects Tempi to your phone and you will be able tomonitor the temperature, shown in Fahrenheit and Celsius, on your screen. Of courseyou can set desirable limits, and Tempi will notify you if the temperature goesabove or below them. Now, all you have to do is sit back relax… and monitor thetemperature.Tempi’s design is simple and elegant. It will be available in the following two colors:We went through several design iterations and Tempi is now ready for the production stage. From paper concepts to prototypes, we made excellent progress and are very happy with the outcome.   This is where Tempi is now. We have everything in place tomove into the production phase and that’s why we launched the KickStartercampaign. We are very close to making the product reality so please help us getit there!Tempi’s app is simple and easy to use – you shouldn’t expectany less. However, we want to add more features to the app and beef it up abit. Right now Tempi’s app displays temperature and provides basic functionssuch as notifications, C or F (or Both) and low battery alert.

This book will take you on a contemporaneous journey through time and space; blending romance, intrigue, adventure seamlessly with a jigger of suspense and sexual tension.On no fewer than 250 pages (with hand-drawn illustrations, tables, graphs and charts) I will regale you with stories of my days fighting alongside the resistance in the jungles of sub-Saharan Africa, to my many conquests at antique auctions and back ally bars in such far away places as Yuma, Hong Kong and East Berlin.    I will dazzle you with details of high-level dialogue in Pyongyang that by some (many) accounts averted the near certainty of global thermonuclear war.    And then there were the ladies.... Yes, I have truly done it all and now is the time for me to share the intimate details of my amazing life with you all.","Life is one gigantic game of risk.    My vital services to many means I need to adopt a nimble lifestyle - - the ability to drop everything at a moment's notice to travel to the other side of the globe, which could trigger an unanticipated delay.

We will journey from the empty beaches that dot the eastern coast to the rugged mountain ranges that form the western border with China.I will share details of my interactions with everyday people and officials from various levels of North Korean society (including a few rather interesting ""government types"").  It is truly amazing the conversations one can find one's self having when equipped with nothing but a camera and a healthy dose of intellectual curiosity in a country completely isolated from the rest of humanity.By combining a selection of over 50 of my favourite photographs together with short stories that aim to capture the essence of each image, the goal of this book is to share with the reader a small part of what it is like to spend time in the least visited, least understood country on earth.All images were captured by me during my ten years of travel to North Korea.  The stories are true, though I'm sure many of you will find much of what I have to share truly unbelievable.  That's my hope anyway!The book will be hard-cover with all original photos and commentary (perfectly suited for that empty spot on your coffee table or to complete your collection of books on the DPRK). I will attempt to paint an extremely balanced picture of a country that is challenged on multiple levels (both internally and externally) and weave in some of the more humorous conversations I've had - - including what I learned about a little-known joint venture they apparentlyseem to think they have with Volkswagen.....more on that in the book!Thanks for your support!  I look forward to sharing my adventures with you!","Risks associated with this project are limited to my own ability to get the book out.   Over the past 10 years I have taken thousands of photos documenting my travels to North Korea, so the challenge will simply be picking my absolute favourite to share with you all.

Many are using it to be innovative and create new things. One thing I noticed is the lack of large printers to make bigger objects. So I set out to create a bigger printer that could handle much larger designs. By expanding a printers build area there is an almost infinite number of possibilities to what you can design and build. This printer that I have designed will be the first printer to be able to create objects over 8 cubic inches that is under $1000! This revolutionary design will help spark a new generation of innovation by allowing for the creation of larger inventions.The goal is to create and mass produce large scale 3D printers in a sort-of self replicating fashion.I am working on completing the 16"" prototype which will be capable of printing enormous objects up to 16""x16""x32""(see below). I want to keep these printers affordable because I feel they need to be in the hands of creators and people who would use them to innovative. Unfortunately 3d printers of this size cost around $1200 so I want to do better. I want to make and produce these printers for under $800 and make it so that they are both easy to use and affordable. I have been working with 3d Printers for about 2 years now and it has consumed all of my time. I am constantly tweaking or coming up with a new way of doing something with 3D printing.. Below is a comparison of the build area of common 3D printers and their associated cost:There are only a few large 3D printers available currently so to provide a comparison was difficult however it appears that the Zion12 and Zion16 are both more cost effective than the large scale alternatives.Update: 12/22/13 - Creation of the Zion 16 3d Printer.As the project progresses I will be updating a blog and posting updates here to keep everyone informed. I believe that you should be updated on every step of the project. 3D printing is very exciting to me and I want to share that will all of my backers. So I will send you all updates and pictures/videos from time to time to show you the latest and greatest from this project.I have invested a lot of time and resources into this project and I have come to realize I cannot do it alone. I need your support in order to continue creating these massive printers so I can put them in the hands of those who need them most. I already have partnered up with a supplier for all of the components and I have built a working prototype. I even have a reseller to distribute these printers upon completion..The only thing missing is your support.Imagine the new generation of creativity that can become reality when the boundaries of what you can create becomes limitless.(Some are subject to change)Desk Footprint : Zion 16 takes up approximately 22""x22"" however the bed itself extends beyond this during prints as the Y axis moves. so estimate and extra 6-8 inches during printing. Filament Supported: PLA 3.0mm or 1.75 depending on your preference. (There are plans for a interchangeable bed which will allow support for a ABS heat bed for ABS Support)Motors: The Motors used are higher end Nema17 hybrid stepper motors.Extruder Hotend: Currently we are using a J-Head Hotend which has had great success at lower temperatures (189 degrees C ). Extruder Cooling Fan: Each extruder will have a 80mm fan for cooling attached to the X carriage.Electronics: Currently using the Printrboard Rev. D, I have plans however to begin working with a Ramps board that supports an LCD display for future upgrades to the Zion Printers.Power SupplyA standard Desktop ATX power supply is used to provide 12volts to the Printrboard and also for the cooling fan.Build Platform: 16x16 Clear Acrylic for Limited edition printers, 16x16 MDF boards for regular Zion16 and Zion12 printers. MDF is resistant to warping and is heat resistant.Threaded/ Smooth Rods: The Rods used are standard 5/16"" smooth and threaded rods. M8 rods can be used to replace the 5/16"" if needed.For questions or comments please email me at: xaberx@gmail.com and I will be happy to reply and update this section.2013 December2014January FebruaryMarch through MayThank you again for visiting my Kick Starter page. 3D printing is very exciting and to be part of building larger printers to inspire more creativity is very motivating to me. I appreciate all of my backers and I know together we can make this happen. Please check out all of the cool rewards I have planned for this revolutionary new 3D printer.",Obstacles I have already encountered was the overheating of the motors on the larger printer. The motors got so hot they melted the mounts( PLA Plastic has a lower melting point than ABS Plastic)  they were on and caused the print to fail. This was resolved by adding 80mm fans to cool the motors as it is printing. I havent encountered too many problems other than the one issue of the cooling of the Z24. I know that space will be an issue in the short term however I have made arrangements to relocate the production of the Zion 3D Printers to a larger facility where a large number of printers can be going at the same time.,https://www.kickstarter.com/projects/555589256/stingray-3d-printer-laser-cutter-16-massive-build?ref=discovery_category_newest,555589256/stingray-3d-printer-laser-cutter-16-massive-build,"Stingray CNC is excited to announce a revolutionary new 3 in 1 modular 3D printer.  Not only is this a fully functional professional-grade 3D printer available in a large size, it is also has optional laser cutter/engraver and paste extrusion module. At Stingray CNC we believe in offering affordable, easy to use, professional grade 3D printers to ensure that everyone can fulfill their creative ideas. The Stingray line of 3d printers is offered in 8³ and 16³ inch build areas, and are meticulously and are crafted to suit the needs of any user. Each printer comes standard with an all metal hot end for printing in plastic and a self-leveling system. In addition to robust plastic printing capabilities optional modules are available to enable the machine to laser cut and engrave using a 2.8W Diode Laser and a “Paste” style Extruder and Stainless Steel bed to enable food extrusion and other semi solid materials.  We pride ourselves in the professional quality of the Stingray 3D printer line.  All of the printer parts for the Stingrays are precisely laser cut, meaning we use very few 3D printed or injection mold parts for any of the Stingray printers.  This allows us to produce parts for our 3D printers quickly, accurately and most importantly it helps to keep costs down allowing us to offer 3D printers without added expenses and the time and cost of developing molds.  Every detail of the Stingray printers were carefully chosen, from our changeable bed, self-leveling system, and innovative attachment holder the Stingray is easy to own and love. Not only did we pay painstaking attention to the technical design of the Stingray line, there were several factors we wanted incorporated into the exterior design as well.  The Stingrays are designed and built using clear acrylic for its durability and ease to work with (we also think it looks great!) What really appealed to us with using clear acrylic, was designing a 3D printer that would be great not only in offices and workshops but in classrooms and for kids.  The clear acrylic build encourages learning, by allowing students to see the entirety of the printer including electronics, mechanicals, and the print process itself from all sides of the machine.Features:Usable Build Area: just over 16x16x16"" (400x400x400mm)Hotend: All Metal Hotend capable of printing with exotic filaments based on E3D v5 DesignBuild Platform: Glass or Stainless Steel (If using Paste Extruder)Construction: Clear Extruded AcrylicSupports Optional Laser Cutter/Engraver/Paste ExtruderBed Self Leveling SystemPrint Quality: 0.1 mm(100 micron) prints supported 0.2 (200 micron) recommended for everyday printing.Supported Materials: PLA, HIPS, PVA, Laybrick, Laywood, T-Glase, Semi Solids (Paste Extruder)Filament Sizes: 3mm or 1.75mm per customer requestPower Supply: ATXElectronics: Ramps 1.4 + Arduino Mega 2560Max Printing Temperature: 300cPackage IncludesPrint Anywhere: LCD controller and SD card for printing without a PC. Free 90 day warrantyAbout Stingray CNCLocated in Columbus, Ohio and founded by Ryan Manley. Ryan Manley has a passion for building and designing large 3D printers. From the moment he had his first 6x6 3D printer he wanted to print larger objects and ""Dream Bigger"" so he began designing 3D printers with larger build spaces.  With the assistance of Joe Toth, a member of the Columbus Idea Foundry, they Stingray CNC was able to design and locally fabricate all the parts for the Stingray 3D printers.  The Stingray 3D printer line was designed, developed, and fabricated at the Columbus Idea Foundry, a Makerspace located in the heart of the Franklinton neighborhood of Columbus. Read more about the Columbus Idea Foundry and the great people designing and building there by clicking here. For more about the exciting things happening to revitalize the Franklinton neighborhood of Columbus click here.Why we are coming to Kickstarter:To be able to bring 8” and 16” printers in an affordable manner, we need to purchase a larger laser cutter/engraver due to the current size bed size limitation of 12x24 cuts on our existing laser. A larger laser will allow us to cut the larger side panels in whole pieces and make far more efficient use of acrylic by allowing us to cut more parts per sheet reducing waste material and saving time. In addition to a laser, a successful Kickstarter campaign would also allow us to secure more favorable pricing on our acrylic sheets by being able to place a larger order.FAQs:What kind of materials can I use with the Laser Cutter/Engraver?Cutting: Wood (Balsa, Basswood), Acrylic, Foam Board, Paper, Plastic, Poster BoardEngraving: Wood, Acrylic, Fiber Glass, Carbon Fiber, Circuit BoardsWhat types of materials can I print in with the paste extruder?Clay, Nutella, Silicone, Joint Compound, Mashed Potatoes, more ideas to come.","Being partnered with the Columbus Idea Foundry allows us access to production tooling and fabrication resources that a company at our stage wouldn’t necessarily have available, along with a steady supply of Acrylic from our friends at Plaskolite we are confident in our ability to produce Kickstarter rewards on time. Shipping times on the Laser represent the biggest challenge to our time frames as fulfillment of an order is largely out of our hands and subject to fulfillment by a 3rd Party."

https://www.kickstarter.com/projects/itnx/useless-can-diy-kit-for-everyone?ref=discovery_category_newest,itnx/useless-can-diy-kit-for-everyone,"Here at InnoTechnix, we are proud to present our most recent creation: The Useless Can. We put years of experience in robotics to design and build the highest quality and certainly most useless machine in the world. We worked ridiculously hard to make it durable, easy to use and uncannily useless. We need your help to start production so it can be made available to the entire world.When we created The Useless Can, our objective was to make a fun product that everyone could enjoy. Although our machine is absolutely useless, there are countless variations you can try. We have already created several fully functional prototypes and are now ready to start production. We have all the equipment to make this product on a small scale but not to produce large quantities. The funds will be used to start production of The Useless Can on a mighty scale. We have already established a network of suppliers and manufacturers for the various components. By investing in our project, you will ensure our current prototype turns into a real product available to world at large. Our goal is to produce 500 units in the first batch. This will require many hours of work to put together the kits after verifying each component to the highest Quality Assurance standards. The design and development process is complete. As soon as we find the necessaryfunds, most of the work will be related to managing production and shippingproducts. Our goal is to ship all 500 first examples of The Useless Cans withintwo months. Here’s how it will work.The Useless Can does not require any soldering which makes itfun and safe for kids to assemble themselves.The inner workings of the can have gone through several iterations.With each prototype, we minimized the number of parts and refined the system toget to the point we are now. Many long hours of R&D have been invested inthis project and we believe we have the smallest detail covered to ensure thevery highest quality of uselessness. The Useless Can comes unassembled andhas 45 separate parts.The Useless Can requires 2AA batteries which are not included.Here is our list of rewards; pledgingon it will allow us to launchour product into the world and make it a reality.Toadd any of the below items to your pledge, simply pledge that additional amountabove the reward tier you're receiving. For example, if you've pledged at the$60 level and would like the Non-Slippery Sports Button as well, pledge $65 ($60+ $5).When the campaign is over, we'llcollect your add-on orders via an email survey.Here at InnoTechnix, we have yearsof experience in robotics. Over the years, we have designedand built several complex robots such as the MandleBot, a robotic arm meant for educational use in high schools,colleges and universities. This obviouslymore than qualifies us to make this product. With The Useless Can, we are nowtrying something new. We created a fun and accessible DIY product to entertainpeople. We hope that The Useless Can will get people of all ages interested in roboticsand electronics.","Our experience in robotics and manufacturing makes this project a lot easier to manage. We have already solved all the major challenges such as finding suppliers for components, producing specific parts in large quantities and shipping. At this point, all the challenges are behind us. We are ready to start large-scale production and deliver The Useless Can to you now.",https://www.kickstarter.com/projects/itnx/maximo-robot-arm-for-kids-and-even-big-kids?ref=discovery_category_newest,itnx/maximo-robot-arm-for-kids-and-even-big-kids,"This is a Robot Arm with5-axis range of motion allowing movements similar to assembly line robots. It was designed to offer the highest quality while remaining one of the most affordable robotic arms on the market.Three years ago, we created MandleBot, a 5-axis aluminum robotic arm currently being used in schools, robotics clubs, summer camps and even factories. We have enjoyed sharing our passion for robotics with a lot of people and it has inspired us to now do it on a larger scale.My team and I wanted to create a robotics experience that would be available to anyone interested in this hot and futuristic subject, whether just starting out or already quite experienced. Our goal has been to create a robot that meets our exacting quality standards while remaining affordable.Another goal was to create a robot that could be used in schools to motivate students to learn more about science, engineering and robotics. Such a robot needs to be highly functional, configurable and visually appealing.The kit includes: a black and clear acrylic body with a set of screws, nuts and standoffs, six high torque servomotors, a bearing base, Arduino with Servo Shield, wiring, USB cable and a power supply. You also get the standard gripper head module, a Robotic Studio license and the Assembly Manual.Everyone who orders a robot will receive a free Robotic Studio license. Robotic Studio functions with Microsoft Windows only. This software is the result of thousands of hours of development by my team and I. It enhances what you can achieve with the robot by executing complex automations that would otherwise be impossible to do manually. Robotic Studio allows you to move the robot with a game controller and execute different series of recorded steps. You can connect up to 10 robots at the same time in Robotic Studio to create amazing automations.There is a wide selection of add-ons you can choose from to add to your bundle. Several head modules are available such as the pen, the advanced gripper, and the palletizer head. They can be added to your Maximo individually if they are not included in the reward you choose.Assembling the 225 parts of the arm is an easy process. In fact, the only thing required to build the robot is a Phillips-head screwdriver. We provide a simple step-by-step guide to help you build it. Even a beginner can put Maximo together and get it to work in less than three hours.In order to bring more features, we’ve created several modular heads. These heads can be changed within seconds. They were designed to be easy to install and remove.The Standard gripper head module is the head included with every Maximo kit. It works like a pair of pliers, with the jaws opening and closing to grab all kinds of objects.The Advanced gripper head module is more sophisticated than the standard claw and allows Maximo to grab objects by applying balanced pressure to the object. Very useful for grabbing small and rounded objects.The Palletizer head module is a miniature reproduction of the ones used in factories and warehouses. A must-have to raise small wood pallets and other stuff.The Pen-holder head module allows you to put various objects on Maximo’s head. You can use Maximo to draw, paint and even play music!All parts of the robot are engineered to allow customization. Part sizes are meant to be compatible to allow different configurations. It’s simple to add more features to the arm by fixing additional components to its surfaces. For example, a webcam can easily be attached to Maximo to capture some cool footage from the perspective of the robot. As an Educational Tool, this robot is a great way to introduce children to robotics and help them discover technologies that are currently used on assembly lines.By using our robot, children will develop useful skills for the future since science and technology are now such key parts of everyday life.We have created a special pledge for teachers, you could ask your local charity organization (Optimist International, Lions Club, Knights of Columbus, etc.) to help them finance the purchase of the robots for your school.We have two curriculums created by an Educational Adviser for middle and high school students. Each curriculum includes 15 exercises to carry out using our robot. Contact us for more info about the curriculums.","We already have fully working prototypes as a result of the R&D we did prior to the Kickstarter campaign. The design is close to final, but we will improve some aspects of the arm before we start shipping. My team and I have already produced a robotic arm in the past and this is our second Kickstarter campaign. We have learned a lot from these experiences and we are confident that our project will be successful. We are already in contact with several suppliers and companies for the manufacture of Maximo. Delivering the robot will not be a problem either since we have already had experience when doing our previous Kickstarter campaign."

The Sentient storyline simultaneously navigates through the lives of two cast of characters; one through a web series and the other through the proposed TV Series. The Kickstarter is crucial in helping produce a Pilot to capture the energy and vitality of Sentient!The Plot: A complex virus called a Pandora Virus is introduced into our environment here on Earth.  The virus is discovered to be intelligent.    It’s a race against time for a group of research scientists and doctors who are trying to save mankind from this ever evolving and learning threat. This complex ""who done it,"" is a mashup between The Thing, Invasion of TheBody Snatchers and The Walking Dead.  It’s an amazing story we will continue telling through our web series; and we are more than hopeful it will see it's full vision of producing a Television Series as well. Your grassroots involvement through Kickstarter can help us realize that vision.Sentient - The Web Series These short 10 to 12 minute episodes follow the story of a group of researchers who discover the threat of the Pandora Virus while on a corporate retreat in the backwoods of Canada. This episodic web series will follow this group as they attempt to do what is necessary to survive and discover a way to hold back a pandemic that could usher in the end of life on planet Earth.Sentient - The Pilot - TV Series The first five episodes of the web series will be edited into a 46 minute pilot that we can pitch to a number of already interested parties. We will cut no corners in producing this gripping tale about the night before everything comes to the end. While our tale is dark, gritty, chilling and ominous - the future for Sentient is bright - put on your sunglasses and be a part of history that backs this pilot!WHY A KICKSTARTER (andHow is this Possible on such a Limited Budget?) The web series was born out of the fact that I reside in Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania and when most Hollywood films come here they bring their own cast and crew. I have been teaching an acting class for the last two years here in Pittsburgh and my actors have been complaining about how hard it is to become SAG (screen actors guild) so that they can get cast in Hollywood films that are produced here. As a result, I decided that I was going to produce a series under the SAG New Media Agreement to kill ""two birds with one stone:"" first get my actors union cards and two cast them in a Hollywood produced film. We started raising money, with actors in the class putting money in as well, and we are still a bit short. It was then my writing partner, Doug Jones, mentioned Kickstarter.  We need to raise at least another $12,500 to produce Sentient.  It may not seem like a lot but we can produce this series on our limited budget with some favors and the support from our community and production friends. So join our cause and together we can produce a great Pilot that garners the attention of a studio.What if we go over the Kickstarter Goal? We hope we go well past the goal and if we do - the overage will go into our production budget for post production and special effects. Any additional funds will be used to produce future episodes of Sentient-The Web Series.WHO IS MARK CROSS?I am a fierce competitor and film maker. I have believed all my life that if there is a will - there is a way. This is the determination that got me to the Olympics, commercial film work and this will be what sees Sentient to completion. I have never quit on anyone or anything; and I believe that anything is possible with the right people and the right direction. Sentient is a project that is full of the right people, an intriguing and unique storyline that will propel us in many new directions and I look forward to you seeing the fruit of that collaboration. [By the way, you can read my full bio by clicking the link at the top right of this page.]SOME GREAT REWARDSFor all of our backers we have cooked up great rewards with first glimpses at the project, opportunities to get some memorabilia and join the cast for the premiere. Take some time to read up about the rewards that frame this page.Note - backers will get access to see the web series before the public!

We have built in contingency plans taking into account the many obstacles we can encounter.  Once funded we will commit to keeping all of our backers up to date with Sentient.  We will give you a behind the scenes glimpse and keep you informed of any issues or potential delays.,https://www.kickstarter.com/projects/1972152720/sentient-the-web-series?ref=discovery_category_newest,1972152720/sentient-the-web-series,"Vision of Sentient:Born from the brilliance of Mark Cross and R. Douglas Jones, Sentient is a science fiction medical drama thriller. Conceptualized as a web series, each script is to be played out as 11-15 minute webisodes, available on Vimeo on Demand. More than that, though, the series allows opportunity for growth, synergy, and expansion meaning that it may soon become a full length television show (25 minutes), to feature length (48 minutes), to film (100 minutes).To ensure this eventual expansion, a Sentient ‘bible’ has been fabricated by the creators that set forth scenarios for the story line for the next several years. One such scenario includes a simultaneous exploration of two separate casts (one in television, one online) navigating the same fateful future.The genius that is Sentient discovers a science fiction framework unlike anything previously undertaken. Characterization, dialogue, and climaxes are both artistically and strategically approached, as value in the series has always been a key consideration. Such an approach allows for the creation of spinoffs from centralized characters.Sentient is an indestructible franchise.The Story:The story follows a group of people employed by BioGNX, a top examination facility that works with targeted nanotechnology. These BioGNX research doctors and scientists go on a sabbatical in the secluded backwoods of Canada after the company experiences significant internal turmoil.Not long after arrival, several of the doctors stumble upon an unconscious forest ranger in the woods. After bringing him back to the cabin to examine him, he begins to show unearthly signs of infection. The sentient symbiote virus evolves more quickly than they are able to understand. Struggling to apprehend the happenings, the intelligent doctors eventually uncover the truth and scurry to cover it up. Will they be able to contain the virus and save life on this Earth as we know it?","We shot the first two episodes of Sentient on an out-of-pocket budget. The crew and cast alike all took pay cuts (or did not get paid at all) because we all truly believe in this project. It turns out it was worth it because we STILL got an amazing result.Check out our teaser trailer: https://vimeo.com/106183784We truly believe that $55,000 is a budget that will help us achieve our goals in making Sentient a reality. The money funded will cover cast, crew, lodging, equipment, location and post production expenses that are necessary in making this project even more amazing and special than we could ever have imagined.A detailed budget for our project may be provided upon request."

Burtons the tailors made army uniforms. John Fowler’s factory made over 1,500 armoured fighting vehicles and tanks. At Avro works in Yeadon, over 4,000 aircraft were produced. The Barnbow Factory in East Leeds made guns for the battlefield. Blackburns in Roundhay, today a Tesco supermarket, produced Torpedo and Blackburn bombers. Vickers Armstrong in Leeds made tanks. Waddingtons, famous for making board games, printed maps on cloth and inserted them secretly into Monopoly games. These were sent to Prisoner Of War camps. Money was also included in the packs. If there was a dot after Mayfair a map of Germany was inside. These maps helped 35,000 troops to escape.By the end of WW2 over 100,000 Leeds men and 10,000 women had joined the army.Over 14,500 women were employed in aircraft and engineering work in Leeds. Many women also joined men on the Leeds Home Guard.In Leeds there were 14,000 domestic air raid shelters. These were mostly either Anderson Shelters or reinforced cellars. Anderson Shelters were free to anyone earning less than £250 per year. There were 132 public shelters including one under the Grand Theatre, Kardomah Café Briggate and North Street in the city centre, Newton Park Church in Chapeltown and 1110 Town Street in Armley. Blast walls protected the entrances to shops on the Headrow.AVIONICAOur first design using a material strap with luminous face points so can also be seen in the dark, using a full movement bezel, with

The presentations given with this platform will be vital and engaging, using the best in modern computer graphic technology and animation. 	The audience will be, at first, high school students and in turn, their parents. Presentations will have two parts: first, during the day, a solar presentation, either during school or after, then second, an evening presentation, with the parents and students together. These presentations will target sights that the night sky offers at that particular time of year. During the summer months we will do presentations at summer camps and other similar venues, and these will be evening presentations.Each attendee will be given a red-lens flashlight and a star wheel in order to follow along and learn the visible constellations. This first van, to be deployed in the early summer of 2015, will be a test-bed for what we hope will expand into dozens of platforms, serving every region in the U.S. and Canada.

Finally, after the completion of the hands on project, the van will return to repeat the earlier day and evening effort. Our research has indicated this to be an effective method to ensure retention of the message. Why is this project important?  - The mobile platform allows us to bring astronomy and engineering to those who might not have access - The combination of astronomy through the large telescope, and the engineering aspects of the van itself allow for inspiration of those interested in either discipline,..(or both!). - This project, with its broad goals of reaching students of ALL socioeconomic backgrounds, is an effort at leveling the playing field for all.

https://www.kickstarter.com/projects/adisoc007/novus-tenebris-volume-ii?ref=discovery_category_newest,adisoc007/novus-tenebris-volume-ii,"I have always been a huge fan of dramatic science fiction shows that were linked through themes such the ones seen on outstanding programming like Twilight Zone and Outer Limits. Those shows were not only entertained, but challenged us on an intellectual level. They didn't just scare me, they made me wonder about the world and our connection to it. Lately the BBC production Black Mirror has evoked the same feelings of wonder and amazement.  My Name is Alex Bright and I am a Film Student at the University of Central Florida, located in Orlando, FL and I am about to start production on the first of a three part trilogy called Novus Tenebris. Latin for The New Dark, it is a series of shorts films that explores the relationship between technology and humans. Technology is advancing a a breakneck pace, but at what cost? Can we, humans maintain being the master or are we on a path that will take us down a dark path? A path that would lead to our doom. Those are the question that I wish to pose.SYNOPSISAfter receiving a series of messages from the lead Scientist that become more and more frantic, a lab assistant returns to the Bio Lab that he works for, only to discover things are not what they seem and are completely out of control. This is where I need your help. My Goal is to raise $3000 dollars for part one of the trilogy, Novus Tenebris - Volume II The Call. Shooting a film, any film is expensive, and while the majority of the equipment will come from my University, I still need funds for Food, a rental truck to carry all of the equipment and our biggest expense, Location & Props. Because the story take place mainly in a Bio Lab, I have to either find one that would be willing to allow us to shoot or build one ourselves on our sound-stage. If we have to create our own, then we will need to buy all of our materials to build the flats needed to create the Bio Lab.We are looking to go into principal photography the end of October beginning of November. I will be updating both my facebook site as well as kickstarter site weekly with everything from location scouting, production meeting, design images to everything going on with the production.","The biggest challenge we will face once we are successfully funded will be finding our locations or building our sets. The reason that I feel that I am qualified is because I have worked on both feature films and television production, so I know what it take to complete a project. I am putting together an amazing crew. And we are very passionate about not only our work, but all films in general.",https://www.kickstarter.com/projects/adisoc007/the-returned?ref=discovery_category_newest,adisoc007/the-returned,"THE STORYThe Tutatori have five years to convince the people of Earth to join the Ylatchee Empire. After five years, the people of Earth will vote directly on membership, not through their governments (although part of the story will be getting the governments to agree with this idea) As part of the plan, they will offer advanced technologies to the people of Earth as a symbol of their benevolent intentions.The various technologies will each come with a price tag, which can be explored through various episodes. One of the key principles is that with each advancement making a step forward for the goals of the Tutatori, there’s another step backward. Along with the technologies there are about six hundred capital ships in the fleet, including carriers, battleships, cruisers, destroyers, frigates, supply ships, troop carriers, and construction/repair ships. There are also literally thousands of smaller scout ships, fighters, bombers, and transport shuttles. Technology isn’t meant to be a center-point of the show. Plot devices where technology provides a solution to the problem facing our characters will be used extremely sparingly. The Ylatchee EmpireThe Ylatchee Empire is ruled by an ‘Emperor’ who is elected to the position for life by the Archducal Council, who are in turn elected by the Ducal Council. The Ducal Council is elected by the population of a planet. Five races currently form the Ylatchee Empire. The number of Dukes a race is able to select is determined by its total population. Each Duke is assigned a region, or planet depending on the size of the race’s home planet and colonies. The Archduke is considered the ‘ruler’ of their race and represents that race on the Archducal Council. Each race has one Archduke. The ‘Emperor’ rules through the Archducal Council and sits as it’s leader. The Emperor can be of any race from the five member species.They conquer planets, preferably with societies that have just begun space flight and are fairly industrialized (which is why Earth is a target for them). They occupy several conquered planets for generations until that planet’s resources are nearly used up and then they move on to other likely targets. Their connection to the Ylatchee will be told later in the series as the connection is deeper that just being the enemy of the Empire.The GuardiansThey are led by the ‘Archduke’ Nathan Killmer, a man of middle years, trim, stern, yet easily approachable. Under his command they seek to convince the people and governments of Earth to join the Ylatchee Empire before they are attacked by the Dvora. The fleet is made up entirely of humans (about 150,000 of the initial 200,000 abductees are still alive and make up the crew of the various ships as well as vital support services like doctors, ambassadors, etc.). Alien species will only be seen in flashbacks or recordings for the first part of the series. There are about six hundred capital ships in the fleet, including carriers, battleships, cruisers, destroyers, frigates, supply ships, troop carriers, and construction/repair ships. There are also literally thousands of smaller scout ships, fighters, bombers, and transport shuttles. Earth 2028The first 28 years of the 21st Century have seen constantly shifting alliances, priorities, and conflicts. China has been exerting more and more influence in the region while the United States has fluctuated between direct confrontation and turning a blind eye. Frustrated with the declining United States influence, and the groundwork in the first decade of the new century by China, who has began to wield powerful influence in Africa and the Middle-East. A secret Mulitinational Corporate Consoritium made from the top business men and women start gaining a seat at the table of many countries including the United States. The Consoritium used their conciderable infuence and money to back elections of their prefered candidates, like the newly elected President of the United States of America.The first season continues to explore the Tutatori, who they are, what experiences have resulted in how they behave today, and their goals in their mission to save Earth. There is continued conflict at the global, national, and personal level as their technology begins to reach into the everyday societies, and new values, beliefs, and thoughts spread throughout the world. The members of the Tutatori also have to adjust to once again being home, on Earth and once again facing their families and friends they left behind. There is also the on-going search for the Dvora. Where are they and are they really headed to Earth? Ships from the Tutatori will be scouring space around Earth, trying to find them. Back on Earth, the Tutatori will also be seeking to recruit and train people in order to fully crew all their ships. Most of those joining them will be genuinely interested in defending Earth. Others will be spies for governments and private corporations.The Returned is a character driven Science Fiction drama which has the goal, creating a series with amazing characters driven stories that engage the audience with thought provoking questions while delivering an entertaining storytelling that fans will enjoy. The questions that will be asked are questions facing our societies as we speak. One of the key principles is that with each advancement, taking a step forward towards the goals of the Tutatori, there’s another step backward.OBJECTIVEThe demand is high for original scripted properties to fill the over 89 million hungry internet, iPhone, iPod, and iPad users. Independently produced webisodes are now capturing a significant share of sales on iTunes, Netflix, Hulu, & Amazon. These new markets are doing quite well in attracting followers and gaining respect in the industry so much that Netflix captured it's first Emmy nominations. Last year's U.S. box office revenues finished at nearly $11.5 billion and with over 290 million wireless phone lines, there is a significant opportunity to sell original content to these very same mobile movie goers. Add in 5 billion worldwide wireless subscribers and there is the ample opportunity for original independent content via theinternet and mobile phones. The funds raised through Kickstarter ($80,000) would be used to create a 10 min proof of concept as well as five 10 minute episodes.DISTRIBUTIONThe proof of Concept & and first 2 episode would be streamed on twitch, Mixer or other like service and the following episodes would be sold on iTunes to build an online following of viewers. Free trailers on YouTube & Vimeo and gorilla marketing to fan boys will help drive traffic.What's the GoalThe entire purpose of the campaign is to gain enough funding to shoot a proof of concept that will showcase the production team’s ability to produce a quality project. Having a proof of concept will add to our pitch package which already includes, a Pilot Script, Series Bible, Technical Bible, Concept art and a 10 page Teaser Comic. The production team has a three plans currently in progress this is part of the self producing, in which the production team self produces the series. A proof of concept goes a long way in showing off the production team capabilitiesWILL YOU HELP US MAKE THIS A REALITY?Help us launch this amazing project off the ground by contributing to the campain and spreading the word. The production team will be sharing update including videos, post of concept, casting notices along with behind the secnes videos and notices through out the campaign and production.","As stated towards the end of the slide there are many obstacles and challenges that every producers faces the biggest funding the project. This will be the toughest and most challenging aspect of the campaign. Kickstarter is an all or nothing endeavor if you do not reach your goal then your project doesn’t get made.  The next is selecting what story to tell with the budget that we have set. The 60 min of footage that we need to select must convey the heart of the series. We have over 90 pages from the pilot, but the characters and their stories will make or break the ability to not only fund the project but capture the audience."

I am a foodie and love to cook - all my friends and family always compliment me on my cooking so I want to share my recipes with the world! Users can also share their recipes in this foodie community.Heres how the app works: Complete a profile with your food allergies, likes and dislikes then simply take a picture of the ingredients you would like to use and the app will generate multiple recipes for you to choose from based on those ingredients - you can also add filters like: types of cuisine, special diets etc. Don't feel like cooking? Select 'EAT OUT' instead of 'GET COOKING' in the sign in page, select desired filters and have access to hundreds of restaurants/out away eateries nearby!",The challenge will be to find the right team to help me execute this idea properly.,https://www.kickstarter.com/projects/1522900770/whats2eat-an-app-helping-you-decide-what-to-eat?ref=discovery_category_newest,1522900770/whats2eat-an-app-helping-you-decide-what-to-eat,"I am looking to raise funds to use towards app development and for marketing. This project is very important to me because I am very passionate about food, cooking, books, helping others and of course - entrepreneurship. On the Whats2Eat platform, you can share recipes, discover new recipes, purchase cookbooks and even import cookbook recipes into the app!We all ask ourselves every day: ""What should I eat or cook today?"" and when we can't decide, we usually make unhealthy food choices because it's always quicker and easier but with Whats2Eat, you can make healthier choices and will no longer have to stress out about your next meal.The app helps you save money by generating recipe suggestions based on the ingredients you have on hand; Not only are you saving money but you are also helping reduce waste by not tossing out inedible food!You can also purchase cookbooks from your favourite chefs (digital and hard copies available for purchase) and import the recipes from the cookbook right into your app profile because let's face it, most of us who have cookbooks don’t really use them as often as we’d like to because maybe we forgot that we have them or maybe it’s just an inconvenience to have a book in our cooking space.. so as a result - they are usually found collecting dust in our kitchen corner somewhere.Also, don’t forget to share your own recipes or your go-to recipes by your favourite chefs/cookbooks/other users with your fsmiley and friends!",The biggest challenge would be to keep up with the demand of new content for users which is why we need to raise brand awareness to foster brand loyalty!

At first she thinks this had to do with her parents political dealings, but she realizes quickly that the man who abducted her is a Jesus freak serial killer who has abducted several women and killed them. His method is to keep them in the trunk and prevent them food and water, all the while playing scripture on a DVD.

The goal is to reteach society about things that may have been taken from them with the industrial revolution. Now, with computer technology ever-present we can combine INDIVIDUAL knowledge of how to grow their own food with automated and efficient technology. The goal is to teach how to grow food in any lifestyle or environment. It doesn't matter if you live in the city, country, water, desert, moon or Mars. It doesn't matter how close wal-mart/meats/greens is, anyone can grow their own food with ease and efficiency. The world is changing, and all the food industry will do is take advantage of you. It is human nature to find ways to hook people to your product, ethical or immoral, essential vitamins or synthetic chemicals. The latter are the ones who control you when you go to that fast food restaurant or get processed foods. Do you know what is in that sandwich? Or do you grow sick of the fact that you don't know where that food has been? Time to learn and keep the money you earn and grow your own food. The goal is to send kits that can help people grow their own food. All you need is water and power to power selves that are six foot high, 2 ft in length and 4 ft in width you could use a faucet to send water to an automated pump and perhaps set up solar panels to power your lighting system or you can just plug it in. The kombucha and mushrooms can produce C02 for the plants to use as well. It is an all in one efficient system that can save you $1,800 a year. Even then, you could save trips to the dumpster by using some waste like coffee grounds as a substrate for mushroom growth. Funds for this will be used for buying a farm and creating cheap living areas and indoor facilities that people can use to rent or stay for a while to learn this forgotten method of living. Agritourism to the farm will show how modern technology can pair with agriculture. Some of the crops produced will go-to healthy restaurants and eventually, a smart fast-food restaurant can be created as a horizontally-integrated company from the funds. The restaurant will have a separate crowdfund. It will improve on all the flaws of McDonald's, Wendys, Hardees, and More and will focus on healthy low-carb, gluten-free foods. There will not be, messed up orders either as it will be member-only through a PIN or Card that will load preset and personalized menu items.Summary of Current Plan.-------------------------------------------I am starting a farm that is based on the notion that you can combine the science of growing greens and mushrooms and making probiotic foods together with high tech, but cheap modern technology to aid one another. The farm will sell these products first and foremost since only 4 percent of the population works in agriculture. As the population increases, there will be a need for people to have access to food, therefore, there must be an efficient and sustainable way of doing so. My farm's second purpose is to have agritourism( Through AirBnB and more) so those can travel and learn how to do this themselves. People have lost their green thumb since the start of the industrial age. Agritourists will be able to see how you can pair modern computer science with horticulture. Because food is the most important thing after clean air, and more people know how to code than grow greens and mushrooms and ferment, why not combine the two disciplines? Once a person lands on Mars and space mining of precious metals begins, The post-industrial age will begin. People will need to learn how to sustain themselves with advanced DIY tech. Maybe CRISPR gene editing can also come into play as well. Maybe 3-D printers will be able to use Kombucha SCOBY's and Mushroom Mycelium(Chitin) and the surrounding resources to build almost everything the astronauts will need. That will be a question in years to come. It all starts here and now; not in the Heavens, but Earth.I am using these funds to start a farm in SC between Columbia and Spartanburg.",Challenges can be related to Natural Disasters

It's exploration of a relationship. Imagine a family. Tom and Emily, as they go though the hard times of their relationship. And when everything seems to get back on track once again, a World War 3 breaks out. That's where they are put to the test once again, but this time not just as a family, but as a human beings in general. Locked deep underground in a bunker while the planet is being destroyed. That's what is Heaven's Light.It is set in the basement/bunker as Emily and Tom escape hell on Earth and hide underground. And when it seems they are safe, new hazard arises from within. It all started with that strange dream I had one night. It started with the sky and clouds just before the sunset. Beautiful, gold. Then I saw an eagle flying past, and a feather separating from one of its wings and falling down towards the ground. It made its way through the gold rays of the sun and clouds – it seemed so peaceful. But suddenly storm started and the next second everything was covered with complete darkness. Feather kept falling down, lower and lower. And when the sky should have ended and the ground should have appeared was darkness. In every direction possible, it was endless. Dark. Empty. Scary. The next second my perspective shifted and it was clear to me that I was in open space. I don't know how, but somehow feather against all rules of physics and gravity ended up in open space. And it kept getting higher and higher and in a couple of seconds it disappeared completely from my view. Nothing was seen for a while, not even starts. Then suddenly a bright flash, then darkness again. At this point I saw Earth, it was different. And then, explosion like thousands of stars. That's it. Then I woke up and wrote it down. I started to explore it. The best part is that you never know when the next idea will come from. Two days after that I wrote a first draft. I'm an artist. And I love telling stories. The idea itself that one of my films can one day inspire someone makes me want to make hundreds more. For the past six years I traveled. I saw the world in a different light most people see it. With every film I make I ask myself thousands of questions, and most of them cannot be answered. I enjoy the simple things in life. I love sunsets and sunrises.While I'll be shooting Heaven's Light I'll be making a documentary at the same time about how I did it. In fact, I already started it. The documentary will be available to the public as soon as we finish principal photography.Unfortunately, my last film, Outsiders, wasn't successfully found here on Kickstarter earlier this year, but I still made it. I've attached it below. Please watch it and if you like what you see, help me make Heaven's Light. You can find out more about Outsiders by visiting Facebook Fan Page.","My goal is £4,600 or $7,000, and I'm sure that with your help I'll make this film.

It's an exploration of the human limits and capabilities, incredible journey that needs to be told. The year is 2029, humanity stands on a break of World War 3, political conflicts brings two powerful empires to the edge of negotiations. EMILY and TOM, a family in their late 30s, live in a modern society of controlled development and legal slavery. Living in a quiet town in the suburb, they struggle as authorities try to get their twelve years old daughter away from them. In a mean time conflict escalates in the far East bringing more heat to the fire.What follows the next is a nightmare. Thousands of nuclear missiles cover day sky so densely that day becomes a night of living hell. Emily, Tom and their neighbor MATILDA, an older woman in the late 60s, manage to hide in a small bunker underneath the ground. Nuclear winter comes. Follow days of the non-stop earthquake like explosions and white nights. As time goes by andas nobody comes after them, hope starts to die. Days become months,and what wasn't obvious before becomes obvious now. Emily gives birth to a child that will never see a sunlight. Matilda helps Emily to look after the newborn, and at the same time putting Tom further away from the child. Closed space, stress and limited food play its role. As Emily and Matilda spend more time together Emily becomes controlled and deeply influenced by her. Soon food ends, and Matilda gives Emily a key from the door. Now Emily has to decide, to stay and eventually die from starvation, or to leave and hope that the world as it used to be, is still out there.For the major time film is set in the bunker, where Emily and Tom escape living hell and manage to hide there with their neighbor, Matilda.

We grow mixed vegetables and hay on what is left of our families homestead. We run a farm market and CSA from our farm and it is our goal to eventually build a sustainable urban town center. This will be our second year hosting a pumpkin patch and third year with a Christmas tree lot. We need your help to add a community corn maze in the heart of Lakewood, CO and grow our own pumpkins for this year. We are asking for assistance from the community with cost of getting the corn growing. What we have:What we need:The corn maze will have a direct benefit for the surrounding community. It is a fun family activity in the fall, within 15 min of the entire Denver Metro Area. It is on a major bus route and one can easily ride the light rail (Call and ride will drop at the corner) or bike. The corn planted will be used as sweet corn or canned corn for sale at the market.It is good for the City of Lakewood as it creates agri-tourism and tax dollars for our community.This area of our hay pasture is being over run by invasive weeds and has lost some it productivity and soil fertility. After the corn maze is finished, we will mulch the stalks, turn them back into the soil and cover crop the area in rye grass and clover in the fall. This will all be turned in in the spring to help increase soil fertility. It will most likely be planted in Alfalfa (a nitrogen fixing legume and animal feed) for the 2016 growing season.For the first time in our family history we are opening our land to the community around us. We are actively engaging the people who have loved watching our farm and animals.Everitt Farms is what remains of our families 1280 acre homestead established in 1876. Over the last 6 generations our family lands have been whittled down to the 7.6 acres we have left. We have seen our city grow around us, and it is our mission to create a development on our land that respects the heritage of our family and agricultural roots of our city. Click here to view our business overview.More info on who we are and what were doing:","Our main challenge is preparing the ground for the corn maze. Given this has been a very wet spring it has been hard to get the ground dried out enough to work it. It will be challenging to finish the tractor work. We are working between storms and (if we have the seed drill) we can plant into the raw ground.The ground for the pumpkin patch is already prepared, we just need the seed.",https://www.kickstarter.com/projects/208425125/pasture-raised-pork?ref=discovery_category_newest,208425125/pasture-raised-pork,"Here's the deal:Everitt Farms has been up and running as a mixed vegetable farm in the heart of Lakewood CO for the past 2 seasons. We love farming! And have realized we would like the opportunity to expand our farm to a larger acreage, while keeping our Lakewood location up and running. We are doing a Kickstarter for the funding as this is an all or nothing deal. If we do not come up with ALL the money needed we cant purchase the ranch, buy the pigs and turkeys, and get the business up and running. Our reward options are very limited as you are not just ""helping"" us fund our ranch operation, you are actually pre-purchasing a meat share for the 2016 season!!We came up with this idea because we have been approached by multiple people who run CSA's in the Denver Metro area hoping we could provide meat to them and their customers. Since we also are in the city (although on a larger piece of land), we can only produce limited numbers of animals (8 large animal unit at any given time) and do not have access to good, reasonably priced processing facilities. This gave us the idea. We purchase land outside the city where we can raise larger quantities of meat, sell shares to existing CSA customers and everyone else who may want one, and bring the meat back to Denver about once a month. In our plan we understand share cost is high for the first season! BUT we will be reducing the price! Second Season you buy a share you get 25% off, Third season an additional 15% off the original price. That brings the full share into a more reasonable range at $1200.Land access is a real problem for young and first generation farmers. How do we purchase land, with or without a mortgage, without an established operation? We can't. No one can, that is a huge part of why less then 2% of the U.S. population reports themselves as farmers. The CSA model is an excellent way to fund farm operations. They have always been the source of early season start up cost, such as seed, compost, planting supplies, irrigation, land lease, etc. Lets take this a step further, lets use the CSA model to put young farmers on land! We want to recreate the family farm, and to do that we have to find new ways, alternative ways to purchase land. We know some of you are wondering, why would we want to leave Lakewood if were so dedicated to the food movement? This has been a hard decision for us but what it comes down to is our family. We have four girls and two boys ranging from age 14 to 2. The bottom line is there is not enough room for us here. We had hoped we would have a market with apartment above built this year but there have been many road blocks to building on the land (see updates to our first kickstarter). Like we said we love farming, we still believe that the food system has to change and we still want to be a part of that change. But we cant keep asking our family to sacrifice. We have looked into renting in Lakewood but as the housing market continues to become more competitive, we are less able to provide a home big enough for all of us, a reasonable distance from the farm, and continue farming. If we want to keep farming, we have to leave the city. Our kids need us and we need to be providing a home and a good family life for them.Holistic Land Management (HLM)- HLM was originally developed in the 1960's by Alan Savory, it describes a system in which we mimic nature through short term intensive grazing practices balanced with periods of regenerative growth. We will be implementing HLM techniques by pasturing the pigs in rotation with poultry, goats and crops (both for animal feed and food production). We hear that food today is less nutritionally dense the the foods of yesterday: ""Modern intensive agricultural methods have stripped increasing amounts of nutrients from the soil in which the food we eat grows. Sadly, each successive generation of fast-growing, pest-resistant carrot is truly less good for you than the one before"". 1One of the main causes for the loss of nutritional density in our food is the removal of animals from our agricultural cycles. Through HLM we return animals to the farm, allow them to live on the land in a mimicked natural cycle and over time to to rebuild the health, carbon, and water holding capacities of our soils. ""A1% increase in soil carbon, allows the soil to retain an additional 16.8 Liters of water per cubic yard"" 2""Holistic management describes a systems thinking approach to managing resources that builds biodiversity, improves production, generates financial strength, enhances sustainability, and improves the quality of life for those who use it"". 3Pasture Raised pork:Breed- Heritage Pigs Gloucestershire Old Spots We will be purchasing breeding stock of a heritage breed called Gloucestershire Old Spots. This breed of pig is a very good forager, make good mothers capable of raising piglets on pasture, are adaptable to a variety of feeds, very docile, good hanging weight, and high quality lean meat.http://www.livestockconservancy.org/index.php/heritage/internal/gosWe have already located and are in the process of securing a contract for the purchase of a beautiful 210 acre ranch. It has water, it has barns, it has hay pasture, and it has divided animal pasture and a house big enough for our family YEAH :). We are hoping to purchase the ranch outright because it takes a large monthly profit margin, right from the start, to make the payments. Buying the ranch in our first season enables us to build our operation, make a few mistakes, and not loose our business and home because of them. Second it allows us to substantially reduce share prices in future seasons.Turkeys: At this ranch turkeys are simple. There is a smaller pasture area already established for managing turkey pullets. They take very little feed if any when pastured. We will need to build a mobile perch setup for the birds on pasture (we have the materials needed). They like to be off the ground and it reduces susceptibility to predators. We will be purchasing mobile electric poultry netting to use for all of our animals. Its a bit overkill for the pigs in most cases but it allows us to make one purchase that is functional for all of our livestock needs. In Nebraska, we are allowed to process up to 20,000 birds per year ourselves. And since you are purchasing a share: you own the bird, we raise it, slaughter it and deliver it for you, then we are allowed to bring them back to Denver.Next the pigs: We will need to supply 250 pigs to the Denver Metro meat market in order to make our first season possible. We will be purchasing piglets for the first season. They are harvested at 4-5 months, at an average weight of 250 lbs (150 lbs finished) each. The share cost includes processing and curing into the delectable pork cuts we all know and love!We will be purchasing sows or gilts (unbred females) and boars to create breeding stock. This will ensure the operation continues after the first year! We need 25 sows and 3 boars to produce 10-15 piglets every 3 weeks year round. Breeding pigs can be difficult as they have have a 30-40% piglet mortality rate. So we are giving ourselves a safety net by budgeting for both the purchase of piglets and breeding stock.Distribution: We plan to bring the meat shares back to the Denver Area, and distribute the portions that were purchased by other CSA customers to the pickup locations for those CSAs. We will take the remainder of the shares back to our location in Lakewood and distribute them there. We will purchase a refrigerated trailer to bring the shares back to the Denver Metro Area.The best part of the ranch is the additional income opportunities. There is 110 acres of hay pasture. We have been cutting 20 acres of hay, ourselves, at Everitt Farms in Lakewood for the past 5 years. We are competent with all the equipment and fully understand the mechanics and work involved. For us, this is a built in income stream. We expect to get about 3500 to 4000 bales. We will be cutting small square bales and delivering them to the Denver market, mainly feed stores, as we can get premium pricing.Last but most certainly not least is the cost of help! We plan to higher a experienced pasture raised pork farm hand.Sources:1: http://www.scientificamerican.com/article/soil-depletion-and-nutrition-loss/2: Cows save the Planet3:http://lunafieldfarm.com/farming-principles/holistic-management/","We dont know all the risks in raising pasture pork and turkeys. But I think, our greatest strengths are our ability to overcome adversity, learn from others and learn from our mistakes. Over the last few years we have learned much about ourselves. We know that we can manage difficult situations, that we hold true to our word, we can work long days, we enjoy working together, we like working outside even in extreme weather. We both love to learn new skills, try new things and adapt the skills we have to new things. Most people who know us, feel we are (sometimes annoyingly) good at everything we try :)These are the specific challenges we know for sure we will have:Pigs have a high birth mortality rate averaging a 35% piglet loss from every litter.  We have planned for this in a few ways. First we are planning for cost of both purchasing piglets and buying breeding boars and sows. That gives us a cushion to be able to purchase additional piglets while we are learning to successfully breed pigs. Second we are NOT raising our animals in confinement! The largest reason for high mortality is the mother laying on her young in confined spaces. By providing ample room and additional heat sources for the young, there should be a much lower mortality rate. Third we are purchasing more sows then ""needed"" to provide one litter every 3 weeks year round. This ensures there will be enough piglets to provide for shares and potentially enough extra to sell and create an additional revenue stream. And last, Kamise has had training in home birth, 3 home births of her own, and been thru the birthing process with our goats, making her a fairly competent birth assistant for the pregnant sows. Our next largest hurdle is our lack of large livestock experience.  While we have raised; chickens, goats, turkeys, and horses; we have not raised pigs. We plan to call on our friends and family as resources, physical help and guidance.  We have a friend that worked for many years on a pasture raised pork farm out east. He, so far, has proved to be an invaluable source of information and assistance in our planning process. Next we have family just 2 hours north of McCook, running a 5000 acre cattle ranch, who we can turn to with questions, concerns, possibly physical help on occasion, and basic support."

https://www.kickstarter.com/projects/2008996354/slashed?ref=discovery_category_newest,2008996354/slashed,"My goal for the film is to be a film that the slasher film fan can have a fun time with.A film that the slasher film fan can go into and have a great time with it and get the humor and references thrown at them. I want this film to poke fun at 80s slasher films, the cliches, typical slasher film characters. I really want the film to play around with what slasher films are known as. The story itself is one of a typical slasher film, my film knows that and has fun with that and is self aware of that. The movie will poke fun at the bad slasher films of are time like Friday the 13: Jason Takes Manhattan or Texas Chainsaw Massacre The Next Generation, films like that that really make me questions their existence in general. My film takes more of a comedic approach to this and isn't a straight horror film that plays with the genre like ""scream,"" or ""Cabin in the Woods,"" but a horror/comedy that plays with the slasher genre. Not in a awful ""Scary Movie"" route with awful popular references, but a film that homages both the good and bad aspects of the slasher genre. I want it to be a personal love letter of mine to my favorite slasher films, the good and bad. I'm very passionate about this idea and what to get funding to see the film make it to screen. I've written the script, this is the last and hardest piece, putting what's written and start making it reality.","There are many risks and challenges when making a low budge indie film. The biggest challenges is bringing together what's on the page to life. The pre-production after funding like casting and aspects of those things simply because I'll be a first time director, with no experience. The biggest challenge will be proving to others that I can make this, I'm the prefect fit as a director for this project, showing people my true passion for the film and hopefully they feel comfortable with me, also being taken seriously because I am young, only 21 years old, will be 22 in December and most filmmakers make their first feature in their later 20s to early 30s, i want to prove that younger people can be taken seriously as filmmakers. I want the production of the film to be as fun as possible, allowing and hoping for a ton of improv in the film. I welcome collaboration, whatever will make the best film under the budget i want to make this film with. Another big challenge will be the budget, the worry and fear of going over the budget. Everyone will be making risks for this film, any one who backs it will be taking a risk, anyone who spend time developing and working on the film with me will be taken a risk. It's a risk that needs to be taken. There is no other way to prove yourself has a filmmaker without taking risks. If you don't take risks you'll just be doing the same shit you hate over and over again. I plan to work hard to overcome any challenges I'm faced with, I just want to have fun and create an experience I'll remember and look back on for the rest of my life and I want everyone who puts their time into the film to feel the same way.",https://www.kickstarter.com/projects/2008996354/death-match?ref=discovery_category_newest,2008996354/death-match,"Think of the film has a frankenstein combination of The Raid films meets Hardcore Henry meets Hotline Miami meets The Guest. Sounds pretty fucking awesome! The movie will be shot entirely in first person using go pro cameras and utilizing the adventure rig mask most notably used in Hardcore Henry. The film is about Ajay and how Interpol brings him back in after his brother is killed whom's cover was blown by a rogue agent. Ajay along with other Interpol agents must find out who the rogue agent, Tomi is working for. The stakes get higher and higher as the movie progresses. What Interpol thinks to be a simple crime organization turns into a bio terrorist cell whom have a plan to destroy humanity. I want to create a experience the audience won't forget. I want you to walk out of this film feeling energized. I want the film to have brutal violence as found in Kingsman most notable the church scene, could you imagine that scene through the eyes of Harry Hart the entire time, that would be fucking madness and there will be two sequences in the film like it! I want to utilize synth pop as utilized in the game Hotline Miami and in the film The Guest. I have a pretty awesome vision for the film! I just need the funds to go from cool idea to coming soon to a theater near you.My project video is a clip o matic using clips from Hardcore Henry, Biting Elbow's Bad Motherfucker and awesome adventure mask cam footage I found on youtube to convey my vision of how the film is to be marketed. I need your help! if you would love to see another first person action film with GREAT spectacle! Pledge! Pledge! Pledge! It would MEAN the WORLD to me! :)P.S. follow this link, https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLMOjPb7D6ADx2JF6cBjSb78Va1nIJdUcXfor the sample soundtrack I have in mind for the film. To get an idea of the type of music I want the film to have in it!","This is a very risky project and will hit a few bumps on the way. All film productions do, big and small. It will be my first feature film and with that I'll be learning a lot while making the film but I plan on pushing through and getting passed any problems because I know it will deliver on the awesome spectacle. I'm an audience filmmaker, what I mean by that is I want to deliver a product for the audience, not the critics. if you hate it but at the very least are entertained I did my job. I want to create escapism, transport the audience into the screen, a extremely immersive theater experience. The movie will be compared to Hardcore Henry, there's no denying that fact, they are very similar, both will be shot in first person but my film is very different, my film is going more for the asian matrial arts cinema style as seen in The Raid, rather than Hardcore Henry's sci-fi style, but also having that 80s siphonic soundtrack as seen in films like The Guest and Drive or the game Hotline Miami, sounds pretty different from Hardcore henry to me. The shoot will be intensive and will require putting together the perfect stunt team to visualize it, I plan on bringing in The Raid guys for choreographing the martial arts sequences  and also bring in the Hardcore Henry cinematography and parkour team to shoot the film and do parkour stunts for the film. It will be a pretty challenging film to pull off but I LOVE a good challenge and that's WHY I want to DO IT!"

Fire Kill LinePhase 2. Business & Home Protection SystemPhase 3. Helicopter Water Delivery SystemPlease see the whole video for information about total projects build.Phase... 1Building a 1 mile test line as it will be in a real build along highways and roads surrounding cities and towns.Phase... 2Protecting homes and business, we already have sprinkler systems inside of business this part of the project is the same thing but on the roof tops of homes and businesses with real life trees acting like sprinklers also, we have seen that people using just a water hose saved their property, Cal-Fire even said that, each system will have its own water pump that will be hooked up to a water tank either above ground or below ground, size depending on house size all water holding tanks will be made out of recycled plastic, system will be controlled by a on/off timer giving enough water over building to prevent fire from destroying business or homes, home water hose will keep water going into tank as system works.Water sprinkler system looking like real tree's surrounding a home or business, the tree's will coat the ground with a light water mist not a down pour, giving just enough water to put fire out and keeping ground moist.The water hold tanks will be made from recycled plastic, size depending on home or business.The main pumping station will be the heart of this build, I have designed a high pressure jet pumping station that will deliver enough pressure to throw water a far distance when pole valves are opened 100%, you will see system in action on our website!Water tank will be made from recycled plastic, the size of tank will be like a Olympic size swimming pool 164 feet in length, 82 feet in width, and 20 feet in depth, ocean water can be purified for the project.Phase... 3This part of the build will be outside of the normal box!Many may say this won't work? I ask this, what if Tesla, The Wright Brothers, Henry Ford or Bill Gates listen to all who said their thoughts wouldn't work, would we have Power, Flight, Automobiles or the Internet? Something to think about.Prototype 1 and 2 will be built within this project's build keeping safety first and foremost! Imagine if this works no more time-consuming water drops or missed drops, this design will give a controlled direct water spray into fires!System #1 Prototype with a direct water supply system hook-up, Fire hose will be quick disconnect for easy break away! High power water pump in helicopter pulling water from Fire Kill Line System, continuous water supply into fire, special hoses will be made for this part of project.System #2 2 Prototype with a 3,000-gallon water holding tank under helicopter giving a controlled water spray into fires, easy drop and hook water tanks with filled water tanks placed close to fires saving time, water tanks can be stage throughout California for when a fire breaks out!Shirt and cap for donations, Show the world you supported our project.","A lot of thought and planning has gone into this test build we are ready when we get the funding needed, the biggest challenge I may have is building this test site before next year fire season and implementing project into the Government resources before the next fire storm hits California, we will work 24/7 to complete this project before the next fire season in California."
