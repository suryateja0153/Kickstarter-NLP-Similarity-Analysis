The finding Christmas Magic project will be used to launch a paid website and continue the travel blog portion over the next year. We plan to create a blog where you will be able to find and submit stories, ideas, crafts and videos that capture the essence of Christmas. This will also serve as a travel blog where you will vote on what destination to send us to! Of course this will be dependent on just how much money we raise but I can tell you Iceland is a photographers dream in the winter and I have never been. That being said, we live in the beautiful state of Oregon which also has some incredible places that shine with Christmas Spirit this time of year. The small resort town of Sun River is a short drive from us and will serve as our first destination review. I would love the opportunity to capture the Christmas Spirit near and far. We live in another small town in Oregon where people still greet one another on the street and we all know our neighbors. Just for fun we will Photoshop some of you into our travel pics! (but only if we have prior permission and a request to do so!). We want this site to be interactive. It is our hope that we will create more than just another travel blog, but a place where lifelong friendships can be born and nurtured (for those of us who will always be kids at heart and for those who will never forget the true meaning of Christmas). Come join our family and celebrate the magic of Christmas. Please check our website often as it is a work in progress in its beginning stages!I will also be attaching a rough budget so you can see how the money will be spent. Basically we will break it down into travel/transportation to photo shoot locations and destinations, any additional camera equipment that may be needed (we have most of what we need), craft supplies, cooking ingredients for the recipes we will be demonstrating and other supplies needed for demonstration videos, printing costs for prints, etc. I think it is important for those who are considering making pledges to have a clear idea of where that money is going and what an important part it will play in this project. If there are left over funds we would like to pay it forward with small acts of kindness as well as a trip to New York to capture New Years Eve in Time Square! Like the others, these photos will be shared on our website and discussed in our blog. We cannot do this without your support and appreciate everyone who backs us in any way that they can. Purchasing prints from our website is another great way to lend your support. These will be available for purchase beginning the first week of December. It has been our dream to go to New York City for New Years Eve. If our budget is exceeded, after paying it forward, we will take you along by photographing / video-graphing and blogging about this trip! We hope to see you in Times Square on January 1, 2015! Lets make this the best Christmas ever and bring back that Christmas magic and then celebrate the New Year. If we find there is enough support we will offer our story to the local news and who knows where it will go from there! Lets make it viral! Perhaps together we can make spreading Christmas Magic a world wide project. So, lets get started in our search of Christmas Magic...","The biggest risk of completing our project is failure to secure enough funding. I am starting with a budget that is lower than I would like to secure to make this project all that it can be, but have insured that it is enough to keep us going through January 1, 2015. A lack of funding will have disadvantages and will limit the travel portion of our project and related site visits. However, if we meet our initial goal it will be an amazing experience that is sure to spread Christmas Magic and urge others to do the same with small acts of kindness and little challenges that our blog will share. I have freed up my calendar and I am committed to give this project my full attention.",https://www.kickstarter.com/projects/596736411/handcrafted-christmas-ornaments-making-christmas-m?ref=discovery_category_newest,596736411/handcrafted-christmas-ornaments-making-christmas-m,"This project was born out of a love for the way the holidays bring out the best in the human spirit. How it reminds us of our own humanity and the importance of family and friends. It is our goal to bring back some of that old fashion Christmas Magic. Handmade gifts are the perfect way to let someone know that they hold a special place in your heart, your mind, your business or your life in general.We even make ornaments for the 12 days of Christmas! These offer another fun way to keep reminding a loved one that you are thinking about them daily around this time of year...a reminder that will live on as they hang the ornaments on their tree each year. Have them shipped one at a time directly to your love one, or have the entire set sent to you and gift them daily in person.Our ornaments are handmade and serve as an elegant gift. It is our hope that this project will reach far beyond selling ornaments but will grow big enough to allow us to follow our dream of opening a store front and an online store. We will offer nostalgic handcrafted gifts and network with other craftsmen by offering them the opportunity to sell in our store as well.We have set our funding goal extremely low but hope that others will see the value and help us in our efforts to spread some Christmas Magic, and put us in a position to help others along the way. We hope to make this a successful pay it forward story and make a difference in the lives of children. In my community there are too many homeless teens, children and even families. It would be awesome to be able to spend Christmas Eve passing out very meaningful gifts of warm coats, sleeping bags, etc. For us a successful store will mean the opportunity to pay it forward in a small rural community that has a high rate of homeless teens.Our store will feature the type of gifts that tend to tug at the heartstrings and bring those warm fuzzy feelings or tears of joy to the eyes of the recipients.The money will be utilized for crafting supplies and tools, lease of a store (we hope to pay one year upfront if funding allows it), utilities at the store, bookkeeping fees and advertisement. Costs will be offset by allowing other craftsmen to sell in our store. One of the possible challenges is not securing enough funding but we have a back up plan to work out of our home until such funding is secured. Another challenge could be finding enough talented craftsmen to fill the space until we have enough stock built up, but we can deal with this by working hard to avoid this issue.Please note: These sample ornaments were made of plastic...we normally use glass so you can expect a higher quality finish that will dazzle any tree or add a focal point by hanging some from your mantle! They truly are more beautiful in person. ",The cost of seeing our project through to the end and being able to open our storefront will be the biggest challenge. Costs will be offset by allowing other craftsmen to sell in our store. One of the possible challenges is not securing enough funding but we have a back up plan to work out of our home until such funding is secured.

Or reading how and where my purchased product was made.Not long after these discoveries I found myself in love with handmade, unique products. One of the first things about having the new hobby was the noticeable raise of the product prices.Soon I learned how to make most of the things I loved on my own. Crochet coffee cup warmers for those cold mornings, brooches like no one else has, colourful crocheted bow ties, facial cloths, soaps, candles, blankets and other practical, as well as decorative and enjoyable items.I think people should be given the option to shop handmade products that help to express their personality and care about the environment by creators who understand the interests and don't overprice them.I would need a little start-up capital for the material costs and setting up a website to make my creations accessible, as well as work towards reaching the target audience.The money gathered would be a great help for me to pursue the projects I have been wanting to take on and make them accessible to people who are seeking for lower priced handmade unique accessories and gifts.","I am working as a one-man-band for now, so I do not expect any hold-backs.

At times I need to source them from various small shops and I have found that it does take time and effort to compile a whole vegan snack pantry.I think going vegan (or even vegetarian, part vegan or simply being ethically concious) is a great lifestyle it should be encouraged to educate people about the great alternatives and substitutes that exist. It is more than possible to have a happy belly & healthy skin - all vegan!My project is monthly vegan boxes delivered to your door. I would like to show people how many good quality and nice tasting possibilities exist. There is no need to compromise on anything in your daily life when you chose to be vegan - the options are broad and the alternatives are surprisingly tasty and lovely!As I am making my own soap and bath essentials, I would be regularly adding them to the boxes, as they are all natural and vegan.The rest of the products will be carefully sourced to offer both a wide variety, great finds and high quality.Each box is planned to consist of 4 - 8 goodies including snacks, food & drink, skincare and other nice goodies, all 100% vegan.With this project I am aiming to concentrate on building good relationships with many suppliers to get the best possible quality and variety products for a better price. The boxes would aim to have more value in them that the actual price reflects.As a starting point, I am thinking to charge £19.99 for box and a flat shipping fee of £2.90, totaling in £22.89.

https://www.kickstarter.com/projects/654080499/photobead?ref=discovery_category_newest,654080499/photobead,"Over the last few years, I have taught myself the art of glass bead making. One afternoon, two years ago, I realised that it may be possible to encase images inside the glass. At first, only black and white lettering was achievable.I had to find a method that would allow me to use colour images. After immense trial, error, heartbreak, blood and burns I finally achieved this.I nowneed to raise funds to enable me to bump up the quality a touch and help boost production. This will be achieved with extra tooling, upgrading the tools I already have and bulk buying the materials I use.To my knowledge, I'm the only person on the planet who can make these beads. There's dedicated production methods in place, some of which could be carried out by hiring staff at a later date (Only if the beads become a success, of course.).Your pledge will help me to turn my hobby into a (hopefully) thriving business. My goal is to be able to keep making these beads in the UK. It would be all too easy to get them mass produced elsewhere, but your pledges will enable me to better any outsourced price. With two people making these beads, it's possible to make three times as many. With this in mind, should orders reach a certain level, I pledge to employ and train someone from the dole que. If you choose to pledge and the project reaches it's goal, I shall send you the details of how to get the pictures to me for your photobead. The beads themselves have a hole size of 4.5mm and will fit on most brands of charm bracelet. Alternatively, they can be threaded onto a leather thong or ribbon.Apologies for the crudeness of this presentation - I am a Kickstarter virgin :)","From start to finish, the process of making one of these beads takes around 24hrs. The biggest challenge is getting it right first time. Any flaws are not apparent until the bead is finished. Due to strict production methods I have in place, most problems have been ironed out.",https://www.kickstarter.com/projects/654080499/the-bead-machine?ref=discovery_category_newest,654080499/the-bead-machine,"Welcome to my project.Where I wasI've been making beads for the last four years or so. Prior to that, my partner and I had a small online jewelry business specializing in charm beads. We were doing reasonably okay until lots of others started jumping on the band wagon. To counter this, I decided to approach some manufacturers in the far east with some of my own designs for beads (Which incidentally is where most of the major branded charm beads are also made). Doing this involved buying 1000 beads of the same design at the same time though. I went ahead with the idea all the same but it proved to be the wrong decision. The quality was there but the manufacturers didn't quite convey the ideas to my expectations. I got stuck with a lot of stock that I struggled to sell for a profit. After that, the business went downhill along with my relationship.With what was left over, I acquired some basic bead making equipment and set about teaching myself a new skill. I had managed to turn my business into a hobby! It was slow at first and I struggled to fit it in with working full time. By the time I managed to upgrade the equipment, my skills were starting to improve. I was managing to control the glass more and some artistic flare began to creep in. It wasn't too long before I was even making little glass animal charm beads. As soon as I was able to control the size of the beads I was making, it became possible to make full-on ""set pieces"" (as I lovingly call them now) and have something other than the charm beads under my belt. With this in mind, I set about creating a style of jewelry that I could use as my own canvas. I have a drawer full of prototypes that are wrong for all manner of reasons. Going back to the charm beads though - out came Photobead.Where I amI now have a style of jewelry that ticks all the boxes for me as an artist and a designer. It looks stunning and is durable too. In my opinion, it will always look good and last more than a lifetime. It's essentially rubber, stainless steel and toughened glass - now my materials of choice.There's an infinite range of designs that can be applied to this style -a style that can bridge tastes.Even the simplest of designs look stunning.Well I say simplest, but don't forget that every bead is individually made.I still like to make charm beads. It's all still the same equipment I need to use and they are ever popular. I just try to make something a little different,I do occasionally break away from the animals still.It's a pleasure to make these beads and constantly come up with fresh ideas. However, one particular bead really managed to strain my imagination. It was a quest to create the bead that everyone with a charm bracelet would want. It had to be something truly personal. I figured there had to be a way to get a photograph inside a glass bead. With a huge amount of blood, sweat, burns, tears and patience I finally cracked it.Photobead was born. You wouldn't believe the amount effort that goes into one tiny bead but I now have the production methods in place (very strange they are too).The Idea is to either have two images per bead or one image and a short message on the reverse.These beads are also shockproof and waterproof. Small flaws and tiny air bubbles are sometimes apparent but unlike metal charm with photos laminated onto them, Photobead will retain it's quality for years.So at the moment, I have three separate lines that can transform my hobby back into a viable business with vast potential.Where I'm goingI'm now in a position where I can take on customer requests. With the ""set pieces"" range, a customer can ask for specific colours and patterns (spotty, stripey, swirly etc) on the main beads, then I can transform them into a bespoke piece of jewelry. The same applies to the individual charm beads and the Photobeads speak for them selves.Why do I need funding?I need to take the quality up to the next level. All the charm beads and Photobeads currently only come with silver plated inserts. I desperately need the tooling and raw materials to be able to use sterling silver tubular inserts inside the beads. This is where the vast majority of the funding will go. The rest will go towards broadening the range of colours of glass I use.Thanks for looking and if this campaign doesn't appeal to you, please try and share it with someone who may be interested.

In addition to being a working letterpress shop, it will be a place to teach others about letterpress printing, wood flute making, bookbinding, papermaking, block printing, and other woodworking arts. Classes will be offered for both adults and kids. Open shop time will also be offered for those needing access to the tools and equipment to create their own projects.I studied industrial arts education with a graphic arts emphasis at the University of Wisconsin- Stout and have been involved with education for over 30 years. I truly enjoy letterpress and woodworking- look forward to sharing that enjoyment with others. Currently, there are three possible studio locations I have in mind. Each has it's advantages, but all come with a price tag. The top choice would have space for the print shop on one floor and woodworking on the other. The current space is small with little room to expand. I have already secured two small hand presses, forty two-cases of type with type racks and some supplies. In addition, I already have the woodworking tools needed to teach classes. In fact, our first flutemaking class is scheduled for this November.The ImpactThe creation of the studio will create a resource for those wishing to get training in 'hands on' types of activities. I am in an area where the schools are being forced to cut back on art, shop and life skills courses. This studio would be one way to help students get those skills. In addition to provding some unique and varied courses they can't find everywhere.This project is designed to fund:•to help with the initial rent for larger studio space•Rescue a treadle letterpress - a Pearl 7x11 and restore to use•rollers for press•an aluminum base•photopolmer plates and platemaker•ink•paperCheck out the awesome rewards to the right you can get for helping out.

My husband and I are ethical breeders of Syrian Hamsters in Dallas. We currently have 12 hamsters in our Hamstery. We love Syrians so much. I purchased the artwork of our logo from Jenni Illustrations (you can find her on Instagram) last year. I love the logo she made for us and I just can’t stop thinking about how cute it would be as an enamel pin. It would look so flipping cute displayed on my pinboard or in my ITA bag! I am a pin collector myself, but I am very picky when it comes to them. I will try my best to make it the Quality that fits my high standards. I hope you guys are as excited as I am! The drawing of the cute mommy and baby hamham is just so cute and would be great to add to any Kawaii pin collection. Plus, I haven’t found that many hamster pins so I thought we could make one come to life for those who also want a hamster pin of their very own!Timing for this project will work as follows: once launched the kickstarter runs for 60 days. We have to wait on the funds from kickstarter to be released to us once we have hopefully reached our goal. We will then pay the Manufacturer and be on our way. Once I have a picture from the manu I will be sure to update you guys! We will get the pins and have them out to you all who have pledged within a timely manner. I promise, I will be as quick as possible because I know you guys want the pin as much as I do!Note: if we reach our goal before the end date then we will be able to put in the order quicker and this will speed up processing time for when you all get your rewards/pins. So make sure to SHARE this project if you really want this to get off the ground and GO! If we by chance go over the goal amount this money’s ill be put toward another line of hamster pins that I have my mind set on designing and creating!I hope you will join us on this project and help bring this 1.5” enamel pin to life!

We are just a little bit Twisted the pair of us ;)Eventually after much failure (exploding candles not as fun as it sounds) we are ready to sell.We make everything from various sized tea lights to large pillar candles. We also go to nearby op-shops and find interesting glassware and cups for some more interesting candles. I mean who doesn't love a coffee scented candle in a cute mug ;)Now we just need a little bit of capital to get our stock up. From there we will be going to markets and selling off our website, once we get that up and running.Most of the capital however will be going into starting up the soaps and body butters (we have the lip balms ready to go). We have been doing a lot of research sourcing ingredients that are as natural as possible. All that is left is to get the ingredients.We are a couple of hard working people who have a dream of owning our own business, all we ask is a little bit of help realising that dream.

Candles are a science in themselves, if you don't get the temp and ratios just right, well exploding candles aren't that only thing to come out of our kitchen :DThe beauty products are going to be a challenge, but with the soaps and body butters the hardest part is sourcing the ingredients. We want to be as natural as possible which more often than not is not the cheapest and some suppliers don't list everything in there products.We are however determined to get this right, for example three months ago I started experimenting with square candle molds and i am still trying to get those candles to come out of the mold and will continue trying till I get it right.",https://www.kickstarter.com/projects/852837112/twisted-essentials-start-up?ref=discovery_category_newest,852837112/twisted-essentials-start-up,"A few years ago a friend and I decided to start up a business.

I hope that you can help!","At the moment the biggest obstacle is the finance, hence why we are here. The next big thing after we have built up out stock is going to be getting the website up and running.Over the last two years we have already done lots of experimenting to get our products right and now that we have found a new supplier and are using a new type of wax, (no more exploding candles, or pillars jammed in their molds). the only experimenting left is with some of the new scents we are trialling with our new supplier, but so far everything is looking good at that end as well."

Here is link to a video of me the director https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9m6kHts-eyg&feature=youtu.be And here is some test footage of the Red Lady https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nNEwC2lxXpA  This is not a finalized version of the Red Lady. The makeup is more improved. This is a first film, but we are fast learners and rapidly improving.***Update // September 9http://youtu.be/JVDVd9aNJN0Everyone who knows horror movies knows the Evil Dead. There was a reboot in 2013 of the first one Evil Dead in 1981, which led to the sequel Evil Dead II in 1988, and The Army of Darkness in 1992. But most people don't know about the 31 min short Within the Woods. Its the original version of the Evil Dead. Without that, there likely would not have been an Evil Dead franchise.The Red Lady: Torment of the Blood Moon, is my ""Within the Woods"". I started out writing a story that was awesome. Mind exploding awesome. But it became a story that I could not make on my limited budget. But it is a fully developed idea that will be known someday. Someday the Red Lady will take her place among the horror legends like Jason, Freddy, Michael, and Pin Head.Since I could not make my original idea, I focused on a more narrow aspect of the Red Lady story. I have a large mythos already created along with a origin story and I know more or less how the Red Lady will evolve in future films as a character.This story combines 1980's nostalgic slasher formula with pseudo Japanese style 2000's era creepy Asian lady psycho, body distorting creepiness. (I just realized that the 1990's was a lost decade for horror, except for maybe the 1st Scream. Oh well I digress) Along the way I will break the ""rules"" of the genre so that it follows the formula but at the same time is not predictable. Its a line I gotta walk.I don't want to give the story away for 2 reasons.1st) If I try to give a simple outline, It will seem to generic or ""canned"".2nd) In order to show that its not ""canned"" story telling I would have to give major plot twist away.So I will just tell you this. Think dark woods, creepy dolls, implements of pain, mangled flesh, and about 30 gallons of blood per victim.Also the film has a certain self awareness of... itself. Though its not the main focus, there will be some internal critiques of the horror genre.So in conclusion, this will be something big someday. Support us.Thank You.","Since you have invested this much of your time I will assume we are friends now. And between friends Ill be honest with you. I am learning everything as I go. Directing and video editing are new to me, but am getting the hang of it. None of the actors that I will be working with are not professionals. Most don't even have any acting experience. We do have experience with theater acting. Also the actress that will portray the Red Lady is an accomplished singer with an amazing range. Unfortunately those talents are not really needed in this story. The biggest challenge is the fact that this is our first film. We are not professionals. Our equipment is not of the professional caliber. Nobody is really qualified to make their first movie. The first movie is where we earn our qualifications to make more movies. And better ones. This is a learning experience for everyone involved. What we lack in experience we can more than make up for with motivation and energy.",https://www.kickstarter.com/projects/237912673/torment-of-the-blood-moon?ref=discovery_category_newest,237912673/torment-of-the-blood-moon,"This is our second attempt at this. The first one was ignored, but we kept trudging on. We have upgraded our equipment, learned some new techniques, secured some up and coming semi professional actors, and have found the creepiest house in Texas to host our little project. We didn't ask for much then and even less now. This started off as a good idea and has evolved into a life driving passion.The basic premise of the story is a group of aspiring film makers break down in the middle of nowhere where they come across an evil cult of rednecks with violent tendencies. Everything is going bad until a pick ax wielding ghost/monster shows up to make things worse.The story is solid. The characters are solid and believable, even the rednecks who will not be used for comic relief but will truly be menacing and vile without having to resort to mutations or inbreeding. The creature has a back story already ready for the prequel treatment and has a future beyond this. This film will also boast the most unlikely of protagonist of any horror film.Kickstarter is only letting me post 1 video which is the location we will be filming at.

Kids participating in our program range in ages from 6 - 17 and come from a variety of cultural backgrounds.Presented in August, our Shakespeare series is fast paced, full of action and held in a relaxed atmosphere to serve as a good introduction for families and kids who have never seen live theatre. We will be appearing at Libs park on Aug. 2 at 7:00 p.m. Sat Aug. 9 for Kool Aid Days 2:00 p.m. and at McCool Junction on Aug. 16 at 7:00 p.m.We begin our rehearsal process in April when each actor is paired with a Shakespeare tutor. The tutor meets with his or her actor once a week, focusing on pronunciation and understanding of text. All tutors are volunteers and include college students, retired teachers and even a classical professor emeritus. The troupe begins staging (or perhaps we should say turfing!) rehearsals in June.  During this part of the process we work complicated sequences, including (but not limited to!) pie in the face, sword fighting and battle scenes involving LARGE numbers of small children! They LOVE this part... and that's the point, really. We do not set a polished production as our primary goal. We hope that at the end of the season each member of our troupe comes away from the experience with a sense of pride. That's not to say, we DON'T secretly hope that they have learned something along the way!

The small truck was used to carry sets, costumes and props to rehearsals and performances around the city.  We have learned to be adaptable when performing outdoors.

Also, ask them to make a face.Next we'll import these images into a photo editing suite. Since the final output will be on a standard A4 / 8.5"" x 11"" printer paper, start by opening your photo editing software and opening a new document set to your printer paper size. Then, import the profile and portrait pictures of your subject onto new layers and resize them to fit your workspace. We'll resize them again after merging the faces together. Using your photo editor trim away any background so that you are left with just the face. After trimming, if your two pictures have different lighting adjust the lighting levels (ctrl+L in most applications)Using the eye as a level, align the two images so the features match up from the profile to the portrait (eyes, mouth, nose all aligned).

My plan is to have numerous gardens outside where we can grow our root vegetables such as potatoes, turnips, carrots, radishes etc. We will also have gardens set up for our leafy greens, broccoli, cabbage, cauliflower, tomatoes of all sizes, cucumbers,  beans, squash, watermelons and pumpkins. Our greenhouse will house all of our young plants and to grow fresh herbs and spices as well as house our already harvested produce.For our first year, all the work done at Stewarts Greenhouse and Gardens will be done by myself, my husband and my children and the family and friends that we have already enlisted to help. My children have already drawn up their produce stand that they themselves will own and run. It is our hope that by spring 2016 we will add an orchard and corn fields. Fruit trees such as apples, pears, cherries and peaches seem to do quite well in our climate so our orchard will house all these. We also plan to add blueberries, strawberries, raspberries and blackberries. Both the orchard and the berry patches will be open to the public for a ""pick and carry"" for a fee. We also plan to have a Haunted corn maze, pumpkin patch and wagon rides for our harvest and Halloween season. With the expansion of Stewarts Greenhouse and Gardens, we will be able to hire up to 4 employees to help with cultivation of our expansions, we hope to have a total of 8 full time employees by the end of 2016 and 4 part time employees for the harvest.Spring 2017 will bring new employees and at this point we will add our bakery. Our bakery will add extra income to Stewarts Greenhouse and Gardens and only the freshest of fruits and vegetables will be used as well as milk and eggs purchased from other local farms and dairies. We have the same plan for this as we do for our gardens, orchards and berry patches. For a small fee, you can purchase fresh pies, muffins, breads and tarts from our bakery.The Plan for our 4 seasons GreenhouseI have done extensive research on this issue. Growing up on my parents farm I learned that these plastic greenhouses don't last for very long before they need to be repaired and lets face it, plastic greenhouses are not very warm in the winter months where our temperatures drop to -20 and sometimes lower. So, with some research I have devised a plan to build a greenhouse that will need minimal annual maintenance.The General design Our greenhouse will be 12' wide by 20' long with a ceiling of 10' at its peak to allow the use of shelving units to hold ready to go produce. We will then use structurally insulated panels (a foam core stuck in between 2 layers of structure board) which is mold and rot proof as well as fire proof. These panels are highly insulative and used in homes and greenhouses alike. For our ceiling we will use Polycarbonate, it is virtually indestructible and perfectly safe to use as a greenhouse glazing. Our roof itself will have 4 panels that we can open to use as a ventilation system during the summer and during the winter months, they will be sealed with weather stripping. For our heat retention, we plan on using non perforated weeping tile, with the help of a solar powered fan, to direct the hot air from the top of the greenhouse down where it will be stored in the soil of our garden beds. For our Thermal mass we will be using black barrels of water. For our winter months an energy efficient heating system will be used to help grow our produce all winter. We estimate that by the end of our first year, we can double our funding goal. By the end of our second year, we can quadruple our funding goal by the end of the harvest.","This project is going to take a lot of work, learning and patients. If we do not get up and running for the spring then we will work harder to get it going for early summer. If we do not meet our funding goal, its not the end of the world, we will just try harder. We aren't known for giving up easily and we have each other to fall back on. We are hoping to reach and even exceed our funding goal to make our dream and our kids dreams come true.",https://www.kickstarter.com/projects/926851008/mandys-pet-urns?ref=discovery_category_newest,926851008/mandys-pet-urns,"Tired of boring old boxes and ceramic pet urns? Tired of paying too much to get what you really want to put your best fur friend in? Well look no more! Hi! My name is Amanda (Mandy) Stewart and I am an animal and art lover. I have an idea to turn boring old pet urns into a beautiful work of art to keep your pets memory alive.As a pet parent, my fur babies are just as important to me as my human babies. I think I speak for every pet parent out there when I say that losing or even the thought of losing our furry kids, is heart wrenching. I wouldn't know what to do if I lost any of my boys, which is why I came up with the idea to create a pet urn that immortalizes your furry, scaly or completely bare pet by creating an urn that looks exactly like him/her. All you have to do is send a clear picture of your pet and his weight so I can create an urn statuette of your beloved pet.Not wanting a pet urn? No problem! I do other custom clay pieces as well. Have an idea for miniatures for Dungeons and Dragons or any other RPG tabletop game but cant exactly find the ones you want? I can make them for you, all you have to do is send me your character information (skills,weapons, class, race, armor, etc) and I will create your mini for you. I also do custom candle holders, sconces, dishes, Repti hides, incense burners, ashtrays and the list goes on. If you want it I will make it, all you have to do is send me an idea and i will put it together.  ","Some of the challenges I have already encountered with these clay projects is that I cannot make them fast enough for people. I learned quite quickly to set a deadline and meet it. If I find myself swamped and need some extra time to finish a piece, I will personally call or email you to notify you. Your service is important to me and I will do my very best to communicate with you and make your piece as wonderful as you imagined."

The Artist's Chamber is a mood synthesizer designed for the personal and collective evolution of consciousness. This directed creativity that interfaces art and technology begins to unknot the inchoate profusion of neuroscience's inquiries into emotion quantification. The Artist proactively selects sensory stimulation from the console; s/he physically expresses art while receiving the selected sensory data in 3 and 4D; meanwhile the Artist witnesses their shifting physiological biofeedback as displayed on the screens, including functions such as brain waves, heart rate, skin temperature and respiration.Let's look at the process of artistic expression that activates this process: ""Not only does art have a neurological foundation in its perceptual properties, but the emotions evoked from making and viewing art have a neurological component as well. Neuroscientist Daniel Siegel (1999) explained that emotions do not exist in the way we usually think of them. ..Emotions represent dynamic processes created within the socially influenced, value appraising process of the brain” (p. 123).""^1...and on how neuronal activity connects with emotions.""It follows that if art therapy affects our emotions, it alters the circuitry and activity of the brain. Conversely, if art therapy alters our brain, one can expect it to affect our emotions. To more fully understand the benefits of the creative act, it is essential to study how the creative experience may shape consciousness and emotions through the alteration of neurological activity.""^2""Human interactions, learning, and the performance of certain activities can all alter the patterns of brain activity as well as a person’s emotions (Restak, 2003). “By altering both the activity and the structure of the connections between neurons, experience directly shapes the circuits responsible for such processes as memory, emotion, and self-awareness” (Siegel, 1999, p. 2). It follows that if art therapy affects our emotions, it alters the circuitry and activity of the brain. Conversely, if art therapy alters our brain, one can expect it to affect our emotions.""^3Using a combination of biomedical monitoring tools; sensory input; physically-generated creative/artistic output; and large biometrics feedback display screens, the neurological data is captured and may be made available through a social media arts app to friends and family on Facebook, Twitter etc., or, if permitted, for neuropsychological and other research purposes. The Artist's Chamber provides: 1) a method through which the Artist may alter one's own psychological landscape, shifting emotions into a reorganized mental perspective; 2) the opportunity for cognitive science advances through the analysis of the Artist's real-time, physiologically-based, biofeedback; 3) an app to share a) biofeedback as it was displayed on a screen, in the forms of a) ""before and after"" snapshots; b) a movie of the entire session; and c) artistic output from the clear window.We will need a room installation such as built by a design firm for museum exhibits; the Chamber will need to be disassembled for transport to venues and reassembled on site.We'll need to acquire and put in place, with the support of an installation builder, an electrical engineer/computer scientist, a neurospecialist, and a media programmer: 1) a swivel chair with wheels;2) a console for sensory stimulation selections, and for saving and sharing biofeedback and artistic out put results;3) a remote EEG device, and other physiologically-based biofeedback devices such as for measuring heart rate, respiration and skin temperature; 4) large biometrics display screens displaying real-time biofeedback; 5) speakers and a large screen for audio and visual input;6) a clear, erasable ""window"" for artistic output; 7) smaller biometrics display screens placed outside the room for permitted observers;8) chairs for permitted external viewers, with a privacy screen protection option;9) temperature control, scents, air movement sensations, flowers or herbs, bubbles, and other 4 D input.This combination of input and output within The Artist's Chamber is designed to activate and achieve mood transitions, proactively selected and arranged by the Artist for one's preferred ""psychological landscapes"".According to many in the field of neuropsychiatry the use of prescription medications and behavioral modification techniques have limited success, and often adverse side effects. The Artist's Chamber allows the autonomous individual the opportunity to observe biofeedback originating from physiological measurements while creating art and using other tools available in the Chamber as a way to affect mood, study oneself, increase self awareness, and contribute data to the challenging efforts to quantify emotions. ^1 Christopher M.

Through presence at events such as the HackingArts at MIT to which I was invited to exhibit The Artist's Chamber in 2015, it will become easier and easier to place this interactive tool for directed creativity at educational and art museums; at psychological  and psychiatric research institutes; in therapy offices; as public art in recreational landscapes; and ultimately in the home. It will probably take 3 - 6 months to have the first prototype. I'll need to hire people, gather supplies, find a place to build it, and then as a team, make it work just right. Fortunately, the prototype can travel to various venues so once that is in hand our marketing ability for future Chambers will be greatly enhanced through exhibitions and demonstrations. The Artist's Chamber offers a revolutionary new technique for the evolution of consciousness. Rather than suppressing our ""undesired"" emotions, TAC provides access to the release and measurement of the full emotional spectrum through Artist participation.

To date I have published 28 times: poetry, essays and short stories. I want my writing to share life and imagination, including, perhaps most importantly, the message of the consciousness of Gaiaia, and what our future may hold, depending on each of us. 20 Years After helps us to imagine one possible outcome, and how we might respond.The story includes basic survival skill instructions at the end of chapters, on topics such as how to skin a snake, how build a fire, etc. In building a gaming plot story based on a semifinalist award I won at MIT, Troubled Waters, to address global ground water supply concerns now and in the future, I wrote 20 Years After, with illustrations by my friend Nick Wyneken. I want to share, especially with young people, the world we may face, of cataclysm; and its survivors, in the way of a story. My hope is that your foresight will keep us from such a fate. A sense of destiny pervades the story.Our goal of $500 was set after careful calculations, in order to cover the costs of printing a collector's first print run of 50 copies: lovingly designed and created, costs add up. I'd like for 20 Years After to engage readers with how things may become, and to place us in a context that empowers us and our neighbors with a practical commitment to positive change based within the wide regions of the imagination; to relay both a sense of belonging, and adventure.Without you, we won't be here in 100 years, or even 50.","Turning out good writing is immensely time consuming and hard work!  The final step is to send the work to the printers. Then we can put the book on shelves. Going to print, and the tremendous amount of work that comes before that, costs money."

The idea is to design a piece that will be a reference tool, but mostly to facilitate a mood of contemplation and/or exploration. I would like to help guide people in their interests in our world.I'm running thiskickstarter campaign because I need help with printing and distribution costs. My Plan:Print and distribute 2,000posters to local retail outlets as well as national facilities. I have some contacts within the retail sector in my area. I also plan to open channels to national and big box settings.Donate prints to schools. As part of my drive to enliven an interest in printed maps, I wish to donate posters to schools. This will begin on the county level. If I surpass my financial goals on kickstarter, I will broaden my program to include more schools.For my $100+backers, I’ll be printing limitededition, signed posters on acid free paper. This will be an awesome wallpiece and not available anywhere else.My goal is to raise $3,500, which will allow me to complete my objectives. If I don’t reach my goal I will not receive any funding... All or nothing. If I exceed my goal, I’llput the additional funds into further distribution. What do you think? If you like this project I hope you’ll join me. It’s a pretty quick thing to donate, and I'm taking donations from $18 up – whatever amount feels right to you. I’d also be forever grateful if you tell your friends about it!Kickstarter will send you a little survey after this project gets successfully funded. In that survey, you'll get a chance to select which poster I ship to you.I would love to expand this project with more projections and palettes! The sky is the limit!",The biggest challenge is wading through forms and hoops it takes to bring my products into the national market!  There will be a lot of paperwork and waiting as the process continues into national venues.  There will be a certain amount of footwork to distribute products into local arenas as well as follow up with all contacts involved.  I will need to put on my Sales Hat!  I appreciate the opportunity to move this project to fruition!,https://www.kickstarter.com/projects/dougcn/paris-gather-no-moss-map?ref=discovery_category_newest,dougcn/paris-gather-no-moss-map,"In addition to mapmaking, I'm also an accomplished designer and artist.I'm excited to be running this Kickstarter campaign in order to create a GIANT 60"" wide x 87"" high mural of my Paris, Gather-No-Moss Map, which is an enlarged version of my insanely jam-packed places of interest map. I'm looking for help from people like you to make it happen. The mural will be printed on a material that is actually an adhesive-backed polyester fabric, that can be mounted onto a wall. Then, if you ever decide to take it down, it's easily removed, without damaging the wall!As we examine and zoom into the beautiful Paris, Gather-No-Moss Map, you can see the complexity of the information. In fact, there are areas that are absolutely crazy with sites to explore! If you're looking to find something to do in Paris, this is a good starting point … or if you've been there and want to remember some details … or if you just like to daydream! In fact, there are over 4,500 locations listed on this map, from major tourist destinations, to hotels, theatres, fine restaurants, cafes, fast food, museums, galleries…. the list goes on and on!!!""The mural must be insanely expensive…"" Not true! I expect to retail them for about $350, plus shipping! The majority of the data used to make this map comes from OpenStreetMap.My Plan:To complete production for and print one Paris, Gather-No-Moss Map mural (60""x87""), as a test display. I am researching high traffic locations to hang the mural, as a marketing piece, in order to spark interest. If a picture's worth a thousand words, then seeing this map on display will be priceless as a marketing tool!My goal is to raise $500, which will allow me to complete production and create a print. If I don’t reach my financial goal you will not be charged, and I will not receive funding. Stretch goals and fun premiums are standing by!If you think this project rocks, join me. It’s a pretty quick thing to donate, with donations starting at $5. I'll welcome whatever amount feels right to you. I’d also be grateful if you'd tell your friends about it!","The challenge, with cartography, is taking useful information and expressing it in the most useful way.  That can change per theme.  With this particular map, there was an incredible amount of information that was required, I needed to bend some design rules just to express all the data!Another challenge is the fulfillment of orders at the end of this marathon.  I have calculated, what I consider, to be an effective production and shipping schedule for this campaign.  If I need assistance getting orders out, I'll ask friends to volunteer.I don't speak that much French... so some of this is set by logic!  Thank you for your patience!!!"

https://www.kickstarter.com/projects/221524246/sail-away-on-a-fractal-flame?ref=discovery_category_newest,221524246/sail-away-on-a-fractal-flame,"Hello, my name is Stan Weddington. I am a visual engineer, and for the past few years I have been designing flam3 fractals for use in light and projection shows, art installations and the global collaborative art project called the Electric Sheep.Sail Away started as a single fractal flame I designed in January 2013.Whiletweakingits animation, I developed a technique which allowed the embedding of a secondary animation inside the primary one. The results produced a flame with a basic circular flow that slowly morphs and warps over a 25 minute period. I was able to repeat the process with a different internal flame transform and extend the total animation time to 50 minutes.Rendering the full Sail Away animation requires over 260 billion mathematical calculations. It will take nearly five months of 24/7 processing to render the entire sequence. So much computer processing power is needed that rendering was split into two sessions. Using two powerful computers runningcontinuouslySail Away 1 (the first 25 minute loop) was rendered from January 2013 through March 2013. Sail Away 2 (the second 25 minute loop) started its rendering in April 2013 and will be completed by the end of May 2013.Sail Away is hypnotic, trance inducing and ideal for entering meditative and altered states of consciousness. It provides a playground for the imagination through free association of the visual imagery, and naturally calms and relaxes the viewer. To add more dimensionto Sail Away, with ChromaDepth ® HD 3D glasses, the animation jumps from the viewing screen in vibrantlyseparatedcolors. Not just any 3D glasses will work because it is the patented ChromaDepth® technology which creates the 3D effect from the colors within the animation.This Kickstarter project is to raise the funds needed to produce audio content just as captivating and mind expanding as the visual content. The project is fortunate to have access to Brian Paulson, the award-winning composer and multi-instrumentalist. Brian is known throughout the world for his synergistic approach for stimulating the different senses by producing music that correlates with the upper octaves of color and fragrance. Collaborating with Brian will be the band 3:1, a powerhouse trio of musical talent with decades of music production experience.The musicians have hit the studio once already and arrived at a musical space best described as Miles Davis jazzy co-mingling with Pink Floyd psychedelic. Brian's complete bio can be found on his website:www.mindpowermp3.com/Bio-Sonic-Music/and the 3:1 band bio can be found on their website: www.3to1music.com.Kickstarter funds will also be used for the manufacturing of the initial DVD and Blu-ray disc releases of Sail Away, and acquiring the ChromaDepth ® HD 3D glasses and Internet server space and bandwidth needed for backer rewards fulfillment.Every backer of this project will be able to download and print the high resolution print file of the Sail Away fractal flame, which can be printed as large as 64"" x 44"" at good resolution.  This is the same file I use to produce fine art prints for galleries and art shows. Print any size for personal use only.Sail Away Project Progress & Future:To see all the flames I have submitted to the Electric Sheep project, click this link:http://v2d7c.sheepserver.net/cgi/best?menu=designer&p=3","The finishing of the animation rendering tops the list of risk for this project.  Hardware breakdowns do happen, but since I have two computers doing the rendering, if one fails, the other still can complete the task.  I have padded the completion estimate by 10 days or so to minimize impact to the project in the event of a computer malfunction.Since the musicians have already been in the studio and started recording the Sail Away composition, not reaching the funding goal is the only thing standing in the way of the music being delivered by the ending of this Kickstarter.Video encoding can produce oddities occasionally.  A variety of open source software tools are used to produce my final master videos.  I am also evaluating commercial encoding software to ensure the highest quality files for download videos, DVD and Blu-ray production.  The downloadable videos will be in .mp4 format which is the most compatible between devices from smartphones to Mac and Windows computers.The download file sizes for the backer rewards range from really big to down right ginormous [gigantically-enormous].  A reliable Internet connection will be needed along with plenty of time if your throughput bandwidth is not high... the video files are more than 1 Gigabyte in size each.Fine art printers break down just like computers.  If such a thing happens, backers will be notified if printing is delayed because of this or any other reason.Fine art prints are shipped in sturdy mailing tubes, and are insured.  If your print arrives damaged, just photograph it and the damaged package, and it will be taken care of.",https://www.kickstarter.com/projects/221524246/sheep-for-your-wall?ref=discovery_category_newest,221524246/sheep-for-your-wall,"Hello, my name is Stan Weddington. I am a visual engineer, and for the past few years I have been designing flam3 fractals for use in light and projection shows, art installations and as contributions to Electric Sheep. Electric Sheep is a distributed computing project for animating and evolving fractal flames, which are in turn distributed to the networked computers, which display them as a screensaver. For more on the Electric Sheep project see their Wikipedia entry.This project called ""Sheep for Your Wall"" is a portfolio of ten (10) recently designed flames which have been specifically bred to make top notch Electric Sheep. Not only that, but the algorithmic genome of each flame has been further manipulated to produce stunning artwork when printed super sized by large format printers. Over the duration of this project each portfolio flame will be put in the Electric Sheep rendering queue where it will be animated and distributed worldwide. The sheep voted most popular will continue to share their unique algorithmic genome pattern with sheep made in the future.The diagram below illustrates how two of my sheep contributions (highlighted in yellow) have been used at different times to ultimately help form the random sheep at the bottom.The way I create a flame is much like the way a biologist would breed a more colorful flower or sweeter fruit. Algorithmic patterns called genomes define what a sheep looks like just as our DNA defines us. I will take a genome and mutate it by manipulating the equations assigned to the transforms of the flame. After mutating I will mathematically cross the genome with another flame's genome to produce a new flame. I repeat the mutate and cross sequence with new flames until one is produced which has the dynamic characteristics and visual appeal which makes for a good contribution to the worldwide flock of sheep.I design fractal sheep not only for theiraestheticbeauty, but also for their animation properties. Sometime I end up with a remarkable looking flame only to find out it has a boring or non-pleasing movement when animated. Not all flames work out, and only a small fraction of the ones I create ever make it to a stage where they are submitted to the sheep queue.This portfolio represents the current evolutionary stage of my sheep creation and animation techniques. It comes from many hours of work and re-work of hundreds of genome crosses and mutations. I am particularly pleased with the results.All of the ""Sheep for Your Wall"" portfolio images can be found on my website at www.freakiebeat.comwhere there is a feature to zoom into any part of the images to see the details of the fractals.To see a video of what the ""Sheep for Your Wall"" fractals will look like once animated as Electric Sheep follow this link -http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R_XXTTTOASYWith the expectation of expanding the reach of my fractal flames beyond the Internet and a screensaver, this project's funding goal is $500. Funds will be used to produce fine art quality large format prints of the ""Sheep for Your Wall"" portfolio for display in art installations and gallery showings. Funds will also be used toacquirethe bandwidth and server space needed to fulfill backer rewards. Pledges in excess of the funding goal will be put towards creating and displaying more of my fractal flames as fine art.There is only one reward level for this project, and all backers who pledge amounts at that level or higher will be able to download the entire ""Sheep for Your Wall"" portfolio of fine art resolution images. Once downloaded, they can be printed and used for any non commercial purpose. Print gallery quality images for your wall, cards for family and loved ones or reproduce and give away as gifts. They also make wonderful background images for computers and tablets.My Electric Sheep HistoryTo see my entire portfolio of flames I have submitted to the Electric Sheep project follow this link -http://v2d7c.sheepserver.net/cgi/best?menu=designer&p=3.","Due to the very large file size of the fractal images, downloading them will require a reliable Internet connection and preferably high throughput bandwidth.  On slower connections it might take quite a while to complete the download of all the images.  To help backers out, not only will the images be zipped into one file they can download, you will also be given the choice of downloading the files individually to reduce instantaneous bandwidth demands.A maximum of one flame can be submitted to the Electric Sheep rendering queue daily.  Occasionally, the sheepserver computer becomes unreachable for up to a day.  Since I only need to average submitting one fractal flame to the sheepserver queue every 4 days, this should not be a problem, but in case  all the flames do not get submitted before this project ends, it will in no way interfere with backer rewards fulfillment."

Well I have been painting for over 20 years now, I started with comic books and moved into surrealism paintings later in my career. I feel in love as soon as I painted my first painting of Marilyn Monroe. I love the feeling of high detail and crisp gradient in my paintings. I also love the idea of making something almost look real, but at the same time you know it is fantasy. Painting is something I love more than anything to do and now I want to create amazing paintings for you. I hope you enjoy and love these paintings as much as I do painting them.I have an idea for a painting series of pinups of a girl in space. I love the idea of 50's style pinups and the cooky posters for the old school movie posters. Like a hybrid of that and my surrealistic style, I have already painted the 1st painting in this set, there are 2 more coming I will update this KickStarter as I finish them. But they will all 3 be pinup style posters brought to life in paper and you can own a copy!Below are the stretch goals for this project, the hope is that we can hit a few of these because I think it would be extra fun!Embelishments - all the poster prints will have embelishments on them by hand, creating even more originality to the prints2 Additional Prints - I will add 2 additional prints to the set everyone will get these prints for free added onto their set.I will add more as they go, I hope everyone enjoys and sorry for my awkward talk, I love to draw and paint, not necessarily write words, hahah!","I have done many prints before, I don't see any risks except for the shipping of the framed prints."

I was working in a metal shop that offered me scraps from our last project waiting to become our first (pictured) tv mount.Her request was for a wall mount moved from one spot to another, and being the non-simple person I am, my finance and myself built a tv stand that would pan & tilt as the top of the line ones do, yet I added my flair, mothers love of a good vino and used hand forged branches and grapes to create vines that held me, I am 6'1 and 218lbs, if it did that I was content it would hold the centerpiece of a room in an ornate fashion I had never seen, but now held.Family and friends that I showed told me I should run with this idea and as I showed a few local businesses their intrest peaked and my inspiration grew. Family medical issues in December and January caused me to lose a job fabricating fences and ornate gates to go back to freelance handyman and arborist work, allowing me to care for my love Jen and our family through her time of recovery and hopefully brief pain managment after surgery, and enjoy her company at work at times too.","I have overloaded myself before, live and learn school of hard knocks classes happen. As of now we are looking at a split of 30/30/40 in our time managment. I have a month of work lined up for handyman work so bills are covered, 30% of my time or two days a week +/- 30% spent on chimneys and the steady what used to be side jobs cover rent and food for the family, might be to much but I'd want to know the venturers are stable before buying a product in advance. That being said the remaining time will be devoted to our art. Materials and consumables will be purchased post haste, as I have never understood running out.

Tan vacío que no puedes sentir nada, rodeado por oscuridad - ¿Cuántas personas hemos dejado atrás?  - ¿Sigues cuidando de ti? - ""Se vio a sí mismo en todo las cosas, en cada ser humano, en cada animal, en cada árbol, en el agua, en la lluvia, en las nubes, en la tierra..."" - ""Es fácil vivir con los ojos cerrados, interpretando mal todo lo que se ve"" - ""Domesticamos a los niños de la misma manera en la que domesticamos o a un perro, un gato o cualquier otro animal"" - ""Todos nos reprimimos, nos esforzamos y adquirimos habilidades para conseguir lo que queremos, nos alentamos nosotros mismos"" - ""Que haya tenido la peor de mis noches, no significa que no te desee los buenos días"" - De cualquier forma el tiempo pasará, es mejor que pase mientras tú das tu mejor esfuerzo, a dejar que sólo se desvanezca y con él tus oportunidades - ""Suicidio; no sé por qué cosas estás pasando, pero puedo asegurarte que no estás solo, hay más personas como tú, hay personas que darían todo por ti, lo malo es que a veces aún no las conocemos"" - Amabilidad con desconocidos (salud a un extraño, hacer feliz a los demás) - Besar a la persona que amas - Defectos, nosotros como humanos tenemos muchas fallas que a veces no notamos - Mira lo más lejos posible, más allá de los edificios, más allá de todas las luces - Efímero, nuestra vida, las palabras, las personas - Problemas que no tienen solución - Sé servicial con las personas  - Belleza callejera (animales) - Ser un camaleón - Una noche resplandeciente - Tranquilidad por la mañana - Ayuda a tu familia - Personas en crecimiento - Gente perdida - Personas fugaces - Esfuerzo - Soledad interior - Música - El final de la vidaAl finalizar el proyecto se realizará una libro adjuntando las fotos de los meses correspondientes, y con las fotos se añadirá la ""leyenda"" en la cuál se busca dar explicación a cosas que no notamos a simple vista, además de anécdotas o sucesos que puedan pasar al ser tomadas las fotos, serán libros recopilatorios de fotos, experiencias, momentos, etc.Este es mi primer proyecto en kickstarter, apreciaré cualquier sugerencia dada, y de igual modo el lograr llegar a la meta me ayudará a seguir realizando proyectos similares y mejores.","Éste es un desafío personal, poder encontrar una imagen que se acople perfectamente al sentimiento que quiero describir, y viceversa, encontrar las palabras adecuadas para poder describir hechos únicos y maravillosos en la vida.Este proyecto se trata completamente de buscar momentos perfectos y palabras impactantes, no hay alguna clase de riesgo, lo único necesario es el tiempo.El presupuesto está destinado a conseguir el equipo que necesito para este proyecto, siendo precisos se trata de una cámara, además de que, al conseguirlo, después conseguiría realizar más proyectos que tengo en mente.Además de que una parte también sería destinada a gastos de traslados, dependiendo de el lugar o de la foto que requiera ciertos días.Por lo poco que aporten quiero que reciban lo mejor que puedo darles, todas mis ideas, toda mi dedicación y esfuerzo.",https://www.kickstarter.com/projects/1123321857/manana-empieza-hoy?ref=discovery_category_newest,1123321857/manana-empieza-hoy,"MOTIVACIÓN:La historia de este proyecto es fácil de explicar, soy un joven de 19 años (la edad es sólo un número) que sigue teniendo muchas dudas acerca de su futuro, y este último año ha sido decisivo para mí, no hay algo que quiera más que dedicar mi vida a la ciencia (física) y al deporte en distintos ámbitos.Durante los últimos meses me he sentido con la duda de qué quería hacer con mi vida, y ahora lo sé, quiero ir más allá de los límites del conocimiento en todo lo que se me permita, y de igual modo quiero aportarle una ayuda a las demás personas en todo sentido posible, y eso es lo que quiero hacer ahora, apoyar a todas las personas que puedan leer esto a ver más allá de su vida actual, porque todos tenemos cosas que aún no empezamos a pesar de que lo queremos, algunos hemos tomado decisiones que nos han llevado lejos de nuestro objetivo principal y muchos otros aún no descubrimos qué es lo que en verdad queremos.No puedo decir que este proyecto tiene años de estudio, lo que tiene son años de experiencia ante la vida que quiero plasmar, quiero compartir todo lo que he vivido a lo largo de los años y me ha ayudado a crecer.SOLO ES EL INICIO:El proyecto consiste en un PDF didáctico en el cuál plantearé anécdotas que podrás relacionar fácilmente con tu vida y que te ayudarán a ver tu alrededor desde otro panorama, consistirá en hacerte pensar sobre lo qué estás leyendo y sobre lo que estás viviendo día con día, además de ayudarte a reconocer qué es lo que sientes y qué es lo que quieres.Este es un proyecto a largo plazo que quiero seguir construyendo al pasar de los años, entonces este PDF sería el comienzo de una pirámide que espero no tenga final, quiero ayudar a la gente ahora mismo y de igual modo que en muchos años este PDF aún sea de ayuda, sé que muchas personas desconocemos nuestro objetivo, la carrera que queremos estudiar, el trabajo que queremos obtener o el simple modo de cómo queremos vivir nuestra vida, y es algo que quiero ayudar a aclarar.SOBRE ""MAÑANA EMPIEZA HOY""He estado desarrollando las ideas que plantearé y muchas de ellas sólo necesitan ser planteadas y compartidas, planeo organizar lo necesario y poder plasmarlo en 16 páginas, ni muy largo ni muy corto, quiero presentar lo más posible con sólo lo que sea necesario y se tratará de 3 capítulos.1) SER YO MISMO""La mayoría de las cosas que hemos logrado han sido gracias a nosotros, pero no por eso debemos de restarle crédito al apoyo que nos han dado las demás personas.Hay quienes han estado y estarán ahí para nosotros, nuestros padres, nuestros amigos o nuestra pareja, muchas veces no miramos lo que hacen por nosotros sin darnos cuenta de que sin aquello esto que conseguimos no sería posible, por el simple hecho de brindarnos un hogar, un momento de ameno o un abrazo o un beso, pueden motivarnos más de lo que necesitamos.Y el modo de agradecerles es siendo nosotros mismos, el motivo por el que nos ayudan es para nuestro bienestar, entonces debemos de ser claros ante lo que queremos, ante lo que nos gusta y disgusta, no dejar ideas al aire o crear malentendidos, es por eso que necesitamos hacer estas 5 cosas sin dudar...2) NUESTRA RELACIÓN ""10 decisiones definirán nuestra vida, y aunque no seremos conscientes de todas, el escoger a la pareja con la que pasaremos la mayor parte de nuestros años, sí es algo que depende de nosotros, es por eso que debemos de escoger con cautela qué es lo que queremos a nuestro lado, después de todo será un reflejo de lo que esperamos y anhelamos en esta vida, seamos conscientes o no de eso.Necesitamos una persona que quiera construir su futuro y que de igual manera nos ayude a construir el nuestro, una pareja será en muchas ocasiones aquella persona que aún a pesar de las circunstancias, estará con nosotros, es por eso que debemos de escoger lo más adecuado para nosotros, aquello que nos complemente en todo lo posible y que lo que nos brinde sea esperanza y motivación para continuar, no debemos de olvidar que...""3) VOY A INTENTAR CUALQUIER COSA UNA VEZ""¿Por qué no probarlo todo si sólo se recuerda una vez? Esto es algo que hay que tener en mente, todo lo que no hagamos en su momento, por desgracia no podremos hacerlo después, el disfrutar una tarde con amigos, el ver una puesta de sol, el tomar la mano de aquella persona que nos gusta... a veces son oportunidades fugaces que no sabemos si sucederán de nuevo, y eso es lo que debemos de aprovechar en todo sentido.Hay muchas cosas que nos gustan o que nos llaman la atención que no hacemos por miedo, el hablarle a personas, practicar un deporte o estudiar algo que nos apasiona, debemos de dejar de un lado los miedos o temores, sólo viviremos una vez esta vida y lo mejor que podemos hacer es aprovechar el tiempo que podamos, ser lo más felices y dichados porque al final no quedará otra cosa, sólo los recuerdos.Debemos de emprender esta aventura, no importa si es una cosa o mil cosas las que nos llaman la atención, hay que probar de todo aunque sea una vez para descubrir si es lo que queremos o lo que nos llena, estos consejos y anécdotas te ayudarán a pensar mejor en qué deberías y que no deberías de hacer, presta mucha atención...""ACERCA DEL CREADORMe llamo Miguel, y primero que nada, si llegaste a esta parte y aún estás interesado en leer quiero decir que estoy agradecido, será un gusto que conozcas un poco de mí.Tengo 19 años y soy un estudiante de la UNAM, durante los años en la escuela he aprendido demasiadas cosas acerca de ciencia, literatura, emprendimiento, problemas, entre otras cosas, también he tenido amigos de todo tipo y eso es lo que más me ha ayudado a crecer.Me defino como un ""camaleón"" al ser alguien que se puede adaptar a las circunstancias y a las personas, suelo ser alguien que le agrada a cualquier tipo de persona y dándose las circunstancias correctas puedo conseguir grandes amigos sin importar el tipo de persona con la que esté hablando, sin importar los gustos o hobbies, porque tengo un interés por todo en esta vida y me es fácil el aprender cosas nuevas.Esto es lo que quiero plasmar en lo que hago y en lo que influyo, una manera más abierta de ver la vida y de ayudar a los demás a conocer lo que quieren en la vida.Desde hace años mi interés por las matemáticas y la física era evidente, pero al entrar a la secundaría empecé a notar la psicología humana, empecé a notar cómo podía llevarme bien con las personas y se debía a que me adaptaba a ellas, entonces noté que la vida también era así, se trata de adaptarnos a nosotros mismos y después poder desenvolvernos en nuestro ambiente, porque lo mejor es encontrar aquello con lo que nos sentimos cómodos y no buscar ser algo que no somos.Estos últimos meses mi interés por los demás ha crecido y he pensado en diferentes formas de querer impulsar a las personas que pueda ""tocar"", a esto se debe este proyecto que quiero realizar y muchos otros que empezaré con el pasar del tiempo.","El mayor desafío que veo es no poder llenar las expectativas de los lectores que confíen en mí, pero tengo confianza en que conseguiré plasmar lo que quiero en todos nosotros,"

https://www.kickstarter.com/projects/wakeupretireearly/grow-the-ecogrid?ref=discovery_category_newest,wakeupretireearly/grow-the-ecogrid,"2 years ago WeirdDude and myself (unknowingly) started the beginnings of The EcoGrid. It began with building the Tiny Home. Then we branched off into Permaculture and OceanSteading. While we were exploring all that we ran across Velomobiles and NiFe (Nickel Iron) batteries... We have now been able to put together an entire ecosystem that will allow a motivated person to completely change their life almost overnight! Go from being a slave to your job, to having very little need for money after the initial infrastructure is built!We built The EcoGrid location in Cincinnati and now we have 2 people taking over that location while we expand The EcoGrid concept into Detroit (and then into the oceans) We have made several trips to Detroit to scout out neighborhoods that will suit The EcoGrid concept. We will be making our final trip up to Detroit on August 23rd (part way through this Kickstarter) so stay tuned for updates on that!Below is an explanation of the concepts behind The EcoGrid.Tiny Home = Build your own EcoModern, human habitation zone, for dirt cheap!Permaculture = Learn how to observe nature, and work with it, to build your own self sustaining, closed loop ecosystem. Grow all of your own (better than) organic foods!Velomobile = DIY, SuperEfficient electric car/bike hybrid. Use this for all your transportation needs. No need for car insurance or registration. They are cheap & easy to build and maintain!NiFe (Nickel Iron) battery = They are DIY, last between 50 to 100 years, and they are made of nonhazardous materials! They are all the battery storage you will ever need! Hook up solar, wind, or any other power source to them!OceanSteading = We will be sailing the world under wind power and explore how to set up a closed loop, self sustaining, human ecosystem on the high seas. After all... we do live on a water planet!THE WEBSITE...Check out our ""Daily Grind Blog"" on our website LetTheBossKnow.com for more details on all our plans. Please feel free to sign up for the Forums to talk with us and help build our online Ecosystem!BUDGET...The $2,500 will be used in a few ways. $2,000 will be used to finish paying off the Tiny Home and a small loan from the original land owner. After this the Tiny Home and our 2 acres in Cincinnati will be completely paid for and debt free!! Property taxes on the 2 acres are less than $120 a year, so coming up with that amount of money per year will be extremely easy :-)$500 will be used for kickstarter fees & for ""seed money"" in Detroit. We have already left for Detroit part way through the creation of this Kickstarter, so we already have the money and housing lined up for a decent amount of time. We are storing our car at a friends home in Pontiac Michigan and he will drive us to Fireweed Universe City in Detroit. We plan on using Fireweed as a base camp while we search and explore the city for a suitable building to claim Adverse Possession on. We also want to finish the Velomobile in Detroit. With the help of the biking community and the abundance of free building material in Detroit the Velomobile will turn into something really amazing!! FUTURE ECOGRID GROWTH...Cincinnati EcoGridNow that we have 2 amazing people ready and willing to help with our plans we can keep a lot of our ideas for the Cincinnati EcoGrid going. The Permaculture gardens out here will be looked after and they will expand on the Food Forest concept. Almost all materials needed to complete a vertical gardening system are already here. They will be building this inside the EarthProof greenhouses that are already here.Detroit EcoGridOnce we find a suitable abandoned building we will move right in. We will be using a legal term called ""Adverse Possession"" this will allow us to legally reside within that property. After 15 years of living this way the property legally becomes ours.We will be recreating our EcoGrid concept up there. Our plans are to expand on the EcoGrid concept. We are going to build Velomobiles and Tiny Homes out of salvaged materials, from all the ""decay"" in Detroit. Our goal is to sell these cheap to people. We are trying to help people further their lives, were not looking to ""get rich quick"". We are also thinking of setting up a ""workshop"" where people come to us to learn how they can build this lifestyle for themselves. People can also learn from our website, they can follow us as we create with our Blog! We want to empower people!OceanSteading EcoGridThe OceanSteading EcoGrid is essentially the sailboat and any sailboats that travel with us. We will be using Detroit as our base camp for OceanSteading. Once we get on the water more often we will be better suited for coming up with sustainable living concepts on water.","The Cincinnati EcoGrid This EcoGrid will be fully paid for with a successful Kickstarter! The property taxes are easily covered at under $120 a year.  We have the 2 people that have already taken our place in the Tiny Home. They are taking care of the gardens and animals and they are anxious to get more EcoGrid projects off the ground!!The Detroit EcoGrid The risk here is if the person(s) that abandoned the property decides they want the property back. Within the first 15 years we could be served an evection notice from the original property owner. We would have a month to a few months to get our projects out of that building and set them up in another abandoned building. Our plans and designs allow for easy tear down and setup, so we will be prepared for this. As times goes on we will add more permanent upgrades to the structure. This is a legal action and after 15 years of living this way, the structure legally becomes ours, we will own it. The OceanSteading EcoGridThis will be an easy goal to reach. We have found several 25ft to 30ft sailboats in Detroit for under $3,000 dollars. Once we generate enough money from our Tiny Home and Velomobile sales we will be quickly purchasing our own sailboat. This will allow us to stop using our friends sailboat. We will then be able to ride along side each other as sailing buddies, instead of being crew on his sailboat :-)",https://www.kickstarter.com/projects/wakeupretireearly/lite-lightweight-intuitive-transportation-for-ever?ref=discovery_category_newest,wakeupretireearly/lite-lightweight-intuitive-transportation-for-ever,"So we've been in Detroit for 3 months now.

Patrons can ride the M1 line from downtown Detroit up to the end of the line. They can then get off, head into the LiTe shop, and rent or purchase a LiTe so that they can continue on with sustainable transportation.Patrons will also be able to ride the LiTe straight up Woodward Ave and get off at the LiTe shop that is being created at the Innate Healing Arts Center. We will have spare batteries available for quick battery swap outs (no need to wait for your LiTe to sit and charge)With your help we can gather the money needed to finish the pedal version of the LiTe. We built it out of as much recycled parts as we could and we made sure that we could easily source these parts here in Detroit for manufacturing purposes. Now its time to start going out and buying parts that we can't easily source for free.With this project successfully funded, it will give a new hope to tens of thousands of Detroiters that rely on the public transportation system for their everyday needs!Please donate and help us bring LiTe out of the shadows and into the world!!","We have put in countless hours designing and planning the LiTe. We understand that this first edition will be a little ""rough around the edges."" We need to build this first prototype in order to make the mistakes so that we can correct them for the final consumer grade product. Winter is a perfect time to test the limits of this design and we are looking forward to this. We are well equipped to handle any design flaws that may show up."

The album is going to be a 2-disc concept album. The concept for the first disc (""Uncle Sam"") revolves around a corrupt government that keeps its people in the dark through the use of mass media and, as it is revealed, pharmaceuticals.. This leads to the second disc, ""Aunt Pharm"" and centers on the rampant use of legally prescribed drugs to help keep the general public blissfully unaware of their government's shadowy actions.Null Factor is the Electronic Industrial / EBM project developed by Dan Harvell. Null Factor formed in 1999 as a result of the dissolution of Harvell's first band, MiLLENNiA. Since 1999, Null Factor has released 6 studio albums.Previous Null Factor releases have been completely self-released. While this has helped in keeping the budgets at a minimum, quality has suffered, due to the lack of proper mastering. The funds raised during this Kickstarter campaign will go for professional mastering. This album is a large undertaking - a 2-disc concept album. Our goal is to produce this album in the most professional manner possible. Loud and proud!The album is going to be released under Checksum Recordings, which happens to be a recording label owned and operated by yours truly. However, Checksum Recordings is expanding to encompass more acts. We're not a big name label, but we're growing!","Currently, the only risk is knowing whether all the tracks to be included on the album will be written and recorded in time to reach the December 2013 deadline.  Right now, writing is almost completely finished, leaving only the recording aspect.  Since 2013 has just begun, I see no reason why this project cannot be recorded, ready for mastering in time to reach our projected release date.

I still count on ""Amazing American Cities"" to be an epic series, but I have streamlined the series to be much easier to manage. And by doing so, I have brought the costs of producing the series of photo books under control in a huge way.

We are raising funds in order to1) keep the show going by helping pay for our monthly expenses.2) buy better mics to give our listeners better quality.3) advertise to reach more people.Right now we are focused on all these things which takes a way a little from our content. With some help we wouldn't have to worry about these things and could focus exclusively on creating the most interesting adventure for our listeners. We want people of all kinds to watch our podcast not just dungeons and dragons fans, and we think most of those people will find our podcast funny. our website","Two of us are college freshman, two of us are high school seniors, and one of us is a high school sophomore, so finding time we all have free is difficult. We are paying a monthly fee to keep our website, and our hosting site up. We do not have any fancy mics, and right now we can not really promote ourselves the way we want. Right now we schedule times to record together so we don't need to use as many mics. We are also splitting the monthly fees out of our pockets, but we can continue for about a year, and we are currently using social media to the best of our ability to gain followers and listeners.

We want to add a new podcast where we will be able to do a much more wide variety of comedy, and therefore be able to reach more people. It would be a cleaner more relatable podcast than our current one. We would answer advice and questions in a fun light way.

https://www.kickstarter.com/projects/palmerorgonite/garrick-foods-teji-sauce?ref=discovery_category_newest,palmerorgonite/garrick-foods-teji-sauce,"For the past 3 years of my life I have been making Teji Sauce from a recipe I found and completely altered. Since then I have harbored inhibitions to market, produce, and sell this wonderful sauce. Everyone and their mother, mine excluded, has fallen in love with Teji Sauce the moment it touches their tongue. The aim of this project is to provide a zesty alternative sauce that can garnish any dish and that is friendly to the vegan, gluten-free, and health contentious palate.But to make this happen and to share Teji Sauce with the world (starting with a local Farmers Market), I obviously need some assistance. Official bottles, labels, and general funding to get this project off it's feet is why I'm reaching out to you -- any assistance is greatly appreciated.All I desire is to make my long term goal come true and to start a local business of my own with this as the spearhead product. After this I have other products to sell with other ideas on how to do it.Disclaimer: I have a business license already, which is known as Garrick Foods, but there is much more I need to do just to set up a stall at my local Farmers Market. I truly appreciate you taking the time to read this. ","The most recent challenge I have overcome is registering as the Sole Proprietor of Garrick Foods. From here, I require funding to fully market, produce, and sell my product Teji Sauce, and future products hereafter. My risks are minimal, as I have an established job of my own to provide for my basic wants and needs. This is my dream, but I will not rush into it recklessly. My bases are covered, but my stage is dark and unknown. Where this will go? I can't say, I can only aim for what is right in front of me, and at this time that is the all too realistic concern of financing the initial stages of my dream.",https://www.kickstarter.com/projects/palmerorgonite/palmer-orgonite-kickstarter?ref=discovery_category_newest,palmerorgonite/palmer-orgonite-kickstarter,"Several months ago a friend of mine mentioned to me the idea of Orgonite as a potential EMF Protection idea. This intrigued me, as I had recently learned of the potential dangers of EMF waves, and so I began looking into and learning about Orgonite and its origins. One of the first things I did was look into the Orgonite being sold on sites such as Amazon and Etsy. At first glance I was confused; why were people making Orgonite and charging ridiculous prices for it if it was primarily a form of protection meant to bring wellness and benefit to others' lives? Then at second glance I thought, well if they can make Orgonite then so can I. So I learned what basic materials I needed and purchased them. Shortly after I had finished my first Orgone creations; some small TBs that looked like solid scrap metal and had aluminum poking out from the bottom. Needless to say it was an interesting start, but it was a start, and soon I began experimenting with what I could do with the resin while keeping the metals and quartz still inside to power the Orgone properties of the pieces I made.It took a few months of experimentation, an embarrassing amount of resin, and a box full of test pieces, but I have discovered quite a few combinations that I genuinely enjoy creating. I must say one of the most beautiful aspects of this artistic expression is that it is limitless; that I can do anything I want with it and can create many more amazing and wonderful pieces that can both function as a useful device protecting from EMF radiation while also looking quite fantastic and unique.Here’s the kicker though, Resin alone is expensive; and when you combine that with the costs of everything else involved it becomes a bit daunting but still perfectly feasible, on a small scale. It can be a fun hobby, but it has the potential to be more. With a larger workspace, a steady supply of materials, and a few helping hands (as well as new ideas), it could become a successful small business venture.Orgonite is not a mainstream material. There are many reasons for that but none are legitimate enough to keep those with a passion for it from turning it into a decently sized small business. If you could produce large quantities of it, market it properly, and sell it at a reasonable (as in cheap and affordable) price, then it could become something more than it is. Right now it’s a curiosity that few are aware of outside of the crystal healing and conspiracy theorist communities. So let’s run a scenario with what I can imagine I would do with all the materials, workspace, and help I could ever desire. I would find a location first, possibly a small warehouse or building that could be easily converted into an Orgonite producing location with plenty of ventilation and storage space. Then I would find an industrial supplier for resin, and maybe work out a deal with one of the metal shops in the area to obtain scrap metal for free or cheap. Or if I had to I would order that in bulk from a supplier as well. Then I would order the remainder of my materials in bulk, set up the workbenches and storage units I would need, such as simple closets and boxes that the mold trays could be laid in so that dust and other such debris wouldn’t come in contact with the Orgonite while it was hardening. Then I would enlist the aid of about three to five others, maybe more or less depending on the initial workload. Then of course I can’t leave out the business license.Now, before all of this took place it would be wise to market the Orgonite pieces to local arts and crafts shops, local natural healing stores, and offer it all online through markets such as Etsy, a Store Website, Ebay, Amazon, Craigslist, and other craft selling websites. General advertising locally and online would take place, such as paying for Google Ads and such.Over time, should the venture prove successful, me and whoever was working with me on it would be able to purchase or rent a small location to open up an Orgonite selling shop of our own, marketing Orgonite and whatever other items we may be crafting and selling by that time. Should the venture prove very successful I can visualize incorporating other such crafts into the fold for selling such as Resin Art, Glass Art, and Pottery Crafting. I would have to find those willing and capable to craft such items of course, but that would be a bridge to cross should the town ever be built.But let’s not get ahead of ourselves here. I currently don’t have the time nor the commitment required to turn this into an enterprising small business overnight. Instead I would like to start with a humble and small beginning; with a simple expansion of stock, an expanded clientele, and a decent amount of paid advertising to get Palmer Orgonite out of its shadow of ignorance and into the market proper. For that I need roughly $500, which is truthfully nothing large. More is always better, and any amount will help me to produce and promote my products in larger quantities and with better quality than I am currently capable of doing. I have many ideas for new projects that I have yet to enact due to financial restraints. These include pieces such as True Good Luck Orgonite Talismans, Orgonite Pyramids, Gem Filled Epoxy Resin Orgonite Pieces, and many others that are simply beyond my current financial capabilities to afford the materials for. To conclude and summarize this: I desire to turn this into more than a simple hobby, and I need help and money to do so. My aim is simple; I wish to craft unique, wonderful, and artistic Orgonite Pieces and sell them for cheap and reasonable prices to allow others to benefit from their effects both physically and ascetically. I have no custom order discrimination and always open to new ideas and new requests for Orgonite pieces.Thank you for your time,Colton Palmer","One of the greatest challenges I can envision is proper and efficient marketing. This is something I can and will tackle with my entire skillset, but I fear I will need the assistance of others to produce 100% or more effective and positive results. My plan to tackle this would be to do the best I can possibly do alone while searching for someone or someones who can assist me in doing it better.The second greatest issue I can see is accounting. I have little experience in this area but am willing and able to learn everything I need to to perform it effectively. However I suspect that I will need assistance from someone else in order to most fully tackle this issue. So I would do what I could while searching for assistance.The third greatest issue is securing business contracts with retailers who can sell the Orgonite Pieces. This is the area where I may need the most help, as I am best at Soft Selling involving customer satisfaction, but I am less skillful at Hard Selling involving business contracts and term agreements. I would most certainly require a salesman of sorts for this issue."

Involucrarse en el proyecto significará formar parte de la historia que marcaremos.,Necesitamos financiación para poder sacar adelante la primera temporada entera debido a que pese a que al público le ha encantado no ha tenido el suficiente empuje como para llegar a más gente y que podamos permitirnos el rodar el resto de capítulos. Una financiación positiva podría permitirnos el desarrollo completo de la primera temporada y comenzar a desarrollar la segunda.

Sarawut is a young Bangkok artist that uses empathy to connect with his chosen subject’s emotion. This connection allows Sarawut to create his unique style of expressionistic work of art.  His Avant Garde attitude has produced a new style of painting that he coined “Living Art”. Just like the working class subject in his work, the actual painting itself has a life span of 35 to 50 years, as times passes, the corrosive rust in which he mixes in his delivery eats away the painting and causing it to crack and flake. The self-destructiveness of his work is a reflection of the society that destroys the working class lives. Sarawut do not wish his painting to last forever, but to die away as his subject will . . . and be forgotten by society that these workers help built. The wonderful process of seeing this “living art” painting slowly “dies” is a new twist to the standard of what art should be.“Why should my painting last forever… if the subject in my painting are slowly dying of oppression and depression? . . . . My art will die just like my subject will.”  - SarawutThe heavy brush stroke of thick oil paint mixed with toxic elements and rust that is painted on canvas slowly eats away the canvas and the oil pigment. The long natural process of living art will change the painting through the passage of time.“As my painting aged, the rust will eat and chip away the pigments…. And the final result is a wonderful cracking leather-like dead canvas….” - SarawutThe process of creating this “Living Art” series is toxic to the artist’s health, as a result Sarawat cannot continue with this series any longer. There are 12 pieces (oil/mixed medium) to this limited collection series and a must see.I am David C., Sarawut Thaichuai acting manager. Sarawut is a talented artist in a country that traditionally, does not support art. Especially when the art challenges the elite's establishment.The money from the pledge will go toward marketing Sarawut future exhibition. I will connect Sarawut with local art gallery and link him with online present.Thank you so much for your support!","The challenge is to limited the cost of marketing expense.

I am not an imigrant, nor were my parents or grandparents. I am Jewish, but have no direct family connections to the Holocaust. To look through the teen section of any library or book store, you would think that no teens like me ever existed. Being Jewish was a part of my every day life as a teen, but rarely a source of conflict. The same is true for so many people who belong to cultural minorities in Canada. In one story I wrote, I got asked why I made the character Japanese, even though the story has nothing to do with the fact that the family is Japanese. I say, why not? There is a growing demand for books that portray diversity in North America as it actually is. Where diversity is there all the time. Sometimes it causes conflict, and sometimes it doesn't. High schools are not all filled with generic white or black people who all celebrate Christmas.Faith and Rainbows in a novel about a teenager who has lived her life in fear of the unknown, of taking risks. She doesn't dare do anything to make herself stand out for fear of what bullies might do. Yes, she is Jewish, but she is also a teen trying to find her own way of making the transition from child to adult and survive the hell that is high school. This is something that all Canadian teens must face, not just the generic white kids.Our heritage is who we are, not a problem to be solved.Here's a glimpse into the book:It was during lunch recess that Cody made his appearance. I sat in the same place under Joseph that I had during morning recess. Dressed in jeans, a white T-shirt, and a denim jacket, he approached me with a clear purpose in mind. He did not hesitate to sit right beside me, so close that we were almost touching. I did not look at him.“What’s your name?” Cody asked.Fearing that he was a bully, and that ignoring him would make him angry, I said, “Chava.”“You’re new here, aren’t you? I’ve never seen you before.”	I nodded, though I still couldn’t bring myself to look at him. Here I was, a smaller-than-normal six-year-old, sitting next to this oversized eleven-year-old, and no idea why he would be the slightest bit interested in talking to me. As far as I could tell, he was nothing more than a bully. So I had to be careful not to make him angry.“My name is Cody. Is everything all right? You look scared.”	I nodded again, emphatically this time.	“Are you afraid of the other kids?”	“Uh huh.” I said it without any hesitation. Before that moment, I hadn’t realized just how scared I was. I couldn’t pick out any one real reason I should be afraid. I just was.	“Why?” Cody asked.	I shrugged, squeezing my legs even tighter than I already had been. There was no better answer I could give him. Are we really that self-aware when we’re only six?	Cody leaned closer to me. Every muscle in my body tensed. I doubt I could have moved if I’d tried. 	In my ear, Cody whispered, “You’re right to be afraid of them, you know. Lots of kids are mean and nasty. There’s no way of telling the nice ones from the mean ones. You stick close to me, though. I’ll protect you from whatever they throw at you.”	“Protect?”Of course I knew what the word meant. Mom and Dad used it all the time when they explained why we used seat belts in the car, potholders in the kitchen, and lights at the crosswalk. Except, I knew how I could get hurt if I didn’t have those things to protect me. Everyone knew how dangerous it could be to cross the street without paying attention to the lights.“You are far better off staying away from other kids. Avoid talking to them as much as possible. Only talk to them when you don’t have any other choice. And don’t even think about playing with them.”	“But--” As scared as I was, it was hard to imagine it could be as bad as all that. These kids couldn’t really hurt me, could they?	“They don’t want to play with you,” Cody said, more forcefully than before. He then put a protective arm around me. I didn’t even think about trying to get away. I wanted him to keep me safe. “You stay with me, though. I’ll help you learn what is safe and protect you from what isn’t.”","The biggest challenge I face is in promoting the book. However, the local independent book store is always happy to carry the books of any local author, including those who have self-published. In addition to this, I plan to sell the book at a variety of events, such as craft fairs and farmers'/artisans' markets.",https://www.kickstarter.com/projects/1630069751/faith-and-rainbows?ref=discovery_category_newest,1630069751/faith-and-rainbows,"There is so much more awareness and acceptance of mental illness these days. I see it every day in my personal and professional life. The teachers and assistants I work with want to understand how best to help the children they are responsible for, in a way that works for each student. We can go to all kinds of professional development workshops to learn various strategies. But all the training in the world does not replace first-hand experience. It is also well known that teenagers want to read books in which they can see themselves. While I loved to read when I was in high school, I never saw books that effectively addressed social anxiety. The only place I saw a character that effectively reflected how I felt was not in a book but in Star Trek The Next Generation.Faith and Rainbows is part ficton and part memoir. There are three things I hope to achieve by publishing this book. One is to give educators a look inside the mind of an intensely anxious person. The second  is to show teenagers that we all feel this was sometimes and we can learn to control our fears. The third is one that is often discussed in casting for film and television. Unless the plot specifically centres around culture, race, or religion, protagonists are often generic white people with little or no religious affiliation. I am Jewish, and since this book is part memoir, Chava, my main character, also is. Minorities' stories and experiences are flavoured by the fact that they belong to that cultural group, but are not always centred around the fact that they are Jewish or Syrian or whatever cultural group they belong to. ","Being a very anxious person, there is always the chance that when I am face to face with potential readers, anxiety can get the better of me. However, I have lots of support in my life to help me face it with strength and courage. Getting paperbacks into the schools may prove challenging. However, I do work in one school board and have connections in others. I also know people who work in the mental health services of my region who may be willing to help promote the book."
https://www.kickstarter.com/projects/Sujewa/how-to-attract-weird-people-feature-length-comedy?ref=discovery_category_newest,Sujewa/how-to-attract-weird-people-feature-length-comedy,"(we will have a video in the near future, fear not fans of that audio visual format)This movie is about a couple in NYC, plus some other people, who are looking for ""weird"" romantic partners. Are they bored with their current partners? Or are they just bored with their lives and themselves in general? Why the need for unusual people as romantic partners? And what's ""weird"" anyway? What's ""normal"" in 2016 in NYC? All of these burning questions (no doubt for some people :) )will be answered in the movie. The script is very funny. Also reflects some of the more uncomfortable aspects of modern life and modern romance. The Village Voice said about my previous movie Breakthrough Weekend that it ""has audacity and poker-faced wit on its side; its wayward pacing and peculiar rhythms recall early Jim Jarmusch, though it has a New York–centric spirit all its own."" And that ""Ekanayake's deadpan approach makes every event seem comically reasonable, especially for New York, a place that's much, much stranger than paradise."" You can expect much of the same in this movie, and perhaps more, and perhaps done better, since I learn and grow as a filmmaker with each movie I make.The film will have a multi-ethnic cast, and a multi-ethnic crew. Diversity in filmmaking has always been important to me. I am in light talks with some great actors (who have appeared in award winning indie movies) about acting in this project. Most likely, prior to the end of this crowdfunding project, we will be able to announce the cast.As I discovered by making Breakthrough Weekend in NYC, this is an amazingly beautiful, very cinematic city. Weird People will celebrate that beauty by capturing great images of the city - so the film should be a treat for fans of NYC.Comedy is important to me because life can be difficult and comedy offers a nice escape from it. And indie filmmaking is important to me because indie films are art and making art with others is a good thing to do with one's time. And making and releasing movies is a great way to try to add my voice to the conversation happening in the world (usually mostly just on some films blogs or sites and social media pages, but, nevertheless, out in the world :) ) and offer some optimistic, humane, positive alternatives for things and similar positive views on things. By things I mostly mean the troubles of life caused by how we deal with other people. And, at the end of the day, trying to make something fun and perhaps, in some small way at least, meaningful and useful that can be shared with the world is a great challenge - so here we are starting on a new movie.Join me on this journey (even though typically I cringe when I hear people describe any media project as a journey :) - but, making a movie is kind of a long adventure - so yeah, it'll be a journey). Let's make a fun, funny, kind of weird (no doubt) movie about people looking for weird romantic partners in NYC.

It has been published continuously since March2000. Vestal Review is a semi-annual perfect-bound print magazine with a Webpresence, devoted to flash (or short-short) stories. A good flash, replete witha cohesive plot, rich language and enticing imagery, is perhaps the hardesttype of fiction to write due to its brevity. A good flash is so condensed thatit borderlines narrative poetry. Flash is a story for today’s reader who has notime for anything else. Reader, you have time for this.Vestal Review's website.Vestal Review pays its authors professional rates of 3 - 10cents a word plus a contributor's copy while keeping Web issues of the magazinefree to the reader. To celebrate the 13th anniversary of Vestal Review, this project seeks funding for the next issue of the magazine with 13 best flash fiction stories you could find (instead of usual 8). We will double the honorarium to the authors for that issue and also pay bonuses to our hard-working volunteer editors. The Web issue will be available in February 2013 and the print issue in March. Vestal Review is an eclectic magazine, open to all genres except children'sstories and hard science fiction. We are blessed with a deluge of submissionsand therefore are very selective. Our contributors include Steve Almond,Katharine Weber, Mike Resnick, Aimee Bender, Sam Lipsyte, Kirk Nesset, JudithCofer, Bruce Boston, Robert Boswell, Bruce Holland Rogers, Michelle Richmond,Liz Rosenberg, Stuart Dybek, Robert Olen Butler and Pamela Painter. We are anofficial Pushcart-nominating press. Our stories have been reprinted in TheMammoth Book of Minuscule Fiction, Flash Writing, E2Ink anthologies, and havebeen printed in the WW Norton anthology Flash Fiction Forward. Vestal Reviewwas featured on NPR in 2004, and is a recipient of the Broome Council of theArts grant.

Our next issue will be lavishly special and will include substantial achievement awards for outstanding stories in addition to our regular material.But what is flash fiction?At the turn of the century—this century—flash fiction was anunderrepresented genre of literature. Hardly anyone wrote it and hardly anybodypublished it. It remained pretty much unknown to the public, except perhaps forHemingway’s famously concise Baby Shoes for Sale.Yet it has always been an extremely attractive genre: succulent,energetic and immensely creative in spite, or maybe because, of the confines of arigid frame—a word count limit.So back in the year 2000, we decided to give flash a dedicated voice, a newmagazine, Vestal Review. Today, almost 14 years later, hundreds of magazinespublish flash and many of them specialize in it. There are flash fictionanthologies, flash fiction contests, flash fiction readings. That’s a flashfiction revolution, folks, and Vestal Review contributed to it mightily. The Vestal Review is an awesome literary journal, one that does thework of angels when it comes to short short fiction. A national treasure. Findit. Read it. Now.-Steve AlmondVestal Review needs to raise $500 to cover ourprinting and illustrator as well as the awards cost for the lavish anniversary issue.

https://www.kickstarter.com/projects/bobkalk/framing-2020?ref=discovery_category_newest,bobkalk/framing-2020,"Think about the behaviors we witness today in light of the words penned by James Freeman Clarke in 1870. He said:“A politician thinks of the next election. A statesman, of the next generation.""Statesmanship has long been eclipsed by hyper-partisan behaviors driven by monied interests. These exert wildly disproportionate political pressures that dwarf the will of the electorate. Instead of working, in accordance with the first constitutional imperative, to build “a more perfect union,” many politicians promote division by derision.I was born and raised inside the Washington Beltway. For most of my adult life I've been disappointed in the way political campaigns are conducted and elections won. I'm pretty sure these feelings are shared by most of you. I'm also certain that I'm not the only voter framing a 2020 vision, one that is more concerned with our shared interests than it has been in the past. Personally, I want to be a voter focused on the issues and not the excessive prominence of a few personalities.Ever since I was old enough to vote, I have been either a registered independent or unaffiliated with either of the two major political parties. And, as special interests tend to align themselves with the Republican or the Democratic agenda, I have been able to avoid the kind of selective outrage, and the tribal epistemology, that tends to reduce every issue to a binary choice. As I am now in my late 60s, I've come to believe that no significant amount of lift is produced at the wing tips.It is also my fervent belief that it's important for the general electorate to take responsibility for focusing our representatives, and to frame the public debates as we move forward. The Scope and Sequence document reveals a set of annotated talking points that are further developed in the book.For more detail, you will be able to read a Scope and Sequence document at www.Framing2020.comI plan to use Book Baby to make the book available as a 99 cent download via Amazon, Apple Books, Google Play, and other channels. I also plan to use CD Baby to make the audio version available, about sixty days later, and selling through Audible, iTunes, and Google Play at prices that are set by those distributors. I am hoping to raise three thousand, five hundred dollars to cover publication costs, web hosting, and some promotional activity in advance of the primary season. If this campaign exceeds the goal, I will use the additional funds to pay for more advertising and other promotional activities that will get this work into the hands of candidates, media pundits, and others with influence.Those backers contributing twenty-five dollars or more will receive an advance copy at the uncorrected proof stage, an advance audio copy, and login credentials so they may be instrumental in structuring a new online debate forum. Through this forum, Framing 2022 and beyond will truly become crowd sourced.We need to raise the level of political discourse in this country so that it is commensurate with the spiritual, intellectual, and societal development of our citizenry and for the benefit of our children's children's children.","Any time we use real world examples in an exposé, such as Framing 2020, we open ourselves to potential liability from those who take the brunt of any criticism. For example, net-neutrality is the most important First Amendment issue of our time. There is no way to confront the true enemies of net-neutrality without calling out some very large corporations. The most time consuming part of producing a book like this, is the verification. I am fully engaged in the appropriate due-diligence.On another front, although most of what I intend to use is either original with me, or believed to be in the public domain, I would like to include some graphics and quotes that may require licensing. During the time the book is in the proof-reading phase, I will be negotiating to use a limited amount of copyrighted material.",https://www.kickstarter.com/projects/bobkalk/democracy-identification-friend-foe-iff?ref=discovery_category_newest,bobkalk/democracy-identification-friend-foe-iff,"We have launched this campaign to help cover certain costs associated with printing and mailing our popular Democracy - Identification Friend/Foe (IFF) postcard. When we would hand these out at polling locations during the primaries, people would ask for extra copies.The campaign video provides a brief introduction to the thinking behind the IFF Quick Reference while Episode 5 of the Framing 2020 podcast provides an in depth description of how the IFF relates, to the Preamble of the United States Constitution, beginning at timecode [36:49]. That section of the podcast is titled: OODA Loops and the IFF - A cultural adaptation of the Identification Friend/Foe system.In addition to the quick reference mailing, we hope the funding will help defray the cost of ongoing efforts to distribute Framing 2020 highlights (postcards) and transcripts (PDFs) to staffers within the legislative, executive, and judicial branches of federal, state, and local governments. We are also reaching out to influential people within the press to help raise the level of political discourse without becoming mired in the sophistries of excessively prominent, hyper-partisan career politicians.The focus of the Framing 2020 podcast (www.Framing2020.com) is on comparing and contrasting partisanship and statesmanship, together with the features of authentic versus inauthentic democracies. It is a free briefing, presented without advertising, for a demographic that includes independent and undecided voters. To date, we have published six episodes of the eight part series. The seventh episode is currently in production and scheduled to publish during the first week of October with the eighth episode dropping in late December.Two companion websites will be used to foster and maintain ongoing discussions about how to break a stranglehold the oligarchy currently has on struggling democracies across the globe. These discussions will be hosted at:EOBC1st www.EOBC1st.organdIntentional Consumerism www.IntentionalConsumerism.orgIn January of 2021, the sequel to Framing 2020 will be titled Roaring Twenties Reprise. The transcript for the new podcast's introduction is available at: www.RoaringTwentiesReprise.orgAny funds remaining after the covering the printing and postage for the October mailings will be used in the launch for Roaring Twenties Reprise.","Mailing instructional and promotional material in envelopes has not worked well for us. The postcard format no only allows the recipient to determine the relevance without having to open anything, it is also not perceived as a potential threat that would be delayed while it is scanned for toxic substances.

My first poem book, ""Rays of Sunshine from the Hood"" was very costly to produce in terms of advertising, and I could not afford a editor. Thus, my first book was a challenge to produce. My new book, which is not yet titled, will be themed around the summer time, and all the strange things thata young black urbanite has to endure and go through during that time of the year. I decided to write about this time of the year because it seems as if crazy things happen during hot summers. Topics of the poems will range from spirituality, strange dreams, love, lost, crime, and matters of the heart. I may decide to publish this book through an independent agency, and as such, this could prove to be very expensive.This book probably will also need some editorial work as well, so more than likely I will also need to hire an editor, and I probably will need to pay for reviews. Please check out the perks that you will receive for supporting me. such as receiving a free copy if you donate over $35 (up until the first 10 supporters), and possibly other rewards.Impact on the CommunityThis book will expose the reality and strangeness of ghetto life to the masses, which will promote understanding between different cultures and people from varyingsocio-economic backgrounds. I intend for this book to invoke joy, pain, laughter, andcuriosity. Topics range fromspirituality, dreams, crime, corruption, and loss.

I was a musician under the name, SYNICAL, for a while and it felt like I wasn’t connected the story or the characters in it anymore. I wanted to make it a more personal story. A story of self-acceptance, a story of becoming who I want to be, despite what others think. Music is what I love to do, and it’s what I want to do for my job, it’s my passion.The album has been written and contains 14 songs, however this is subject to change so I don’t want to post a tracklist without being 100% certain on them. I will continue to write songs through the kickstarters lifetime.Infinite is a symbolic representation of any emotion. Pain = Infinite, love = infinite and so on. It’s a feeling of never getting over an emotion, no matter how dark or how light it feels.I want to make a project I feel like I need to make, with songs I feel like I need to sing. And that’s what I plan to do, and with your help, my dream project can come true.","Delays - A rushed album is never a great album, so if the album doesn’t feel finished to me, it won’t feel finished to anyone else either. There is a chance the project could be delayed depending on the recording and mastering of songs. This won’t be a overly long delay, but it could be a delay nonetheless.Marketing - Marketing material will need to be made for the album, which could mean a lot of money going into just the artwork and editing alone, meaning less for the marketing promotions themselves. They will be mainly social media promotion.",https://www.kickstarter.com/projects/callum-self/reality-hip-hop-album?ref=discovery_category_newest,callum-self/reality-hip-hop-album,"When I started writing Infinite, the original version of this album, I realised a common theme. Privacy Issues, Technology and Morality were extremely on my mind and it's fuel I used to change the albums tone and make it one that's dark and deep.The thing is, everything is right at our door now. Food, Gifts, Danger. Social Media and the internet is both a great invention, and our worst enemy.Reality is really about the question; What is Reality? Do we even know it anymore? Is a personal conception? Maybe, but its scary.THIS KICKSTARTER IS NOT FOR THE ALBUM ITSELF, JUST PRODUCTION OF CD AND MERCH.","Challenges: The album is a work in progress and the progress could halt suddenly due to any number of issues; Songs added or changed or even deleted, lack of time to create the music. But it will be definitely made."

I want to get this off the ground this year. Being the editor and poet myself, I began Oddball Magazine in 1998 after a dream I had. I just wanted to relate to people who were like me. As I grew up I was diagnosed with manic depression. Since then, my mind has been a gift and a curse. I write all the time, and Oddball has been my saving grace. I found a purpose with Oddball. We have constant updated content every day, we have different columns that relate to many different people.As for Oddball Magazine, it is a amazing online soapbox for poets, writers, artists and musicians.

But more recently I feel I have homed in on my own style and approach to painting, combining my love of painting and drawing and also landscape and figure through a process I call representation and erasure. I use a method of representation and erasure to create a visual tension between figure/landscape and depth/flatness representation/attraction. Im working hard and treating this as my full time job, even though its tough in the beginning I am going to pursue my passion for painting and im aiming to eventually build up enough work for a solo exhibition.",I use a wide range of materials in my practice from acrylic paint and spray paint to oil bar and charcoal. I also paint mainly large scale from 40x40in to 100x100in. I will carefully consider the costs of my materials for this project but at the same time try to not feel restricted in what I can achieve due to being on a budget.

Each character is given a line that changes paths according to when that character is introduced, interacts with other characters or is killed. Numerous hours were spent painstakingly identifying when exactly each character was introduced into their respective groups and hours more can be spent examining this unique graphic representation of the social progression of The Walking Dead.Each poster will be printed on high quality gloss poster paper at a full 24""x 36"" size to ensure maximum readablity of all text and imagery. Posters will be shipped in hard tubes to guarantee a safe journey to your doorstep.",Ive spent the last few weeks working on this poster and now that it is complete i just need enough interest and backing to place a large enough order with the printer.

My name is Michael Watts and i am a graphic design student at Old Dominion University in Norfolk VA. Now that I'm out of school for the summer i finally have some time to work on some of my own personal projects, one of which being this series of posters featuring vintage cameras. Each poster features a different classic camera body laid over top of a collage of vintage photography related advertisements and imagery. Each print is sized 13x13 and will be printed on high quality woven canvas from the Red River Paper Company. In addition to the actual prints, other rewards include PDF files, glossy vinyl stickers, and white cotton to shirts. Thank you for checking out my project and i hope you all enjoy these designs!","This is a relatively low risk project considering that most of the printing will be done by me personally and only the production of the t shirts will be outsourced.  The only undetermined factor will how long it takes to acquire the required materials upon the funding of the project, though I am very confident that there will be no problem fulfilling orders within the estimated time."

Or at least we hope to be, but in order to do that we need your help. Before getting into what we need from you though, let us tell you what it is we're hoping you will eventually get from us.For the majority of our lives we have been deeply in love with sports, and like most sports lovers, we love to talk about sports. Fortunately, we both realized there could be more to this than just our usual discussions among friends.What if there was a way we could interact with fans like us, but on a much larger scale? Where we could do what we love for people who love the same thing.Which is why we teamed up and decided we wanted to create a way to take our love of good-ol'-fashioned sports discussions and debates and reach many others like us. Thus, Cheap Seat Chatter was born, or at least the idea.We wish we knew of a great, detailed way to describe to you exactly what it is we'll be bringing you on the show, but that's not how our show will work. Like sports, discussions about them are unpredictable. So it's probably best you just tune in and see it for yourself. We promise at the very least you'll be entertained, and maybe you just might learn a few things too.We've already put in enough of our own money to buy microphones and some basic filming equipment to use, but with our bills and responsibilities we don't quite have the means to get everything we need on our own. This is where you come in! With the help of you all, and your donations, we can get the rest of what we need to get this show on the road (literally).Your money would go towards video-editing software, online advertising, professional logo design, any other equipment we may need and if any money is left over, merchandise for all who would be interested.As of right now there are three of us on the Cheap Seat Chatter team. We each bring very specific and necessary skills to help make this show a success, as well as the love and knowledge of sports that will fuel it.Ben has a degree in sports journalism from The University of Alabama and two years experience in online sports writing and content production. He will be one of the two hosts of the show and responsible for finances.Will has a background in multiple sports, both playing and coaching, on the high school level. He will be one of the hosts of the show and responsible for social media interaction.Shawn has a degree and photography and videography from The University of Alabama and professional experience in both. He will be in charge of editing and making sure the shows are ready to be seen by you great supporters.Each of us on the team are willing to put our skills and time to good use in order to help make this show entertaining, interesting and fun.If we are successful with this funding project then the show should be ready to start filming by mid-December. That would mean we would be ready to start airing episodes twice a week on YouTube by the start of 2019.We appreciate you taking the time to read over our project and we hope you consider donating. Every donation gets us closer to making our dream into a reality. For all of you sports fans out there, look at it this way. You have a chance to join in on a brand-new franchise. It might be slow going at first, but just think of how sweet it'll be once that new team becomes the best out there.Follow us on Twitter: @CheapSeatChats","The biggest risk to this project is simply lack of funds.

This is a Batman fan film that follows the story of twenty-two year old, Benjamin Wayne.Benjamin always believed that he was destined to become the cultural icon known as ""Batman"" because of his name. It was the death of his parents at the age of 10 that solidified that ideal. He studied, participated in martial arts, and suffered ridicule for years to be up to par with the iconic ""Bruce Wayne"". Now at age twenty-two, he dons the cape and cowl to protect the streets. The only problem is that he is neither Bruce nor Batman, he is simply a Wayne.These films will delve into Benjamin's character and how his child-like ideals of becoming a superhero will lead to real conflicts with devastating consequences. In his quest to become the Dark Knight, Benjamin will get himself mixed up in situations that can yield death and destruction. Beyond physical, Benjamin's greatest trial will be an emotional one, and that is: No matter how much he tries to convince himself, Benjamin Wayne is not the fictional comic-book character ""Bruce Wayne.""Even though we are bringing our own characters into this story, this will very much feel like a Batman film drawing inspiration from Nolan's Dark Knight trilogy as well as Burton's films. Benjamin Wayne's character is obviously mirroring Batman's in this series; however, in addition, we are bringing other characters in that mirror other popular DC Characters as well. As to who they are, that will be up to you to discover!Two years ago, Konnor Tierney and Riley Hendrickson of the would-be ""Alitheia Cinematics"" picked up a camera and shot a short with one of our current actors and co-founders, Mathias Kluemke. One year later, the crew came back together to produce school projects and recreational videos that would become the foundation of experience needed to create our later projects. Fast-forward to present and we are a formidable group with a lot of talent and, of course, a passion for film-making.All of us have always been very big superhero fans, especially Batman fans! Now that we have grown more mature and more organized, we want to move on to a more serious and mature project, and thus, ""Wayne"" was born!We will be spending the funds we receive on authentic, but original, costumes and more professional equipment to produce one of the best Batman fan-films out there! And speaking of funds... Here are some designs for the custom T-Shirts only available through donation rewards.We are very happy to get started on this project. We are long time fans of Batman and that is why we want to do this series! This is completely non-profit and strictly for our own enjoyment as well as for the entertainment of the entire Batman fan-base!With this project we are able to reach out into one of the most popular fan-bases out there while still maintaining our own original content and characters. We hope that both Batman fans and new fans will enjoy this project for its strong story and quality. This is something that we have wanted to do for a long time and we appreciate the support of all of our friends and crew members. Thank YOU for your support. Come on guys! Let's make this happen!If you have any questions about the project or anything else (Or if you just want to pick one of those T-Shirt designs!) email our lead creative Director, Konnor Tierney, here:konnor.t96@gmail.comThank you!","Right now one of our biggest challenges is the funding necessary to tackle a project of this caliber.

I expect to finish the book sometime in late february 2016. The book will be sold on Amazon.com in, both, print and digital formats as soon as the design process is finished.I photographed the model and I'm retouching the photographs digitally. I'm also designing the book, the book's cover, and writing the text that will be added to the book describing some of the behind-the-scenes facts of the book.","This is my fourth art nude photography book. Prior to this book I published the Releasing the Nudes series, which is a series of 3 books featuring my work in art nude photography: Releasing the Nudes Part 1, Releasing the Nudes Part 2 and Releasing the Nudes Part 3. All three of them are available on print and digital formats on Amazon.com by author Victor Hernandez. In fact, the model for this new book is the cover model for Releasing the Nudes Part 3.My main obstacle right now is not being able to concentrate on the book because of my living expenses. The book was planned for 2011 or 2012 at the latest, but I had to put everything on hold because I had to pay rent first. But if that is taken care of through a kickstarter campaign, I can concentrate full-time on the book and plan for another art nude photography book.I own the rights to the photographs and to the book, so there's no need to get any more permissions for selling it on amazon.com. The only thing I need is the time to work on it. But unless I have funding for this project, I won't be able to have the time for it, as I will have to use my time doing other things to fund my living expenses.Thus, your contributions to my project will allow me to finish this project as quickly as possible.I encourage you to look for my Releasing the Nudes books on Amazon and see for yourselves the quality of my work.

I expect to finish the book sometime in late february 2016. The book will be sold on Amazon.com in, both, print and digital formats as soon as the design process is finished.I photographed the model and I'm retouching the photographs digitally. I'm also designing the book, the book's cover, and writing the text that will be added to the book describing some of the behind-the-scenes facts of the book.","This is my fourth art nude photography book. Prior to this book I published the Releasing the Nudes series, which is a series of 3 books featuring my work in art nude photography: Releasing the Nudes Part 1, Releasing the Nudes Part 2 and Releasing the Nudes Part 3. All three of them are available on print and digital formats on Amazon.com by author Victor Hernandez. In fact, the model for this new book is the cover model for Releasing the Nudes Part 3.My main obstacle right now is not being able to concentrate on the book because of my living expenses. The book was planned for 2011 or 2012 at the latest, but I had to put everything on hold because I had to pay rent first. But if that is taken care of through a kickstarter campaign, I can concentrate full-time on the book and plan for another art nude photography book.I own the rights to the photographs and to the book, so there's no need to get any more permissions for selling it on amazon.com. The only thing I need is the time to work on it. But unless I have funding for this project, I won't be able to have the time for it, as I will have to use my time doing other things to fund my living expenses.Thus, your contributions to my project will allow me to finish this project as quickly as possible.A quick parenthesis: I published this project on Kickstarter two weeks ago with a goal of 3000 dollars. It didn't succeed. It reached 509 dollars, which is not the goal but it is very encouraging. So I'm publishing it again with a 500 dollar goal. My actual goal is 3000, but if I can only reach 500 that will be fine. At the very least it encourages me to fund more book projects in the future because I know it is possible to look for support on Kickstarter.I encourage you to look for my Releasing the Nudes books on Amazon and see for yourselves the quality of my work.

https://www.kickstarter.com/projects/americasfavoriteguy/help-doug-record-his-first-good-comedy-album?ref=discovery_category_newest,americasfavoriteguy/help-doug-record-his-first-good-comedy-album,"Ahoy! So, I've told you about myself. Let's talk about the album.I put out my first album in the 2000s, when I had only been performing for a little over two years. I was living and performing in LA at the time, and I had decided to hit the road. I let some other comics convince me that I needed merch to sell (which is true, but a t-shirt is a LOT cheaper than a CD), so I put plans together to record my first CD, ""My Name is Dave."" The first recording, which was at The Outland in Springfield, MO, did. Not. Go. Well. It's a terrible place to record sound and, while a great live music venue, not the best for comedy.So, I decided to do something decidedly Los Angelean and record the album in my friend's loft. That went much better, and was a little forward thinking in the grand scheme of things (Maria Bamford would go on to do something VERY similar). However, due to a CD printing error, there was no back to the front cover which was SUPPOSED to explain that I was doing the comedy in a loft. Since it didn't, the album just sounds like I'm performing to an empty crowd.Cut to recently. I shouldhave waiting until recently to release my first album. But I didn't. About six months ago, I did a show at a DIY venue. I record all my shows on my phone for posterity, and this particular 20 minute set was very well received and the sound bounced in JUST THE RIGHT WAY to be the best recording a phone could put out. So, I released the set as an EP that I'm fairly proud of. It's called ""Jokes for Lovers.""However, that only whetted my appetite to spread my particular brand of comedy. I now feel that the time is right to release a complete LP (long play) that doesn't suck. And I need your help.As described in the video: The engineer needs paid. The camera guy needs paid. I need a few bucks to get the digital album going online when done.If I exceed my set, modest goal of $150, all that money will go to making a physical version of the album. Is it going to be CD? Tape? Vinyl? We'll find out when we see how much money I raised!Oh, did I mention that it's being recorded on 1/4 inch reel-to-reel!?! It doesn't get more lo-fi than this folks. A comedy set album recorded in a bookstore on reel-to-reel!","The risks:1. The album might suck. I'm ready for this, but there are so many things that go into making an album that doesn't suck. Not only to I have to be on the ball in general, I have to be on the ball that night. The sound has to get recorded just right. The audience has to be in a laughing mood. So on and so forth. 2. That's the main risk. The beauty of backing this project, is that even if it's not great, you're still going to get your rewards. I'm starting with a modest set of rewards I know I can fill even if EVERYTHING sucks. Maybe I'm sick that night and my performance is terrible, maybe the sound is all messed up. I can still send you the almost hour of comedy in the formats I've made available.",https://www.kickstarter.com/projects/americasfavoriteguy/national-digit-wrestling-association?ref=discovery_category_newest,americasfavoriteguy/national-digit-wrestling-association,"We are The National Digit Wrestling Association!

In the past 8 years I have been working as an IT-project manager.Gradually I started to pay more attention to my colleagues who were struggling to lose weight.They also had a variety of health issues due to an office job and inactive lifestyle in general.I love sport and make sure to watch what I eat.A few years ago, I decided to become a professional nutritionist. I began studying different diet strategies and healthy food alternatives. It’s been a lot of courses, lectures and specialized literature. Today I’m very happy I took that risk and I’m proud of having a Bachelor degree in Nutrition. My first satisfied customers were my wife and relatives, as well as some of my colleagues. I’ve developed an individual training plan and diet for each of them and in just one month we’re able to see visible significant results. I’m sure I’ve found my passion.Nowadays I continue working with people and helping them to live healthier and happier life. However, I often come across the fact that many people are getting lost in a variety of products we have in our grocery stores. Some of the products have a low quality and could be dangerous for our health, even though the label says “fitness”, “sport”, “organic”, etc. Many people don’t pay attention and lazy to read what’re the ingredients.What’s our food is really made of?I have a friend Tom (Artsem). One day Tom and I came up with a wonderful idea. We’ll create a mobile application. An assistant for all of us.SNAPFOOD is a mobile app which helps you to understand the impact of all the ingredients in every product you see in a supermarket.SNAPFOOD is a smart label scanner which can recognize any language and the whole list of product’s components.SNAPFOOD will help you to understand how good or bad all the additives and preservatives in the product before you choose to buy it.SNAPFOOD will tell you what influence any products may have to your body.Unlike many other applications, SNAPFOOD will analyze your health profile and medical history (optional) and warn you of any harmful products and its ingredients (indicating them by color).Our goal is to simplify the search of the information about quality and value of our food. Also, to help you understand the compatibility and eliminate harmful products from your menu.We’re keen to assist you to make your everyday diet balanced and delicious.Why we need your help?· To create a high-quality app using the latest technologies (IOS & Android).· To have a team of “the best” in their industry (it; marketing; nutritionists, etc.).· To make sure the database is always up to date (you won’t need to guess what’s in this brand-new granola bar).Enjoy it and stay healthy!Our plans for the future?Definitely with your great assistance we’ll develop an application first.As well:· keep improving the ingredient recognition technology to reduce any delays· make sure all new products added to the database accordingly· debug technology that’ll allow you to receive information by scanning labels with minimum errors.· make sure the information is translated to any languages.· provide application learning, so it’ll be able to choose the products that suit YOU best.· provide the database that includes the whole list of different additives following the latest research in a food industry.· collaborate with nutrition professional from different countries with the different methods and opinions.How much will it cost?

We renamed the car ""The Heart of Gold"", and took a trip across this great country of ours. From New Jersey to Florida, yanking the wheel we hung a left and hit the southern states. Up into California and then through the heartland and back to the garden state. We were on the road for a month and as we cruised the highways and byways a story was forming in my head. I imagined a quest, a map, and the pursuit of conquering aliens from a distant world.Upon our return I locked myself in my bedroom for three weeks and turned out a screenplay entitled Journey, a science fiction adventure about a young mans quest for a powerful Egyptian ankh of alien origins . Three rewrites on an old Brother word processor and it was sent off to hollywood. After some initial interest the story was not optioned and it retired too my desk drawer. A screenwriters first attempt at immortality.Then one day while going through boxes of scripts entombed in my parents basement it hit me. Turn Journey into a audio series, the story was a perfect fit for the medium. Action, adventure, science fiction, It was all there. I adapted the first episode under the new title ANKH after the Egyptian symbol of life, and BAM here we are.I believe the story will make a exciting audio series and I hope that you will help bring ANKH to life.",The risks involved with this project are few.

My book takes an average of $3500 dollars to write, materials and supplies, publishing, travel expenses to speak and publicize, promoting, marketing, and to place in bookstores, so charging a fee for selling a book is a drop in the bucket compared to writing you book.Rolling Stone Magazine says, it's anything but difficult to see why the famously stage-timid Sia was a fanatic of 11-year-old reality star Maddie Ziegler. Here, the Dance Moms alum's fresh moves and showy mugging were an extraordinary fit for Ryan Heffington's creative choreography. At the same time, its not just Ziegler's mystique that makes this feature hypnotizing: Her performance makes your memory shiver, with each motion reviewing common activities that you can't precisely place. Every recognizable development is rehashed until it gets to be peculiar and undermining. Now get the full story in the new summer musical dance book “Maddie: Sia’s Inspiration & Method to the Madness / America’s New Sweetheart.""Thank you for your support and allowing me to be your partner in this worthy endeavor. Now it's up to you, how you market and promote this excellent piece. We are here when you need us at anytime where you can support this book to be a great success, so we can market our book successfully. You have been wondering as a fan for years, what really goes on behind the scenes of Maddie successful Dance Moms series and Sia's videos, as well as what are the stars personality and lifestyle really like outside the show unscripted?You get first VIP exclusive access that other fans of the show can't get, so you will be ahead of the game and have greater advantage to discuss in detail with your associates and the people close to you.Please pass along our winning literary piece and recommend us to your colleagues or anybody you can think of, that can support this endeavor.

I have finally decided to commit to one and develop it into a screenplay. I hope to have this movie made one day and this is my first step in the process.I am calling it ""A Knight In Shining Armor"".It is a fantasy movie about two knights who adventure together. They must save a princess from a prince that captures her and tries to marry her against her will. While this may seem like a pretty usual story line, I have a few different elements that should make this a unique and entertaining movie.The money that is raised here will allow me to focus my efforts on developing this project. By freeing up my time I will be able to get more work done more quickly. Also, a portion of the money will be used to begin other parts of the process such as concept art. This will help bring a visual aspect to my ideas and will also be given as rewards for higher level contributors.Thank you very much for supporting my project. It is very important to me and could be a life changing pursuit.","I do not foresee anything delaying or preventing this project from being completed. I am working hard on completing the script and once I have the funds I can find an artist to complete the concept art.

The Missick brothers have Biblical and historical movie projects in progress.It is hoped that this project will help raise awareness for War Veterans and Victims of War around the World. The Super ZETT Comic project has already been noticed by the media in Germany. This is the Missick brother's attempt to do something good for the world and make Art not War.",The Super ZETT super hero has difficulty because Germans are afraid to be happy about a German Super hero because of the Scars of War and the Holocaust. The Super hero has been accepted and many Germans like this Good Guy German Hero. Already Super ZETT has been in German News papers and television.

Originally The Super ZETT project was to create a new 'Good Guy' German Super Hero comic book in Germany for Germany as an integration project for Paul Missick. A few Super Hero costumes for Super ZETT were made to promote the Crowdfunding project. Paul Missick made a Shield with the Super Hero name and began riding his motorcycle out on the streets of Germany. He also attended Comic Conventions and Public events in Costume. Something was lost in the translation and Paul Missick was accepted publicly as Super ZETT the FIRST REAL German Super Hero. He was put in the BILD newspaper of Hamburg region and also on a TV spot for North German Television (NDR) as Super ZETT. During the Filming for the TV spot, people of several other countries who spoke to Super ZETT asked him to do something to break down walls between people in society. The AGENTS OF METATRON is our attempt to do so.What we seek to create is a basic format for a real Super hero. METATRON will be the first and later versions will be Agents of METATRON. It must be a Good Guy Super hero and the costume and network needs to be adaptable to everyone in the world.The possible rewards for supporters of the project are costume designs and usable gadget designs. Also inclusion into the network of Super Heroes that will be a form of modern day 'Guardian Angels' of the World.It is our belief that Love is a real Super Power that we all have. Caring for each other and our world needs to take on a real form. This project is an attempt to do that. Starting with METATRON the International Super hero. Supporters of this project will become Agents of Metatron.","This project is an extension of the Super ZETT project. The risks were that people would not accept Germans as Good Guy Super Heroes. Well, they did and many people are extremely grateful someone chose to stand up for the silent majority of Good people in Germany.  The Agents of Metatron project faces similar challenges. In the World there are many dangers. With the right equipment and network, the world can be safer and we can help each other better."

The Twentieth Century has produced an overwhelming number of great and highly influential individuals whose names have stood the test of time and serve as examples to us of true leadership in our day and age. The inspiration to create these posters came from admiration of these great men and women who have shaped our modern world. While there are hundreds of influential leaders who have shaped the Twentieth Century, i set out to find just eight whose influence and leadership has been profound not only to American History but to the world at large. The result of my efforts is this poster compilation of great leaders whose lives have impacted our modern generation.Franklin D. Roosevelt - For his leadership and vision during a time of worldwide economic depression and total war. John F. Kennedy - For his talented leadership during the tumultuous sixties oversaw major events such as the American Civil Rights Movement, the Space Race, the creation of the Berlin Wall and the Cuban Missile Crisis.Martin Luther King Jr. - For his inspiring leadership of the American Civil Rights Movement through nonviolent civil disobedience and the advancement of civil rights for all Americans.Mahatma Gandhi - For his visionary leadership during a time of colonial suppression. Championing the cause of civil rights and equality through nonviolent civil disobedience. Nelson Mandela - For his tenacious leadership during and after the apartheid era. Advancing the cause of equal rights and justice for all peoples.Mao Zedong - Though the legacy of his leadership is controversial he is regarded as one of the most important individual in modern world history. Credited with the transformation of China into the modern progressive state that it is today.Margaret Thatcher - For her strong leadership of Great Britain during the eighties. Oversaw major world events such as the Cold War and the Falklands War.Winston Churchill - For his courageous leadership of Great Britain during a time of total war. Regarded as one of the greatest wartime leaders of the 20th Century.About the Posters:Each poster depicts the Name, Office, Time in Office, Date of Birth and Date of Death of the individual. Three posters are printed for each depiction with three different band colors black, blue and red. Print DetailsEach three-color poster will measure 12"" x 18"" with color band full bleed to the edge and printed with vivid colors on 100# Recycled White poster paper.

Apart from its detractors who argue that the alliance has lived out its usefulness in an age where its nemesis the Soviet Union no longer exists, there are those who argue that the existence of the NATO military alliance has been the bulwark of Cooperation and integration and its continued existence serves to benefit peace and stability in the North Atlantic region. The NATO was founded on April 4th. 1949 with the stated goal of containing the Soviet Union and the Warsaw Pact states. With the collapse of the Soviet Union in 1991, the NATO has expanded to include all of the former Warsaw Pact states such as Romania and and Bulgaria and former Soviet Republics such as Estonia, Latvia and Lithuania. Sixty five years after its founding the alliance has once again seen life with the conflict in Eastern Ukraine. The future of the NATO is undoubtedly one of expansion and inclusion and may potentially become a global military alliance including states far outside the North Atlantic region. Future members are knocking at the door and another round of inclusions could possibly include countries such as the Ukraine, Georgia, Israel, Japan, South Korea and more. About the Poster:The poster depicts the infantry weapons of the 28 member NATO military alliance. The standard issue service rifle of each member state is depicted in silhouette form against a light colored background with information about the weapon provided such as name, date it entered service and manufacturer. Silhouettes are perfect for depicting weapons in a way that easily brings out its form and design, hence the reason why its used in this depiction.Print DetailsThe poster measures 18""x24"" and will be printed on high quality acid free poster paper for long lasting quality and vibrant colors.

Yes it can be difficult, we never said it's that easy but with the right instruction, proper equipment, and all the right thingamajiggers you'll be growing the best looking anything in a matter of time.HYDROPONICSThe basics to this system includes a water source *could go as small as a coffee can or as big as the pool in your backyard*, an oxygen providing machine *could be a fish air pump with air stoner or a massive air filter for commercial use*, a pH meter to test the water levels to ensure proper growth and healthy plants, and nutrients to feed your plant as no soil is used in this type of system to prevent root rot or other diseases remembering to keep the water dark to as well prevent any algae forming which will kill your growings. :( NOBODY LIKES A DEAD BABY PLANT!Essentially - HYDROPONIC** you have non organic growing medium in a nicelyaerated nursing pot that sits slightly on the water to allow it to wick water up the growing medium into the seedling for feeding, I like to use rockwool cubes that pop right into the systems and help seedlings grow nice roots through the growing medium on out and down to theoxygenated water below; a container to hold your water that is nicelytemperatured leveled at the right pH; with the best possible lighting you have to offer andaccommodatetemperatures depending on if it is outdoor or indoor.Essentially - AQUAPONIC** you have two containers one of which holds your fish the other holding your greens; the fish will thrive and produce waste as any animal does and your plants will thrive from that; you throw in some good bacteria to help the plants breakdown the needed nutrients, filter the water with air stones to provide oxygen to both green and aqua; your plants are placed on any platform that uses non organic growing medium to filter the water that comes in with the fish waste *preferably a type of lava filter rock is best* this all ends up in a nice loop as shown in the picture below*We would like to assure you we feature all the essentials and required attention you will need to provide your plants in the packets we send out.#UPDATE:We would like to insure you all of our great hydroponic & aquaponic systems and their functionality in any home. We have added a last minute reward to feature a complete easy to set up aquaponic system. Due to requests the new system will include everything you need to run a small aquaponic fish and food farm from your own home. The kit will include all your basic aquaponic essentials and instructions on how to get your own aquaponic ecosystem running in no time.There is not much, I have already made my first hydroponic system which is thriving and currently housing 2 beautiful tomato plants and 1 jalapeno plant. These greens are delicious and grown indoors with excellent lighting conditions, pH levels, nutrients, and oxygen these plants are growing faster than we can think of what to do with them later on. Join me as I grow my garden with both aquaponic & hydroponic systems from homemade self made setups ready to house new plants.Picture a nice 2 story house in the middle of the city and the nicest part of town, systematically housing a large number of ponds & gardens throughout the backyard and indoor of the house. With these hydroponic & aquaponic systems the house alone will produce a large amount of food that will be given out locally and promoted through many local events, farmers markets, and other means. We will successfully grow our own fish and vegetables to produce green home grown food that is fresh & ready to be part of our ecosystem and efforts in making our world green.Since my first batch of babies are firing up and growing happy plants I am ready to build more homemade hydroponic & aquaponic systems. The money backers help donate in support of this kickstarter will go towards the production of my home based farm to produce a lot of delicious food. These systems will not only help grow food for locals but it will also be part of a pro-green movement in efforts of growing organic food from the bottom up. It doesn't get any more fresh than this so with all your support we will grow a greener tomorrow. The seeds we first started are already well on their way to future growth and well in our plans to be mass produced and mass enjoyed to locals. We believe in all natural growing and will produce all of our delicious greens in my own home with the lovely space of our home & backyard that are ready for a large supply of equipment & delicious greens.Yes, the greens only get better from here, once the project is funded a beautiful self running ecosystem set on aquaponics and hydropnic system harmony. Fish and greens in abundance grown with proper care in our home to perfection, the food will go out to many locals to be shared to the public. It's the best way to grow the best tasting food and the greenest.",There are absolutely no risks or challenges as the project is only to support green growth and aquaponic & hydroponic growing techniques used to grow fresh food for locals and the public. Since the first hydroponic deep water culture system has been set up successfully growing 3 new born plants we have no problems in our efforts of growing many more with the addition of a few fish friends.,https://www.kickstarter.com/projects/1903527888/the-house-of-greens?ref=discovery_category_newest,1903527888/the-house-of-greens,"All the food is grown naturally using only the best methods & the best of care. The systems that will be placed throughout the house will allow us to ensure maximum yields and make use of every inch of space within the house.

With the successful launch of ""The House of Greens"" Kickstarter we will begin construction of a large green house made by us, to create a stable growing environment for both our plants & fish.The house will be home to many plants & fish varying from almost all types of vegetables, fruit, and fish that you would see at your local market. This includes, but is not limited to, many trees such as oranges, avocados, plums, and plants like tomatoes, peppers, leafy greens, and much more which the fish will be a part of working in harmony with one another in the proper growing environments and eco systems. The way this all works is through the power of nature growing naturally from seed we will begin to create top notch plants, get to cloning, and release to the public a large amount of good tasting food. The Kickstarter itself will fund the construction of the greenhouse and as well create an amount of fish or plants depending on the success.The $500 projected funding goal will go towards construction of a greenhouse in order to produce more food in controlled environment making use of the land in our backyard for growing delicious food and out to the locals.Hydroponics & AquaponicsWe will set up homemade systems that will include both deep water culture and railing systems. This ensures healthy strong plants, prevents disease & pests, and can save a lot of room.Productivity is key, we understand we will need to grow and make use of everything we have. Seeds and cuttings from quality grown plants will be produced and saved along the way creating a batch of fresh perfection with consistency. We already have a few things down but will grow along with our food throughout the time & duration of ""The House of Greens"" Kickstarter letting you get eyes on the beauty of nature first hand. Watch our garden grow and see the works of nature as time marks the life of many new plants & fish friend.We will use systems that include the basic layout of a water source, perfect lighting, growing medium, air filtration, proper nutrients, and of course life.The basic layout for aquaponics is two water sources, a filtration system, healthy bacteria, life, and as well nutrients.Yes, since we are growing in a city home will use the land wisely & set up a network of systems throughout the inside and outside of the home.","There are no risks or challenges, the Kickstarter will only help construct a greenhouse to boost production, ensure better conditions, and provide a nice home for our plants and fish."

So nothing is exact in the process, yet we have done this before and wanted to share this tidbit on the process.We have built over 30+ titles for mobile platforms. We understand the pressure that comes along with tight deadlines and delivering quality games, especially on newer platforms such as the XBox One, PS4, and Wii U.Taking feedback from the community should be interesting and challenging at the same time. We love the idea of pulling back the curtain and joining us in the journey. We have our plan, but we are not 100% certain that our plan will work exactly how we want the first time around. Yet, we will iterate and tweak until we find a right balance for the game. Dream Bot Studios is truly excited to getting this project kicked off and know it will incredibly fun to work closely with our fans. You can feel certain this title will be completed on time... as we have a great prototype and story art already completed.

Love both? Then keep on reading!From Django to Toots:Belgium has an incredibly rich jazz history. And its vivid jazz scene keeps on making history as we speak with its current artists and musicians.  With this photobook we'll focus on today's Belgian Jazz scene.The book will bring you 100 unique moments from the Belgian Jazz scene, captured during a one-year  time frame  (2018-2019).Foremost: it's a photo project (I kid you not). So the main goal is to bring you a selection of high quality photos. Original, stunning, tender, intimate, passionate… everything goes.The general theme is the Belgian Jazz Scene as we know it today. Established old timers (and I say this with the utmost respect!), upcoming young guns and new talent… Wherever they are in their career doesn't matter. If he/she/they performed in these 12 months and I got a great picture, they can make the final selection.What I'm trying to say is, it's not a documentary project pure sang.

Love photography? Love both? Then keep on reading!""BIG JAZZ IN LITTLE BELGIUM - a year gone by in the Belgian Jazz scene"" is a photo project where I combine my passion for photography with my love for jazz music. From Django to Toots:Belgium has an incredibly rich jazz history. And its vivid jazz scene keeps on making history as we speak with its current artists and musicians. With this photobook we'll focus on today's Belgian Jazz scene.The book will bring you 180+ unique moments from the Belgian Jazz scene, captured during a one-year time frame (2018-2019).Foremost: it's a photo project (I kid you not). So the main goal is to bring you a selection of high quality photos. Original, stunning, tender, intimate, passionate… everything goes.The general theme is the Belgian Jazz Scene as we know it today. Established old timers (and I say this with the utmost respect!), upcoming young guns and new talent… Wherever they are in their career doesn't matter. If he/she/they performed in these 12 months and I got a great picture, they made the final selection.What I'm trying to say is, it's not a documentary project pure sang.

https://www.kickstarter.com/projects/2107586344/robot-pcb-kits?ref=discovery_category_newest,2107586344/robot-pcb-kits,"Thankyou for taking a look at my project, My name is Rickey and I'm a electronics enthusiast who enjoys building machines that can think for themselves, without the aid of any programming. I would like to share with you 3 projects I am currently developing. If successful this will help me continue what I love doing and be able to share it with you!PCB - WalkmanOut of the 3 boards offered here this has to be the most advanced, giving a robot the ability to think for itself. it uses inverters as artificial neurons built into the driver chips (included).This robot will be able to automatically teach itself to walk after powering up the board. This is called adaptive robotics in-which the circuit will compensate to changes in it's environment. Making modifications to its walking style, if the robot obtains any damage to the legs, the robot will reteach itself how to move.The board is based on designs from roboticist Mark Tilden. As you can see the board is wider than the one used in the picture above. This is to make assembling the board as easy as possible. Using cheap throughhole components and solder tabs for including your own types ofswitches,sensors and motors. Making atrulycustomisablerobot.examples below:Features:4 motor + Waist motor,crab-walking, reversing, reversing and turning (photo-taxis), hind leg lifting (Out of hole function) and photo-tropic behaviour(light seeking)Other sensors can also be easily incorporated. Adding connectors to the board means that this board can easily be swapped out and placed inside different robot chassis's.Kit includes; PCB Board + IC sockets & Driver chips + Instructions.(other components are not included)PCB - Moon walkerCheck back in a few minutes!Features,Moon-Walker is a 2-motor walker with light seeking abilities, left,right and reverse functions, The is also 2 red and 2 green LED's incorporated into the circuit to show the various neural processes.Kit includes; PCB Board + IC sockets & Driver chips + Instructions.(other components are not included)PCB - Head walkerFeatures:HeadWalker is conceptually based on Justin Johnson's ""PhotoWalker"", It refers to a modular type of walker that responds to signal from both a head and other types of sensors.The main modules are:A reversing master bicore - slave monocore to control the walking motors.A Power Smart Head 1 complete with integrators to seek (or avoid) light.A selection of higher level control circuits which include touch sensors and regulate the walker's response to light.Kit includes; PCB Board + IC sockets & Driver chips + Instructions. (other components are not included)Items crossed out in red are included in the kit, the other components have to be self sourced. These components are basic and very cheap so sourcing shouldn't be a issue. (Please note component count/values may be changed while the design and manufacturing process is taking place) Most motors can be used,but servo motors are probably the best (with the electronics taken out the top of the servo)","Myself being a one man band, High demand for such products may cause some slight delays in the product reaching the customer but I can guarantee a fully working product delivered to your door as quickly as possible :).",https://www.kickstarter.com/projects/2107586344/robot-circus?ref=discovery_category_newest,2107586344/robot-circus,"Before we start id just like everyone to know that all profits that may come about from this project, Will be spent on shipping out free boards to educational places and maker-spaces around the UK. All financial information will be made public along with the names of the people who helped made it happen. I like too in the future ship the boards out for free with motors and battery packs,But I first require the capital made from selling my kits to get the ball rolling, I am hoping to get the price down to 100 kits costing around £250. Exposing as many people as I can to the field of basic electronics, soldering and simple robotics.MY BLOG :http://beambuilder.blogspot.co.uk/Hello there!. My name is Rickey and I would like to tell you about a robotics project which isn't only unique, it requires no programming and no sensors. My robots brain is based on a circuit designed by a guy named Mark Tilden, He is the inventor of a field of robotics called BEAM robotics and is also the designer of toys such as the Robosapian. Below shows a early prototype of theRobosapian, utilising three of these boards for walking.My board is adapted from Marks work and the work of fellow robot hobbyistjwgoerlich, Who has used the boards on the robots displayed on this page. My board is very similar, but is designed to be more user friendly and a more viable version for mass retail. Four boards are shipped as one piece and are pre-cut so they can be easily separated.Parts per board (Supplied in all kits, Times by four for each panel)2N3906 Transistor x22N3604 Transistor x447uf Capacitor x3100K Trimpot x11K Resistor x22.2K Resistor x24.7K Resistor x21N4148 Diode x4Red LED x1 , Yellow LED x1 ,Green LED x1So what does the board actually do?Well as you can see in the first video, Two of these boards give the robot a unique haptic response. Using nothing more than motor load, The circuit will sense whencontact is made with a obstacle and automatically change its direction. After a few seconds themotor will then return to the state it was in before it hit the obstacle.In the second video, When the two arms are out of sync, the robot turns in place. This condition puts extra load on the motors. So after a few tumbles, one of the Abcores will senses that extra load and will then reverse. That arm will then fall back into sync. Moving the robot forward. Using two of these boards means the robot can go forward, back, left and right turn. All with no programming or with no sensors.You can also connect the boards up in a master-slave configuration to create awesome walking robots. These robots will want to seek a state where the least amount of load is put on the motors, which just happens to be when its moving.Circuit Variations.Headbots. ""Replace the two 4.7K internal resistors with CdS photoresistors for phototropic oscillations (ideal for headbots). No further electronics required.Headbot ""Solder the negitive leads of two IR diodes into L1 and L2, Then solder posirive leads to eachother.No further electronics required.So if your still scratching your head, Don't worry about the jargon, The boards have been designed to be user friendly. All the components are through hole, easily soldered, the board is masked, covering the tracks on the board, meaning the only thing your solder is going to stick to is the well spaced pads and the component your trying to soldering in. All the components, values and there polarity are displayed right there on the board.A simple tutorial will also be sent of the different things you can do with the boards. You can also experiment with different ways of connecting each module. These boards are for building interesting robots quickly and cheaply.So what will I need that doesn't come with the kit?.1) Soldering Iron (Why not check out if your school has one of these)2) Solder3) Plastic/wire to build robot body and legs.4) Battery pack or solar panel - 3/5v5) Motors,these boards are designed to work with DC motors, but work best with the geared variety shown below, these can be picked up from sites like aliexpress for as low as 80 pence a piece. Search for ""TT Motor Smart Car Robot Gear Motor""","My main challenge if successful is setting up a postage account as it is new to me,  I have already sent a email out to my local postage providers and have done research on delivery costs plus packaging material. The project is ready for sale and is a product designed and sold myself."

https://www.kickstarter.com/projects/newmuses/rur-at-new-muses-theatre-company?ref=discovery_category_newest,newmuses/rur-at-new-muses-theatre-company,"Hello,Thank you for taking a few minutes to look over our funding campaign for R.U.R. Hopefully you've watched the video above, if not take a couple minutes and give it a chance, then read on below for more detail.We've reserved the Dukesbay Theater (where we previously performed Neil Labute's The Shape of Things) for a three week run from September 5-21, but we need your help to give this production the green light. The best part: if you support us now you get cheap tickets! And you can even sponsor the set design,or costumes, or lighting! Thank you for your time, I hope you get a chance to look over the information provided here. If you have any other questions feel free to contact me through the link provided.All the best,Niclas OlsonManaging Artistic Director |New Muses Theatre CompanyR.U.R. is the story of Rossum's Universal Robot Factory, where they turn out automated workers of the highest quality, without emotions, needs, or souls. One day,Helena Glory, president of the Humanitarian League, comes to bargain for better conditions for the Robot workers. Ten years later, in order to impress Helena, the head of Robot development has changed the formula and the Robots have become more and more human until they rise up against their makers. The rest of the play is a magnificent melodrama, with a handful of human beings holed up in the factory offices as their creations close in around them.Would you believe this is the play that invented Robots? In 1920, Czech playwright Karel Capek premiered a new work about automated workers revolting against their makers. While writing, he needed a new word to describe the workers and decided to call them ""Robots."" The rest is history. This is the play that set off a science fiction revolution and created a genre we are still seeing play out in movies and literature today.R.U.R., beyond just being a really entertaining piece of theatre, is actually fascinating from a historical perspective. In a bizarre twist, the play as written is set approximately 90 years in the future (i.e. about 2010), so what you get when watching is a 90 year old prediction about our modern society, robotics, cloning, and various social issues. The things Capek got right are just as interesting as the times he was completely off in left field.The New Muses mission is to produce intelligent, thought-provoking, and engaging theatre, and R.U.R. fits all the criteria and then some. The script is funny, but also full of very meaty discussion on the meanings of life, relationships, and the ethics of science.Founded in 2009, New Muses is a fringe theatre company which has produced works ranging from The Importance of Being Earnestand Hamlet to Neil Labute's The Shape of Things and their Seattle production of Wallace Shawn's The Fever. We are dedicated to producing intelligent, thought-provoking, and engaging theatre for a contemporary audience.For more information on the company you can check out our website at www.NewMuses.com, or look us up onFacebook.Because if you support us now you get a cheaper ticket! Our general admission tickets are priced at $15, but for every $10 you donate here, we'll give you a ticket, that's a savings of $5. And, to make things even sweeter, all donors will have priority access to reserve their seats before tickets go on sale to the general public.Furthermore, if you make a donation of $50 or more we'll give you a limited edition 11x17 copy of the R.U.R. poster. And for $100 or more, we'll throw in a signed copy of the script, newly adapted for this production and not available anywhere else.Into the show! Every theater production carries a bunch of costs before we even start rehearsals and with your help we can make R.U.R. a viable opportunity for the company. All funds raised via Kickstarter will go directly into production costs that affect you, the audience, and your enjoyment of a fully realized production.Our minimum funding goal is $1300, but how does that break down into real production costs?We also have a bunch of other costs in areas like marketing, printing, and administrative fees, but with the above costs covered we know for sure that we can make the show happen.You can! You can sponsor a whole portion of the show! Put your name on the set, costumes, lighting or sound design. We'll bill you right below the designer in every single program, and you get a commemorative plaque featuring an original rendering from the designer, or even a piece of the color gel used in the lighting for the show.Imagine your name in the program:    Scenic Design by ..................... Designer's Name               Set Sponsored by Your Name HereWe love your enthusiasm. And you can be a producer! For $500 you can join the team as an associate producer and attend a dress rehearsal, be billed as part of the creative team and have your very own copy of the script used for the show.Or, if you really want to make a difference join the team as a full producer for $1000 and be billed with the company on all advertisements, programs, and websites. And, as a full Producer, you are invited to attend the first read-thru with the cast, a dress rehearsal, and you get your very own copy of the script for the show.Imagine your name above the title!*The fine print: All creative decisions remain the sole responsibility of New Muses and the R.U.R. creative team. Producer credit is given in recognition of financial support only.Absolutely. We have several reward levels specifically designed for businesses. Along with tickets to the show, we can offer advertising space in our program for businesses at the following reward levels:*Note: Businesses will be asked to provide their own artwork in the appropriate dimensions for their ad space. New Muses is not responsible for creating ads.Spread the word. We're a small company without a huge mailing list or crowd of season ticket holders to keep us afloat. We really do depend on word of mouth from people like you to make our shows a success. Share this campaign around the internet, come see one of our other upcoming shows, like the company page on Facebook, and most of all just stay in touch.","Fortunately if we meet our funding goal, most of the large risks of theatre production will be put to rest.  We'll have covered our basic production costs, including space rentals, insurance and funds to cover set, costume, and other technical elements.  So what's left?1) Can you put together the cast and crew needed for this show?  Yes we can!  We're in the process of casting already, you can see the casting notice up on our website (www.NewMuses.com/auditions.html), and even submit yourself if you'd like to be involved.  We're hopeful that we can announce the full cast and creative team here well before the end of our funding period.2) What about the costs not covered by your Kickstarter campaign? The other costs we run into, like marketing, printing, and company admin fees will all be covered out of our general company funds.3)  What if you reach your funding goal and nobody shows up to see the show?  That would be sad, but fortunately we are giving away tickets with every donation over $10, so we'll have sold approximately 1/3 our available seats when we reach our funding goal.  But don't worry, Kickstarter sponsors will have priority access to reserve seats before the general public can even buy a ticket, so your seat is guaranteed.4) What if you don't reach your goal?  If we don't reach our goal R.U.R. will go back on the shelf and we'll move on to other projects.  One of the reasons we chose to go through Kickstarter is the all-or-nothing format of the campaign.  Unfortunately this means that R.U.R. only happens if we reach our goal, so it's up to you to help spread the word if you want to see R.U.R. on stage this September.5)  What about _____?  Feel free to contact us through the links provided for answers to specific questions not covered here.  We'd love to hear from you.Thanks for reading.",https://www.kickstarter.com/projects/newmuses/new-muses-presents-finians-rainbow-a-musical-comed?ref=discovery_category_newest,newmuses/new-muses-presents-finians-rainbow-a-musical-comed,"To bring the magical tale of two Irish immigrants coming to America and finding their fortune in the company of poor American farmers, southern bigots, - and a leprechaun! - dancing to life in FINIAN'S RAINBOW, we’ve gathered a crack production team, designed an intimate minimalist production that serves the purposes of the script while keeping budgets to a minimum, and began a marketing push to expand our audience.However, with all the preparation in the world, the upfront costs of producing a musical are prohibitive. Before we can start rehearsals we need to pay royalties, deposits, and shipping costs to the publisher and renew our liability insurance.As a company, we pride ourselves on being fiscally responsible and producing entertainment that can be covered with income from ticket sales alone, and we feel we're in a good place with this production. But,... in order to make the earlier than normal due dates for our bills from the publisher, Tams-Witmark Music Library, and have money left over for sets, costumes, props and the like we could use some help.By reaching out to the Kickstarter community we can empower this production to reach its full potential and guarantee our loyal supporters a ticket to the show through rewards and early ticket access. And in keeping with our policy of budgeting based on ticket sales, we will be giving away free tickets for every $10 in donations.The publishing house, Tams-Witmark Music Library, Inc., is charging us $500 for the rights to do 9 performances of FINIAN’S RAINBOW from July 3-19, 2015.  With the royalties covered, we feel that with company funds and projected ticket sales we will be able to confidently mount the production we envision, and our audience deserves, while remaining fiscally responsible.For that purpose we’ve put together a rewards package which gets you access to tickets before the general public (and free tickets for every $10 in donations), with additional perks like signed posters, business advertising, and coffee or lunch with the creative team. A new addition to our fundraising is the creation of the title of adjunct company member.  New Muses functions under the idea that a company is ""a group of individuals coming together for a common purpose,"" and our realization is that, as donors and supporters, you are just as much a part of the company as an actor or staff member. Therefore every donor, no matter the amount, will be listed as a donor and adjunct company member on our website for the 2014-2015 Season.And for those looking to really get involved we’ve opened up positions as associate and co-producers, including access to some rehearsals and the production team and listing in programs and advertisements as a producer.*Thank you for taking the time to look over our campaign. You can find out more about the company and our past productions on our website: www.NewMuses.comor by visiting our Facebook page.And just for fun, here's a sneak peak at an early draft of the set design for FINIAN'S RAINBOW.","The good thing is, with nearly six seasons of producing theatre under our belts, we're prepared for, and familiar with, most of the challenges which can arise during any production.  We're already in the process of casting the show and finalizing the production team, the first major obstacle to any production.  When we reach our goal here, the major financial hurdles of the production will be handled, and from there it's a matter of taking the same steps as directors, actors, and designers that our company has done throughout its history and hundreds if not thousands of more times by the individual members of our team throughout their combined careers.And finally, it comes down to filling the seats.  We've started here, by giving free tickets and early access to our contributors, and with a dedicated marketing plan with a social media focus, and audience connections through local partnerships, we look forward to full houses throughout the run."

Roseanne Barr is committed, but Queen Rosie is just the beginning. Many famous comedy stars are lining up. Unfortunately, I cannot reveal their names just yet. But, from the man who brought Jerry Lewis to the London Palladium, you can expect the unexpected! Watch the clip of High On Laughter, which is the show I created and produced in London. (HOL benefits Turning Point Scotland, a drug and alcohol charity launched by Princess Diana.) I've done this already, Folks, and I'm going to do it again, this time for my own foundation at The Hollywood Bowl.TLF will focus on seven main areas, referred to as ""The Seven Goals,"" which can be read on our Facebook Group page: http://www.facebook.com/group.php...The foundation's immediate needs are minimal. I am a one-man band. I need an assistant 20 hours a week. I need to get a website done, business cards, etc. Devoting an average of 50 hours a week, as President of TLF, I would like a small working wage. Plus, I need money to apply for the foundation's own 501(c)3 non-profit status. (please read REWARDS DISCLAIMER below)Most importantly, I need to raise the deposit for the Hollywood Bowl show. The Bowl deposit is $150,000 for one night. (There are other costs -- security, buses, etc.) Everything is negotiable in life and I'm sure once I get the complete core of great famous comedians, I'll be able to close the money gap with corporate sponsors. Plus, there are many ancillary means of fund raising, such as auctions, which will be tied into the charity. And, finally, there is always ""that chance"" that television will pick this up. The High On Laughter show I produced at the London Palladium was filmed and broadcast on Bravo UK. The Laughter Foundation is being followed by people all around the world. I'm getting offers of help, as well as donations, from people who have heard my story, but never met me. It's truly an amazing time.Folks, like many of us recently, I've been through a very tough time. Last year, my home of nine years, in London, was repossessed. It was heart-breaking. I had remortgaged it too many times, but I was also carrying an enormous debt from the London Palladium show. I bet everything I had on that show. That's why I thought Jerry Lewis was the right move. Rather than detract from the main message here, you can read all about what happened with me and Jerry Lewis if you go to the Facebook group THEY LOVE HIM IN FRANCE. And while you're on Facebook, please go to the group THE LAUGHTER FOUNDATION. What matters now is the future. I want to be involved in something bigger than myself. And my dream is to be on stage a year from now, introducing the greatest comedians in the world, at The Hollywood Bowl, all for what I think is a great cause: Comedians.Please read the Seven Goals below. I've put up the 5-minute highlight video of the Sept 8, 2002 High On Laughter show at the London Palladium. ""HOL III"" was a great show, 15 British & American comedians. And starred comedians such as ""relative unknowns"" Zach Galifiniakis and Jim Gaffigan. Zach (who did two HOL's) is now a big Hollywood comedian film star. Jim is doing pretty nicely too, one of the top comedy acts in the country.Thanks for your time. I love you all! You've been a great crowd! Drive safely!And, please please please, if you can, contribute to The Laughter Foundation.Never take Life too seriously, you'll never get out of it alive.Comedians. A very funny cause!Please help me help ""My Kids,"" ya' know...like ""Kidding""?Cheers,Steven Alan GreenPresident, The Laughter FoundationTHE SEVEN GOALS:HEALTH AND DENTAL INSURANCE for comedians. This would include coverage for mental health issues, a common occupational hazard or prerequisite for being a comedian in the first place. [LATEST UPDATE: May form ""The Comedians Guild"" for best group rates.]SUPPORTING COMEDIANS ON THE GROUND “How can we help?” is our motto. Whether you’re a comic off the turnip truck or a burned out vet, sometimes advice and a simple and friendly conversation with someone in the know can help.WORKSHOPS Not a “networking thing,” screw that. All workshops at the Foundation will focus on the human element of being a comedian, as well as The Business. Guest lecturers and workshops will feature Kelly Carlin, the daughter of the late great George Carlin. Kelly teaches a wonderful workshop on how to get control of the creativity deep down within and make it work for you.THE HECKLER FUND One-time financial grants will help qualified comedians who may be experiencing rent or alimony problems. An interview process will determine eligibility.ADDICTION SERVICES. One of The Laughter Foundation Advisors is Kitty Bruce. Daughter of the late great Lenny Bruce, Kitty runs The Lenny Bruce Memorial Foundation, helping women with addiction issues.COMEDIANS FOR COMEDIANS COMEDY GALA AT THE HOLLYWOOD BOWL will be the big fund raising show. Many top comedians have already lent their names and more info as this develops, but I promise you this….. From the man who brought Jerry Lewis to the London Palladium, I think you can expect the unexpected.[LATEST UPDATE: ""The Comedians for Comedians Comedy Charity Gala at The Hollywood Bowl"" is in the works, with a target date some time in 2011. ROSEANNE BARR is the only big name act I can mention at this point, and within the last week alone, I got two very well known comedians who star on HBO and Network Television. C4C is going to be the most talked about comedy show in LA in years. My dream is to get Eddie Izzard, Russell Brand, Rickie Gervais, all of whom I have met and/or worked with in London.REGULAR MEETINGS Leave your networking hat at the door. These gatherings are open to comedians and will serve as sort of group-therapy between comedians. Sharing stories and hearing other’s stories. That’s the way we do it!MY DREAM is to create a community. Being a comedian can be a very lonely enterprise. People love you when you make ‘em laugh. But comedians are real people with extraordinary talent. And often, that talent comes at a price. That’s where The Laughter Foundation comes in. My long term goals for The Laughter Foundation? A Comedy Museum and International Laughter Day.Let’s help comedians. They are a very important part of the world.And remember, “Never take life too seriously!....You’ll never get out it alive!”For more information and/or to offer your services for the cause, please email me at steven.alangreen@gmail.com.Please beware that an investment through this Kickstarter Project is not the same thing as donating directly to The Laughter Foundation.

I'm the do it yourself kinda guy. I'm also an ""international comedy legend"".  International because I made international news on September 2, 2002 when comedy legend Jerry Lewis ""collapsed"" backstage at a show I produced to honor him at the greatest theatre in Europe, The London Palladium. I performed stand-up comedy throughout North America, the United Kingdom and half of Europe. I've been on television 12 times in the UK and US, including on Conan.  I am considered a ""comedy legend"", all because I got my name on the wall of The Comedy Store.  That's a big deal apparently, especially to the up and comers. I was there in the day. Imagine a guitar player telling you he jammed with Hendrix. Translate that to the world of comedy. After doing 5 different well-reviewed one-man shows at the Edinburgh Fringe Festival (including ""I Eat People Like YOU for Breakfast!"" which was nominated to be nominated for the coveted Perrier Award) and got rated second in the whole of England, I am doing a new one-man show at the Two Roads Theater, right here in Studio City this August. One night at The Two Roads Theater. In this new show ""The Naked Comedian"", I'll be telling funny, but meaningful true life stories of being one of the first comedy explorers of his generation to go from America to not only become established in the UK, but to create, produce, and finance an international comedy television show featuring top British and American comedians, and one comedy legend.I'M interesting... Then maybe, as my grande finale. If you're lucky, I will bear all. I will do a comedy routine completely naked on stage. (Okay; how am I gonna get outta this one...) Right in front of your horrified eyes. Maybe with my guitar hung low, I don't know yet.  But, I will reveal, one way or another, finally, why the tights. (you'll be quite impressed)For this Kickstarter campaign I need to raise money for production of this show just one night. I've gotten great reviews of my one-man shows in the past (see below) and I guarantee if you come to the show you'll have a great time. 10% of all ticket sale revenue (and after production expenses) goes to The Laughter Foundation, explained all below. Thank you for your support of The Naked Comedian.Steven Alan GreenStevenalangreen.com10% of all ticket sale revenue (after production expenses) goes to The Laughter Foundation.  On the advice of Legal Zoom (who has been helping every step of the way), we need $450 to pay into the IRS when I send in the official application for our 501(c)3. Because The Laughter Foundation is my big legacy dream, 10% of the money raised from The Naked Show, a commercial venture, will go towards the expenses I'm supposed to come up with to make The Laughter Foundation a reality.  Comedians Pay Program, which grants $150 to independent comedy shows in cafes and bars all across the country.   We've already signed up comedy rooms in L.A., San Francisco, and New York. $50 goes to the promoter and the $100 is paid to the comedians, anyway the promoter wants to, but they have to be multiple comedians and all be paid equally, whether they're the headliner or not.     The Comedy Museum.  This is to build a world-class museum to study and exhibit the art, history and science of comedy.   This is a huge project; millions and millions of dollars, but attainable.   I believe in what The Laughter Foundation stands for. ","As far as risks and challenges go, I go by experience.  I know that not every ""great idea"" is gonna fly.  Things are always a work in progress.  The only ""risk"" I can see is no one coming out to see the show.  Given that on a good day, I have 10,000 social media followers and I'm very much already a topic of conversation in the comedy community, I believe my friends, both famous and non-famous, will come out to lend support. In terms of a challenge?  As it always has been for me, like any ""artist"".  Make sure the project is both worthy of the audience's time, as well as a stretch to new levels for me, as a comedian, writer, and performer."

The overall project is entitled SPORT IN ART SERIES. The visual design of the poster is intended to draw the viewer closer, to examine the action, to advertise the sport - no matter what language the viewer speaks or reads. In the early 20th century POSTERS were the main form of advertising and the world's greatest artists created them to advertise everything from soap, chocolate, beer, wine and cigarettes to silent movies, skiing and the Olympic Games. Today those original posters can sell for tens of thousands of dollars.My first poster was for the sport of WRESTLING - my own sport. I did not want to glorify any one athlete or personality so I decided to use historical images. The image comes from a book printed in the 16th century with the Latin word for wrestling in the lower left corner - LUCTATORES. Using four different colors I used four languages in different fonts for the word ""WRESTLING - Lutte (French), Lucha (Spanish) and Ringen (German). The printing is high quality only - I used two coats of black ink for a solid background, brilliant silver ink for the image in the center, solid blue, red, green and yellow for the languages. I have found a great sport photographer in the Czech Republic, Pavel Rycl, and will use one of his images - with permission of course. This is an international collaboration project with a Czech photographer, three Austrian gymnasts and me - an American graphic artist. I have reviewed thousands of his photos of gymnastics and have narrowed my selection down to fifteen images with just a few shown here. One of these great images will become the final poster. A special showing will take place in central Pennsylvania where three separate gymnastics groups with have a preview and vote on the best image and design. The final selection will become the GYMNASTICS poster and be printed on good quality, archival poster paper, 24 x 36 inches in full color. Those supporters who make a donation of $10.00 or more will received free copies of the poster via US Mail, rolled inside a tube.Three different athletes are illustrated in these images and they do not know which one will be the ""winner"" of the design project. All three are very talented gymnasts who demonstrate fine form and skill, strength and endurance, excitement and passion. But the poster is intended to promote the SPORT and not the individual athlete, so their names are not revealed.This poster will illustrate men's gymnastics while another gymnastics poster will be prepared to promote women's gymnastics. The SPORT IN ART series will continue further with other sports such as baseball, football, basketball, golf, soccer and many, many more.Give generously and then give this poster away to a gymnast, a coach, a club or school team. Promote this fantastic sport through the visual arts. Please give what you can. Thanks! This sports poster series will cover every sport you can imagine - the posters do not promote a specific team or country - just the sport itself because sport is universal. There are over 60 posters planned for the series. So help get this project funded and in return for your support you will receive a LIFETIME acknowledgement on the IISOH website. PLUS you might get a free GYMNASTICS poster if you become a $10.00 donor or more.Due to the very high cost of shipping overseas, I regret that this free poster offer can only be shipped to US addresses.Thanks for your help! Merci beaucoup - vielen dank - gracias - grazie - spaceba.","There are minimal risks in this project. I will have no difficulty creating the poster design. I experiment with fonts depending on the languages used but the most important decision deals with the visual impact of the design - does it attract your attention? What I cannot control is the printer and their work. Production is done using the lithographic printing process on very large printing presses, using archival quality paper so I am at the mercy of the printer, really. Normally a project can be done in 4 weeks, but just to be safe I am shipping in DECEMBER so posters can be used as holiday gifts.",https://www.kickstarter.com/projects/319507795/gymnastics-poster-sport-in-art-poster-series-2?ref=discovery_category_newest,319507795/gymnastics-poster-sport-in-art-poster-series-2,"I created a Sport poster project entitled SPORT IN ART SERIES. The purpose is idealistic - to promote sport worldwide through art. The visual design of the poster is intended to draw the viewer closer, to examine the action, to advertise the sport - no matter what language the viewer speaks or reads. In the early 20th century POSTERS were the main form of advertising and the world's greatest artists created them to advertise everything from soap, chocolate, beer, wine and cigarettes to silent movies, skiing and the Olympic Games. Today those original posters can sell for tens of thousands of dollars.My first poster was for the sport of WRESTLING - my own sport.The IISOH Library and Museum is the publisher of this GYMNASTICS poster and is part of the Institute's educational program. We will eventually print a poster for every sport imaginable. For GYMNASTICS I have found a great sport photographer in the Czech Republic, Pavel Rycl, and will use one of his images - with permission already granted. This is an international collaboration project with a Czech photographer, three Austrian gymnasts and me - an American graphic artist. I have reviewed thousands of his photos of gymnastics and have narrowed my selection down to thirty (30) images with just a few shown here. One of these great images will become the final poster. A special showing will take place in central Pennsylvania where three separate gymnastics groups with have a preview and vote on the best image and design. The final selection will become the GYMNASTICS poster and be printed on good quality, archival poster paper, 24 x 36 inches in full color. There remains a possibility that I will go nuts and create THREE posters, one of each athlete, but in a smaller format at 18 x 24 inches. The smaller posters will go as a complete set of three -- because it has been hard to pick a single image and everyone has a different favorite. BUT you can help me decide - tell me which poster(s) you like best.below: Julius 6 without text  Below: Julius6 with humorous text (one language, 4 to be added)Below: Julius10 with text of GYMNASTICS in twelve (12) languages.Below: Julius 6 with text of GYMNASTICS in nine (9) languages.Three different athletes are illustrated in these images and they do not know which one will be the ""winner"" of the design project. All three are very talented gymnasts who demonstrate fine form and skill, strength and endurance, excitement and passion. But the poster is intended to promote the SPORT of GYMNASTICS and not the individual athlete nor their team nor country. Below: Johannes2 with text in seven (7) languages.Below: Johannes4 with humorous text plus GYMNASTICS in six (6) languages.Below: Johannes8b with seven (7) languages.Below: Johannes 8c with six (6) languages.If you look closely then you can see the subtle changes in fonts, colors and layout of the graphics. The clashing of colors has to be avoided while making it attractive and readable. There are thousands of fonts and I try to sample many hundreds to match each language. The variety is unlimited, so it can be a challenge. Your eye should be drawn to the action first and then the words.This poster will illustrate men's gymnastics while another gymnastics poster will be prepared to promote women's gymnastics in the future. The SPORT IN ART series will continue further with other sports such as baseball, football, basketball, golf, soccer and many, many more.Below is Julius5 without text.Below is Julius 5 with text added in fifteen (15) languagesGive generously and then give this poster away to a gymnast, a coach, a club or school team. Promote this fantastic sport through the visual arts. Resell them as a fundraiser for your team or club.Thanks for your help! Merci beaucoup - vielen dank - gracias - grazie - spaceba.","There are almost no risks involved - we will be dependent upon the printer that is selected to print the posters.  All photos have been taken in high quality high definition, permissions are received, graphic designing is in progress daily....we need a final selection and then we just need funds to print."

For the past few months I have been helping at the Drama Department by teaching the students how to apply stage makeup and helping them apply makeup during productions. Everything that goes into the productions is made by the Drama teacher -who in reality is an English teacher who volunteers her time to keep performing arts in Hawthorne alive- and the students. The department also has an alumni who donates his time to direct the productions. This year, although the school does not have enough funds for our department, we the Drama Club department want to step it up and participate in parades in our neighbor cities and perform for our city as well.The idea to do this came to me 2 years ago when I was living in the city of South Gate, CA. One day after coming from work I saw a group of kids and adults trying to take pictures of something or someone, after a while I noticed the kids were trying to take pictures with Mickey and Rapunzel. I was surprised and upset because the character costumes look cheap and the people behind the costumes were charging them money to take pictures. The following year I started to construct from scratch Snow White, Aurora, Cinderella and Peter Pan. I dressed up my nieces and took them to the park. Kids went crazy over them and it was rewarding to see their smiles without having to charge them for something my nieces enjoyed doing.This year I want to step it up and have High School students bring the Princesses and their Princes to life. I am donating all my tax return money to make the Princes costumes from scratch and add to the ensemble 4 Royal Couples dancing along with the Royals and also add Tiana and Naveen to the group. All the costumes will come from my tax money, my etsy shop and family donations. But we are still short for the props, application fees for the parades, the sound system that we need to play the music during the parades and some fabrics to create the costumes for the Royal dancers. Please make our dream to bring smiles to our community a reality. Any amount is gladly appreciated.Props Needed:-20 LED Candles to use for the Candlelight Ball performance.-Dance shoes ($15-20 a pair) for the performers once they are auditioned.- Sound system for the music.Everything above will belong to the Drama Club Department for future performances.Calendar:-Auditions February 5th and 6th.-Rehearsals: Fridays March-November 2014(During summer vacation I will ask local hospital to give us permission to visit children dressed in the finished characters)-September Apply for the parades.-December the group will perform for the school, Fridays go to different areas of the community to perform and also perform at the local parades.Thank you soo much! ","In the month of September we have to apply to participate in the parades. If accepted we can go forward, is application is denied we will only perform in the school and go several days around different areas of the city to perform for people. For example at the parks and visit some elementary schools.",https://www.kickstarter.com/projects/261817849/hawthorne-high-school-fashion-clubs-team-of-dreams?ref=discovery_category_newest,261817849/hawthorne-high-school-fashion-clubs-team-of-dreams,"Hawthorne High School's newly created Fashion Club is asking your help to raise money to create costumes and buy accessories -for already auditioned students- to visit schools, hospitals and entertain different cities throughout the Southbay during the month of December dressed in Disney characters.

Funds collected will help to pay for expenses involved in running the show (including the purchasing of equipment, advertisement, and paying staff and on air talent).""Liberal Dan"" comes from a New Orleans Conservative radio host who gave me that name when I called in to counter the points of him, his callers, and his guests. Several ""YOU ARE LIBERAL DAN"" exclamations later, I knew I had to do something. I really enjoyed the previous radio show I had co-hosted and I knew that an internet podcast was the way to go. And after another friend of mine let me on his blogtalkradio.comshow, I was hooked. So I registered the domain name liberaldan.com. I got all my ducks in a row for registering all of the appropriate social media accounts, and I started recording shows.I intend on making this show last well beyond 2013. However, a good start with a Kickstarter campaign will be a great way to enable future success. And who knows, perhaps I will also have a kickstarter for the 2014 year.Because the show is a live show and a podcast, your commercials do not just play when the show is live. They will also play whenever anyone downloads the podcast and listens to it. There is no limit to the number of times that your commercial could be heard.Note: All reward levels contain only what is stated and do not contain items from lower reward levels unless explicitly stated in the reward or in via a stretch goal.Stretch Goals!50 shirts: I am using cafe-press to fulfill my t-shirt orders. Once 50 shirts are ordered I will improve the quality of the shirt from a ""value"" t-shirt to a standard white t-shirt. This will also enable orders of XLT/2XLT/3XLT.100 shirts: If 100 shirts are ordered, I will throw in a bumper sticker with each shirt order.UPDATE: Any commercial advertising or sponsorship bought in this Kickstarter can be renewed for the same prorated rate next year as well.","Risks and challenges include: 1) Production of bumper stickers and t-shirts will be done by a third party. The required time to make the items, have them shipped to me, and then repackaging them to be shipped back out to you all depends on their production time. Of course, I will keep everyone notified of the production schedules as applicable. 2) The creation of commercials requires both parties to come to an agreement on any background music (to make sure it is pod safe) and on the content (to make sure it is both g-rated and takes the appropriate time). The commercial should also sound good. The amount of time it could take to complete the commercial will depend on all those issues. I also have final say on if the commercial (or banner advertising on the website) is suitable to be played on air (or placed on the website) If you are planning to purchase commercial time, I suggest working with me before the kickstarter ends in order to get the product on the air as quickly as possible.3) Vacations, holidays, sick time and technical difficulties (including weather events that prohibit me from connecting to the internet) can interfere with the operation of the show. If you are buying a set number of commercials this will not affect you. But in the event that a show is missed, for any reason, reasonable attempts will be made to reschedule the show or to increase commercial time given in future shows. But there may be weeks where the show does not air (like on Thanksgiving Day). So by purchasing advertising time ""per show"" you understand that you only get commercials when the show would air. 4) Any reward level that gives you banner advertising on Liberaldan.com will require the reward recipient to deliver the image to me before I can display it on liberaldan.com. There will be no placeholders until that graphic arrives.",https://www.kickstarter.com/projects/liberaldan/liberal-dan-radio-2013-redux?ref=discovery_category_newest,liberaldan/liberal-dan-radio-2013-redux,"What is it?This is the second attempt at a Kickstarter project to fund the Liberal Dan Radio Program through the end of December 2013. Funds collected will help to pay for expenses involved in running the show (including the purchasing of equipment, advertisement, and paying staff and on air talent). The nickname ""Liberal Dan"" comes from a New Orleans Conservative radio host who gave me that name when I called in to counter the points of him, his callers, and his guests. I would randomly meet people who would be excited that they had just met ""Liberal Dan"". Several ""YOU ARE LIBERAL DAN"" exclamations later, I knew I had to do something. I really enjoyed the previous radio show that I had co-hosted and I knew that an internet podcast was the way to go. And after another friend of mine let me on his blogtalkradio.com show, I was hooked.What have I done so far?I registered the domain name liberaldan.com. I created pages on Facebook, and account on YouTube and a Twitter account. Finally, I started recording shows on BlogTalkRadio for about a year now. However, I would like to see the show expand.What are my future goals?I intend on making this show last well beyond 2013. However, a good start with a Kickstarter campaign will be a great way to enable future success. And who knows, perhaps I will also have a Kickstarter campaign for the 2014 year.Why should you support Liberal Dan Radio as a listener?Because I believe that I produce a show that is both informational and entertaining. I have had some very interesting past guests. I have spoken about very serious subjects but we have had fun analyzing the issues. I also like to put some humor into the show by taking a snarky look at the headlines for the week. I mock bigotry and intolerance in the weekly ""Words of Redneck Wisdom"" bit. As the show grows I will be able to produce more funny bits that go right along with the news and opinions. I will also interject some random items from time to time (like sports, gaming, and other various topics). But don't just take my word for it. The podcasts are available on iTunes for download or they can be downloaded from blogtalkradio.com. Listen to a few shows and you might just like what you hear.Why should you buy commercial advertising or a sponsorship?Because the show is a live show and a podcast, your commercials do not just play when the show is live. They will also play whenever anyone downloads the podcast and listens to it. There is no limit to the number of times that your commercial could be heard. Also, the show is just starting and will grow with time. Your business will have the opportunity grow with it. Finally, any ""per show"" or ""per hour"" advertising or sponsorship gained as a backing reward for this year will allow you to renew for at least next year at the same pro-rated rate (as this ad buy is for 3 months and next year is 12).How do the reward levels work? All reward levels contain only what is stated and do not contain items from lower reward levels unless explicitly stated in the reward or in via a stretch goal. If you want a t-shirt/bumper sticker and an advertising package, just choose the advertising rate level and add the cost for the other reward level to it.Some rewards say ""hour"" and others say ""show"". What is the difference?A show can take place once per day. However, a show could contain multiple hours. Currently the show airs once a week for an hour.Why do the 2nd hour and beyond sponsor levels cost much more?It is to make sure that I would have enough money to cover the costs involved to do the show full time.Are there Stretch Goals?In a word: YES!50 shirts: I intend on using cafe-press to fulfill my t-shirt orders (However that could change if a better alternative arises). Once 50 shirts are ordered I will improve the quality of the shirt from a ""value"" t-shirt to a standard white t-shirt.

While the Stars Fall explores loneliness, happiness, and our need for love and communication.The InspirationThe initial inspiration for the play comes from a line in a song by The Doors, called Touch Me.

What's important to us is to be able to focus on the content of the play, see how an audience responds, and make the necessary changes in order to produce a richer, fuller, text.How Are You Involved?Without an audience, the creators have no way of establishing any sense of the impact that their work will have. After most readings, audience members are invited to stay and discuss the work they just heard. This is some of the most crucial feedback that any creator can get.

But the risk is so exciting because what results are often thrilling, bold, sexy pieces of work that can't be found in commercial houses. So here we are, doing this risky business, and we're doing it with you."

Im estimating on paying $40 per song to be mastered plus any other mixing they may provide. I already started working on the album. My goal is to have about 7-10 songs.

There's something beautiful about how each genre of music can make you feel. The melodies, the pumping rhythms, and harmonies all join together to give you a unique experience.Over the past several years I’ve been honing my skills and learning new techniques for composing and producing music.Studying music production has helped me direct my musical ideas and happy accidents into fully produced tracks. With my new experience and greater passion, my goal is to release a mastered digital album on January 25th, 2019.The album will be comprised of 8 tracks, all with their own unique style and groove.

His style could be described as a blend of Techno, Progressive House and other dance music undercurrents, making for a very diverse and textural tone. Influenced by artists the likes of Deadmau5, or Boys Noize, Dark and Dark has a truly unique approach to building song structures, often allowing thick textures and drones to interact with punchy beats and powerful drops. In early 2018, Dark and Dark released an Ep album titled “Feast on Me”, and he is about to drop a new release on January 25th, 2019, which is going to be his de facto debut, introducing his new direction to the audience, as well as his mercurial approach to electronic music production.","The only risk will be getting the funds in time to get the album mastered a week or two before the release date on January 25th, 2019.

Part of the funding will be used to satisfy all orders associated with this project and the remainder will be used on portfolio printing.I currently only sell original pieces of my work, so this therefore limits my audience considerably as ive found not everyone is in the market for the full cost of an original but would consider a print at a lower price. Unfortunately finding the spare cash to source prints while only doing my art as a hobby is quite hard as most printers work on a ’order more, pay less’ basis... so ordering one at a time doesnt stack up.The ProjectIve always wanted to do a set of works revolving around the Collectible market for Adidas trainers... I have long been a fan of the styles and think they are a massive part of our culture in Britain. So ive planned a set of 13 original paintings, which i will generate prints from, if funding is met, of the best and most collected Adidas trainers in British Culture.I will create these on A2 board in my own unique style, using striking colours as a backdrop to highlight the pieces and give them a desirable finish.Below ive added a few examples of my commissioned paintings from the past to help show how i work...Ive also added some of my ink work that I tend to do more often and want to generate my prints from.Thank you so much for taking the time to view my profile and id love to hear from anyone willing to fund my project or just in general to be honest!Shaunfacebook: Shaun Salmon Artworkinstagram: ShaunSalmonArtworktwitter: isalmon","As with all creative projects, especially original artwork, there may be a slight overrun on timescales but I hope to complete the pieces on time as stated. Any problems will be communicated at the first possible instance.Also if funding is met and people only select a certain number of designs they would like, across all orders, I may only complete these said paintings until further funding is provided, so as not to disappoint anyone who backs my work.But I can’t see any of this being a problem!!!"

If project is funded keep in mind it is only Phase 1, so you can still back us, we will allocate funds to other phases and update this project accordingly. Phase 1 (Current Funding Goal): GMs can create a template campaign (they fill in story details and use existing enemies). Up to 5 players can join each campaign via invite code.Phase 2 (Additional $2000): GMs can create more customized campaigns, their own enemy placements, maps etc. Open to all the player base or Private Mode (only via invite code).Phase 3 (Additional $2000 to $5000 based on complexity of chat server and lobby controls. We will get feedback from players before starting this phase): Game Lobby - Players can chat with one and other. This allows players to contact specific GMs and request content etc.Phase 4 (Additional $5000 - already have a few programmers willing to do it for that fixed price, which is very good!): Convert to Apple (IOS) devices as well. Currently only for Android Devices. Most likely going to outsource this portion while we develop the Android one even further so updates will be frequent and we can put in the content that the players and GMs want!Additional Fund Allocation: Any additional funds that we aren't using for above phases (they are our main focus) will be used to acquire graphics assets, mainly isometric assets for campaign maps. We can get much better visuals using isometric assets. We have a few artists in our contact list that can do it for us at very reasonable rates. Also funds will be allocated to the TCG development (see Coming Soon).We urge backers to get in on the Beta if they want to play and also connect via our Facebook page. We are going to be doing a Google + Page, Twitter and Instagram if that is your preference! 100% Developed (With Videos)Campaign Mode (travel on map, gain quests, battle, find treasure, etc.). Tutorial Video Provided for this portion and Battle System as well. An actual partial campaign video will be added in the days to come before Beta Launch (May 15, 2019):Updated Gameplay Video (June 1, 2019):Party Management, Character Management, Inventory, and Skills.Quest Mode (Choice based story mode, note: Battle System is our Alpha Version, the new one is fully animated like the one in Map Mode Tutorial Video!) This is great for those GM that like to do larger sub-dungeons and areas within their campaigns:Dragon Vale Development (build your own ""Kingdom"" for your dragons, with castle and supporting buildings, no build times, just gain resources passively or through other game modes). This was a request by some of our Alpha Players (GM do not have to use this feature in their games but it offers a side-game for wars and conquest type campaigns). We designed it so you don't need to wait months to build up your kingdoms. Meant to focus on wars and conquering areas on the campaign map so it is more combat focused rather than city management (yes we take your requests seriously and try to implement requests as best as we could within the scope of the game and also for general use by GMs):The Dragons (6 Basic Types - Neutral, Fire, Water, Nature, Light, Dark, more branch Dragons coming soon! Hatch and Evolve Dragons. They can eventually bond with your Heroes so both Dragon and Hero gain additional skills and powers! Currently young and adult versions available. Future Content: Elder and Ancient Forms):The Heroes (7 Heroes obtained from current campaign/Story Mode):Beta APK Available after May 20, 2019! If you want to get in on the game early we will be releasing the above completed portions in Open Beta Version through Android.Game Link: COMING SOON! Backers who support us before May 15, 2019 will receive an exclusive character. See our Rewards!90% Completed (Estimated Completion - May 31, 2019):Raiding (raid other ""Kingdoms"" in a tower defense style system using dragons you have to acquire through Map Mode, player's don't actually loose anything through raids but will gain points to advance in the tournaments and events). Video:Game is 100% FREE and not pay to win! You can pay for things to help support us further but it won't affect whether you win or loose in events. Most events are fair for all regardless of when you started playing. Event structure is new campaigns that you start with specific new heroes and enemies. Everyone starting from Day 1 of event have equal chance of winning event so they can acquire new Heroes and Items we release! Players will have opportunity to challenge other players using anything they got but this system will be divided into 2 categories: Those That Paid and Free Users. This way free users will only compete against other free users (though they can also join the Paid Category if they choose but Paid cannot join Free).We started out as a group of D&D players but life hit us somewhere along the line so we can't get together to play. We do play mmo but they often require too much time investment due to game mechanics. We found that we have the skills to create a game on the mobile platform so we began our journey a few years ago. Our skills evolved enough to undertake this project. An RPG that is accessible to all of us via smartphones and tablets. We can play anytime, anywhere (as long as there is a connection or wifi if we want to play with each other). Game is offline as well so we can still play single-player and if GM allows it on their campaigns do offline grinding. Offline grinding will be available option for GM but not recommended for the general player base, as GM may have to balance out the party if they are too far ahead.Here are some sample custom characters from our Alpha Test Event Winners.1. Shadow Mage - Human/Mage - Dark Magic/SummoningCharacter is Advanced Level Character. Has a Metal Golem Construct. Takes up 2 Party Slots when using Golem. Golem is a separate character that the player can customize.Starting Skills: Craft Construct - Golem, Raise Dead, Summon Undead, Dark Bolt, Life Drain.Golem Skills: Power Attack, Impervious Defense, Taunt, Crushing Blow2 - Succubus - Demon - Mage (Dark)Character is Advanced Level Character. Great for those fights with a lot of enemies. She can turn enemies against one and other and prevent them from attacking her. Having the ability to fly means melee attackers cannot target her unless she enters melee combat with them.Starting Skills: Mesmerize (Humanoids), Enchanting Kiss, Vampiric Bite, Flight Combat, Dark Bolt.After completion of Phase 3 we will be implementing a new feature (well an old feature that was removed due to funding issues for offline version). We will revisit this and implement it, as some players have requested it. We started the battle system off as a TCG based system. We will be doing it both as an offline table-top version and an offline/online mobile version. Players will be able to connect to the same lobby and connect to TCG game requests as well as custom campaign requests.Like our Facebook page for updates, info and other material for the game. We will be updating it quite a bit in the coming days.https://fb.me/dcwod","Risks and Challenges:We had many, mostly chasing down bugs (we think we got most of them).  Other challenge is limited memory on devices.  We were slowly upgrading graphics to avoid crashes due to memory.  Still updating to optimize graphics and animations.  It will work on most devices 3 years of newer.  Older devices may work (some do, others don't).  This will always be a challenge, as there are 1000's of devices.  The app is designed with mostly coded features so it will work with older versions of Android as well.Challenges to Multi-Player is server coding.  We have to make sure it is done in a way to avoid hacking.  Also server costs vary depending on users.  We are doing it in a way that it will cost minimal amount for 100 000 user base.  We will upgrade when we get closer to this number.  Currently have a 100 or so players in alpha testing.  This will grow with time, we are taking the slow and steady approach to make sure quality of service stays at it's highest.  We don't want to upset most of the player base with broken updates.  All updates will be thoroughly tested before release.",https://www.kickstarter.com/projects/efury/dragon-chronicles-rpg-for-phones-tablets-part-2?ref=discovery_category_newest,efury/dragon-chronicles-rpg-for-phones-tablets-part-2,"Game Link:https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.dragonchroniclesWe have created this game because distance prevents us from playing our table-top games like we used to and there isn't really any games that are the same feel as a table-top game. Players have fun designing and planning their characters. Game Masters have fun designing worlds and things for players to encounter! If you have played table-top RPG you know what we mean! We have split the project into parts to give backers a more progressive experience. Once a part is funded we aim to bring it into fruition 1-2 weeks after! The wheels have already begun to move so the part is already underway but we hope to do this more quickly so have set our timeline accordingly. We are hoping you have enough faith in us to do a few parts at a time! We left funding minimums per part and have the ideal amount as well. We could have done 1 large campaign but if it doesn't get fully funded the development will be slowed so we decided to split it up to give you a progressively completed product.Part 1 Status:We have had a previous part on here and unfortunately it wasn't funded but we were not stopped! We accomplished a part of it (just took a lot longer than if it were to have been funded!). Part 1 Features:Production Game Available to Try Out - We created a main campaign with dialog, character interaction and a sub-dungeon. We will be adding more to this campaign to show you what you can do with campaigns. We also created a base server with user creation. Right now it is limited to backing up your game data (only if you create a user account in the game).Game can be downloaded for Android (If you don't have an android device, you can use Blue Stacks to play it on a PC). Blue Stacks is a free android emulation environment that lets you play games for Android on the PC.Rewards Note: We have 2 Rewards - Minimum $25 and Minimum $50. If you pledge higher amounts you WILL BE GIVEN BOTH REWARDS! $50 Reward will include the $25 (2 Characters Total).All Pledges: All Pledges will receive a Premium Account Upgrade. It will activate additional perks in game (Version 1.25 will have the Premium Benefits added in).Part 2 (This Project) - What we hope to accomplish with your help.Player-Side: Create custom online characters. Players that have created a user account in the game will be able to create their first Custom Characters. These will be different than the Custom Characters from this project rewards. They will be given base templates and bonus Stat Points to create their Playable Characters. Full Custom Characters will be available to Premium Accounts, GM Accounts, and Custom Characters from here.Utility: We will be creating a small campaign to allow players to test out their characters. They earn Character Points by playing and can use to make additional characters. We will also have an arena style challenge system so players can challenge other player characters.Whats Next?Any additional funding goes to the subsequent parts to the project. We have outlined the parts below.Part 3 - GM Side (Will be launched once this project has been fully funded or Over-Funded!)Goal: $1500GM Templates - allows GM's to create campaigns based on a variety of templates. They can change enemies, dialog, and event trigger points. Send join invites to players on Friends List.Player Side - Friends List allows players to add friends via messaging system and join games.Part 4 - Custom GM Campaigns (Will be launched when Part 3 is funded!)Goal: $2000Full Custom Campaign - GM can submit their own maps to use. They can mark enemy placements and trigger locations. Dialog, loot and other elements also can be selected by GM.Part 5 & 6 - Chat, Advanced Messages, Player Trading, Player Shops, Player TavernsGoal: $10 000Above mentioned features (some new added from our last project information). Will offer players a way to trade with one and other, earn gold, gain crafted items, and mercenaries in their taverns.Part 7 - Conversion to IOS and Browser Based Game, Sound/Graphics Enhanced VersionGoal: $5000 to $20000These features may not be for everyone but will increase the player base. IOS devices will be able to play as well on the same Server! We will be enhancing Sound and Graphics for the game as well. Will be starting development on a Browser Based version of the game for those times when a phone and tablet is inaccessible! Again this is changed from previous project based on feedback from our Alpha and Beta players.Total Ideal Funding: $34 000Divided into parts so Backers know progress is being made and reinforcing their faith in us!Game is live! We hope to get your help to get it to where we want it before the year ends! The link is available at the top and a short game play video is on here as well. Here are some new screenshots:","No real risks, as this is an indie project and is built on time mainly.  We have purchased assets in the past so now just doing things timely is a challenge.  Funding will be used to outsource some of the work to other developers so we can finish the updates more quickly and get them to players for testing!"

Following the destruction of the Temple, the Jedi Order has had to flee to the Outer Rim to regain their strength. Meanwhile, the Jedi High Council has retreated to a remote planet in the Outer Rim, where the rest of the Order do not know. A small group of Jedi have been tasked with transporting a Holocron to the Jedi Order, which details the location of the Jedi High Council. Gaining knowledge of this, the Sith Emperor sends and edit squadron of Sith: the Shadow Knights to hunt down and acquire the Holocron. Then return to Morriband so the Emperor can bring a swift end to the Jedi High Council.What is:The Shadow Knights? The Shadow Knights is a Star Wars fan film, that is approximately 20-30 minutes long from the script review. This is intended to be an extremely high-quality and professional film. Making sure that every detail from effects to costume is the best quality it can be. So although it is a fan film, it looks and feels like a true Star Wars film made by Lucasfilm.What does funding do? Your funding will contribute to every part of this project. The lightsabers and other props; the high-quality costumes and make up; the camera equipment to provide a top quality cinematic experience and the food and accommodation for the cast and crew as this will be a 3-4 day shoot.When willeverything be happening? As soon as the project has (hopefully) completed Kickstarter I will finish the pre-production stage and go into production in December/January. After production has been completed post-production will begin straight away, with the release projected for May 4th 2017 - on Star Wars Day.What will be released? There will be several products released from The Shadow Knights. Firstly and mainly will be the full film, which will be released on YouTube. Followed by several behind-the-scenes videos and some extra videos for those who donate!Everyone who is involved on this project are fans of Star Wars and are passionate about filmmaking as well as experienced in filmmaking. We are eternally grateful for everyone who donates and want to bring the best fan film to the world! Thank you once again and please donate!!","There are several risks in this project that I and people in the crew will be able to over come.1) Filming on a tight schedule: as most of the equipment will be rented we only have 4 days of filming with the funding we are requesting. However, I have lots of experience in dealing with fast paced environment filming that will help to complete production in those 4 days.2) The 4 day shoot will have to be consecutive days and so this means that we will have to make sure all actors are around during this time, which is why we have allowed a few months for filming.3) The challenge with making the film look as professional and Star Wars-like as possible will be making it look as realistic as possible, which is why we are using high quality equipment and need to use a mixture of special and visual effects to pull it off.",https://www.kickstarter.com/projects/kiallgarrett/the-joker-a-short-film?ref=discovery_category_newest,kiallgarrett/the-joker-a-short-film,"This film is based on characters from the DC Universe.The film begins with Commissioner Jim Gordon entering Arkham Asylum, with the intent to find out what information the Joker has on the mysterious 'Ghetto Killings' in Gotham City.

As it becomes ever more hostile...As writer and director for the film, I intend to bring to life one of the best villains in history. In an intense short film, where we meet a Joker like never seen before; going through different emotions and hostility. This project will be one of the most intense and story driven fan films seen to date, combined with the excellent cast and crews involved!This short film requires a small budget, to cover the costs of location, and for paying the cast and crew for their participation in the film - as well as hiring of equipment. Over the process of the Kickstarter, I will be releasing small behind the scenes videos, to show you how we are making the film and what has gone into the process so far.We have filmed the teaser trailer to give the audience a brief view of the Joker and the style of the film.

As we want to film in a asylum/police type environment it is very difficult to find the right location for this. However, we have nearly shortlisted a few options!Another challenge, will be bringing the character of the Joker to life for the fans of the DC Universe!

https://www.kickstarter.com/projects/1087077655/floras-organics?ref=discovery_category_newest,1087077655/floras-organics,"Thank you to Jared at http://www.redchapcreative.comfor donating his time to create our video. You can also view the video on youtube athttp://youtu.be/5bwinBEj-3cHere is a little about why I want to open an organic nursery in Bakersfield, how I will make it work, and what I'll do with the funds. Please send me a message if you have questions.Market Situation:Non-organic nursery stock has been shown to kill or damage individual bees, beehives, and native pollinators. Beehives are collapsing at an unprecedented rate. The U.S. Department of Agriculture says that beekeepers have been losing approximately one-third of their hives each year. But word of hive losses in the 70-90 percent range were reported last winter. Of the 55 nurseries in Bakersfield and Kern County (8,161 square miles), none are certified organic.This leaves a dearth of certified organic nursery plants and seeds for the local organic gardener to choose from. This lack of access to certified organic nursery stock leaves the whole county's bees vulnerable, and local homeowners and gardeners without options. Here in the breadbasket of the nation, this is just unconscionable.Our Solution:Stop killing native bees and other pollinators due to the use of conventional nursery stock. By using certified organic nursery stock, seeds, and supplies you can eliminate the risk of your garden poisoning native bees and pollinators.  Organic, open-pollinated varieties of native and pollinator attracting plants will bring new wonders to your garden, increase the nutrition and decrease chemicals in your food, and let the bees and other pollinators thrive.Market Definition: Bakersfield and Kern County area (population 865,000).  Organic gardeners, homeowners, environmentalists. We will obtain a USDA Certified Organic License. USDA certified nurseries are non-existent in Kern county at this time. We will be first to market with such a concept in this large metropolitan area.Market Size: A recent survey by the National Gardening Association showed that approximately 17 percent of America's gardeners use organic methods only. Many others use a spectrum of conventional and organic mixes. According to the 2009 survey, almost a third of American households intended to grow food that year, a 19% increase over 2008. So if one-third of people in Bakersfield and Kern County garden, and 17% of those do so organically, that would be approximately 45,000 organic gardeners with little to no access to certified organic nursery stock in their local area. Ordering organic nursery stock by internet is expensive, especially when shipping costs are added. I can provide a better local product at a comparable price.  I hope to gain 25% of the organic market in Kern, since there are no current operators; the internet is the primary competitor.  If each of approximately 11,250 customers purchased $10 worth of products that would equal a market value of$112,500 per annum. Market Plan: I will establish vendors in Bakersfield, including Farmer's Markets and retail establishments.  I will use these vendors until I make enough profit to rent my own retail space.  I will begin the start-up by buying supplies September 1, 2014 and begin selling plants October 15, 2014.There is a long fall gardening season here, and in fact it is year-round if one so desired. I will raise the plants on my own 1/4 acre property. I will use the cash flow from plant sales to purchase seed and supplies for the spring 2015 planting season. I will also buy certified organic seed in bulk, repackage it, and resale it.  I will begin selling Spring plants and seeds in early March or April 2015, depending upon the weather.  This fall/spring cycle will continue, with increasing sales and stock each year, as I plan to reinvest a minimum of 50% of profits into the business. If necessary, I will reinvest more. I will keep the remaining profits for my salaryfor the first two years. After that, I will reassess my budget, as business and cash flow increase.Startup Budget:Nursery License -    $150Organic Certification - $1,500Supplies -           $1,800Postage -           $100Fees, taxes -        $400Rewards. -          $50Total Budget -        $4,000 first year startup costs.","Obstacles that I will face are those that all farmers face:  weather, pests, and disease could strike.  I will mitigate some of the weather issues by growing starts in a small greenhouse.

Our first nursery season was the fall 2014 garden planting season. We sold plants throughout October and November and also donated $750 worth of plants to three community garden related non-profits in Bakersfield. We didn't make much profit, but we sold over $1,000 worth of plants besides our donations. Right now, we have a critical need for a greenhouse to start our spring plants in. I already have purchased seed and some of the flats I will need for spring/summer planting season, but I need soil and a small greenhouse to get the plants ready early enough in the season to have them ready before, or at least on par with the big box stores to be competitive.I will spend approximately $400 for a 10 foot by 20 foot greenhouse, and $150 for 12 bags of Coco Loco planting medium from Fox Farm Fertilizers, the best in the business for potting soil, planting medium, and fertilizers. I have some fertilizer to use as I need it for the spring/summer crop of transplants. The planting medium I use for my transplants, Coco Loco will feed the plants for about 30 days before they need supplemental organic food.Note: This video was made for another project, but is still correct in all but the funding amount. I have reduced it to $600. Thank you to Jared at http://www.redchapcreative.com for donating his time to create our video.  You can also view the video on youtube at http://youtu.be/5bwinBEj-3cNon-organic nursery stock has been shown to kill or damage individual bees, beehives, and native pollinators. Beehives are collapsing at an unprecedented rate. The U.S. Department of Agriculture says that beekeepers have been losing approximately one-third of their hives each year. But word of hive losses in the 70-90 percent range were reported last winter. Of the 50 nurseries in Bakersfield and Kern County (8,161 square miles), none are certified organic.This leaves a dearth of organic nursery plants and seeds for the local organic gardener to choose from. This lack of access to organic nursery stock leaves the whole county's bees vulnerable, and local homeowners and gardeners without options. Here in the breadbasket of the nation, this is just unconscionable.Our Solution:Stop killing native bees and other pollinators due to the use of conventional nursery stock. By using organic nursery stock, seeds, and supplies you can eliminate the risk of your garden poisoning native bees and pollinators. Organic, open-pollinated varieties of native and pollinator attracting plants will bring new wonders to your garden, increase the nutrition and decrease chemicals in your food, and let the bees and other pollinators thrive.What we need:We are still working on the Flora's Organics Nursery Project. We need soil and a greenhouse for the spring growing season. Flora's was just Certified Naturally Grownin late November as well as became a licensed nursery in November. We are ready to go, but are low on cash due to a poor marketing campaign in fall. We plan to have a better marketing campaign this season, as well as our website at http://www.tinyurl.com/organic-nursery. Flora's needs your help to make a good profit in spring and summer. We are taking pre-orders for the spring/summer growing season now on our website, so if you can't donate to us here, please order plants from us and help us with our cash flow situation. Every dollar can be put toward spring's supplies.We should still be able to get our USDA certification within two years if we make a profit in spring.  I will invest this entire amount in a greenhouse and soil to plant the trays I currently have with the seed I currently have.I am asking for a total of $600. $150 for soil, $400 for a greenhouse, and $50 for rewards.Another aspect of this project is trying to raise awareness in the central valley about the plight of the bees and pollinators and what they do for us. ","Obstacles that I will face are those that all farmers face: weather, pests, and disease could strike. I will mitigate some of the weather issues by growing starts in a small greenhouse. I will combat pests and disease through organic means only, which means possibly discarding infected plants if they pose a danger to the rest of the crop. My 40 years experience with agriculture and horticulture will serve me well if these problems strike.I do not expect to reach my full client base until at least the fall of 2015, so there will be little profit for the first year.

Only with ePub3 can you use HTML5, CSS3 and JavaScript to create projects that will gain you long-lasting followers. In addition, since our Embellisher Mobile Publishing platform is the most secure sales platform available, you won't be losing your profit to pirates.As a reader supporter, you'll get free copies of all four of these unique satirical stories as well as future access to all present and future eBooks available in the Embellisher eReader Library.By joining our support team in this unique hybrid publishing project, you can use all the tools we have in our ePub3 Creator Studio, and any other tools you might have, to create a final project in any of four entertaining categories. Our theme isTHE HORRORS, FANTASIES AND SCIENCE FICTIONS OF LIFE IN THE TRUMP ERA.The four project story categories are:Read over each category and determine what you can best provide in the way of support. If you're just a reader, then you may opt for our Reader level of support. If you're an author, then you can join at this level. Finally, we have one Administrator member for each of the four levels of participation.So, let me show you the old paradigm that my rival publishers adhere to:1.  Publisher controls the content of the eBook.2.  Publisher controls the pricing of the eBook.3.  Publisher controls the royalty agreement between the authors (you) and him.  Most of the time, it favors (guess who) him.4.  Publisher controls the cash flow (where the money goes) and is in charge of how much and when you (the creator) get your “royalty” trickle-downs.What they don’t tell anybody is that when your best-seller gets pirated and becomes free out here in digital land (in about say, three hours after it’s for sale on Amazon), he can simply turn off the cash-flow spigot to you.  What’s worse, most publishers don’t pay an author any advance payments for digital copies sold.  He makes the first profits from the idiots who paid for the initial digital copies, and he’s not worried at all about who gets paid later on.Well, I’m worried about later on, and you should be too!Here’s the new publishing paradigm for those of us worried about the creator’s share of the publishing pie:1.  Publisher/Author (you) controls the eBook content (yeah—especially important with ePub3 multimedia content).2.Publisher/Author and reader (those you market to in order to help you create your content) control the price of the eBook (the best and fairest way to handle this by far!). 3.  Since you’re the publisher and author in one, you don’t need a fancy contract that was always devised (under the old publishing paradigm) to rip-off the creators of content (the old you).  In fact, in our platform, you can sell your content without even using the antiquated ISBN (since you’re not using middlemen).4.  The most important part of this new paradigm means you control the pay-out of sales right inside your publishing application.  In addition, since we use the Stripe payment system, you get to keep 97% of the price you affix to the content of your new ePub3 book!  So, we’re even screwing over our old pal, Paypal, who charges more for each sale. Finally, you'll also get your anthology story published through EMRE Publishing's Vearsa International eBook Sales Channels. Our authors’ eBooks are marketed through our Vearsa distribution system to over 1,000 online retailers and over 65,000 libraries around the world.  We can create inexpensive print and hard copies as well as multimedia ePub3 eBooks to give our authors an additional “power house” of marketing forces to work for them 24/7.The way our system will work is that I will give you a general idea of the tools you’ll be using to create your ePub3 eBook, and I will also kickstart you with a basic story idea.  Of course, you don’t have to follow my idea, and you can always make one up on your own, but I would like to keep the theme of these multimedia experiences the same for consistency.If you literally “buy in” to a story, through Kickstarter, then you will be given access to the premium version of my Embellisher ™ ePub3 Creator Studio, where you will all be working together on your creation. When we surpass the goal, the extra money in each group will go to your team for marketing and promotion costs.You will have the choice of being a “reader” (no editing function), an “author” (editing and creation access), or an “administrator” (control over pricing and money aspect of the creation).  Since being the administrator is tantamount to being a publisher, in the old school definition of publishing, this person must be a savvy business person who can provide the extra development tools that might be needed to create the final product.  However, since the entire enterprise is a team job, whoever is appointed administrator must answer to the authors and readers in a democratic way.  In a sense, this is the hybrid model of publishing.For example, if more authors and readers want to price the final eBook higher, then the administrator must agree to that.  For all intents and purposes, the administrator will simply be a working executive who applies the “will of the members.”  Hey, I told you this wasn’t the Trump way of doing business! So, without further ado, here is the overall theme of our anthology of multimedia products:THE HORRORS, FANTASIES AND SCIENCE FICTIONS OF LIFE IN THE TRUMP ERAAs you can assume, we’re going to stick with the fictional genres of horror, fantasy and science fiction to tell our stories in this anthology.  Also, since each story will be sold separately inside our Embellisher ™ app, it would be nice to cross-promote with the other authors in order to maximize the social promotions of your titles. Since there are no limits to the numbers of readers and authors to create the stories (no limit on length of story, either), you will be building a potential marketing team as well. EMRE Publishing, LLC will be giving more financial support based on the numbers of members, so you'll be able to leverage more marketing and ad dollars by supporting your category. As you’ll see, each category of story will be different enough to make each eBook an interesting purchase on its own merit.I will now give you the four category assignments, so you can see what you’ll be doing in the way of creation.  Afterward, I will explain the way you’ll be participating if you’re a reader, author or administrator.Story Category 1:  The Pussy-Grabbing PresidentThe idea is to create a parody of our current president, Donald J. Trump in both written and visual form.  Next, the “pussies” being grabbed in this interactive game won’t be X-rated (fewer sales opportunities); plus, it’s too damned sexist.  No, I suggest that you create animal cats that our president must grab in order to “win the game.”  In other words, the president will be the game player avatar, and he will be tasked with grabbing the most pussies in a certain time frame.  Another way to do this is to provide personal stories of horror, science fiction and fantasy based on the sexist flavor of the current White House. What has happened in your life to cause fear of sexism and acts of violence against women? You can incorporate video and audio in these stories.This is where your team’s creativity can take-off on its own.  Will you have different levels of play?  Will you incorporate augmented reality or interactive animation?  Or, will it be a simple game play engine?  This is where you need to work with your administrator to figure out the costs of what you’ll be creating.  What you create will, of course, determine how much you will charge the buyer to play your ePub3 game.Story Category 2:  Jared Kushner’s Big Adventure (not to be confused with Peewee Herman)This eBook will incorporate our unique “insert story” tool that’s included in every author-level studio interface.  The plot will be the many hats that Trump’s son-in-law, Jared Kushner, has to wear in the White House.  What kind of misadventures can happen to him as he attempts to circumnavigate his many different roles?  Let the reader (user) choose inside your story what will happen next.Again, you’ll need to decide how to create a unique parody of Jared in both written and visual form.  Then, what are the different job “hats” he must wear and what kinds of choices (and their results) will be programmed into your eBook?Another method would be again tell personal stories of how Jared Kushner's responsibilities have affected or might affect your life. Again, you can use AR and VR as well as conventional video and music playlists to tell your story.Story Category 3:  Ivanka Trump’s Shopping ChannelThis story will show how Trump’s daughter, Ivanka, gets special permission to set-up her own shopping channel inside the White House!  What will she sell, and how will she sell it?  Does the reader get to do anything interactively?  Maybe Ivanka’s channel will be better than the home shopping network.  Perhaps it’ll be an augmented or virtual reality experience.  Whatever happens in your eBook, the reader must become a participant in some way.The second method is to do a personal horror, fantasy or science fiction story about what Ivanka Trump's businesses do to people in America. For example, many women decided to boycott Nordstrom because they sold a line of Ivanka's clothing.Story Category 4:  The First Lady’s War on BullyingHere we have a story that pits our new First Lady, Melania Trump, against all those online and cell phone bullies out there.  You can also use her son, Barron, who can help her in her effort to “flush out bullies” in humorous sting operations.  Please remember that you must create parodies of Melania and Barron (you don’t want to get sued by Trump Enterprises!).  Again, you must create all the inter-activities the reader must go through as well as what results from the story-lines.  Will it be a game or a “choose your own adventure”?  The cost of your final product will determine how much your eBook will contain!The second way to handle this story is to tell your personal stories of bullying and discrimination (or you family's). How ludicrous is it to have somebody like Melania Trump telling people to stop trolling on the Internet? What are the real causes of bullying and what can be done about it? You tell the story that really matters!Included in your team package for each category will be the following:1.  Premium access in the ePub3 Creator Studio (includes all the tools and tutorials therein).  This studio can also be used to create all promotions that are covered in the “marketing tutorials.”  Note:  Readers will not have editing privileges.2.  Free copy of my eBook Running with the Big Dogs:  A Creator’s Guide to Using Electronic Media.  This book contains online sources where you can get copyright-free media to use in your projects.  All members will also have instant access inside their library to free eBooks that cover what ePub3 formatting can do by using CSS3, HTML5 and interactive (JavaScript) components. You can also use open source AR and VR tools available online.3.  Premium access to the Embellisher ™ ePub3 eReader where your final project will be sold.4.  Premium access to the Embellisher ™ Forum where you can communicate with your team in private.In addition, your Administrator will have access to the back-end portion of our platform where all the administrative work can be done for your team such as pricing your project and establishing the Stripe payment options.  The administrator will also see what the direct sales are and can instantly publish this information to all team members.Although there will be no limitations to the Reader level membership on your team, as they will be your future audience who can assist in your social marketing promotions, there are limited numbers to the Author and Administrator functions.  There can only be five authors and one administrator included on each team.The best thing about this project is that our anthology has no definite time limit. You establish your timeline for completion as a team. In fact, even if your team finishes before the other three project categories, you can start your promotion and sales before them. The most advantageous feature of Mobile ePublishing is that it is extremely flexible--both for the creator and for the reader!Join us today. We would love to see what you can create.","The risk of publication is simple:  If your reader doesn't enjoy the experience of interacting with your project, then he or she won't purchase any more of your work.  Since this adventure will be showing you how to use our Embellisher Mobile Publishing and Marketing platform, we're hoping you can work well with others to create the best ePub3 title possible.  If you don't have any experience with ePub3, then you may not want to take on the role of Author and become a Reader supporter instead.  Each category needs workers who can provide the best expertise, so be certain you can do this.  Otherwise, your team's final project may have little chance of creating sales.",https://www.kickstarter.com/projects/660431472/our-golden-gang-comedy-and-satire-anthology-series?ref=discovery_category_newest,660431472/our-golden-gang-comedy-and-satire-anthology-series,"Setting: Mar-a-Lago Club, Palm Beach, FloridaCharacters: Trumpie ""Golden Boy"" Trump, Jeff Sessions, Melania Knauss, Stevie Mnuchin, Betsy Prince, Sarah Huckabee, Benny Carson, Ricky Perry, Kellyanne Fitzpatrick, Mikey Pence, Jimmy Mattis, Rex Tillerson, and Petey our dog.This will be an anthology of short stories that depicts “Our Gang-type” plots using the above characters.  President Trump’s rich pals will be playing inside the luxurious confines of Mar-a-Lago.  Every summer, Donnie ""Golden Boy"" Trump invites all his friends to spend a couple of months at his big club in Palm Beach, Florida.  Guests from around the world stay there, and the kids in Trump's ""Our Golden Gang"" get into plenty of mischief.  Although they will be depicted as children, these characters will keep their adult names.Each child will be a mixture of the adult’s persona and the Our Golden Gang character’s persona.  He or she will be a child, however, and the troubles they get into at Mar-a-Lago will be childish in nature.  Satire is accepted, but humor will be the thread of enjoyment throughout each story in this anthology.Writers who submit can use old plots from the Our Gang films and update them to fit the present (technology, clothing, etc.).  Stories are set in present day, although don't give specific dates.  Villains can be people from the present (Hillary Clinton, Barack Obama, Vladimir Putin, etc.), or you can invent others. The first anthology in the series is called The He-Man Woman-Haters Club. All stories must mention this club in the story, although the club need not be the main emphasis in the plot. There will be eight stories in each volume of the series.Listen to the title story of our first anthology by the publisher, James Musgrave:Here's the second story by Marleen S. Barr called ""Little Trumpie and His Golden Guy Gang (Temporarily Including Melania) Run Amok At Mar-a-Lago."" Marleen S. Barr--who has published several Trump stories including contributions to Alternative Truths and Trump: Utopia and Dystopia--is known for her pioneering work in feminist science fiction and teaches English at the City University of New York. The third story is by Bruce Harris and is called ""The Bigly Bout."" Trump decides to fight that kid from Russia, Vladimir Putin. Bruce Harris is the author of Sherlock Holmes and Dr. Watson: About Type.From the Publisher “Give me a child until he is 7, and I will show you the man.”  This quote by Aristotle, the Greek philosopher, could very well apply to one Donald John Trump, current President of the United States.  I worked on this premise in order to create the series I call Our Golden Gang.  The idea was modeled on those old comedies by Hal Roach Studios starring Spanky and his gang of Depression-Era kids.  Instead of poor kids, however, my kids were going to be a bunch of rich, entitled kids, who just so happen to be affiliated with the Washington White House.Their leader, of course, is the king of the Baby Boomer’s entitled generation, Donny “The Golden Boy” Trump.  The setting is none other than the secluded Mar-a-Lago Country Club in Palm Beach Florida, where Our Golden Gang is invited by Donny Trump to spend their summer vacation.I decided to make all of the children in my series limited to ages 8 through 10.  This, of course, is not realistic to the actual age differences of the characters being parodied in my stories.  Also, since these stories are parodies, they have exaggerated the real-life characters’ attributes in order to affect humor and satirical insight into our society and its ways. Just as television shows have done this to great success, including The Simpsons, Southpark, Family Guy and even Monty Python’s Flying Circus, we also hope to create a short story “show” that will give people a lot of belly laughs and make them think twice about the issues presented “below the surface” of all the humor and satire.Another point of departure from the usual publishing fare is the fact that we will be publishing our series in paperback first, and our digital issue will be included free for our readers who buy the paper version.  Why do this?  Piracy of eBooks sold through mainstream channels has become epidemic, and as publisher, I’ve decided to keep the integrity and sales of this series sacrosanct and as secure as technologically possible.  Of course, there is no digital security that can be 100 percent safe from piracy.  However, since my digital versions of Our Golden Gang books will also be sold as “enhanced” multimedia experiences, it stands to reason that my readers will want to read on a digital eReader that provides ePub3 technology.  My trademarked “Embellisher eReader” will allow readers to experience interactivity, regular, VR and AR videos, as well as music playlists that accompany the stories’ themes and characters.The enhanced version of the Our Golden Gang volumes will be able to be purchased once they are published.  They will pop-up in the reader’s library desktop inside the application.  As a publisher, I believe this is a brilliant “end around” the mainstream blokes like Amazon, who seem to be ignoring the security end of publishing.  This ignorance loses money for both authors and publishers, and makes readers look like fools.I hope to perhaps establish a new generation of innovative publishing for publishers who will use this technology for their own purposes to protect their investment and to also provide the highest royalties to their authors.I hope you enjoy this first volume in our series.  It’s called The He-Man Woman-Haters Club.  I wrote the title story, and I wrote it in honor of my father, now deceased, who was a Pearl Harbor Survivor.  Needless to say, there was no love lost for the Japanese around our house for quite some time after World War Two.  However, my father eventually grew to respect and even admire the Japanese and their culture, just as one would expect any normally intelligent person to do.  I knew our president was not “normally intelligent.”  In fact, if he is indeed a fully developed narcissist, then his reaction to the Japanese and their culture would probably turn out to be something similar to what I have created in my story.  The fact is, many of us do not grow out of our prejudices.  As our previous president stated in his much-heralded tweet, ""No one is born hating another person because of the color of his skin or his background or his religion,"" the tweet reads. It was posted along with a photo of Obama looking up to a window of children of different ethnicities and races.  Of course, a narcissist always sees the world through his own prejudices and never bends to the “other.”  This is both sad and funny, in that it’s sad to have somebody who thinks this way in a role of leadership, and yet it is quite humorous to show this person for whom he really is.","The challenge to getting satire accepted is having a readership who enjoys intelligent and funny stories.  We hope that by distributing and selling our digitally enhanced version of our series in our Embellisher (TM) ePub3 eReader, we can communicate directly with our readership in order to hear what they like and don't like.  There's a Forum built inside our app where readers can share.You can register for our eReader (free) here:  https://emrepublishing.com/embellisher-ereader/Donors will receive a copy of the final print edition of our first anthology in the series and/or a digital enhanced copy of our ePub3 version."

Between the loss of all but one cub to a deadly disease and humans settling into their territory, his Shaitani (demon) interrupts his uneasy thoughts with taunts and provocation to force the King to utilize its power against the humans encroach. A power that comes at a price.While the series starts with Shujaa he is but a supporting character as the story revolves around his only cub,Malaika, as he finds himself while being taunted by his own Shaitani.",Finances are the biggest issue with this project.

This was great as it kept the dream alive whilst I was learning the art of animation, lighting, modelling etc.Indeed I also story-boarded and modeled 90% of the film during this time.This is the right time to dedicate 100% of my time to the project, now that all the technical learning is complete, and these odd jobs have reduced in frequency..Keep my time on the project, to speed up each episodes release.Continue my track record of delivering episodes.Additional funds will allow me to hire the remaining voice actors.Additional funds allow faster production of the animation frames.Even more funds will allow me to sub contract some of the work out..If you can't contribute, but want to help, please consider the following:Like the facebook page https://www.facebook.com/scififunk?ref=hl.Tell others about this page, link to it in social media.Subscribe to the Youtube channel. https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCNm-mszn_0h3cDSa0I9ViDwTell others about this channel, link to it in social media.Use the Kickstarter share tools..","During Production There are almost no risks associated with funding this project. I am healthy and dedicated to seeing this project complete. Only lack of funds can prevent this.  Coming from an IT and musical background I am used to solving the many issues that crop up during the making of an animation.  I will continue to keep up regular dialogue with followers on Kickstarter and Facebook.The process it's self is setting up lighting rigs, animation and rendering. During Reward Fulfillment. I don't anticipate issues as most of the rewards are online.The photos of Steve Malore will be sent out recorded delivery (signed for), so you can be confident they will arrive. Have any Questions?

The song is currently available for streaming on all media platforms such as, iTunes, Apple Music, Spotify & More. With your help I plan on creating a music video with great quality like the lyric video. I plan on shooting myself, as a director, my first music video with a choreographed dancer who just recently came off tour as a backup dancer for Genuwine (a popular R&B singer back in the 90's). I plan on enhancing the video with great effects and awesome B footage (If all works out will even have a white Lamborghini in the video shot as well). Thanks to all that support and wish to see this vision of mine come to life. Its been a fun journey so far as I continue to learn and progress in this field. As a singer/song writer, rapper, co-producer, and now videographer, as I will be shooting the video myself, your support will be more than just funds, but, that motivation to keep on going and belief that the music is good, the quality is good and that I should keep going.Thank you","The risks and challenges that come with completing my project will be learning my camera and equipment as well as, lighting and angles since I will be directing my own music video. I am prepared to overcome these challenges through research, studying and constant learning and practice of the equipment and camera which I am doing on a daily bases.

Factions of players meet weekly to determine the fate of the land, and the game will be held in a mixed medium of voice and text based roleplaying through a custom designed website.Ophilus is a world torn asunder. The Daemons of the underworld have torn a scar deep into the planet, and pour out in their multitudes, seeking to destroy the celestial realm of the clouds, the home of the Angels. The Angels were caught off guard, and much territory was lost. Now the world is divided between the two mortal enemies, and between them, humanity continues to exist, some turning to the word of The Creator, and his Angelic protection. Others turning to Daemon worship to secure a place in the Dark Army. A small fraction forgoing either side of the conflict, and seeking to defend their independence. In Halo/Horn, you take on the role of an Angel or a Daemon in the midst of this war, and will help determine the fate of Ophilus. Halo-Horn is a story of angels and daemons struggling to control a magical land filled with resource, chaos, mystery and destruction. Entirely live, players will meet on a weekly basis in order to role-play through a changing story with a group of others from their faction- Angels or Daemons. Their decisions in game with effect the storyline and the rise and fall of power throughout the empire. Experienced GMs will help direct the flow of player movement, as well as providing NPCs, items, and monsters for the players to encounter. Once monthly there will be a battle, in which the factions will face off for dominance over land, throne and gods. There are going to be some awesome and interesting gameplay mechanics, including players being paired off to make combat teams with viable powers, player subfactions within the main grouping, and everything from assassination attempts to weddings that change the face of the game. We will be running on a 2xD6 gameplay system, entirely designed by our lead GM, so the stakes are high!Though the running of this kickstarter we hope to create an awesome website, that will have all events clearly listed and recapped for those who missed the game. The websites will be password protected so that factions have the ability to make game plans without the other side knowing what's going on. They will also have built in chat capability and private team speaks, so that games can be run smoothly. We would also like to fund the creation of Lorebooks, one for the Angels and one for the Daemons, complete with illustrations, charts and stats, gameplay ideas to help players get a one up over each other, PVP ideas, and general information about the land and characters in it, and special edition dice and game card sets such as these angel and daemon dice below, available in the sets and rewards.If possible and if money is raised, we're hoping to release this game around Christmas 2014, with pre game and warm-up games starting as early as October. STRETCH GOALS!-$5000 Fully illustrated Lore Books detailing the history of the setting will be made available to players for every faction in the game.-$7500 HUMANS will be added to the game as a third and also playable faction with their own ranks and mechanics. -$10000 After our heads are done exploding, we will contract a songwriter to create a full Official Soundtrack for Halo-Horn games, which will be played in the background of gaming sessions and made free to download by all players. We will also start writing a novel of the game's exploits, which will be published yearly as an online fiction with all backers listed as coauthors. We will also attempt to have fully player run battles added to the game, and an all nighter launch party with drawprizes!","Scheduling and managing large games will be difficult for all of our staff, but we couldn't be more excited!",https://www.kickstarter.com/projects/1311709695/thought-empire-roleplaying-community?ref=discovery_category_newest,1311709695/thought-empire-roleplaying-community,"Roleplaying has always been a favorite pass time of mine, and it has always depressed me that it's so hard to find a place where I can feel like I've developed enough as part of a community to enjoy being part of games with friends. I've role-played games from space action to DND, to fan-fiction and LARPING, but I know that the best, (in my opinion the only) way to truly enjoy a game is to know that the people you're playing it with are your friends.That's why I'd like to start the project Thought Empire, a place where role-plays of all sorts will be hosted through every online medium- forum, voice chat, regular chat, even texting if you get to know people well enough. This website will allow gamers to be themselves, and people (like me) who don't really have the resources or skills to go out into the community and play big games with skilled veterans of a particular role-play style to steamroll us.Thought Empire will feature several components, including a login system, aforum, a live and private chat, and a private TeamSpeak. We'll also take advantage of the high quality website to enjoy time getting to know eachother- connecting by playing games like Cards Against Humanity and setting up small games with only a few players to enjoy.Anyone and everyone will be welcome to post their game ideas. The website will be byapplicationonly, so hopefully only people who truly care about playing will get involved.Here are some hypothetical ideas of what pages on Thought Empire might look like, based on a small website of the same title between myself and the people who will become Staff on the completed project. This is an Enjin website, but ours will (hopefully) be entirely created and hosted on our own.Check out the rewards, and please give wholeheartedly, as well as share this page around so we can all have as much fun as possible!STRETCH GOAL- At $1000 I'll release an album on the website with tracks of music that should help inspire your gaming and serve as background for the live games. ","As with all websites, one of our greatest risks will be the technical issues associated with the changing times.Another risk will be that we run out of donation money and cannot continue to fund the website.A final risk will be that Staff may have conflicting schedules and not always be present, making weekly games hard to schedule. However, there will be a solid few of us so at least one should always be online in time for the games."

https://www.kickstarter.com/projects/1439173011/mckenzie-files?ref=discovery_category_newest,1439173011/mckenzie-files,"I am trying to raise the funds to create an animated feature of my science fiction series, McKenzie Files. McKenzie Files is a series currently consisting of three books. McKenzie Files, book one. Assassination Anxiety, McKenzie Files book two. And the soon to be released Obliteration, McKenzie Files book three. McKenzie Files is a series that is growing in popularity across the globe. My goal for this animation project is to create a series of small episodes from book one in order to generate a greater interest for a much larger project. Also, budget concerns have forced me to aim for creating a smaller animated feature from one or two chapters from the book rather that doing the entire book all at once. I am already working with an animation artist located in California (Terrence Walker of Studio ArtFX) to help produce this project. The McKenzie fan base is very strong and growing. The books have gotten several highly rated reviews. So I have full confidence that an animated version will have a very strong appeal.Below is a brief outline of the story.Chapter one introduces characters Sergeant Colin McKenzie and Trooper Ed Driscol. Evil Reploids working for the separatist organization, Vendetta. Vendetta is also working with the Brelac Empire in their war against the United protectorate. Colin and Driscol are on a mission on the planet Meridan to prevent a platoon of Protectorate troopers from capturing the cargo of a crashed Brelac shuttle. During a violent confrontation Driscol uses his freezing ability to kill one trooper, while Colin reveals his deadly electrical powers. Driscol is gunned down and killed by the troopers. In the middle of the fight the two reptilian Brelac occupants of the shuttle emerge with weapons in hand. They begin to open fire on everyone in the area. Colin joins the protectorate troopers in killing the Brelac. He is then assaulted and beaten unconscious by his commanding officer, Lieutenant Paul Yates.The story moves to the city of Navarone on the planet Maseklos Prime. Capital world of the United Protectorate. Doctor Howard Fenlow Is meeting in his laboratory with members of the Protectorate’s Central Commission, Major General Verne Larkin, and the President of the Protectorate, Sandra Drennen. Fenlow is joined by young medical doctor Blair Van Doren and computer scientist Doctor Art Trevor.  Fenlow explains that some of the Reploids who have been committing terrorist acts possess arcane psionic powers granted by small electoinic implants in their brains that augment psychic abilities. He shows them three cylinders containing Reploids that were captured on the planet Meridan. Fenlow’s plan is to have them reprogrammed so that they can serve the Protectorate military. The plan is approved by Drennen. The three Reploids are to be transported to Starbase Lodestar so that the project can be developed safely. Later that day Fenlow returns to his apartment and gets a message from his boss, Walter Carnaby. C.E.O of Carp Techlologies. carnaby wants to advance the timetable for his plan, Operation Broadaxe. On the planet Talos, Fenlow’s goal is to find a means of being taken into Brelac custody. He finds his chance when he comes across Protectorate troopers who have captured five Brelac prisoners. Fenlow offers medical aid to a trooper who is wounded. Then manages to kill all three troopers. He then surrenders to the Brelac prisoners. Sergeant Colin McKenzie awakens within a strange cylinder. He sees two other cylinders. They contain the unconscious Reploids, Diane Christy and Kelly Lytton. These two are Colin’s teammates in the experimental project. Colin leaves the storage room where the cylinders are housed and ventures out into a smoke filled corridor. He is quickly tackled and subdued by a Captain Gains. Colin learns that he was onboard a ship. Gains mistakes him for a hostile intruder. Blair and Doctor Trevor arrive on the scene and vouch for Colin. After Diane and Kelly awaken Trevor explains to all three that they are involved in a military experiment that will grant them paranormal abilities. The ship was supposed to transport them to Lodestar, but heavy Brelac activity forced them to land here at Scorpis. A military base on the planet Voran. The group board the ship and attempt to leave Scorpis. But they soon encounter Brelac fighters, who immediately open fire on the ship. The ship is heavily damaged by the attack and crashes back to the planet. Colin is the only one remaining conscious. he see a wild mob of ragged people swarming over the ship. One of these wild people climbs into the ship and knocks Colin unconscious.Still on the planet Voran, Colin awakens and finds himself hanging upside down in a large warehouse. His hands and legs are tightly bound, rendering him helpless. He sees Diane hanging unconscious next to him and bound in the same manner. Down below Colin sees two of his captors. Both are large men dressed in rags.Diane awakens to hear that she and Colin are being held for ransom. Colin and Diane escape and a violent confrontation develops. During the course of this fight Colin’s electrical powers emerge and he manages to free himself. Diane’s powers emerge in the form of super human strength. Diane kills one man by hurling him into a wall while Colin electrocutes the second who tackles him to the floor. Colin and Diane jump into a chute and slide down to reach a disposal area where Kelly is being held captive. They land in a trash filled area and find Kelly, securely bound and gagged by tape. But in this chamber they are not alone. They are surrounded by dozens of large carnivorous cacti that are slowly crawling towards them. During the excitement Kelly’s power comes to life. Flaming energy streams out from his body and sets small fires in the trash heap. Colin uses his electrical power to destroy several cacti before he spots a doorway to escape.The trio escape the disposal pit, then locate Blair and Dr Trevor. They then encounter Brelac Major Clive Danton, who arrives at the warehouse with a squad of heavily armed troops. Colin and the others have to fight their way out of the warehouse. Once outside they discover that a group of armed Protectorate troopers have entered the scene. Colin, Diane, Kelly and the others become their prisoners. Dr Fenlow has established a laboratory in an underground level of Rantraven base, located on the planet Morthos Three. He is studying an organism that he has growing inside of an incubation tube when Major Danton barges in. Danton gives Fenlow a report about his encounter on the planet Voran with two unusual Humans. He mentions their names. Colin McKenzie and Kelly Kirby. Fenlow recognizes the names of the two Reploids, but assures Danton that he is developing a means to deal with them. Colin, Diane and Kelly are taken to Nocturne. A military base on the planet Trillion. They meet General Larkin, who tells them that they are to be split up and assigned to other duties. Colin becomes increasingly irritated at Diane and Kelly’s bickering and is glad that they will be separated. He is also growing suspicious of Blair and Trevor. Thinking that there is some secret that they are not revealing. Days pass since Colin, Diane and Kelly were assigned to their new jobs at Nocturne. Assigned to the Quartermaster’s corps Colin hands out supplies in a basement storeroom. Diane works with an excavation crew. Kelly works in the maintenance corps. Colin’s memory about his past is still shrouded. To solve this problem he decides to explore his past life. He uses his computer to log onto the United protectorate’s macro Net. He locates the web page, Universal Eye, to find personal information on himself. Later on, Colin goes to the base cafeteria and sees his old commanding officer, Lieutenant Paul Yates having a meal with a group of troopers. At that time Diane comes and sits at Colin’s table. Colin shows little interest in Diane’s presence and goes to greet Yates. Lieutenant Yates is less than happy to see Colin and reminds him that he killed a man back on Meridan. Yates and the troopers attack Colin. Diane steps in to defend Colin, but he has little appreciation for her help. Blair comes onto the scene just as Colin and Diane leave. Blair invites Colin to go back to the cafeteria. He promises to reveal important information to Colin. Inside they see Dr Fenlow appear on a video screen and issue an ultimatum on behalf of the Brelac. He demands that the United Protectorate surrender in three days.Back at Rantraven base on the planet Morthos Three, Mariner and Senior General Owen Lagar are in Mariner’s quarters enjoying a game of monopoly. Fenlow appears on a video monitor on a nearby table and asks if he Protectorate has responded to his ultimatum. Mariner has nothing to report. Even though two days have passed. Mariner asks about Fenlow’s new project, Viperhawk. Fenlow reports that he has a final test to run. He ends the transmission. Mariner then tells Lagar that he can’t wait for the chance to get rid of Fenlow. The Brelac currently cannot use their brain implants to give themselves greater psionic powers without fatal results. (Subjects nervous systems burn out.) But Fenlow has created a gene that enables a subject to regenerate nervous tissue. Mariner wants the secret of this gene. In addition to project Viperhawk. In a large orb shaped starbase in orbit above Morthos Three Fenlow is aboad the Brelac battle cruiser, Viperhawk. The ship is being refitted by the Brelac with special technology by Fenlow’s specifications. In the ship’s control center Fenlow is checking over a column shaped computer that maintains control over the entire ship. His name for this device is Succubus. Back at Nocturne Colin, Diane, Kelly, and Blair are summoned into a conference room by General Larkin. Before Larkin arrives Colin asks Kelly if he also has strange repetitive dreams. General Larkin arrives and asks if Colin, Diane and Kelly have a plan to deal with whatever threat that Fenlow might create now that he has defected to the Brelac. The emergency alarm sounds off. Larkin receives a report that the base is under attack by three units. Larkin reinstates Silencers. Colin, Diane and Kelly depart to investigate the attack.Outside a full scale battle is raging. Protectorate troops are being decimated by the Deltans. Three Humanoid robots created by Dr Fenlow. In addition, a Brelac invasion force is also due to arrive. Colin, Diane and Kelly split up to deal with the Robots, but their efforts are futile. Suddenly a huge oval shaped vessel with large wings appears in the sky above their heads. This is Fenlow’s latest creation. The Viperhawk. The Viperhawk is soon joined by several Brelac fighters. With the battle now hopeless Colin, Diane and Kelly join the mob of personnel to escape the base. They locate and squeeze themselves into a small scout craft. With Colin acting as pilot the ship manages to barely take off. A trio of Brelac fighters pursue the ship. Diane awakes and contorts herself into the pilot’s seat to take control of the ship. To everyone’s horror Diane comes to the realization that she has no pilot’s skills. She accidentally engages the ship’s hyperspace generator and the ship is warped across space to arrive at Starbase Lodestar. Colin, Diane, Kelly and Blair are being detained in a cell on Lodestar. Captain Robert Burns from Special Operations enters the cell and orders the group to accompany him. They are to embark upon a special mission to neutralize Fenlow. He takes them to a landing bay where they board the assault cruiser, Corvette. Burns gives Diane a quick instruction on the ship’s controls and Corvette flies off into space. Warping into hyperspace. Corvette emerges from hyperspace and approaches a vessel that Colin recognizes as the Viperhawk. Corvette docks with the Viperhawk. Burns leads the group to an airlock door where the Three robotic Deltans are waiting on the other side. After the Deltans board Corvette Burns draws a gun at Colin and informs them that they have fallen into a trap. Mariner and Lagar arrive aboard the Viperhawk. Fenlow reports to them that his new weapon is functioning perfectly. Mariner discusses with Major Danton about the notion of eliminating Fenlow. A soldier from Mariner’s ship barges in and informs Mariner that Captain Armatige back at Rantraven base reports that the computers containing all of Fenlow’s vital data have been erased.Colin, Diane, Kelly and Blair are all being held in a cell within the Viperhawk when they receive a telepathically projected image of Fenlow. Fenlow offers them all a chance to join him as he conquers the United Protectorate. Speaking for the group Colin refuses the offer. Fenlow refers to Colin, Diane and Kelly as his creations and gives the group one hour to reconsider. His image disappears, leaving Blair the job of explaining to them the truth of who and what they really are. Mariner and Lagar are in the ship’s control center, admiring Succubus. Fenlow enters and Mariner informs Fenlow that his data back at Rantraven had been destroyed. Fenlow casually admits that he is responsible through a small network of Brelac and Human Reploids in his employ. Fenlow reveals that Succubus gave him prior knowledge of Mariner’s intended betrayal. Mariner confesses his guilt and draws his plasma pistol. Along with Lagar and Danton. Fenlow orders Succubus to disarm them. Succubus now reveals a power that they did not expect. Telekinesis. Blair finally reveals the truth to Colin, Diane and Kelly. That they are not real Humans. But Reploids created in a laboratory by Fenlow. Kelly and Diane are upset at this news. Colin is also upset, but more accepting of the notion of being a Reploid. The groups priority is to escape the cell. Colin uses his power to destroy the floor of the cell. The group falls down into the lower level of the ship. Diane, still upset over her true origin, runs down the corridor away from Colin and the others. Colin looks up to see that the Deltans are investigating the disturbance. Succubus informs Fenlow that the group have escaped from their cell. Fenlow dismisses them as a threat. Succubus reports that a fleet of Protectorate ships have formed a blockade to cut the Viperhawk off from reaching Maseklos Prime. Fenlow orders Succubus to activate a special jamming sequence for the Brelac psionic implants. The signal jams the Brelac’s less advanced psionic implants. Taking away their limited psychic vision and rendering them blind. Mariner’s Elite Guardian Squadron of ships is now helpless. Colin, Kelly and Blair are rushing through the corridors of the Viperhawk to avoid the Deltans and locate Fenlow. Diane is still missing. They meet up with Captain Burns. Who is accompanied by several Brelac soldiers. Diane returns and helps the others to kill Burns and the Brelac. They come to the ship’s control center and find Fenlow with Succubus. Colin and the others attempt to deal with Fenlow but Succubus’ telekinetic power hurls them back against the wall and holds them there. Succubus tells Fenlow that a small fleet of destroyer class ships have emerged from hyperspace. This is the Vendetta fleet sent by Carnaby. Fenlow confesses that Carp Technologies is the real power behind Vendetta. The Viperhawk engages and destroys a majority of the Protectorate fleet. Fenlow decides to restore the Brelac Psionic implants and give them back their sight. The Viperhawk reaches Maseklos Prime. Fenlow now orders the ship to fire on the Vendetta fleet. Fenlow announces to Carnaby that he is changing Operation Broad Axe and taking control of both the United Protectorate and the Brelac Empire. Fenlow receives a transmission from President Drennen and all 18 members of the Central Commission. Fenlow tells Drennen that he has no demands. He simply wants the entire Protectorate government centered in one place so that he can make an easy kill. Before Fenlow has a chance to order Navarone destroyed Colin and the others manage to break free and disable Succubus. Fenlow and his three Deltans pursue Colin and the others into a corridor where Colin has set a trap for them. They direct their attack towards the ceiling above the heads of Fenlow and the Deltans. The explosive decompression sucks Fenlow and the Deltans out into space. However, two of the Deltans manage to get back into the ship. Colin, Diane and Kelly concentrate their efforts and destroy the Deltans. Protectorate troopers breech the ship in search of Fenlow. Instead they place Colin and the others under arrest. once they leave the ship The remaining ships in the Protectorate fleet are able to destroy the Viperhawk.","The possible risks and challenges to this project could be the same risk that any new project of this type could face when going up against the more popular and well known franchises such as Star Wars, Star Trek, Dragon Ball Z. However, I have already stated the the McKenzie Files fan base is strong and growing. I am certain that with my continued efforts to promote both the books and the first installment of the animated feature will generate an interest in more features. This will work towards my goal of creating a full length McKenzie Files animated movie.",https://www.kickstarter.com/projects/1439173011/mckenzie-files-animated-feature?ref=discovery_category_newest,1439173011/mckenzie-files-animated-feature,"I am trying to raise the funds to create an animated feature of my science fiction series, McKenzie Files. McKenzie Files is a series currently consisting of three books. McKenzie Files, book one. Assassination Anxiety, McKenzie Files book two. And the soon to be released Obliteration, McKenzie Files book three. McKenzie Files is a series that is growing in popularity across the globe. My goal for this animation project is to create a series of small episodes from book one in order to generate a greater interest for a much larger project. Also, budget concerns have forced me to aim for creating a smaller animated feature from one or two chapters from the book rather that doing the entire book all at once. I am already working with an animation artist located in California (Terrence Walker of Studio ArtFX) to help produce this project. The McKenzie fan base is very strong and growing. The books have gotten several highly rated reviews. So I have full confidence that an animated version will have a very strong appeal.Below is a brief outline of the story.Chapter one introduces characters Sergeant Colin McKenzie and Trooper Ed Driscol. Evil Reploids working for the separatist organization, Vendetta. Vendetta is also working with the Brelac Empire in their war against the United protectorate. Colin and Driscol are on a mission on the planet Meridan to prevent a platoon of Protectorate troopers from capturing the cargo of a crashed Brelac shuttle. During a violent confrontation Driscol uses his freezing ability to kill one trooper, while Colin reveals his deadly electrical powers. Driscol is gunned down and killed by the troopers. In the middle of the fight the two reptilian Brelac occupants of the shuttle emerge with weapons in hand. They begin to open fire on everyone in the area. Colin joins the protectorate troopers in killing the Brelac. He is then assaulted and beaten unconscious by his commanding officer, Lieutenant Paul Yates.The story moves to the city of Navarone on the planet Maseklos Prime. Capital world of the United Protectorate. Doctor Howard Fenlow Is meeting in his laboratory with members of the Protectorate’s Central Commission, Major General Verne Larkin, and the President of the Protectorate, Sandra Drennen. Fenlow is joined by young medical doctor Blair Van Doren and computer scientist Doctor Art Trevor.      Fenlow explains that some of the Reploids who have been committing terrorist acts possess arcane psionic powers granted by small electoinic implants in their brains that augment psychic abilities. He shows them three cylinders containing Reploids that were captured on the planet Meridan. Fenlow’s plan is to have them reprogrammed so that they can serve the Protectorate military. The plan is approved by Drennen. The three Reploids are to be transported to Starbase Lodestar so that the project can be developed safely. Later that day Fenlow returns to his apartment and gets a message from his boss, Walter Carnaby. C.E.O of Carp Techlologies. carnaby wants to advance the timetable for his plan, Operation Broadaxe. On the planet Talos, Fenlow’s goal is to find a means of being taken into Brelac custody. He finds his chance when he comes across Protectorate troopers who have captured five Brelac prisoners. Fenlow offers medical aid to a trooper who is wounded. Then manages to kill all three troopers. He then surrenders to the Brelac prisoners.     Sergeant Colin McKenzie awakens within a strange cylinder. He sees two other cylinders. They contain the unconscious Reploids, Diane Christy and Kelly Lytton. These two are Colin’s teammates in the experimental project. Colin leaves the storage room where the cylinders are housed and ventures out into a smoke filled corridor. He is quickly tackled and subdued by a Captain Gains. Colin learns that he was onboard a ship. Gains mistakes him for a hostile intruder. Blair and Doctor Trevor arrive on the scene and vouch for Colin. After Diane and Kelly awaken Trevor explains to all three that they are involved in a military experiment that will grant them paranormal abilities. The ship was supposed to transport them to Lodestar, but heavy Brelac activity forced them to land here at Scorpis. A military base on the planet Voran.     The group board the ship and attempt to leave Scorpis. But they soon encounter Brelac fighters, who immediately open fire on the ship. The ship is heavily damaged by the attack and crashes back to the planet. Colin is the only one remaining conscious. he see a wild mob of ragged people swarming over the ship. One of these wild people climbs into the ship and knocks Colin unconscious.Still on the planet Voran, Colin awakens and finds himself hanging upside down in a large warehouse. His hands and legs are tightly bound, rendering him helpless. He sees Diane hanging unconscious next to him and bound in the same manner. Down below Colin sees two of his captors. Both are large men dressed in rags.Diane awakens to hear that she and Colin are being held for ransom. Colin and Diane escape and a violent confrontation develops. During the course of this fight Colin’s electrical powers emerge and he manages to free himself. Diane’s powers emerge in the form of super human strength. Diane kills one man by hurling him into a wall while Colin electrocutes the second who tackles him to the floor.     Colin and Diane jump into a chute and slide down to reach a disposal area where Kelly is being held captive. They land in a trash filled area and find Kelly, securely bound and gagged by tape. But in this chamber they are not alone. They are surrounded by dozens of large carnivorous cacti that are slowly crawling towards them. During the excitement Kelly’s power comes to life. Flaming energy streams out from his body and sets small fires in the trash heap. Colin uses his electrical power to destroy several cacti before he spots a doorway to escape.The trio escape the disposal pit, then locate Blair and Dr Trevor. They then encounter Brelac Major Clive Danton, who arrives at the warehouse with a squad of heavily armed troops. Colin and the others have to fight their way out of the warehouse. Once outside they discover that a group of armed Protectorate troopers have entered the scene. Colin, Diane, Kelly and the others become their prisoners.     Dr Fenlow has established a laboratory in an underground level of Rantraven base, located on the planet Morthos Three. He is studying an organism that he has growing inside of an incubation tube when Major Danton barges in. Danton gives Fenlow a report about his encounter on the planet Voran with two unusual Humans. He mentions their names. Colin McKenzie and Kelly Kirby. Fenlow recognizes the names of the two Reploids, but assures Danton that he is developing a means to deal with them.     Colin, Diane and Kelly are taken to Nocturne. A military base on the planet Trillion. They meet General Larkin, who tells them that they are to be split up and assigned to other duties. Colin becomes increasingly irritated at Diane and Kelly’s bickering and is glad that they will be separated. He is also growing suspicious of Blair and Trevor. Thinking that there is some secret that they are not revealing. Days pass since Colin, Diane and Kelly were assigned to their new jobs at Nocturne. Assigned to the Quartermaster’s corps Colin hands out supplies in a basement storeroom. Diane works with an excavation crew. Kelly works in the maintenance corps. Colin’s memory about his past is still shrouded. To solve this problem he decides to explore his past life. He uses his computer to log onto the United protectorate’s macro Net. He locates the web page, Universal Eye, to find personal information on himself.

We have decided to expand our regular 4 episode seaons to 6 episodes and begin building season 4.Season 4 is going to be cool as we let the characters explore the town and wrap up loose ends with their families.WHY ARE WE ASKING FOR MONEY FOR SEASON FOUR?Our voice actors have been great and worked for free these last three seasons. We want to be able to cover thier expenses and time if we are going to go to six episodes a season.None of the actors have asked for pay, but we feel that at this point in the series we need to step up and show them how much we appreciate them.HOW MUCH DO WE NEED?We are asking for $1,000.00 to do season 4. The money will be used to pay union rate for all the main actors and the secondary voices.",We have 13 episodes under our belt and feel the risk of not getting the episodes done is low. Paying the actors will allow them more time for us to record them.Want to hear an episode?

When I was younger being an artist was just a dream but with determination and practice I was able to build my skills and knowledge.I have a plethora of subjects that I gravitate towards such as; Architectural, Humans and Wildlife but the Subject I enjoy drawing most is Animals. This is by far my favourite thing to draw because I find the whole process incredibly therapeutic. Drawing the animals fur and the markings is the bit I enjoy most every animal is slightly unique and I’m presented with different challenges each time I start a drawing. I work in a traditional medium using graphite and paper, but I also create pieces with a technique called Pyrography. This is an old Greek technique of drawing by burning directly onto wood. This effect is created from the controlled application of a heated object such as a poker or soldering iron. The Video attached to this listing is a speed drawing of a pyrography I made using a soldering iron.I have created this Kick-starter because I would like to take my journey of drawing to the next level, I plan to do this by making my artwork more accessible in the hopes that more people can enjoy it. This Kick-starter will help raise funds for art supplies and equipment so I can develop more work over the year. This will also help towards a high Quality printer and supplies for making prints, postcards and more. Meaning everyone can enjoy a physical copy of my drawings. These will be available for pledge along side original drawings and some Custom drawings from your photograph.For Pledge there are 2 Custom A4 Pyrograpghy drawings of animals. This Pledge will help towards purchasing wood and a temperature controlled Pyrography Drawing tool because I’m currently making pieces using a Soldering Iron on 1 temperature setting.Size guide(approximate) A1 -594 x 841 mm= 23.4 x 33.1 inA2 - 594 x 420 mm = 23.4 x 16.5 inA3 - 420 x 297 mm = 16.5 x 11.7 inA4 - 297 x 210 mm = 11.7 x 8.3 inA5 - 210 x 148 mm = 8.3 x 5.8 inBelow is a handful of examples of artwork by Moiimran.

Hope you enjoy and would love for you to be part of this project :)",The biggest challenge I see is that it takes along time to make the artwork. Each piece of work I invest days to its development. I feel that I have overcome this by having as much work ready before putting up the Project. Also by practicing I am able to determine how long it would take to do a drawing and manage my time better.,https://www.kickstarter.com/projects/1231496986/drawing-project-pencil-pyrograpghy-wood-burning-ar?ref=discovery_category_newest,1231496986/drawing-project-pencil-pyrograpghy-wood-burning-ar,"My Name is Moiimran and I live in the West Midlands, England.

The silhouette paintings will also feature different subjects such as animals, dancers, people, shapes, and anything else that comes to mind. They can be negative space silhouettes or pure silhouettes which are the shape against something with no details.I would like to have enough finished pieces of each to get into an art gallery to sell my work and get them in to the world.Silhouettes:Resin Paintings:Misc:",Time line for rewards may change because of family things that may arise.,https://www.kickstarter.com/projects/tiacaldwell/silhouettes-the-new-star-of-the-show?ref=discovery_category_newest,tiacaldwell/silhouettes-the-new-star-of-the-show,"This project is all about making my silhouette paintings the new star of a show that RAWartist is holding in Milwaukee at the end of January.Why This Show?Earlier this year, I had the opportunity to showcase for them alongside many other artists of different paths from painters and doodlers to singers and dancers. It was an amazing experience not for the fact that it was my first ever art show, but I sold two of my larger pieces, passed out business cards, and had someone ask for a piece to be commissioned. Now I get to do it again and I can't wait.Why Silhouette Paintings?So silhouettes may seem like an easy thing to do, but they are not easy. Not only is there finding the right silhouette to paint, there is the background stuff like the right mixture of colors, details that make it come to life, materials like pastel or paint, and whether or not it is cohesive. I've done some in the past that I thought would look great, but they turned out not so well and I had to scrap them. So it has been a learning curve to say the least. I also find them soothing, fun, and challenging.Why are you raising funds?I'm raising the funds to secure my spot, it's the same as renting a space in a gallery and that space has to be paid for, it's the same for this show. I'm also raising funds to make sure I am able to get to the show, that I have all the proper supplies, and that once finished, the painted pieces can be properly framed.","I have two kids, so timing may be an issue when it comes to fulfilling rewards, but I will reach out and let you know if that has become an issue."

The presentations these students would give wouldcomprehensively detail their experiences in studying abroad on their class’schoice of continent. Thesubsequentyears would entail the students spending nine months as a class experiencingthat which every continent has to offer.The basement of the Nicholas Lawson General Studies Buildingwould house a data center where students as they are traveling around the worldand experiencing life abroad while gaining perspective on the GlobalCommunications Network would be where the students store their diverse andvaried Multi Media Creations in the forms of Text Documents, Video Documents,Audio Documents, and Photography Documents.The students would in fact spend nine months out of eachyear for their first seven years of study experiencing in full detail eachcontinent. They would then spend the final three months of each of their firstseven years of study and travel in the Nicholas Lawson General Studies Buildingworking collaboratively on their final presentations. Each years the studentsare to give their presentations on their respective floor representative oftheir year in the program with their first year being the year that they givetheir class presentations in the first floor and their subsequent years givingtheir presentations on each level lower.The final four years of the program would ask students toexperience and recover from the culture shock that would be experienced and tocollectively work together to detail their inspiration that they wouldexperience. They would be expected to organically over the first seven years oftheir studies and travel to collect a professional contacts lists that theywould be expected to naturally keep in touch with.These students would spend their final year on the groundfloor of the Nicholas Lawson General Studies Building working to create a finalpresentation that explains and details their by this point global inspiredmindset and would be asked to explore and understand how best to navigateglobal issues up to and including drafting writing as to how best to go aboutnavigating the Global Warming issue that is presently being discussed andunderstood in society at large.This is a program that is intended to produce global mindedcitizens equipped with competitive stories in society at large that stem fromhaving an understanding in some form of what life is like on each of the sevencontinents.It is understood that in a globally networked societyinterlinked with a global communications network that training students and youthto think globablly through the process of experiencing globe that they wouldthen be able to in enhanced fashion function more professionally on a locallevel pulling on their diverse international contacts to aid them inaccomplishing their future goals and furthering their respective communities withthe aid of their cumulative experiences amassed in their 11 year universitystudies.The funding that this Kickstarter Program is asking for willbe used to offset the costs of creating the first draft of a set of plans forthe building and will be issued to a local Architecture Firm to begin the firstphase of a presentation to initiate this program.I hope you find this idea inspiring and that you feel thatthis undertaking would be beneficial to the Global Community in such a way thatyou open your pocket book and help promote the futures’ ability to better andmore thoroughly understand the needs of the leadership in the future and theunderstanding that it would be a program like this that would enable futureclasses of Students to promote understanding and communication in a GlobalSociety.

There are many other parts that I have written and the musicians are ready to record. (I play piano and some percussion)I am recording everything with 3d microphones (called binaural microphones) so it will be a lot of fun in the mixing process to layer the orchestra like a 3d image, I have never heard anything recorded in this way before so I am looking forward to this. I am going to put together some more information about this technique for people that don't know about it.I really hope you can listen using good headphones as you can't experience the 3d audio image on speakers (laptop or even a high quality Hifi system the music does not translate well ) -(also I don't know why but when I uploaded my video to kickstarter it boosted the volume by 20-30% so you might need to turn it down a bit!)I think what makes me most excited about this project is that I have asked a world famous jazz musician to play a solo over the top of one section, you will definitely know him if you love jazz.It's a surprise who it will be ;-)I have been playing and listening to different types of music all my life, and studied music at university. I love all types of music (African/Classical/Jazz/Electronic/Blues/Latin etc) so it was difficult to put my music in category here on Kickstarter.In my personal life I have been sitting in a kind of cave for the last 10-15 years but continued to write music all the time , so I would like to come out of my cave to some extent and turn my ideas into full compositions, the above video is just a very small sample from one of my pieces.I need your support as I don't have masses of friends or connections so I am really relying on you. Self promotion is definitely quite a challenge but I am going to see how I can promote this.I am going to keep my backers updated at every stage of the development and I am just about to start a Facebook page, I will also message you with updates and give you samples of things recorded. Creating an orchestra in this way will be interesting as I will be placing the various recordings (of cellos /violas for example) in a 3d field.Sometimes I might ask for some creative input, especially with the recording techniques/3d imaging as I am recording using a mixture of analog and digital equipment and I might do polls to see ""what sounds best"" through my listeners ears.-Musicians-Mixing + mastering (I really need help from a very good engineer to get it sounding right- I know very little about mixing)-Equipment-Piano Hire for several hours (I can rent a very nice grand piano near me)-Kickstarter fees-Rewards and postage----------------------------------------",Everything is ok I have nothing booked ahead I am totally dedicated to this!,https://www.kickstarter.com/projects/al360project/i-need-to-pay-session-musicians-to-finish-this-piece-i-wrote?ref=discovery_category_newest,al360project/i-need-to-pay-session-musicians-to-finish-this-piece-i-wrote,"Help!

https://www.kickstarter.com/projects/787411937/julies-ma-history-thesis?ref=discovery_category_newest,787411937/julies-ma-history-thesis,"I am currently working on my MA thesis in History and researching religious resistance to the Nazi regime in the German state of North Rhine-Westphalia. The work will concentrate on the activities of the Confessing Church and Jehovah's Witnesses (at this point in the planning...some of the emphasis may change as the project progresses and depending upon the source material located). In order to write the best possible thesis, I feel it is necessary to travel to Germany to gain access to archives within the region I am studying. Travel to Europe is never cheap, especially for an extended period of time. I plan on being as frugal as possible with regards to the travel arrangements, but there are other factors that must be considered (time away from work, etc.) I have already conducted some research at the United States Holocaust Memorial Museum in Washington, DC and obtained some sources there. I have been saving for this project for some time, but any additional funds I can raise would be incredibly helpful. Expenses once abroad are unknown (such as copying fees for sources, and travel to various destinations within the region). Due to the length of time that I have been in school, most of my ability to obtain additional federal student loans has been exhausted, and must take out loans at a higher rate if that is necessary.","As with any MA thesis, there is always the chance that I may not be able to access the archives I need.  Additionally, some sources may not be available and I will not know this until I visit the archives in question.",https://www.kickstarter.com/projects/787411937/religious-resistance-to-the-nazis-in-north-rhine-w?ref=discovery_category_newest,787411937/religious-resistance-to-the-nazis-in-north-rhine-w,"I am working on MA thesis in Modern European History. The proposed topic of the thesis is Religious Resistance to the Nazi Regime in North Rhine-Westphalia. I will be examining primarily three religious groups: The Jehovah's Witnesses, The Confessing Church (the portion of the Protestant Church that split from the Reich Church), and the Catholic Church. Each group protested the regime in their own ways and early research has shown that resistance centered on challenging the policies of the regime which affected the beliefs/practices of that specific faith. I am focusing my study on a particular region (North Rhine-Westphalia) in part because religious resistance in that area appears to have been fairly active. The estimated completion date of this project is December 2015. I will be spending anywhere from 4-7 weeks in Germany this summer doing archival work to locate beneficial primary sources that will help to complete this project. An initial chapter (on the Jehovah's Witnesses) is already in progress with a rough draft due to be completed within the next week.","The biggest challenge is unforeseen costs that may arise once in Germany.  I do not know what types of costs I will incur when copying sources and how frequently I will need to travel between different cities in order to access different archives.  As the exchange rate is constantly changing, these costs will continually fluctuate...making it difficult to give an accurate estimate of what they will be in advance."

We've worked with software, 35mm, 16mm and 8mm film, home camcorders and full HD. We've painted filmstock with live electricity, created abstract landscapes with home made resin lenses, converted sculpture into dance, dance into motion capture data and motion capture data into abstract animations. We've shot nightmares, memories, imagined what its like to be synaesthetic, thrown ourselves into the kinetic and left ourselves shipwrecked at the edge of dreams...But we've never worked solely with audio. So this time we thought we'd try something new and go back to analogue tech, take a radio cassette recorder apart and hack it to disable the motor - physically drag the tape over the recording heads by hand and then layer, loop and edit the results to create a landscape for a movie in your head.The title comes from an experiment we did to see if the idea worked - it did! - and strange words appeared from the voices on the tapes...

The tiniest movements of the artist can lead to massive change within the Intraference environments.  These sweet-spots can be fragile, always in danger of falling back into disarray but with careful manipulation they can be encouraged to evolve into complex architectures.  With practice, the artist can revisit shapes at will.  The sensitive dependence on initial conditions of each AV set-up leads to its own journey into morphogenesis, tesselation geometry, space-time dynamics and spontaneous self-organisation.Working with Dan Powell, I have selected 20 short sequences made using a variety of A/V equipment and techniques to complement Dan's abstract soundscapes and to illustrate the variety of the Intraference work I've been doing since 1993.The video demo is a low quality test demo version of the final high quality piece.here's a link to some of my previous intraference work with a soundtrack by andy coxhttp://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NOjT6-brutM","None!

Each painting is packaged in a plastic ziplock bag of an appropriate size. I have been in talks with High Times and they love my concept and have asked me to participate in one of their Cannabis Cup events. In order for me to build up the inventory of 500+ pieces my goal is the Las Vegas Cannabis Cup in January of 2016. I have price points for my pieces ranging $5-$5,000. The pieces range in pieces as small as 3"" x 3"" and stickers all the way up to large scale paintings at 4ft x 4ft. I have yet to show this series in its entirety anywhere and I think this would be the perfect debut.The concept behind this is to actual be able to raise a dialog, awareness, and take away the stigma/taboo of such a beautiful plant. I have shown elements of this series in places that this topic has been highly censored.Conceptually, this project has opened dialog about the subject matter in unexpected ways. People debate about the legal issues, social issues, and criminal issues that Cannabis causes along with it's potential to raise tax revenue and as a source of taxable dollars for states with debt. With my series being art it allows for this topic to enter into states where actual Cannabis is illegal there by allowing another forum for it's benefits and drawbacks to be debated in a neutral arena. If this project gets funded and I have success at the event I wish to carry this exhibition on and expand it to states where medical and recreational laws prohibit Cannabis there by creating more dialog and debate. This series has surprised me about how accepting the general public has been as it does not promote or condone the plant, but just shows it's beauty aesthetically in all stages of it's growth.The funds would go towards the booth fees, supplies to create the inventory, travel expenses, lodging while at the event, and supplies to create the rewards.EXPENSES:Booth Fee - $2,000materials for artwork- $3,000 for 500+ paintingsTravel Expenses- (Winston-Salem to Las Vegas= 2224 miles, 32 hours) 6 tanks of gas, 12 round trip = $500Hotel + Food=$ 1,000 (8 Days)Automobile expenses= (oil changes, etc.) $1,000Reward materials and supplies= $2,000Promotional material at event= $500 (catalogs, stickers, shirts)The reason I think this is worth all the work is that they sent me numbers on these events and 25,000+ attendees arrive throughout the 3 day event. It is currently the biggest festival circuit in the US along with the average person spending $540. If I were to get 1% of these people that is 250 people and of those people I can receive 10% of that $540, that is $54. These are numbers that provide the risk worth the gain.I have produced small quantities of each of the pieces. I have already painted 25 of the 8"" x 10"" pieces, 15 magnets, 15 stems and seeds, 15 of each strand, one of each of the mother plants, one of the larger pieces, and one of the large scale works.I have estimated that if I were to go into full production by the beginning of November at the latest I could easily create a minimum of 500 pieces.To supplement other expenses I have over 200 paintings of other work to help with expenses and raise extra funds so I will not have to sell The Dispensary inventory.I also have four volunteers willing to donate their time to help me with this event. One volunteer will make the long drive out there with me so that we may split up the time for safety and that we can make longer durations of straight driving.Another volunteer is my lawyer and her husband who will help in making sure all of my permits and requirements are met for the event. They will also help in managing the booth so that we may take breaks and rotate to help promote our booth.","Production Delays- This area I feel pretty strong, in that, I have created prototypes and in some cases complete series of my products and know the time constraints. I am an artist an my sole objective when November hits is production. The event isn't until January 16th-18th. This gives me at least 2 months of production time. I produced 100+ pieces of this series in a week. If this kickstarter were funded I'd be able to focus all my energy on production as soon as October which would be more than enough time.Unique Challenges- The biggest unpredictable variable in this whole equation is weather, being that it would be winter time some roads me be closed or a blizzard could be in progress as I will be driving across country... How do I combat this, by giving myself a possible two week window of travel. Or by taking more southern routes or giving myself extra days of travel time. Or if I have car trouble, but my van is very reliable, however have a fund set aside in case I have to rent a truck if it were to break down as 2224 miles is a long trip to take especially in the winter time.Worse case scenario if the blizzard of the century were coming through during our travels and we were forced to miss the event. They have an even bigger festival in Denver in April and I would just have to regroup for that event. However, all of my products would be just as suitable as it is the same festival. So, although extremely disappointed if some impossible obstacle were to occur whether it be production or travel it would simply delay the debut of the dispensary by 3 months, but it would still happen.Current Projects: I am currently wrapping up two commissions, but those will be done within weeks. Everything else I am working on is only to help raise funds for this project. This is my one and only focus as of mid September.",https://www.kickstarter.com/projects/artfort321/not-just-another-brick-in-the-wall-new-mural-proje?ref=discovery_category_newest,artfort321/not-just-another-brick-in-the-wall-new-mural-proje,"I am raising funds for a new mural project... Its is to be on the site of my old mural, but here is where the fun begins. My old mural was demolished in September to make room for progress. The building was an old brick furnace room which had to go to beautify the local area of Downtown Morganton, North Carolina and also making it easier access for all of Morganton to businesses. The town was sad to see the mural go, and I wish not to charge my patrons of Brown Mountain Bottle Works whom not only commissioned me for the previous mural, but also helped in the removal of the bricks by hand, ONE AT A TIME! (on a holiday weekend). They were also gracious enough to allow me to take all the bricks and use them as I please. Seriously, not many muralist get to salvage their first. Because of all this, I developed this idea that the old mural could help spawn birth to the new mural which is in direct line with my philosophies toward art. A self perpetuating work of creative evolution.The city of Morganton, it's community, businesses, and people have opened their hearts to my style of art and allow me to flourish as an artist. I wish to thank them by raising enough funds to purchase supplies and use my time to create a truly spectacular work for the city to enjoy. At no cost to my patrons, business owners, orI would use the funding towards supplies such as spray pint, primer, drop clothes, and my time, allowing me to focus on this ambitious new piece.All of the rewards are either made by my clothing company Urban Monkism Fashion, which is 100% sweat shop free, or screen printed by us in-house, or designed by me. The minimum goal can achieve to paint a smaller mural, although the more funds I raise will allow me a greater scope of materials, colors, equipment like ladders or a scissor lift which will expand the project.I plan on reaching my goal by promoting this project through various events and businesses which I collaborate often with throughout the months of October and November. As an artist and fashion designer I travel all over and attend many different events allowing me a unique opportunity to spread my message to wide audience.As far as meeting deadlines for rewards the majority of the inventory are the bricks which we have in a safe location. All of the screen printing of shirts , bandannas, and hoodies will be done by us, personally. Our manufacturer in Canada is 100% sweatshop free, and could meet the demands on our yoga leggings. We have had over a decade relationship with our printer who produces the catalogs and postcards with an environmentally, eco-friendly printing facility.This is a great opportunity to bring more contemporary mural art to small town America. I believe everyone deserves great art and to experience large scale works, not just major cities or excluded to art specific districts.""In a world where everyone is fanatical about buildings walls, we took this one down brick-by-brick, in the name of art... Why, so that we may paint our way toward a brighter world filled with imagination, creativity, and awe.""- The Urban Monk","All of the toughest challenges have already been met. We extracted the wall, inventoried all of the bricks, and have them in a safe location.All of our printed material, Catalogs & Postcards are done through a company I have been using consistently for over a decade and have never had a problem. They can handle orders in the tens of thousands.Our leggings are made in Canada print to order. So a problem could arise in delivery time which generally takes 2-4 weeks to create. I have allowed 2 months on delivery time to forgive this period.Another problem which we can not account for is if our deliveries are delayed by the holiday season or bad weather, but we plan on accommodating an extra print for those delayed by delivery changes.Another potential problem is that after the rest of the demo work the mural cannot go on the same business. I have two or three alternate venue that will agree to allowing the project of public art continue.Those are the problems I can think of, as far as time goes. I am a professional artist designating a large block of my time in October and November to seeing this not only be successful, but reach above and beyond that.I  will begin designing my new mural in October with plans of starting it no later than January 1, 2017. November will be designated as my fund raising month with events to be held around the city of Morganton, TBA.December will be allocated toward fulfilling mural rewards and ordering supplies for the new mural."

He gets his powers and memories sealed by a anti-world crystal by a High elves class Scientist from Palomar named Agaron and A human General of the DAC(Deathspawn Annihilation Corp.) named Hijka Blade because he was said to be too dangerous.

This is a message to all of you manga fans out there. Itoo am a great manga fan and wish to make my own original manga for everyone to enjoy and I mean for anyone who wantsto read it to enjoy. I want to make this manga free to read for the public so noone has to worry about buying it. However there are a few problems that I can't solve alonewhich is why I need your help. First and foremost I am not an artist I am awriter who has written everything from fanfiction to self-publish books;however I feel my storytelling skills are far better in the visual sense. As aresult I have been working to create a manga on Tapastic with a great artist.The work is called Warriors of Matrimony. http://tapastic.com/kennethjrfultzThe synopsis of the story is this: The countries ofCamgon, a patriarch society and Saron, a matriarchal land have always livedside by side and have agreed to work in harmony for the time being. Saron holdsthe power of Design, the unique ability that allows its people to createwhatever they engineer in their heads. Camgon on the other hand has amysterious power of its own, however it was lost. Kalich, a Camgonian soldier lives seemly happily with his wife and daughteruntil Captain Xia of Saron comes to reveal the truth about Annala, Kalich'swife's true mission. Things only become worse when he demands she returns homeand kidnaps their daughter in a plot to please Colonel Lei, Annala's mother.Now Kalich and Annala must go to Saron in order to save their daughter, butthey aren't the only ones after her.I have been funding it so far through my part time job;however with cost of living and the need to replace things it's hard to tellhow far I will continue to be able to pay for it with my own money. I like yourhelp to continue the project and make it a great project that many can enjoy(even right now its only in its beginning stages.)By supporting this kickstarter you will allow me tocreate a high quality work that is free for everyone to read. When the story iscomplete it could be sold on Amazon to help support further projects, but willstill remain free on Tapastic regardless. That is the goal here. To make great workpeople can enjoy for free since everyone can't afford to pay. You could behelping someone forget their problems and enjoy a great new manga. The money raised for this breaks down as such: $60 (pre page) to commission (1-2 pages can be completed and posteda week) for a total of 200 pages.$100-500 for translations into other languages such asSpanish, Japanese, etc.$ 2,000 (a month) to help with my living expenses so Idon't need to sell the work or spend on promotions. I am very thankful to anyone willing to support thisdream of mine. You are truly a wonderful person.","The problems that come with doing such a big project like a full manga is having a full story, artwork and keeping it all organize.

Kovu soon learns about the Rings of the Kings and their power to make the greatest king that ever existed. Can he save his country or is that just a fantasy?

I plan on making songs with the best of my ability every time I'm producing because I believe in quality not quantity.If I get the funds, I would get to work as soon as they are transferred. I plan to make it at least an EP with 3 songs but hopefully I would be able to get 4 in.Since it's the summer I would be able to get a huge chunk done, most likely the first two songs. I've been experimenting with these programs demos and have gathered some ideas. I would say that my EP would be released at the beginning of next year, possibly Winter 2013 as I am very determined!This is my first attempt at Dubstep, before I learned a lot about the programs. Please don't be put off by this as it was first attempt and with basic plug-ins.I've been listening to a lot of dubstep and other electronic music for inspiration. I have studied their structures and have created similar ones but only with more basic software.Regarding my EP, I intend to create more unique songs and not just generic ones. I want my songs to be able to be recognised and stand out from the others, such as artists like Borgore and Skrillex.

Since I am unsigned, the album won't be in a plastic case. It will be in a plastic sleeves with the cover slid in. Although it won't cost nearly as much as the programs, it is necessary. Also, the funds will go to hiring a studio for high-quality vocals, that will cost around 20€ as it shorter than other genres.The beauty of electronic music is that I don't need to hire studios to record my songs as you would for genres like metal.The funds will also go to burning my songs onto CDs. I won't be doing this myself, I will pay a company to burn a 100 or more. Doing it myself would take too long.I have an idea for an image, I'm going to get an old PC monitor (the old box-like ones) and hollow it out, paint it and put a thin monitor in it which would show images/videos on it. This would be placed on my head!Eventually, if everything turns out right, I will hopefully be able to do gigs and get paid. (However, money isn't my main aim.)

Also, I will need a keyboard (piano) that I can connect to my PC to make it easier to make rhythm.My ExperienceI have watched countless tutorials, so I know how to use these programs. However, there is still much more to explore. Not only that, my friend has used these programs for years and is willing to give me tips and help my productions!I have realised that if you want to create art, you have to see it more than just a song and really look into its structure.Who am I?I'm Floki (stagename) and I'm from Bristol, England!Thank you!","I can't foresee many obstacles but it is possible that files become corrupt or that I get writers block.

Together we spawn fictional worlds and breath life into the characters that inhabit them. Our first series Hope Falls follows a young heroine that wants to find redemption from the mistakes of her past. The story is filled with gangs, high school drama and superpowers. While Hope Falls is the first series we have shared with outsiders (you), it is not our first series. Shadows in the Light is an epic high fantasy adventure that we have been working and perfecting for the last 6 years. The WhatShadows in the Light takes place in a world where the mythical and human live in a shared space. After years of war and destruction an uneasy peace has settled in. The races divided, enslaved or in hiding. Worse yet, the magic is fading. The fate of all is caught in the twisting shadows of an aging king, a lonely outcast and the naive musings of a flightless fae. The WhenThe WhyAt the risk of sounding cheesy, for as long as I can remember I have wanted to create stories that would capture the imagination of others. To breath life into a character in the same way that my hero Walt Disney did. I have pursued art and chased storytelling at every twist and turn that life has thrown my way. Through hard work and determination I have stepped up the challenge and am eager to share the worlds I’ve been building.With your financial support we will be publishing the first issue of Shadows in the Light this November. For a sneak peak at the prologue and early pages visit thehopefalls.comThe HowThank you for your support!",The biggest risk we face is the timeline. As a full time art teacher maintaining a steady pace with high quality can sometimes be a struggle.  We have built in buffer space to help ensure we do not fall behind in the time line and we will keep everyone up todate should something happen to  push the timeline back.,https://www.kickstarter.com/projects/shadowsinthelight/shadows-in-the-light-shadows-crossing?ref=discovery_category_newest,shadowsinthelight/shadows-in-the-light-shadows-crossing,"The WhoI am the great world builder, at least, that’s the title my husband and partner in creation has given me. Together we spawn fictional worlds and breath life into the characters that inhabit them. Our first series Hope Falls follows a young heroine that wants to find redemption from the mistakes of her past. The story is filled with gangs, high school drama and superpowers. After years of work and the encouragement of the success of Hope Falls we are ready to share the world of Shadows in the Light, the series that started it all.The What:We’re raising money to print the first edition of our graphic novel Shadows in the Light: Shadows Crossing.It all started with a stump.This is a story we started working on because we were essentially too broke to do anything else and were being (for lack of a better word) haunted by a mysterious stump. LeSha was hypnotized into drawing it. Over and over again, each time with a little more detail. Eventually, she drew it as a full tree and the story began to take root (pun FULLY intended and unapologetically so!).Now the story is rapidly unfolding and we’d like your help to give it a tangible physical form!We have the first issue almost fully written. By the end of October, it should be fully drawn and inked, being colored, edited, and ready for print around Thanksgiving. With your support, we can have this beautiful graphic novel printed and shipped in time to be wrapped up under the tree.The When:We are hard at work to bring this story to life. Below is our projected timeline.The WhyLife is to short to live in fear. This has been made painfully clear. Tomorrow is not promised and I do not want to live a life of regret. I have always wanted to breath life into characters and share their amazing stories in the same way Walt Disney and Stan Lee did. I have pursued art and chased storytelling at every twist and turn that life has thrown my way. Now, I am stepping up to the challenge, with the love and support of my husband, family and friends to share the worlds that I’ve been building with you.The How:Below you will find the budget breakdown.","The Struggle is realThe largest hurdle we face is balancing time and financing. Shadows in the Light: Shadows Crossing is our first graphic novel and we are eager to see it in print. Balancing work/ school events, Hope Falls and Shadows in the Light, hurricane scares and family we run a tight ship to maintain high quality work. The struggle may be real, but the end results are amazing and we wouldn’t have it any other way."

We do henna and crafting for people around us. We do roadtrips regularly. We capture lighthouses during our trips. Now we decided to do these all at once since these are the activities making us happy. We decided to sell our car, buy a campervan and travel through Europe. The mission of our project is to spread peace, love, unity and respect through laughing, dancing, singing, crafting, teaching and capturing joyful moments and cool places.At the end of the project we aim to exhibit our photos somewhere in Europe at a possibly central and easily reachable location so most of you could attend. We also aim to create a digital photobook what we give away as a reward in exchange for your support :) And of course, we are very very happy to create many colorful dreamcatchers for you and to do workshops around Europe so our loved psy sisters and brothers can also learn how to do it :)))We plan to drive about 13.000 kilometers from the middle of April until the middle of September.We plan to go through Spain, Italy, Slovenia, Croatia, Montenegro, Albania, Greece, Macedonia, Serbia, Switzerland, Germany, the Netherlands, Denmark and Sweden.We plan to photograph lighthouses at the beaches of the North Sea, the Baltic Sea and the Mediterranean Sea (including the Alboran Sea, the Balearic Sea, the Tyrrhenian Sea, the Adriatic Sea and the Ionic Sea).We would like to attend 8 psytrance events and we are open to visit even more based on suggestions and ideas we are getting during the trip :)Psy events we would like to attend:AlkemikA Regeneration Gathering | 27-28 April | Lago di Vico, ItalyMulti Dimensional | 11-12 May | Malaga, SpainTransition Festival | 14-21 | Almonte, SpainMystic Mountain Festival | 1-7 July | Velebit, CroatiaShankra Festival | 17-21 July | Lostallo, SwitzerlandWe Are One Gathering | 13 - 19 August | Orvieto, ItalyPsy-Fi Festival | 28 August - 1 September | Leeuwarden, The NetherlandsPsychedelic Malmö | 14 September | Malmö, SwedenWe are very happy to meet you at some of these events or at other ones somewhere in Europe :)What we finance from own budget?Where we need your support?We decided that would love to live our dream and we are very very happy if you support us :))","In our life we have gone through many tough situations and we have never had any issues that we couldn´t solve together. However before our trip starts we would like to do two things:#1 We would like to sell our SUV in order to be able to buy a campervan. Now we are in Italy so it would be ideal to get a buyer here. If you can help us with this,  just let us know :)#2 We have three cats: Cica, Dixi and Kopi. We have gone through Slovenia, Italy, France and Spain together with them by car and now we clearly see that it would be the best for all of us if we would find loving new owners to Cica and Dixi and take only Kopi with us. Cica and Dixi were not so well with the travels and we think that life in a campervan and being on the road continuously for 5 months would be too much for them. If you can help us finding a new owner to them, please let us know.  Both cats are girls with 10+ years and very calm. Cica is Siamese, Dixi is a white house cat with black tail. Thanks for your help!:)Apart from these, we think there aren't any risks and challenges in this project. We are experienced travellers with more than 100.000 kilometers behind us in the previous 4 years. We tried all kind of travelling: we slept in our car for days in Sweden, we slept in our tent or in a hammock in Croatia, we used campsites for taking a rest and we also tried airbnb or other apartment sites many times. During our travels we were facing with challenges many times: we lost our bank card, we had defect on our car, our passport was expired, we ran out of fuel and so on.

Though, in the recent years, we started to live in a minimalist way in all areas of life:we decluttered our homewe got closer to naturewe simplified our financeswe started to eat healthierwe got rid of negative relationshipswe quit our bad habitswe were focusing on what's good and released the negative from our life... and we could go on. We started doing yoga, collecting experiences instead of objects, replacing our previous household products with organic ones and paying more attention to self-development.And we felt way much better.What did we got?peace of mindthe ability of self-reflectiona happier life full of joyful and beneficial activitiesbetter healthmore time for what we loveNow we would like to offer the same for everybody so we are planning to write a day-to day guide for minimalism. Based on our experiences, the simplification of life in so many areas require time, efforts and tough decisions and it's not something you can do in one day. We would like to help you by learning from our own experiences and guide you through this change so you won't get lost.Basic pack:Extras based on pledge amount:We suggest you to get the minimalist guide:If you read the e-book and do the daily challenges, very soon you will experience that you have more energy, more joy and more peace in your life. Minimalism is not about having less. Minimalism is having more through less. Your home will be more clean and organised, your diet will include a wider range of beneficial food, you will get rid of the relationships which pull you back and in general, you will develop an instinct to discover the good in small things rather than the negative.If we manage the collect enough money, the first step will be to write the content for both the e-book and the guidance cards. A few cards have already been done to have some samples, but still there are a lot to create. As soon as the content is ready, we can proceed with the designing. When both the content and the design is done, so our ""Beta version"" is ready, we are planning to find 10-20 volunteers to test us the cards for one month and tell us their opinion afterwards. Based on the feedbacks, we would like to the necessary modifications for a better experience and finalise everything. Once we are done, a proofreading will take place and that's it. If we will have backers who get a printed version, we need to find the ideal print format and printer company. We plan to finish the project the latest by March 2020. That means that you can start your 1-year challenge right at the beginning of spring, when nature also starts to change around you :)For the whole project, we will need approx. 800 euros. This includes the designing, the proofreading, one printed sample, the potential costs of delivery to the backers and the Kickstarter fee.","What can go wrong and how we can avoid it?1. Test month: It can happen that our volunteers quit testing the guidance cards during the test month and can't provide feedback. To overcome this challenge, we need to work together with a higher number of volunteers.2. Printing: Printing 420 guidance cards is not as easy as it may seem. Before the designing, we need to find the right format and size for the cards so we can print them for a good price, e.g. if the size will be the same as of a name card, we will find cheap printing with higher probability.Apart from these 2 challenges, we don't see any real risks related to the project."

I soon realized that my hobby was quickly turning into more then a hobby and people were really interested in the idea of wearing artful and detailed rings made from coins. To expand on this project I need to invest in better equipment so i can move into doing coins from around the world and also get into making earnings and pendants from every coin imaginable. I recently got my business liscense and also got approved as a member of the ""made in montana"" program. for more information and pictures of my rings visit my facebook page at www.treasurestatecoinrings.comRings made from clad quarters contain copper and nickel, some people have reactions from both of these metals, most common is a green or black finger. Clad coin rings come with a protective coating on the inside so there is no direct contact with the skin. The coating may need to be reapplied over time and clear nail polish works great as a coating. Clad coin rings are intended for occasional use.90% silver coin rings do not require a protective coating. Silver rings are intended for long term use.","As with any business there are risks of failure and also great success, i have been pleased with the response I have received from the customers I have acquired so far and many of them have had me make them a second or third ring. I have invested my own money on equipment so far which includes 100's of coins and in the beginning there were failures but over time I have figured out a proper technique to my craft.

Yes, you could try to use something like Irrlicht (and hope there is a SDL2 binding of some sort), but for the average person, those moving from BASIC or just starting programming, trying to get things working invloves decoding a not-very-helpful documentation system.GLBasic (on which the command set of Triority is based) does have a 3D system - it is just a case of moving that into Triority.Simples!The money is needed to cover the time and effort (as well as building rent) needed to read and write code.","Unfortunately, it isn't as simple as it sounds - first, it involves a lot of source code reading, and trying to understand what does what.It shouldn't hopefully take too long to understand the 3D routines in GLBasic and then implement them in Triority.It may also require the purchase (and possible re-write) of the DirectX/3DS to DDD converter code (which is currently still closed source).If that isn't possible, then it would just be matter of using the version that comes with GLBasic.Finally, the testing - this would involve creating test programs for each function (or group if some work together).I do already have a set of test programs, but this would need expanding.",https://www.kickstarter.com/projects/triority/plastic-manufacturing-management-system?ref=discovery_category_newest,triority/plastic-manufacturing-management-system,"I was the programmer for Plastics Software's Manufacturing Management System, which unfortunately never got released - which is something I now want to remedy.Once everything is running, I would like to convert the database system from Pervasive (which is expensive) to using mySQL (which is free).

Plain and simple.These facts below are sometimes obvious and it's painful to comprehend how this is not fully understood across the world.""Animal poaching"" is when an animal is killed illegally. It usually occurs when an animal possesses something that is considered valuable (i.e. the animal’s fur or ivory).""""Rhino horn is more expensive than GOLD.""""The three species of Asian rhino remain in grave danger: less than 300 Sumatran rhinos and only around 60 Javan rhinos are left, and poaching is an ever-present danger.""""...all three species (African, Forest and Asian) are endangered by habitat destruction and poaching.

To your left is furniture that has seen better days but that has this lived-in comfort as many transient denizens have occupied those seats. Much of the upholstery has this mold smell that isn’t immediately revolting but instead builds the venue’s character. To the farthest back are personable, mostly female baristas serving coffee and pastries and, behind them, the menu they took orders from was scrawled in crayon. They all have winning smiles and will chat you up at a moment’s notice.This, my friends, was the place that Jack M. Freedman and Douglas G. Cala ,, both aspiring spoken word performance poets and fast friends, first called home. The year was 2004. The place was the Muddy Cup.Fast forward to now and Jack has become a budding businessman whose publishing brand JMF Chapbooks LLC, operating and producing content since 2017, is at the apex of its most expansive project yet: a literary and visual art anthology featuring 80+ writers and artists. Jack bills his creation as “the largest anthology ever conceived” on Staten Island. No small feat, Jack, who has made waves in the spoken word scene for over a decade both in his home borough and elsewhere, has enlisted a staggering number of professional creatives to help bring his vision to fruition. He dubs his collection “Liberate the Verse” as it is his company’s aim to publish thought-provoking, incisive and substantive content thatspreads knowledge and creativity wherever and whenever humanly possible.In order for this to become a reality, he needed resources. In addition to an IndieGogo crowd-funding campaign in which JMF raised over $500 to contribute toward publishing costs, Jack and his newly minted marketing strategist and co-event organizer, Douglas G. Cala, had a successful fundraiser at a local pub and restaurant called Killmeyer’s Old Bavaria Inn which featured hand-selected performers who were contributors to “Liberate the Verse”. The crowd and the energy was palpable. In order to raise finishing funds, Jack and Doug have organized a second fundraiser, its last before the book is due for release in February 2019. It will take place at Duzer’s Local Market on January 19th from 8-11PM, directly across the street from the former Muddy Cup coffeehouse that started these two poets on their lifelong journey.The second fundraiser will mirror the template of the first in that a fully energized and diverse list of performers will once again take the stage. There will be raffles and door prizes in addition to a percentage of the proceeds going toward UNCF. As JMF Chapbooks LLC ushers in its second year of operation, it looks to the future as one of prosperity and creative vigor that never wanes.","We know many do not want to invest in poetry, but poetry is the medium which could use a boost in readership. We are hoping to have some generous backers to help us reach our goal. This book aims to speak truth to power and there are risks which even comes with that. We hope that a progressive audience will take interest in this project and will help us, as our tagline goes, #PublishTheRevolution."

https://www.kickstarter.com/projects/adira/adiras-adore-ments?ref=discovery_category_newest,adira/adiras-adore-ments,"I have always been interested in gemstones and crystals. I must admit I was not much of a jewelry girl until I realized I can make my own jewelry using these pretty naturally occurring gems and crystals!I have self studied and obtained crystals as a hobby for 2 reasons. Number 1 they are pretty and number 2 it is said in various beliefs that these gems and crystals can help with various emotional, physical and metaphysical subjects.We have always worn jewelry with gems and crystals. Most commonly diamonds, rubies, sapphires, etc. We have used them as birthstones, and many other things. I am able to customize bracelets, earrings, necklaces, and I am currently working on rings.I pretty much plan to turn my hobby into a full time business one day, but first I can do this part time for now. I know I would need to do a few things for legal and safety aspects. This is partially what I am raising funds for. If I want to expand, I need to do it the legal way to protect the best interest of everyone. Pretty much I am looking to get start up materials in bulk as well as take care of legalities to better service customers.I am currently working on my blog and store website that would give information about the types of gems/crystals I create jewelry from, their physical appearances and what they are said to be used for. The other part of funding would be towards the physical materials needed to make the jewelry, while many can be inexpensive. I need to have as much on hand as possible.","Since I am already creating the items for friends and family, it is not necessarily as risky as a start up-more so like a hobby expansion to introduce what I already create to others.The biggest risk and challenges would be lack of materials to complete the products in a timely fashion. I would hope that getting the funds through this campaign would alleviate lack of materials. The funding would set me up with a great amount of the materials and tools I need to start off on the right foot. Since I have thoroughly planned for these possibilities I prefer to create items ahead of time and advertise them as often as I can. This will allow customers to possibly choose pre-created items at possibly discounted prices, rather than run the risk of me not having the materials and not being able to complete the custom orders clients desire. Jewelry creation for me is pretty easy I have done it on bed rest!",https://www.kickstarter.com/projects/adira/nurturing-naturals?ref=discovery_category_newest,adira/nurturing-naturals,"I started creating bath items for myself years ago. Just recently I started making items for family and friends. They have encouraged me to expand and sell my items because so many people may suffer from sensitive skin issues and cant get luxurious bath items.My items will be made with of course love and care, but ingredients such as non toxic vegan colorants, essential oils and many everyday kosher/vegan food items. Some products may contain synthetic fragrances, but I will label these items as such and make sure that all products have their ingredients listed.I will be raising funds to start up this small business. I just need to get the items I already have on hand in bulk to make a lot of items to post as samples for my future website, etsy, facebook page, etc. This will pretty much help me advertise and you get to try some awesome samples of my products!","Since I have already created many of my items, I don't have a lot of risks and challenges. I believe my biggest obstacle will be securing the ingredients I need in bulk in time to ship to backers. I am prepared with several alternatives to purchase the ingredients as I have been doing, just to get the products out to backers. The ingredients are easily available in small portions at local stores, but I prefer to purchase them from bulk distributors."

IAK was featured as part the the 10th annual emerging artists in Chicago in 2015 and had a gallery show at Morpho Gallery also in Chicago where some of my poster art was displayed. Funding for this project will go towards making prints of my work on paper, canvas, metal and even throw pillows. I will also use funds to obtain artwork displays and canvases for art shows.For $150 you'll be collecting a 9""x12"" print then matted and framed of one 'Lady Lake'. For $400 it's your choice of art on canvas or metal up 16""x20"" by Isaac Akemadae Kenley from his print collection.At the art patron level of $850, you'll receive a large art piece on canvas or metal up to 36""x27"" from Isaac's print collection. At the art collector level of pledging $2,000 or more, you will receive a commissioned original work up to 24""x36"". Larger donations will be used for car expenses for transporting art. These type of pledges will receive a choice to have a painting on 4'x5' size canvases, or choose from IAK's collection. You can choose what colors you want and what you want it to be about. Artist does have right to refuse commissions that he deems offensive. If you are a musician at this level you can also have a poster design made fore you for merchandise sales up to 16""x20"". ","I've had many art shows over the years out of my apartment or in my neighborhood.  One reason why I'm asking for a little bit extra money is because we all have our own tastes in art and sometimes when you do an art show people are just checking you out, getting to know you and it may not lead to sale right away, but down the road a commission could happen.  I don't want to go on the road with my art shows in debt stressing about having to 'sell'.

It was powerful to read how love can evoke such a strong emotion out of humans and how little things such as touch, familiarity and smell can relate to love. Love is such a strong emotion and I believe that is a blessing when you find someone that loves you as much as you love them.We have found drugs that can help us with anxiety, help with depression, to make us happy. But there is nothing that man can make that can combat the feeling of love.With my visual book I want to be able to show things such as a loving hand around a waist, lips on the collarbone, caressing, and the intimacy of touch.It is fascinating to me that the touch of a loved one can make everything better. In this generation, we are used to ""instant"" relationships. Investing in short term people, settling for the moment. I want my book to remind people that love is still a beautiful thing.","My main goal is to raise money for the actual photo books and the studio.

The prop design will consist of wooden stools, a grey cloud backdrop, and a few ladders. I will also need to invest in angel wings that look as natural as possible.  After the live shoot, I will have people mingling, enjoying a light cocktail hour where I , along with another photographer, will be editing the pictures on a platform.

When I started learning photography, I was amazed by wonderful photos by professional nature photographers. The problem was that I couldn't take the same photos.I spent years of reading and learning until I could take some good photos. During this time, I understood that the long process can discourage some of beginners who are really interested in landscape photography.Why not to encourage them by letting them to shoot some awesome photos and then they get interested to learn more? MY PHOTOGRAPHY GUIDE IS NOT A BOOK. It is similar to flash cards. It is a quick and practical guide. Simply, find which photo card is similar to your scene. Look the back of the photo card and see settings (aperture, ISO and etc) with some useful tips. Then simply start shooting.I have traveled in the US for last two years to take photos of different places. As a learner I tested different sites, times and camera settings and tried to prepare good examples of landscape photographs for everyone. I believe this is the best starting point for the young generation of photographers and those who love photography but they don't have too much time to learn it.I have completed the first part of the project, which is taking different photos, with my personal budget. I need fund for the second part. In the second part, I will prepare the photo cards and put them in a very nice retail box. The information on each card will be about the location (all in the US in this version), time, light and camera settings in a few tables and charts.This project is not about photography only. It is about encouraging them to travel and spend time in nature.

All of them are a treasure for not only foreign tourists but also millions of americans who have not traveled in their country.I have plan to make a nice photobook of different landscapes and wildlife in america.

I have done this hoping to make it successful someday as a producer in children’s learning and entertainment. While my wife works full time I try to help financially by selling my DVD and Music CD in Ebay, iTunes, school fete, door knocking and by word of mouth.I previously worked as an account manager for a well known IT company. I was there for 12 years, loving my responsibilities and extending exceptional service to my clients until 1 day my 3 year old was hospitalised the day before his first birthday. We almost lost him due to 2 nasty viruses attacking his tiny body. My wife and I decided that one of us should stay at home and nurture him back to health. My wife was to resign but her company wouldn't let her go. I wanted to try my luck on own business, so I quit my job and focused on my family and business. It turned out to be the best decision we ever made. I see my sons grow up everyday plus the benefit of watching my small outfit come to life before my eyes.My Name is Lisa and I am part of Carick Animation.

All he ever wanted was to see 100% animations (with lots of singing and dancing). This gave me the idea so I decided to create my own show and guess what? He loved it! Then I started showing this to family and friends and they too encouraged mass production.__________ How Did I Managed to Produce the DVD ___________This is a one-man band business. I practically did everything on my own, The creativity, theme, ideas and concept came from my inner mind using only my old laptop at home. And with a handful of talented animators and musician building the work for me the outcome is a DVD!

The idea is that each person can have a Godinterest Site, add social networking features to their Godinterest Site, invite friends to participate with there Godinterest Site, but can also visit any other sites within the wider network with the content of all sites pulled into the centre of the network for logged in users to interact with - I need to work on the last bit.FundsServer Hosting Costs for 2 Years for Godinterest £2000.This could increase depending on site membership.Plugin Development (We want to develop a couple of plugins to enable the centralisation and streaming of network wide posts) £200Template Development for Godinterest Sites to help streamline the user signup experience £250Domain Registration for an additional 5 Years for Godinterest £100Domain Registration for an additional 5 Years for God.ag and BiblePress.co £500Domain Registration for an additional 5 Years for Christian.ac £150Securing other domain names for blogging service £500Development of custom ios and andriod apps £25000Godinterest is a project of designer, journalist, social & new formats editor and grateful christian dad, Dean Jones. “Godinterest is not an alternative silo: instead, it’s what you build when you believe that the web itself is the great social network and understand the need for people to own their data but still exercise freedom of speech and religion on the web.” ""Godinterest bloggers and writers connect to mainstream news sites, other non-faith blogs, and online collaborative knowledge networks such as Wikipedia and can be anything from personal diaries to daily screeds about current events. Some are highly opinionated and include funny personal stories.But their content is also unique as many spiritual blogs are written by people seriously engaging with their faith and others by people who do not believe in a super being, but evolution. Some bloggers write specifically about sacred texts. Others are more culturally oriented, covering the ways faith intersects with the arts and politics.By chronicling how they experience faith in their everyday lives, Godinterest bloggers are not only connecting with the wider public, but also to themselves and are gradually carving out their own section of the blogosphere.""Back to the second thing I’m doing that is pulling together Godinterest's first publication and I’d love your support for it on Kickstarter.This first publication will essentially make the case forThe Religious Blogspot aka Godinterest as Christian Social Network for Bloggers and Writers and show you how to participate in the growing community.Some of the topics:You’ll get the publication itself and early access to Godinterest's newest features. Whenever the Kickstarter project is successfully funded, I'll start sending out invites to backers.Over the last couple years, I've posted dozens of articles on Godinterest about independent blogging, blogging theology, social networks and the open web. Some of them have even inspired others to write more on their own site. I'll be going through all of these posts to take the best writing — as well as brand new essays and technical topics — to put together this book. I'm putting everything I have into the first publication.There's a growing community and movement around independent blogging and niche microblogging networks. With your support, we can make this happen.","There is a potential risk that this project never really takes off and at the end of the 5 year period the site closes. We are hopeful this will not happen, and that the technologies that are available in 5 years will exceed what we have now and also be cheeper than what we have now.",https://www.kickstarter.com/projects/deanjones/christian-blogspot?ref=discovery_category_newest,deanjones/christian-blogspot,"Godinterest - Christian Blogs on Jesus Christ, Bible & ChristianityHi, I’m Dean Jones. I’m a, dad, Christian, entrepreneur, business owner, writer, and lover of all things creative.Recently, after 15 plus years of being a project manager, my life took an enormous change and I found myself wondering “who am I?” and “What am I doing with my life?” As new direction for my life began to unfold, the Lord placed Godinterest into my hands and He said “consider this”. After much prayer and consideration I decided Godinterest was a good fit for my family, I then became the owner of Godinterest in 2014.It used to be said that everyone has a book in them, but these days, it might be more appropriate to argue that everyone has a viral blog post in them. Plenty of people retain a thirst for more thoughtful writing than a tweet can afford, and faith bloggers are no exception.Spiritual bloggers are increasingly carving out their own section of the blogosphere and I'm working on Godinterest, a free, platform for faithful bloggers to blog about faith, culture, life and all that other stuff!Godinterest currently brings together the Christian faith community, academics, and the broader public into a single environment, and is already a place where many people turn on a regular basis for insight, inspiration, daily devotionals, and stimulating discussion of a kind never seen before.The social focus of the project is a publishing platform that allows Christian writers, thinkers, and storytellers from all walks of life and of all age groups to post relevant takes on topics that matter the most and allow find fresh thinking and unique perspectives. The technical focus of the project is simply a good user interface. My visionMy vision is for Godinterest is to continue to serve its faithful blogging community in their quest to reach the world via a quarterly magazine that captures the best and most inspirational community blogs posts. I hope to expand the offer of resources to assist faith bloggers and to foster a community where we encourage one another in our efforts.Manifesto of ethicsTo promote freedom of religion – Violations of religious freedom are increasing globally in scale, depth and blatancy. Carried out by both government and non-state actors, they range from the mundane to the extreme (e.g. genocide).To promote freedom of expression and internet freedom – Freedom of expression is an essential part of a properly functioning democracy and a free society. People should be free to express themselves both online and offline. But in many parts of the world freedom of expression is under threat.To be a inclusive social network – We aim to share multiple voices and perspectives. We prohibit and will remove Offensive material that has been reported to contain (e.g., Pornographic material, hate speech, encouraging violence against others, etc)To respect one’s right to remain anonymous – Our users place their trust in us to keep them safe, and, in some cases, anonymous. We view safeguarding that trust and protecting our users’ private information as vital to what we do.What Are People Saying About Christian Blogging?Over the past few weeks I’ve been putting out the call for new faith bloggers to get started and for given-up faith bloggers to give Godinterest a try. I’ve been calling for bloggers who have turned all their attention to writing for ministry blogs to also consider writing for Godinterest.comThis has generated a fair bit of discussion and today I want to look to some of the noteworthy contributions I’ve collected (admitting, of course, that I’m sure I’ve missed a few). So if you’re into blogging, or are considering sponsoring this project, maybe read through a few of these.Chris Thomas:Why I started blogging. Why I stopped. And why I started again.“Something had occurred over all those years and across all those platforms, something had silently been growing though not even I had been aware. I grew a voice. Somewhere in the midst of it all, I suddenly became aware of the tone I best carried, the audience I wept for, and the hope I had been crafted to shout about over the white noise of the world. It was the gospel. It had always been the gospel. But the gospel is no puddle that dries up following a summer storm, the gospel is grander and deeper than the Pacific that throws itself against the shoreline not far from my home. So I found my beach where I just keep dipping into the cool waters of grace that endlessly swish around my ankles, and I throw it with abandon on whoever walks close enough.”Samuel James: The Present and Future of Christian Blogging. “As I see it, Tim is right in articulating the problems that come when evangelical online writing is heavily filtered toward these large sites. But I think we could add that there are problems to deal with when it is not filtered, and that these problems are, for most Christian readers (not writers), trickier to deal with than the other kind. I’ll mention 3 of them…”Why a faith blogging network?In the age of Web 2.0 a blog has become an integral part of online communication. A blog is an ideal complement for anyone - it's updated regularly, and provides a simple way of sharing experiences and expertise, whether the subject matter is personal or professional.Like most blogs, faith-based blogs tend to be highly opinionated and often include funny personal anecdotes. But their content is also unique--many spiritual blogs are written by people seriously engaging with and struggling with their faith. Some bloggers write specifically about sacred texts. Others are more culturally oriented, covering the ways faith intersects with the arts and politics.FundingGodinterest is free publishing platform. There is no advertising, monetizing, or venture capital. Your donations directly support full-time development of the project.Supporting this Project will help pay for its hosting, as well as the development of the project and expansion of the team.“Its also hard to express the degree to which the Internet is changing society. We started Godinterest with the hopes of influencing culture and creating amovement online. With technology becoming such a huge part of our lives most people couldn’t envision life without it. At Godinterest we couldn’t be more convinced that God has a purpose for this technology, and so Godinterest is dedicated to utilising it to empower faith communities, academics, and the broader public into a single environmentand is the place where many people turn on a regular basis for insight, inspiration, and stimulating discussion.God is awesome.Godinterest is on a mission to tip the scale and shed more light in dark places.

Before you judge, let me say that I know there are quite a few out there. What will set us apart is our creativity of a fusion menu, a significant culinary background, and a passion for great food! All of that is brought to you by a colorful and family oriented group that wants to fill your belly as well as your heart. This food truck concept will combine Latin and Polynesian flavors to create an explosion of taste in each taco. Currently our menu consists of 6 different tacos, 3 sides and 2 dessert choices. While our menu may sound small the flavors and creativity are abundant! We have been researching different options for the food truck. Currently we have set our sights on a few used food trucks in our price range. As many business startups are expensive a food truck gives us the best shot at success with the least amount of overhead. Building a food truck from the ground up can be way more costly than our goal of $35k so we have set our sights on some used food trucks. These trucks are partially or fully turnkey. All we will need to do is add our branding and stock the food! There are several local bars and businesses that are amicable to a food truck of our cuisine and will allow us to use the property. We have also looked into food truck bazaars in our areas of interest as well as quite a few markets. The more locations we can test the more of our awesome tacos we can deliver to you!","There are always risks involved with starting a business.  This risk does not diminish with restaurant or food truck concepts.  While the cost of overhead is lower than a stand-alone business we will still have to tackle the obstacles of permitting and location.  The city of Orlando is not as open to food trucks as they once were.  This can be overcome by having and making new relationships with local businesses.  Being involved in food truck bazaars and markets is essential to survival just as marketing on social media and websites will be.  The issue of permitting is more tricky but only because it is normally definite and the time and cost to pull permits oneself is laborious.  I have a familiarity with obtaining permits.  Food cost and cost control are other issues that can make any, even a great concept, restaurant/food truck fail.

I hadn't seen him in several months and I wanted everything to be perfect. I thought out every headache inducing detail and came to the conclusion that I'd need more than new outfits, I'd need new undergarments as well.My favorite bra, the one that not only looked good but was comfortable and made me feel confident wearing it, was decorated with a bold leopard print. Under some of the clothes I had chosen this wouldn't have been an issue, except that I'd bought this beautiful white lace dress. The leopard print shone through like a beacon and really dulled the classy edge that the dress presented.So I headed off to the store in search of new undergarments that I hoped would really WOW my husband. I started first at local stores with bras that were on the more affordable side but nothing fit or looked well. So, I eventually wound up at Victoria Secret and got my attention grabbed by the lace bras, the playful bras, the muted pastel colored bras and the angelic white bras. I walked out of the store with four new bras the day before my flight and four hundred dollars poorer. That's right, $400. For bras that I wasn't really in love with, I'd only liked how pretty they were.That night, I stood in front of the mirror staring at my bold, slightly worn out, leopard print bra and thought to myself, ""This would be so much easier if I could change your color."" It was then that the idea started to fester and form. Why couldn't it be possible to take the bra that fits, feels and makes you feel the best about yourself, and change it to fill your needs?Instead of spending obscene amounts of money on bras that are pretty, why not take a bra that fits right and easily cover it with a cover that is lace detailed or silky? Feeling fun and goofy? Why not have a big yellow smiley face over one cup and rainbows on the other? Each cup cover is individual so the combinations are endless.It doesn't matter if you are 13 or 130, if you wear a bra then you can have the ability to customize it however you want. The application is very easy, with a few well placed magnets that hold the cover in place without damaging your bra, and can quickly be removed and replaced.The $50,000 I am asking for will help with the costs of protecting my ideas and other necessary fees to help to make this business the success that I know it can be, keep our website up and running and purchasing the materials to make each of the bra covers.

This new digital technique will allow the team to create small scale models of large dinosaurs that have been previously too big and heavy to study their movement mechanics. This technique also applies to the smaller detailed fossils that are too rare and delicate to be handled by students, this allows for a more hands on approach to educating about these amazing creatures.Clear and SimpleOur aim with the funds we would receive from Kickstarter:These funds would be used to improve the technology in which we produce our printed fossils, We have made huge steps in a short space of time in our technical aspects and the contacts we have made. This opportunity would allow us to perfect our techniques for the more challenging replicas we intend to make.Long term aim:Our long term aim does unfortunately largely depend on Kickstarter, but with a successful pitch we are aiming for a vast database of all the replicas we produce in which they can be used by educational and research institutions to further and widen our knowledge on these amazing animals!What are we?PaleoPrint is a 3D printing service within the paleontological industry. We are a unique service that provides fossil replica models to the education and research industries trough the means of 3D printing.Alex Clarke (BSC Hons in Geology) 'From personal experience I have felt the frustration in studying fossils when we can't even touch them!'How do we do it?Using our Stratsy 3D printer we can achieve millimetric precision needed for the replication of fossils, using over 30 years of CAD experience we have perfected the process in which it takes to produce spotless prints.We have used a variety of scanners over the last year from which we have identified the most suitable 3D scanner that will take us forward.Obviously some dinosaurs were pretty big! However we have previously scaled down larger fossils such as skulls and even whole skeletons!What do we produce?So far our team has focused on developing the smaller more detailed fossils that are not necessarily rare or hard to find but demand the most precision and detail from our 3D printer. These fossils aren't the most impressive but they have set us up so we can deliver the same results in the much larger fossils.Why is 3D printing better than plaster casting?3D printing has numerous advantages over the original methods of plaster casting fossils. Here are a few:- Superior detail and accuracy- 3D scanning vastly reduces the handling of specimen fossils.- 3D files can be sent from the excavation site through portable scanning- No need for transporting plaster casts from different countries-The study of dinosaur movement has thus far been a 'no go' area of paleontology, since trying to turn a 80 ton plaster replica of a giant sauropod into a moving robot is a little bit difficult!What we need?The funds from a successful Kickstarter campaign would ignite Paleoprint to expand our service internationally! The great thing is our business is portable! And with a great HQ all we need is our own 3D scanner (not rented anymore!) so we can travel to the fossils on the larger size and those which may be to fragile to move!Our Ambitions!To 3D scan and print the rarest and most impressive fossils discovered on earth! We can bring these pieces of history to education establishments in a cheaper and more interactive form of learning, getting hands on is far more stimulating than studying from a distance!(put it this way, we all can be a bit clumsy when it comes to rare and expensive things!)Our long term ambition is too successfully create a database of 3D scanned fossils, these scans would be for download by the public or they can purchase a replica from Paleoprint!","We almost have all the tools to preserve a unlimited amount of ancient fossils, we just need that financial push! If anything we are preventing the risk of breaking some of the most impressive and valuable fossils on earth!",https://www.kickstarter.com/projects/1520246630/paleoprint-3d-printing-geoscience?ref=discovery_category_newest,1520246630/paleoprint-3d-printing-geoscience,"PaleoPrint is a very young but innovative 3D printing service within the Geo-science industry.

By 3D scanning geological surfaces we can print them at magnification to easily study the movement of fluids such as oil and gas through the lithology at qustion.This research could potentially change practices in fracking and various Oil & Gas extraction techniques. By understanding the geology at each extraction point the optimum amount of resources can be obtained at lesser costs.Our financial goal will allow us to expand our research and promote it to companies within the industry. Giving us an opportunity to test our technology on actual geological samples from such extraction sites.3D Terrain mapping is new innovative practice in surveying. Through the use of GIS software3D terrain can be generated for use in land surveying and geological mapping.3D printed terrain can be used for cross section study, to aid geological students in observing and understanding geological mapping and the dipping of bedding planes and fault lines.Our Achievements and GoalsThe funds from a successful Kickstarter campaign would ignite Paleoprint to expand our service internationally!

There's also some rednecks and a lot of wannabe hippies. Long story short, there's a lot of fun to be had.

In addition to funny and sometimes informative text, art from marvelous local artists will be featured throughout each issue. We need the money to print the first issue, and to pay the artists and contributors. It's a small zine, so we don't need an exorbitant amount of money. Just some money to make a bunch of full-color copies and to compensate the artists for their extraordinary talent.","The artists could not do the art in time, and thus the first issue is delayed. Other than that, the zine could suck, no one could buy it, and it would strongly discourage us from making future issues.

We want to share their work with you. This new monthly magazine is the perfect way to do it. It's quite simple. Every month artists and writers will contribute their work, and we will put it in the magazine. Music reviews of local artists will be present, as well as interviews and articles about all the latest and greatest in the Humboldt County art world. The magazine is free and ad-based, and it will be distributed at local bookstores, cafes, and other businesses that wish to carry it.     The first issue is almost complete, we just need your help to print it! All of the money raised in this Kickstarter will go to print the magazine. Once we have a worthy product, we are going to present it to local businesses, and acquire advertisers to continue to make issues of Artomic Warfare.     We already have several ads from generous local businesses, but not nearly enough to print enough copies. Our plan is to print what we can, and fundraise at the Eureka and Arcata Arts Alive events in October. We will be selling prints of various art that's in the mag, (including the cover) and accepting donations in exchange for one of the few copies we will be printing. When we raise the money through that and this Kickstarter, we will print enough copies to distribute to our distributors. This will cause more people to take an interest in advertising in the magazine, thus allowing it to sustain itself!

There are millions of aspiring writers in the world who have little to no chance at getting published. My dream is to help those people turn their dreams into a reality. This project is a stepping stone toward my dreams of opening a small press or literary agency for new writers everywhere.In order to succeed, there are a few steps I need to complete in order to offer future writers everywhere the best I can give them:Because the Denver Publishing Institute is run by such big companies and names, and because it offers so much information to future employees in the industry, it comes with a hefty price tag. The cost of tuition, housing, meals, and around-trip airfare was $6850 for 2014. I expect this cost to increase slightly for 2015. For more about why I need help with the cost of tuition, check out my bio page. For more about the Denver Publishing Institute, click here.If I reach or exceed my goal, I will throw a big party in June 2015 to celebrate. All backers will be invited to come, whether they contribute $1 or $1,000!As an added bonus to inspire aspiring writers to back me, any writer who backs me will have an automatic pitch once I get my new company off the ground. The hope is to complete the BA, MFA, and DPI and get started with a few fellow writers and marketers I know by 2017 (at the latest). I am doing all of this for those writers who are turned away by the conglomerate of large press publishing.","Risk: All of the money given the help get me to the school and get my dreams off the ground are contingent on my acceptance to the Institute. Less than 100 students are admitted. If I am not accepted for 2015, I will apply again in 2016. Meanwhile, money given for the education will be saved for it.Challenges: It is hard for me to come up with the money for this part of the education because there is no federal aid available like there is for undergrad and grad school, and scholarships are extremely limited. My husband is a med school student, and I am a full time student, so neither of us have regular jobs while we pursue our dreams. I also have two toddlers at home that have to be cared for, so the biggest challenge for me is getting the money to pay for the eduction I need to succeed.

Meanwhile read a little more about Metamorphose, and what we aim to do.Our MissionMetamorphose is a literary e-magazine dedicated to discovering new voices in the genres of fantasy and science fiction (and all the sub-genres they entail). We aren't interested in authors who have published books or more than 3 short stories. We want the newbies looking to crack the publishing shell. There are a lot of great voices out there who aren't heard. Why? Self-publishing has caused traditional publishers (and established magazines) to batten down the hatches and become more selective. They want names that sell. There's nothing wrong with this. It's a business decision with a reasonable foundation. Unfortunately it cuts out a large chuck of brilliant voices.Metamorphose was founded as an undergraduate project, but it is completely dedicated to succeeding. We want to offer those new voices a home.The staff at Metamorphose works on a volunteer basis. We don't have the funding or the income to pay them for all their hard work. First, we all agree that we want to pay the authors/artists for theirs.Where We Want to GoIt benefits the authors/artists who submit their work to us just as much as it does us if we become a reputable and established magazine. This is our goal. Not only do we want to give our authors/artists a good reputation by publishing with us, but we want to pay them for their hard work. Someday, we would like to pay our staff as well. Hopefully we gain readership through subscriptions to make it all possible.In a perfect world (or the world of fantasy where we currently reside), Metamorphose wants to gain enough recognition to be nominated for awards, another way to benefit our authors/artists as well as us.Where We are as of TodayMetamorphose is currently hosted for free on WordPress. We want to change that, but the domain is just one more cost we have to find the funds for. There are currently only two people on staff. Both have a major in English. The staff built the website (and is still working on it), created Twitter and Facebook accounts for Metamorphose, and is working hard to prepare for launch. There are no submissions as of yet. This is largely because we have not yet launched the site. The more funding we receive, the more successful Metamorphose's launch will be. When we say you are getting in as we pour the foundation for the magazine, we mean it.The funding for this e-magazine may seems small to some and large to others. Here is a breakdown of where that money will go.","Risk: Authors/artists may not come to us. Without them, we fail.Challenge: Getting authors/artists to know that we exist. Funding we have left over will go toward getting ads in the right (and reputable) places so that people submit. If we can get this ball rolling, the rest should come in time."

Our materials are not food safe.Tom: I have more than 40 years experience creating unique, innovative products and more than 18 US Patents. I also have been creating computer art for about 30 years and currently design 3D printed bronze/stainless steel jewelry. I think passion is the key to life; I have always been accomplishment driven. I'm 71 going on 20 and refuse to act my age. The right side of my brain has, I think, partnered with the left side of my brain because I find creativity in both art and mechanical design. More on Tom's StoryDan: I have more than 17 years experience designing and implementing manufacturing systems. My passion is in working with our youth through Scouting and FIRST LEGO League, a robotics competition. I see too many kids who aren't hitting their potential and hope to inspire them to solve the many problems our society faces.We've always had a vision to create and bring unique and innovative products to fruition and help inspire the next generation. We have known each other from the local Kenosha Wisconsin Inventor Club for a number of years and recently decided to work together and make that vision a reality.This project is dedicated to our friend, Bob Balow, who recently and unexpectedly passed away. Bob was the President of the Inventor Club and an inspiration to everyone he touched.We hope you will support us in this project.Please tell your friends about us and help spread the word; we need your help.","We have more than 13 years experience designing and sourcing 3D printed items and are committed to transparency and achieving our goals. The 3D printed components will be crafted by a reliable, quality focused source located here in the United States.

His images have won numerous awards and have been used on a variety of high profile album covers, such as 2007 Grammy winning ""Native American Album of the Year""In honor of the MAKE/100 Kickstarter campaign, he is creating 100 beautiful, signed and numbered giclee prints on heavy, archival paper.Don’t miss Tom’s first major limited edition print release . . . . ..I have been creating fractal images for over 30 year, since the Microsoft DOS days, for those who can remember them (or care to). As my images matured, I started sharing my prints on paper and digitally, for more to see and enjoy. I have always viewed fractal art as an adventure, exploring and shaping a world no one has seen before. I try to create places that stir emotion with my images and are more than just geometry. I hope you enjoy viewing my art as much as I do in creating it... ...","Tom has been creating and printing digital images for many years, thus the risks are relatively low. As with any project, there are always things that can come up, which we will communicate should the need arise. We look forward to bringing this project to the Kickstarter, MAKE 100 community."

Many individuals do not take the time to consider how other people perceive the world or look at how many times our sense fail us.  As we speed through life we tend to transfer a lot of what we should be consciously processing into automatic thoughts. Part of the reason is that our brains naturally do this for us to make our information processing quicker.  However, when we stop paying attention we miss details and thus leave ourselves vulnerable to misinterpretation. Our senses can deceive us if we are not constantly monitoring them.  For example, in my daily life, I notice this phenomena occurring while I am driving.  As I approach a light and see it turn yellow I often misjudge the distance my car has to travel versus the time it takes to make the light before it turns red. This often causes me to drive through an intersection illegally.	When I first began to envision these projects, the idea of how simply our senses can deceive us grabbed hold of my attention.  I started to think about everything I had learned and realized that we misinterpret events all day long and many we are not even conscience of!  I began to come up with ideas of how, through art, I could remind myself and others that reality is not always as it seems and to humbly remind myself that I am not always right. I say this not for the mere fact that I made a wrong decision but because my interpretation was incorrect. We make decisions using any and all the information that is available to us, especially from our senses. However this information, even ifit is believed to be correct, can be wrong.  To demonstrate this, my project uses small perceptual differences in color that the eye has trouble differentiating between in order to create a illusion of identical images.  At first glance colors on both art pieces look the same.  However, it is not until the tiles are moved one begins to see that their initial assessments of which tiles were different is proved wrong and the truth is revealed.So it was with these thoughts in mind that I created my first piece of art and began to create a website called www.interactiveperspectiveart.com.   I would hope that there are people who will use my art to remind themselves as well, that reality is all in how you perceive it.  I suppose I would be satisfied if it were used to entertain a guest with a slight trick of the eye or to just maybe open the mind of another individual to the idea that we do not always see what we think we see. ","The challenges that I foresee may have to do with production delay as each one piece takes quite a bit of time to put together.  If there are more orders than I have anticipated, and I hope there are, I have already put together a team of friends that will help get each piece ready and sent out.",https://www.kickstarter.com/projects/193768559/optical-illusion-art-color-perception?ref=discovery_category_newest,193768559/optical-illusion-art-color-perception,"When I first began to envision these projects, the idea of how simply our senses can deceive us grabbed hold of my attention.

https://www.kickstarter.com/projects/895839954/aspiring-graphic-artists-student?ref=discovery_category_newest,895839954/aspiring-graphic-artists-student,,Not having the proper amount of money is always a struggle as a student. Making it even more difficult is the struggle to often compromise on the artwork based on lack of said resources. Graphic design is one major in  which the utensils or technology in which you have at hand all play a tremendous part. Possibly the only risk I face if said project is finished... is turn around time for the vinyl stickers or art prints. Realistically all of said artwork is at my disposal and such obstacles should be fairly scarce. Turn around time for physical portions of artwork should be no longer than 2-3 weeks. I can only hope you enjoy as much as I enjoy creating!!!,https://www.kickstarter.com/projects/895839954/art-fund-for-young-illustrator?ref=discovery_category_newest,895839954/art-fund-for-young-illustrator,"Who are you?Hello everyone! My name is Shaquan Duncan, I'm a 23 year old student living in San Diego, CA in hopes of becoming a successful illustrator/designer.What are you creating? Aside from working my regular 9-5, i spend the remainder of my free time trying to create. When I'm not creating for myself, I create for others as well. I've been drawing and have had a deep love and passion for art for as long as could pick up crayon's and pencil's. For about the last 2 years I've been able to really hone my skills and generate my own wave...artistically speaking. My pieces are unique and or original (in concept & execution) and are a true showcase of the creative space within my mind. All of the artwork I create is a true extension of myself and the things in which I love (Music, Popular culture, etc.). Why have you ultimately chosen to crowd fund?Thank you for asking!I am here today in hopes that I can gather enough donations for a new Canon PIXMA PRO-1 inkjet printer!!! Over the duration of time in which I've been able to create and put my artwork out into the world. I've also garnered the respect and admiration of my peers... those of which have come to enjoy my work(s) just as much as I do. The goal is to be able to purchase the Pixma Pro-1 and finally get my artwork out into the world and to the masses. If you are an artist (and even if you aren't) you can potentially understand the meaning of being able to create for others and for them to be able to truly enjoy and appreciate what you do. I want to be able to help my potential consumer(s) by eliminating the middle man....and the printer allows me to do just that. With the printer I'll be able to create my fine art prints and eliminate the need for outsourcing that would otherwise occur without it. The printer not only allows me to save time and money in the long run (while still delivering high quality prints), but it allows me to price the said prints at a reasonable price for potential customers/fans alike. Where will this money be going?All funds are strictly for the purchase of said printer.The printer itself cost 999.99. Shipping and extra cost (in terms of ink, etc) will be covered by me.Why is this so important to you?I'm currently in a transitioning stage in my life where I feel I can go nowhere but up from here. I've spent countless days and hours honing my skills as a creative and I believe it's finally beginning to pay off. I really want to be able to share with the world because I believe I have something that truly worth sharing. When you are passionate about anything in life, sometimes you want others to feel the same way you do. I'm working extremely hard to save up in-between time but it's not always easy when life hits you sometimes...ya'know? No worries though...just got to get back up and readjust. My art is the one variable (don't forget my loved ones) that stays consistent and keeps me sane at times. I feel that it is only a matter of time before I am able to really bloom and provide for those around me with my talents. In the meantime I will continue to work as hard as humanly possible (and then some) and get better with each passing day. The printer will undoubtedly change the way I am able to make moves with this love affair I call art.The mere thought of an individual (known or unknown) who is willing to make a true investment for something that I truly yearn for, is a blessing in and of itself. Anything else?That's all folks! Thank you all for taking the time to donate and or share with others to help me reach my goal and chase what I am most passionate about. Follow up with me on my social media account via instagram @93_tillinfinityOne Love.-Shaquan",There aren't any real risks that I should come across aside from raising the amount in which I need. I am ultimately trying to create a business by being able to sell my art prints.
https://www.kickstarter.com/projects/88651000/number-rush?ref=discovery_category_newest,88651000/number-rush,"I find some simple casual games are quite fun to play, such asBejeweled and Candy Crush. I also noticed they let player work with shapes or colors but never with numbers.Why not numbers? I believe a casual game working with numbers will also be fun to play and also refreshing. It may even be used to teach preschool children.I already have a good idea how the gameplay should be and what kind of functions will be interesting to have. It is a matter of implementing it with an app.The app will target both iOS and Android platforms.Attached below are some work in progress screenshots.","With this project, the most significant risk will be time. Because I will be working on it on my spare time and I also have a family to tend to.I have already started writing the program and have a good idea how much effort it will take to make a decent app (and it is not trivial). I also will use some libraries available commercially to help me speed up the process. In fact, the fund raised here will go towards the cost of these commercial libraries and tools.I will try my best to deliver the game on time. But if there is delay due to unforeseen event taking my time, the game release and reward will be delayed, by weeks not months.If you can't contribute money to the project but find the project interesting, please try out the game when it is released (targeting July or August). Also you can tell your friends about it.",https://www.kickstarter.com/projects/88651000/numberrush?ref=discovery_category_newest,88651000/numberrush,"I have tried to raise funding for this project earlier this year, unsuccessfully. I am hoping, that was because the game was just a concept and hard for people to appreciate.Now I have released the first version of the game, it is a lot easier for you to see what it is and decide to back the project if you like it. You can get the game from Apple App Store and Google Play.I plan to improve the game if I can attract enough interest in the game. The main improvement I already have in mind is the level editor. I want to give player more precise control in making new levels, hopefully more interesting and challenging levels.Another area to improve is play-ability (is that a word?). Currently, if there is no possible chain, player is forced to use power up or end the game. Perhaps that can be improved upon so player doesn't have to do that.If you can't contribute money to the project but find the game interesting, please tell your friends about it. Thank you.","As I stated in my previous fund raising attempt, the most significant risk will be time. But I have a good idea of the amount of the effort needed and I think I have given myself plenty of time to finish it.In case I can't complete the project (which is extremely unlikely), I will refund all contribution if that is allowed by kickstarter."

I spent about ten years in the Air Force as a Security Forces Airman. Now I am at the University of Hartford studying film.While at Hartford I have created some short films, and a web series called Defending which is a comedy about Air Force Security Forces. I have used my experiences in the military to attempt to make this as realistic as I can with limited resources.Just as important as DEFENDING and all of its spinoffs is the work I am doing on short films. They are not all comedies, some like Police Three were made to call attention to bigger issues.So that brings me to my next project that I am working on. The working title is Snowplow. This title is definitely going to change. The film is about a firefighter named Malcolm and a EMT named Jen. They have run into some relationship issues when they come into work at the firehouse. They are dispatched to a medical emergency which forces them to take another look at what is their priorities in their relationship.With your help I will be able to continue creating new episodes of DEFENDING, and create new short films. If you can't help, I understand and I hope you enjoy what we have to offer. And please share with your friends and family. Thank you.","With every project there are risks and challenges. With Defending it's finding actors and places to shoot each episode. For Snowplow, I am working with a local Fire Department and city EMS to see if they will help me film. They still need to run it through their leadership before we know for sure if they will be assisting. If you are a member of a Fire Department or EMS company in Connecticut that would like to help with location and equipment please contact me. Thank you.",https://www.kickstarter.com/projects/140672292/name-pending-productions-0?ref=discovery_category_newest,140672292/name-pending-productions-0,"For the past three years Name Pending Productions has produced some web shorts and web series. The most popular of which are DEFENDING, WEEKEND SAFETY BRIEF, and MILITARY HISTORY LESSON. These projects have been a blast to work on.However for the past projects we have been working on a very limited budget. This is why we find ourselves here. We have so many stories we want to tell, but we need your help to reach our vision. With your help we will can make the next season better then the last two. The more we raise the more we can do.The thousand dollars we are asking for is for the bare minimum like props and rentals. But the more we get, the more we can achieve. We would like to go further with our stories than we have gotten so far, more actors, more locations, more props and more stories. We won't be able to do this without you.","This project is gonna be difficult. We want to include music video spoofs, get more actors outside of Barkley, Poulin, Jackson, and Smith. Getting these actors will be a challenge. Finding locations like airports and private property will be difficult. But I know we can do all this with your help."

https://www.kickstarter.com/projects/redonerrythang/haystack-mujer-original-storytelling-by-rosaxsalva?ref=discovery_category_newest,redonerrythang/haystack-mujer-original-storytelling-by-rosaxsalva,"****MISSION:Haystack Mujer empowers girls & mujeres in Hayward, the Bay Area and beyond through storytelling.****GROUND RULES:1) I do not permit Verbal, Emotional, Psychological, Physical and Sexual violence in my vicinity.2) The details you divulge during a storytelling session are confidential. A storytelling session is simply a time to tell stories about your life, which can get personal if you have been through tough obstacles.3) My role is to create a safe and empowering space, be genuinely nice, and ask straightforward questions to encourage you to share your story.****HISTORY:""Haystack"" is Hayward's nickname; ""Mujer"" is woman in Spanish. I am being very intentional about starting my business in Hayward, my hometown. I understand well the severe lack of resources for the personal growth of youth, and girls in particular. My unique form of storytelling blends together Words, Movement and Voice, and my wok will be documented in my upcoming podcast, Haystack Mujer, which will be available on my YouTube channel.Aside from spending time developing Haystack Mujer, and The Hayward Collective, I use my storytelling tools to tell my own story. RosaxSalvaje is the part of me that fearlessly expresses herself. My 1) words (writing), 2) movement (dancing and self-defense), and 3) voice (public speaking) are fairly fine-tuned, and I want to add a fourth element to my storytelling: 4) sound (music production).REWARDS FOR CONTRIBUTION:$25= 1 Hour Session$50= 3 Hour Session$128= 5 Hour SessionYou can choose the workshop, and/or interview. You can mix and match based on 1 hour increments:1) Writing Workshop2) Dance Workshop3) Public Speaking Workshop4) Interview, which will be publicized on the Haystack Mujer podcast (haystackmujer.org and Youtube channel)There are specific reasons for my wanting to raise $5,000!1) $1,760 for the Razer Blade Stealth:https://www.razer.com/Gaming-System/Razer-Blade-Stealth-H2-H3/p/RZ09-02393E31-R3U1(It's $1,599 plus $156 for tax, and I rounded to the nearest tenth)My current laptop is on its last legs, with black squares randomly showing up on my screen, freezes, and the battery's inability to keep the device on without the power cord. After conducting research, I chose the Razer Blade Stealth because it has all the specifications (processor, memory and storage) necessary to successfully produce music. The Razer will be the major device for my business. There will be a use for music, staying up on communication with my clients for storytelling sessions, updates to social media and my website about my newest content, and access to Youtube and Patreon to continually post my work.2) $860 for Ableton Push and Ableton Live Software Intro:https://www.ableton.com/en/shop/push/($799, plus $57.93 for tax, and I just rounded to the nearest tenth)Ableton Live is a software for music production; Push is the hardware that accompanies the software, which will easily integrate the sounds that I create onto Ableton Live (which will be downloaded onto my Razer) to edit and refine them.3) 1,200 for 1 month of expenses:****Full disclosure: I quit my 9-5 job in early January 2018 because I knew what I wanted to pursue but I needed the time, energy and resources to continually think about it, plot it and begin to make it happen. This also worked out because my dad received a kidney transplant on March 12th, a day before my 27th birthday, which has been very impactful on us as a family. My mom cannot possibly take care of all his needs on her own. There are medications, doctor visits to UCSF, blood draws, continuous phone calls, and translations that are necessary. My being around (and not coming home drained from being at a job that didn't feed my passions, just to make money) has created a better, more balanced quality of life for all of us. I currently make an income as a Lyft driver. Although it is flexible, which is exactly what I need, the cost of gas, mileage and strangers in my car have started to take a toll. In order to become financially self-sufficient based on my passion for storytelling, I need to continually create, build, craft and tell stories to build buzz around my name, AND therefore attract clientele to Haystack Mujer.Haystack Mujer is in the initial stages, and I need capital in order to FOCUS on getting my business off the ground, rather than spend time doing things I don't want to do to make money (like Lyft). My monthly expenses ($1,200) currently include:a) Facial--This seems like a luxury but I have acne-prone skin and if I don't get a monthly facial, my face breaks out terribly. I have continuously dealt with acne since age 14, and when severe breakouts happen it adversely affects my self-esteem. My face is part of my overall presentation as a business owner, as I am the person in charge of communicating with clients, and publicly speaking about my business for its continued growth. Folks who have never dealt with acne may not understand but acne is painful and causes scarring, and if I can avoid it with regular facials to promote the health of my largest organ, then I'll do so! Regular, monthly facials help keep the acne at bay! PLUS, Sydney, the gal I go to for facials, and I talk about business when I go. We talk about communication, expansion, budgeting, marketing, business tools, etx to help each other grow as business owners.b) Car---I use my car to make an income via Lyft. Additionally, I use my car to go to networking events, performances, and meetings for The Hayward Collective. I anticipate needing my car to drive to interviews with artists for my upcoming podcast, ""Haystack Mujer"", which will be the visual, storytelling aspect of my overall business. I also anticipate needing my car to meet with clientele once that support-base is established.c) Car Insurance--Gots to have this in the state of California to drived) Student Loans--I'm paying back that degree in Sociology, with a Concentration in Community Change that I earned at San José State. Although I am in debt, I am happy that I had the privilege of attaining that piece of paper. My education has profoundly altered my way of thinking and seeing the world.e) Phone--Although I wish I could go back to the time when folks wrote letters, the phone is a very inescapable part of the 21st Century. I could get a flip phone but then I'd be disconnected to the tools and phone applications that keep my business running, such as Gmail, Squarespace (website), Instagram, Facebook, Patreon, Youtube and Venmo.f) Training--My training includes capoeira and personal fitness. 1) As mentioned, capoeira is integral to my movement and the reason I have unlocked my own, unique footwork when it comes to dancing. 2) My niece, Valeria, has started her own personal training business (Fitness By Val) after finding success in fitness, and weightlifting. She trains me remotely by sending me workout plans, and regularly communicating with me about how I'm moving along in my program, which holds me accountable to my fitness goals. Fitness (and nutrition) are crucial to a person like myself who wants to be the best of the best in storytelling. There is a lot of work that comes when momentum gains, and I need to be able to have a constant in my life that keeps me grounded. Dwayne ""The Rock"" Johnson was born in Hayward, and regularly emphasizes that working out is a necessary part of his daily success.4) $680 for miscellaneous expensesI can update my business cards, move forward with the t-shirt ideas I have in mind, have a meeting with a tax consultant, pay for my business license at Hayward City Hall etx There are a myriad of ways I can use $680 to invest in Haystack Mujer. More than likely, I will end up purchasing another BM-800 microphone, mic adaptor and 2 mic stands to bring professionalism and style to my upcoming podcast, Haystack Mujer.****$1,760+$860+$1,200+$680= $4,500Kickstarter has their own fees to consider:1) ""Kickstarter fee is 5% of total funds raised""2) ""Payment processing fees3% + $0.20 per pledge.Pledges under $10 have a discounted micropledge fee of 5% + $0.05 per pledge""***If I raise at least $5,000, that would be $250 for the Kickstarter fee alone. With the payment processing fees, I took a guesstimate because I don't know how many pledges or what amounts they will be, so I am budgeting $250. This totals $500 alone for Kickstarter fees.That is the breakdown of why I am raising $5,000!! If you have any questions, you can email me at rosaxsalvaje@gmail.com, haystackmujer@gmail.com or call me at 510-363-5958.FIN:A Haystack mujer is born and/or raised in Hayward, or otherwise claims Hayward as home.  The term ""mujer"" is inclusive of our transsexual sisters; ""Haystack mujer"" is a state of mind, untethered to conventional gender identity.A Haystack mujer fights for herself, family and community.A Haystack mujer never permits Verbal, Emotional, Psychological, Physical and Sexual violence.   A Haystack mujer is guided by her principles of Trust, Peace, Strength, Truth, Love, Dignity & Respect. A Haystack mujer has a firm grasp on Words.Movement.&Voice to achieve her visions for the future.","I anticipate that upon reaching my goal of $5,000 dollars, the rewards, which are primarily made up of 1-hour storytelling sessions, will take up a majority of my time.  I would ask that folks be patient when I move about with scheduling sessions.  I am very organized, so I know that I will be able to maneuver creating a workable timetable.  Next, it takes time and patience for a business to take off and become a well-oiled machine, so I ask that folks give me feedback as I move about with fine-tuning my unique way of coaching people through storytelling.  I know the benefits that a storytelling session can bring, and I hope to inspire trust and understanding so that you can see for yourself that owning your story can change your life!Finally, because the concept of ""storytelling"" may be new or uncharted terrain for many folks, maybe people will not be down to do a session because they don't see how how it will immediately benefit their life.  I'll tell you right now: storytelling is powerful!  I am a great listener, easy to talk to, and genuinely nice, and that is the trifecta necessary to create trust and build rapport with humans!

Second video will be created incorporating more story than the first.","The biggest challenge to this task is achieving the desired result, the quality maybe too poor, or the story may not be evident from the images.I believe these will not be an issue as the designer is as excited about this project as I am and I feel the mix of voiceover, music and expected images will easily allow the viewer to discern the story.",https://www.kickstarter.com/projects/martinwallace/a-very-izzy-christmas-video?ref=discovery_category_newest,martinwallace/a-very-izzy-christmas-video,"Hi friends,Welcome to the colourful world of Izzy.

Izzy sets off on an adventure which will introduce her to some new and interesting characters. Izzy and Mike will travel far to help these new friends achieve their goals in time for Christmas morning to come.The video will be around 10 to 15 minutes long and the story will be narrated over the top of the animation. Alongside the video we will create a picture book which will follow the story and give a nice accompaniment that can be read to kids at night.Our goal is to turn Izzy into a well established British children’s character, with a range of picture books, Special video’s, cartoon series and interactive website. Everyone who has encountered Izzy so far has enjoyed what she has to offer, so we want to grow that reach and offer new and exciting projects.We would love for you to get involved, not just with donating to the cause but also in checking out our material, joining and growing our social media and sharing the content all over.Thank you so much for your time and I hope you like Izzy.",The biggest challenge that we will face on this project will be in the selection of the correct partner to carry out the animation. I am working hard to look at a wide variety of professionals who can provide the correct look for the budget. The look of this video is very important as this will carry the project forward  to it's future goals.

With your help, and of Kickstarter, we plan on having the full album recorded and release ready by the end of 2013, and to be released at the end of January 2014.What will your money help us do?With your help, we will be able to pay for the time in a professional studio to get vocals, instruments, and the final album mixed and mastered. We will be using the money you send us to help pay for cd manufacturing, paying for an artist to make a full size album cover print, (which we will be giving signed copys to, to specific backers!), as well as travel costs required for the production of the album. POSSIBLY if funds are available, or if we go over our expected goal, there might even be a music video included as a special thank you ;)This project is something we both look forward to completing and sharing with the world, it will take a lot of hard work and diligence, but seeing how so many people are supportive of our music, we know this is possible to get done and sound amazing.

https://www.kickstarter.com/projects/950095344/whistle-to-call-your-dog-not-me?ref=discovery_category_newest,950095344/whistle-to-call-your-dog-not-me,"This project is designed to help people fight against harassment in public without having to say a word by wearing easily visible affirmations against common unwanted behaviour from strangers.  While most of these buttons have phrases that can apply to street harassment, the primary driving force behind their creation is the harassment workers in retail, food service and customer service industries get from their customers. Get them for yourself, for your friends and family, or to give out to workers you see having a bad day!What I hope will come of this is:1. People who are in a position where either they can't say anything (like working in retail) or are too shy to can still make a statement. Being able to do so in some form does wonders for one's mental state and makes one feel more empowered.2. Buttons tend to get read. If people read a button being worn by somebody, it invites conversation that allows the person wearing the button to stand up for themselves and speak out against harassment in a constructive manner.3. In turn, the person who asked about the button might realize that some of their own behaviour can be considered unwanted and they might start watching how they act toward others. Or, if they are sympathetic to victims of street harassment, they might realize that it's ok to call out the behaviour when they see it happening.The goal amount will allow me to print a small run of each of the six buttons designs I’ve made, purchase mailing supplies and mail the buttons to backers. It will also cover Kickstarter/Amazon fees and income taxes. The more funds this campaign raises, the more buttons I can print and the larger the reach of this project will be. Each button design was sketched and inked by hand, then finished up digitally. The buttons will be 1.5"" across. Big enough that the text can be read, not so big that it will be considered too much of an eyesore to be worn on work uniforms if your workplace allows personal touches. The printer I'm using to produce the buttons is entirely USA-based. No sweatshop labour!The six designs are:- Does This Look Like a Hoochie Mama Bar?- My Name is NOT Baby- Lack of Laughter Means YOU Are Not Funny- I'm Here to Work, Not to Entertain You- What I Wear Gives NOBODY The Right to Touch Me- Whistle To Call Your Dog, Not MeThis project started as an idea born of frustration.  I have worked in the service industry for years, in a variety of places.  There are usually policies in place against the kind of harassing behavior service industry workers deal with on a daily basis but they are largely ignored when it comes to customers.  Instead, the expectation is that employees should put up with any rude or harassing behavior from customers in the name of “good customer service” and the bottom line.  Stand up for yourself and you risk being written up or losing your job. A store check-out is not a singles bar. Wearing a wedding ring doesn’t mean the employee is simply “more of a challenge”. Employees are there to work and not to entertain customers or to validate the customers' sense of self-worth. Stores do not need to hire “eye candy” to make the customers’ shopping experience more pleasurable.  Retail and food service industry workers are just as human as customers are and deserve respect.  Nobody should have to put up with being degraded by their customers just to try to earn a living. These buttons are meant to give people a chance to speak out without having to actually speak.  None are offensive – just statements of fact and affirmations of what is already in most corporate harassment policies.  All of them are based on personal experience and the experiences of my coworkers, both male and female. If you're interested in more than two button sets, additional sets will be available for $8 each within the US, or $10 each outside the US - just back the appropriate amount and when I send out the survey make a note about how many extra sets you want over your selected reward level. ","There should be few, if any, hurdles in this.  I did a small test run of buttons of an unrelated design to test out the US-based printer I scouted for this project and I am very happy with the results (those buttons can be seen and bought here: http://dragonfyredawn.storenvy.com/products/3658669-flock-ewe-pinback-buttons ).  The printer is fast and provides an excellent quality end product.The biggest challenge will be if this project become popular and I find myself shipping out a lot more buttons than I originally anticipated.  Everybody will be kept updated about progress on shipping, which will probably be sent out in manageable batches, starting with complete button sets and moving on from there.",https://www.kickstarter.com/projects/950095344/resin-and-latex-casting-studio-expansion?ref=discovery_category_newest,950095344/resin-and-latex-casting-studio-expansion,"Hello, and thank you for checking my project out!My name is Laura and I'm an artist and costumer. A large portion of my professional costuming work has been in the realm of mascot style costumes, but it has always been my intent to branch into casting masks and prop pieces, as well as expanding into latex prosthetics and creature effects. In order for me to be able to offer new cast costuming products in time for the 2015 Halloween season, I will need to raise the capital in order to furnish the necessary supplies and equipment to go no-holds-barred with new projects and product lines. Future offerings will include resin mask bases for animal costumes, masquerade style masks and hooves and horns for creature costumes. I will be focusing on resin castings first, then expanding into latex from there. The primary supplies I need in order to set up my studio for resin casting are: a new sculpting armature, clay for sculpting, ultracal and silicone to make molds, polyurethane and polyurethane filler for slush casting. The same supplies will allow me to cast in latex for other applications. Then there are the various sundries for my studio space. Beyond the actual costs of supplies, a portion of the funds raised also goes to production for printed rewards, Kickstarter fees and shipping costs.Anything beyond the basic funding amount will allow me to do two things. First, it will allow me to set aside dedicated work time that will allow me to develop new product lines sooner rather than later, which means more will be available for sale for the 2015 Halloween season. Second, it will allow me to purchase additional sculpting tools and supplies that will allow me to make more intricate and visually interesting pieces.Everything I have offered for rewards is hand made by myself, other than the postcards. Fake fur items are made with patterns of my own design. The feline skull mask is my first venture into slush casting resin, with the mold made from an original sculpture.Some of the smaller items are things I have on hand and ready to go. These are limited and once they're gone, they're gone. Some are ""grab bag"" items where you will receive a random colour. The remainder of the fake fur items are things I will make upon the successful completion of this campaign, using supplies I have on hand. As such, the browns used on tails will be one of several shades ranging from camel to a medium brown.Shipping within the US will be by USPS, either First Class or Priority, depending on which is most cost efficient. For backers within the US who back at the $160 or $500 level, this will also include insurance to protect your reward. I will ship internationally for an additional cost, but for international backers I will ship USPS First Class for everything as Priority is very expensive for overseas shipments. Please keep in mind that international shipments will not allow for tracking and insurance will not be available. Also, please be aware that international shipping can take 2-6 weeks.Thank you Postcard ($5): At this level, you will receive a hand-written thank you note on a post card featuring some of my costuming work as captured by Dim Horizon Studio at a recent post-apocalyptic themed photo shoot. This collaborative project was an effort by Dim Horizon Studio (http://dimhorizonstudio.com/) and Sick Sense Productions (https://www.facebook.com/sicksenseproductions), with the location provided by Black Creek Productions (https://www.facebook.com/blackcreekproductionsal). Tiger Tail ($15): A fake fur tail measuring approximately 16"" long, with a binder clip attachment.Elephant/Donkey Tail ($15): A fleece and yard tail measuring about 24"" long to the end of the fringe, with a binder clip attachment.Baby Bunny Tail ($15):  Grab bag item, either in a natural colour range or neon colour range, depending on which you choose as your backing level.  Baby bunny tails come with a binder clip for attachment and measure about 4"" tall.  Those in a natural colour range will be white on the underside with a contrasting natural colour on top.  Neon will be white underside with bright red, purple, neon green or hot pink on top.Crochet Cat Ears ($20): Grab bag item. Small, cute crocheted cat ears in grey mounted on a small plastic headband. Sized for smaller heads.Leopard Ears ($20): Grab bag item. Fake fur leopard ears mounted on a leopard print headband.Bunny Tail ($23): Simple fake fur rabbit tail with your choice of binder clip attachment or belt loop attachment. It measures about 7"" tall.  Choose one colour for the top, one for the bottom.  Colour choices are black, white, grey, brown (shade will vary.  Most of what I have on hand is camel to medium brown), bright red and lime green. Tiger Tail and Ears Set ($25): Fake fur tiger tail as above. Fake fur tiger ears on a tiger print headband to match.Pet Costume ($35): This lion's mane costume for pets will fit cats and small dogs with a neck of approximately 11-12"". Velcro closure. Choose from black, white, grey, chocolate brown, lime green or bright red for the mane. The ears will be a lighter shade of brown. Skull is for display purposes only and not included with the lion's mane costume.Canine Tail ($40): A straight-hanging canine tail with a built-in split belt loop, in choice of black, white, grey, brown (shade will vary. Most of what I have on hand is camel to medium brown), lime green or bright red. Measures approximately 18"" long.Fox Tail ($45): A straight-hanging canine tail with a built-in split belt loop, in choice of black, white, grey, brown (shade will vary.  Most of what I have on hand is camel to medium brown), lime green or bright red with a contrasting tip (same choice of colours).  Measures approximately 18"" long.Premium Canine Tail ($45): A straight-hanging canine tail with a built-in split belt loop, made with a premium, more naturalistic brown fur with honey tones.  Measures approximately 18"" long.Cat Skull Mask ($160): Impact resistant slush cast polyurethane mask, hand-painted in a weathered bone finish. Will come with padding (you may have to add more to make it comfortable for you) and ties. This was designed to fit heads approximately 22"" at the brow, but I can heat-set them to fit a larger head size more comfortably. Sculpt Sponsor ($500): Interested in seeing the process that goes into making a slush cast resin mask, from start to finish? This level sponsors the creation of a new product and the backer will get behind the scenes photos as I work on it and will have the chance to comment on the development process and ask questions via email. The backer has the option to choose one of several projects I have plans for and I will bump that one up to first in line to work on. Among those plans are resin mask bases for animal costumes as well as other masks in a similar vein as the cat skull mask. If they choose a mask base, they will receive two cleaned up and cut (but not hinged) blanks from the mold. If they choose a sculpted mask, they will get the first finished, painted mask from the mold, with their choice of colour scheme. ","The only real potential delay is if this project becomes wildly popular and the number of rewards I need to produce is beyond what I expected.  In order to head off that risk, I am only offering a limited number of the higher end rewards for the Kickstarter and those high-end items will not be available for general sale until the Kickstarter rewards are all sent out.  The remainder of the rewards offered are all things that I either have on hand that are ready to ship or are within my means to produce with materials I have in stock."

Students study the makeup of different materials and determine how that affects the material properties.Students use aluminum wire to create hair clips or electronic cord holders, learn about and build truss or kingpost bridges, scamper to recreate old ideas, and test the properties of materials to create new ones.The Materials Engineering Unit Covers:Forces and VectorsTension and CompressionStress vs. StrainCategories of MaterialsMaterial Property TestsHardness, Tensile Strength, Conductivity,Density, Optical Properties Force Distribution Bridge DesignElectrical EngineeringElectrical Engineering is so necessary to engage our students in our increasingly technological society. Students will learn about electric force and all types of energy conversions. The unit then begins with circuit basics, series and parallel, and basic components. Then students will learn Ohm's law, calculate voltage, resistance, and current, and complete more advanced circuits. Finally, students will learn advanced electrical systems, including touch screens, sensors, and indicators.The Electrical Engineering Unit Covers:Energy and Electric ForceEnergy ConversionSchematic DiagrammingCircuit BasicsElectrical SafetyElectrical ComponentsOhm's LawVoltage, Current, and ResistanceAdvanced CircuitryElectrical SystemsComputer and Systems EngineeringComputer Engineering is the next frontier. It is incumbent upon all 21st century educators to give their students a chance to understand and be part of our technological revolution. Computer systems are broken down and explained simply to students, who can then process how a computer is able to communicate with humans. Students learn how to create a computer program, as well as the ability to troubleshoot code. Students also learn many of the processing and iteration skills used in computer programming in a revolutionary new format called ""Stix"", which requires no computer!

Iceland, The Himalaya, Patagonia, Norway: their names can start a photographer drooling. Yet one place has flown below the Photographers radar..South Korea.I'm a nature photographer who is traveling to Korea for 10 days in April 2017 and the goal of my project is simple: to create compelling photos of one of the most beautiful and undiscovered countries on the planet and to turn those photos into a series of limited-edition fine art prints for exhibition.Who am I?My name is Charlie Nowlan and I'm just a normal, fun-loving guy with a passion for photography and travel. I currently work in London as a property photographer.Why should you back this project?Because you have the power to take something good and make it amazing. The project is already underway, I have my flights lined-upand my batteries charged. I'm jazzed up and ready to shoot. And the last thing I want is to come home from Korea with disappointing images. Which is why I need your help. I plan to travel all over South Korea hire outfitters and guides to take me to remote locations in order to get the best photos possible. I'm gathering support to help me cover the costs involved in taking advantage of these special opportunities. Every little bit of support means one more chance to create an awesome photo.And you backers get something awesome and beautiful in return for your support. For your pledge you will receive limited edition fine art prints and canvases of your favorite photos from this Korean Adventure. There's no tellingwhat kinds of photos I'm going to take on this trip, but I do know that if they even come close to capturing the hidden gems that South Korea has to offer, they'll be great. And of course the better my photos are, the better your rewards will be!So if you're in a position to back a fun, exciting, and adventurous art project, I'd be forever grateful if it's this one.

To accomplish this Shorty will combine compression and virtual private network software. Here is an example of how this program will operate: You log on to youtube - The log on request will be compressed and routed to our server - The log on request will get uncompressed and the server will log onto youtube - when you select a video to be played the server will then compress the video stream and send it to your computer to be uncompressed and played - All this will be seamless with the compression/uncompression software running in the background.If the youtube video is 1gb and gets compressed by 20% you then increase your data limit by 20% and speed up downloading the video due to the smaller video size. If your data limit is 10gb your limit is raised to 12gb and if you have 500gb limit your data limit increases to 600gb.Our company has developed a new experimental data compression software that shows very promising results when tested on text based documents and small graphics files. Currently it is DOS command line based and a easier to operate version with a Graphic User Interface is being researched and developed.  The compression software is based on a very old idea of signal flags. Flags would be run up and with a few flags detailed instruction were given to fellow ships. The receiving ship would see the flags and in which order they were aligned and using a book for reference know what message was being conveyed. To use a more modern example I will use the phone book and phone numbers. Say my phone number is 515-555-9176. To reduce this number a program would note that the number five is repeated and remove some of the fives. In this way the phone number is “compressed”. I never liked the thought of removing information and I have been searching for a solution to this problem. My solution is a completely new way to apply the very old idea of signal flags. Everyone has a phone book. Now assume everyone has the same exact copy of the phone book. When asked for my phone number I reply with “6 and 12”. This means page 6 of the phone book, phone number 12 down form the top. Using this method I have successfully conveyed my phone number using only 3 numbers.Our company hopes to create a reference book that would greatly increase compression ratio, increase compression/uncompression speeds, and lower cpu usage.The funds raised will go towards research and development, legal fees, and  operating expenses. Our goal is to be up and running in two months.","With any software development, issues of software compatibility, stability, and software error can and will be encountered. Shorty hopes to offer a good reliable program, but expects to fix any errors and offer new, faster, better versions in the future.",https://www.kickstarter.com/projects/420593679/new-atlantis-stage-one-informative-website?ref=discovery_category_newest,420593679/new-atlantis-stage-one-informative-website,"Welcome future New Atlanteans please support a great endeavor.My project it create a nation using the vast empty oceans. To all the new readers welcome. To all who read and pledged before welcome back and again thank you for your pledges. Like all great projects this will be accomplished in stages.I realized in my enthusiasm to reach my goals I jumped to far ahead in my first Kickstatercampaign. There well now be four new stages to reach the dream of a new nation. Stage One - New Atlantis - Informative Website - $1,000.00 At this stage the funds raised will go towards launching a informative website to bring awareness and information to millions about New Atlantis. The information ranges form the goals of New Atlantis, to the first draft of the constitution of New Atlantis, which will be debated, updated, and voted on by all citizens of New Atlantis.Stage Two - New Atlantis - New lands - $3,000,000.00 The next campaign after the Informative Website is the second step in bringing life to a nation. The money raised will go towards purchasing the first cargo ship. The cargo ship pictured below is listed for sale at 2.5 million dollars. The cargo ship will be anchored securely to a seamount.  Seamounts are underwater mountains. They raise to just 20 to 200 feet below the water. 200 feet may sound deep but the ocean floor averages over twelve thousand feet deep. The ship that is anchored will become the ""land"" of New Atlantis.Stage Three - New Atlantis - Infrastructure - $4,000,000.00 This stage is vital to the long term success of New Atlantis. The funds raised will go towards everything needed to become self sufficient. Wind Turbines to produce clean and unlimited energy, hydroponic gardens for food production, desalination plant for unlimited water production, comfortable housing for citizens, it is a long list but vital.Stage Four - New Atlantis - Economic Development - $3,000,000.00 Economic development is as vital as Infrastructure if New Atlantis is to survive and thrive. In this stage a data center will be created. A data center is compact, does not need constant influx of goods like a manufacturing plant would need, powered by free energy produced by the wind turbines, and offers services internationally without shipping costs The data center will be comprised of IBM mainframes that have a starting cost of $75,000.00 for the most basic and bare bones systems. If we assume a budget of 2 million that works out to be close to 27 mainframes to start with and each mainframe can be upgraded as needed. The remaining one million will go towards operating expanses. But this is only the beginning. Stage Five will take the money generated by the data center for purchase of used cruise ships to expand living spaces.Stage Six will be to manufacture true homes for New Atlanteans and there descendants. This step will use two abundant materials that are resistant to salt water corrosion, long lasting, cheap, and easy to work with, ""Plastic"" and ""Aluminum"". Plastic has a estimated life of one thousand years and though it is not good to throw in a land fill, utilizing plastic will last three times longer then the United States has been in existence. When our great great very great grand sons and daughters need to replace their habitat they will surely have invented something better. Now for the government. It will be a constitutional monarchy. The House of the Nobles will have more voting power, form a knight with five votes up to the king who has 30% of all noble votes with 51% passing said vote unless citizens vote it unconstitutional. A free society of live and let live with the option that If your neighbor plays music to loud and to often you can challenge him to a dual at 20 paces at dawn. Again I ask the future New Atlanteans to please support this great endeavor.  SincerelyYour FutureKing King Joshua McDonnell","With any great goals there are a number of challenges. Form the dangers of severe storms, to pirates, to hostile governments. Every challenge is unique and can and will be meet as the situation arises."

These officers work directly within communities addressing community concerns and act as a major part of the interaction between our community youth and law enforcement. I built a council which has worked to keep our COPE officers in the Suffolk 6th District and to rebuild the trust between our law enforcement officers and our youth in what was gang and crime ridden neighborhoods by beginning a culinary program. To date, we have been certified by the FBI as a gang free community and have not had a murder in more than 12 months while our culinary program which started with 4 children and 2 police officers has now grown to us having to do the classes in shifts and an out pouring of police officers volunteering. We have been recognized by our Legislator, Supervisor, and local groups because of the success and diversity of our youth being of all races and religions and ethnic backgrounds, but need help with funding in a difficult economy to keep the program going. We need your help. Will you help us ?","Our success depends on continuing to receive assistance from everyone willing to assist us. I am in the process of securing funds to help renovate space donated by the Catholic Church to allow our youth to be able to use it more effectively. In 2014, we have had to move from location to location but by using the space recently donated we can add stability to our youth and parents. I said to more than one person,"" Since we have taken gangs away from our youth we have to replace it with positive activities to keep them engaged."" To fail would mean to go back to our youth dying and being disinfranchized."

https://www.kickstarter.com/projects/zeeky/avarage-joe-survival?ref=discovery_category_newest,zeeky/avarage-joe-survival,"Hi my name is AJ.About 3 months ago my friend and I went on a little trip. We decided to go on a manly man hike up this mountain 3 hours from our home. We only brought some granola bars, liter of water, matches, and some change of clothes. It was awesome at first, but after a small walk up the mountain my body began to have a panic attack is what it seemed like. I drank some water and rested for about 20 min and onward we went. Since I was lacking hydration I was already out of water by 60% of the 10 mile walk. Their was also rock climbing involved that we had to do without rope. I'm no expert but I would say that was dumb of us to do. However we made it through to the top. When we arrived at the top we found a beautiful location where the sun was setting and their was a view you couldn't believe. We made our tent and chilled out by a fire that I had started. A few hours go by, wood was running low and it was getting too dark to see anything. We didnt bring flashlights so we used our phone light to go search for wood, but even that was short lived because they soon ran out of battery. Around midnight we were completely out of wood and it was unsafe to wonder off in the dark looking for wood so we decided to burn everything we could to keep warm. One stupid mistake we did was not take in to account that it was going to drop below freezing this high up and not pack enough warm clothing. So, out of wood and freezing with still 7 hours till the sun comes up. I decide to throw the hot rocks under the tent around where our feet is to help us cope. About an hour goes by I go in and out of sleeping trying to get every minute I could of rest. The rocks are now colder than we are so we get rid of them. My friend isn't as mentally stable as I am so he starts to mope. Like a bitch.... I just lay their and think that everything is fine because the sun will come up and we will be out of here in 6 hours. For the rest of that night all I could hear was him crying like a dog wishing for the sun to come out. I lay there quiet, not saying a word for the rest of those 6 hours. As soon as that sun started poking through the mountains I shot out of that tent. The tent was frozen solid from our humidity in the tent. We begin to make our way back down the mountain when all I hear is a weird fart sound. I halt, look back. There he was, my friend had just SHARTED his pants. (Shit, fart) his body must of just not been thinking about holding it in or something but it was nasty. He's on the side of a cliff for the next 10 min whipping with what ever he can find and changing his briefs. After an hour or so of walking, (and a bit of jogging) we make it back to the car. We praise the car as if it had just saved us, and we begin our drive home. After all that happened all I could think of when I had returned home was. ""Damn, I wish we would have gotten all that on film.""So it brings me to today, I would like to do this again. Go somewhere we have no business being and give it another shot. Record it all and make some episodes or a short film.-AJ","Honestly if no one wants to see this than so be it, but wouldn't you rather see some Joe that has no idea what hes talking about on those ""survival"" shows rather than some know it all.

I've been an avid gamer and reader my whole life and it always seemed like the link between the two always seemed mediocre. I grew up reading mediocre magazines and always felt like the connection between the reader and the magazine wasn't there. So I am dedicated to giving the reader what they want. There will be forums for readers to discuss what they want to see in the magazine every issue. For the first couple months I will be taking ideas from the comments on this kickstarter campaign and then working from there. I decided to set up the website and get things started before this campaign even goes up. You can check it out at Gameomagazine.comThe printing press for the hard copies will cost about $10,000 but buying our own printing press will be for a later time. We will have to print through a company for now.    If you have some talent and a passion for gaming, esports, or game related reporting, donate 1 dollar and lets start the chatting. Thank you guys so much and looking forward to see where this takes us.-AJ","Something like this will always have challenges, but we think that we can overcome those challenges with the help of you guys! If we can't think of something engaging to publish we just look to you guys for inspiration! Our forums will always be available so that everyone can have a say in what they read."

https://www.kickstarter.com/projects/1322862152/sms-text-based-rpg?ref=discovery_category_newest,1322862152/sms-text-based-rpg,"Let me start on what this project is. I started this project SMS in February 2015. It was intended to be a small, lightweight mobile role playing game that focuses on real life decisions while minimizing the use of graphics. The name was a coincidence, I had already chosen the stats which are Skill, Mood & Social. I later found out that those make SMS which is an acronym for Short Message Service (text based messages).So the objective of the game is to make money while keeping your mood stat up. If your mood lowers to 0 your character can suicide. Going bankrupt will do the same thing. You can raise your mood mostly by doing Civil events and possibly Good Events. You can gain the most money by working at your job which will lower your Mood but gain your Skill and Social points. I will also be incorporating a leader-board system where people can post their cash pool and compete with others real-time.Let's talk about PANELSOK so the game consists of four panels so far (not including the main stat panel). Those are:Jobs - You get given a random job that pays the lowest possible rate a second. After completing a few shifts with this job you are able to change to a starter job which pays the next tier available.The tiers are:First Jobs - $1 [No promotions]Starter Jobs - $2/s [Promotions from Trainee to CEO]Amateur Jobs - $3/s[Promotions from Trainee to CEO]Skilled Jobs - $4/s[Promotions from Trainee to CEO]Workaholic Jobs - $5/s[Promotions from Trainee to CEO]Elitest Jobs - $32/s[No promotions]You may be thinking WOAH $32/s compared to $5/s, that's a huge jump! Don't forget that promotions multiply your pay per second.Here is a picture of what the jobs panel currently looks like:Events - The events panel is available all the time so users can just pick an event and complete it. There are three event types. Good, Bad & Neutral.Good events usually boost your mood and social and sometimes give you money IF successful.Bad events usually decrease your mood and social and give you heaps of money IF successful.Neutral events usually don't give you money but can give you a good amount of mood and social IF successful.You have a Success/Fail result from doing any of these events. Some events are always a Success (mostly neutral). The success result depends on your total skill, having a higher skill level will higher your chances in completing the event.This is what the events panel currently looks like:Civil - This panel only includes events that will take your money but increase your mood & social stats a significant amount. So stuff like ""Go to a friends birthday party"" or ""Travel to Dubai"". Not much to explain about this one, hopefully a picture will help.Me - The me panel is used to see your next bill time and cost as well as other statistics. You can also post your cash pool online here as well as view the leader-boards.This is what the Me Panel currently looks like:Let's talk about SPECIFICSGame price on release - $FREEMinimum requirements - [Android - 3.2 Honeycomb API Level 13] [iOS - iOS 8.2 compatible device; iPhone 4S+; iPod 5th Gen+; iPad 4th Gen+]Supported operating systems - iOS & Android ( Maybe more later )In app purchases - If the goal reaches $1000 I will NOT include in app purchases. It will all be fair.Online gameplay - Currently only leader-boards, if goal is reached I will do real-time verse play.Monetization strategy - If the goal is reached I will remove the use of advertisements completely. Backers currently over $5 will receive a no-ad version.Let's talk about FUNDINGWhy do I need this money and what will it go towards?Making video games isn't as cheap as you think. I'm an indie developer so luckily I don't have to pay for staff. I do however have to pay for licensing for the engine that I'm currently using and distribution costs for store publishing on iTunes & Google Play.

As well I want to get my permits and licenses I need to do this legally and safely.,https://www.kickstarter.com/projects/1474542303/spray-paint-art?ref=discovery_category_newest,1474542303/spray-paint-art,"Spray painting on canvas has always been a hobby of mine. I never thought anything of it till people wanted me to paint them stuff. Now I have many people who want my art but no funds to get supplies that I need. I make no profit at this point and a kick start would be great to get things moving! I spray paint all kinds of things from Star Wars, guitars, space, guitars, etc. I also draw pretty well and mix the two together in abtract pieces. Art is a passion and to share my passion with the world would be incredible and hopefully inspiration to those who have a flame they want to turn into a fire. The money will go to supplies and a traveling art table so I can perform live art. ","the challenge is marketing myself. People don't really ""need"" art. So proving myself a worthy buy is a challenge but once they see it and hear the story behind it they are sold. Doing art shows helps a lot as well."
