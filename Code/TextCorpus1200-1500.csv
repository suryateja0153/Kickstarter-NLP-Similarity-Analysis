Our first attempt was not successful due to unfortunate timing within our community. This summer our community was the victim of what has turned out to be one of the most devastating events in recent history. A wildfire destroyed the surrounding area and 48 structures at the Royal Gorge Bridge. Fortunately the bridge survived and the area surrounding it is currently being rebuilt. The fire was going at the same time as our kickstarter project and as as expected the community was focused on our famous landmark and the uncertainty of the wildfire as it moved closer to our city. We appreciate a second look at our project and have reduced our goal because of continued local fundraising. This is still an urgent matter to us as our timeline to go digital is approaching quickly. In June the local 4 screen cinema closed it's doors leaving us the only screen in town thus making it that much more urgent.Ninety five years ago the curtain rose for the first time at the Jones Theater in downtown Canon City, crowds were ecstatic to have a modern day playhouse in their quaint little town.

Los artistas mayas y zoques que colaboramos en la Galería MUY nos comprometemos a acompañar a la población afectada, través de talleres de creatividad. Utilizamos el arte y el diseño como instrumentos en la liberación emocional y superación del trauma provocado por el sismo. Diversas comunidades del municipio de Jiquipilas nos han invitado a acompañarlos en sus procesos de reconstrucción. Trabajaremos con familias, al integrar a los jóvenes y adultos a talleres de gráfica. La intención de estos talleres es compartir las emociones que afectan los ánimos de la gente reforzando su capacidad de soñar su propio futuro, y establecer lazos entre equipos de reconstrucción y las familias y comunidades afectadas. La galería MUY organiza el proyecto y trabaja en coordinación y alianza con los esfuerzos de la sociedad civil de reconstrucción de Chiapas. Buscamos apoyo solidario para financiar viajes con estancias de varios días, en las comunidades de Jiquipilas y materiales para talleres gráficos de recuperación histórica y expresión emocional en estas localidades.Los artistas videastas involucrados, colaboraran en la realización de un video de aproximadamente 20 minutos, inspirado en este proyecto. InglesNatural disasters - a 8.2-magnitude earthquake and heavy rains - have also been a social and personal disaster that have left Chiapas communities in need of rebuilding / repairing their homes as well as their own futures.Mayan and Zoque artists, in collaboration with the Galeria MUY, will accompany the families and communities affected by the natural disasters, offering “emergency art” workshops. These use the visual arts and design as means to liberate traumatic emotions. In the same workshop participants will reconsider house design and the possible creation of a mural or altar, with the help of the artists.Communities of Jiquipilas have invited us to accompany them in their reconstruction activities. We will work with children, youth and adults in graphics workshops. These will be linked to brigades of volunteers and professionals working with families in “self-construction,” by preference using local materials.We seek your support to finance travel and living costs as well as the materials needed to carry out at least six “emergency art” workshops. The artwork will serve for the historic record; and the artists will collaborate in the making of a 20-minute video inspired by this project.",Solo podremos realizar tantos talleres como podamos recaudar fondos$4000 por taller.,https://www.kickstarter.com/projects/galeriamuy/creadores-mayas-y-zoques-frente-a-la-pandemia?ref=discovery_category_newest,galeriamuy/creadores-mayas-y-zoques-frente-a-la-pandemia,"This project supports the work of 18 Mayan and Zoque artists committed to sharing their work, and creating new work (murals, workshops, etc.) in Indigenous pueblos and communities of Chiapas, Mexico. The Coronavirus pandemic is hard on all, and local art -- by young and mid-career professionals -- will help lift a burden of concern and open avenues for self-expression.Queremos animar, con el arte, a nuestros pueblos mayas y zoques del estado de Chiapas. Somos un grupo de 18 artistas provenientes de siete comunidades indígenas de Chiapas, de las hablas tsotsil, tseltal, ch’ol y zoque. Más que nunca tenemos la vocación de compartir nuestras obras y realizar talleres artísticos para reforzar la unidad y autonomía comunitaria en estos tiempos de virus e incertidumbre.De que se trata el proyectoSince the pandemic sowed concern among the artists (coming from Mayan and Zoque homelands), some artists went back to live at home and all experienced the situation of the communities directly or via constant contact. It became evident that reactions oscillated wildly, fear, anger, denial, above all new-found strength in Indigenous energies: knowing how to live with respect for nature and with resignation and hope.Desde el inicio del confinamiento por la pandemia, como artistas mayas/zoque preocupados por nuestras comunidades, seguimos los hechos que sucedían entorno a la pandemia mediante los medios digitales y, claro, viviendo la realidad interna de los pueblos indígenas. Hubo y hay mucha consternación, también mucha sospecha, ¡y también un poder espiritual basado en la resiliencia muy particular maya y zoque! ¿Cómo reflejar esto e inspirar a reflexionar más sobre nuestra condición de pueblos indígenas, el lugar que damos a nuestros sistemas curativos, los efectos fuertes que la pandemia está teniendo en la economía y en la vida de la gente?Decidimos crear una serie de obras artísticas que hablan justamente de la realidad de los pueblos mayas y zoques ante el Covid-19. Ya lo ""montamos"" en virtual (ver: www.galeriamuy.org/interpretaciones.) Ahora, es nuestro deseo y compromiso aportar como artistas, al llevar proyectos culturales y creativos directamente a nuestras comunidades.Artists decided to create a series of works speaking to and talking about Indigenous communities and the Covid pandemic, including what it meant affectively, economically, socially (including no classes for children). The exhibit of these works is up, virtually; see www.galeriamuy.org/album/interpretaciones. Now for the second phase of work -- in communities -- we reach out.Sin embargo para proseguir a esta segunda etapa del proyecto artístico necesitamos de su complicidad en sus donaciones.Nuestra meta es exhibir nuestras obras en espacios públicos, hacer murales, hacer performances y realizar talleres para niñas/os y jóvenes. Vamos a entablar diálogos de profunda reflexión con los pueblos de Chamula, San Andrés Larráinzar, Rayón, y Tenejapa, Chiapas, México. Y llegaremos a más gente de cultura maya/zoque usando medios digitales a través de una plataforma digital desarrollada en parte en la Galería.We will share our work in public spaces, making murals, performances, and workshops for children and youth. We'll promote collective reflection in townships such as Chamula, San Andrés Larráinzar, Rayón and Tenejapa, Chiapas. We'll reach still more folks through experiments with digital platforms for making Indigenous art.Your donations will go to purchase of materials, costs of travel and a fund for incentives paying for days spent in this work.Sus donativos se usarán para materiales y traslados, y un fondo de estímulo para artistas (calculado sobre salario mínimo). La Galería MUY aporta infraestructura, gastos de administración y difusión.Nuestra manera de re-contribuir en agradecimiento a nuestros patrocinadores será mediante regalos acorde a donativos, además de ofrecer, con mucho afecto, recorridos de la exposición y diálogos con lxs artistas, en fechas a proponer a las y los contribuyentes. Siguen una imágenes de las obras de obsequio.By way of giving-back to our backers, we offer, with our sincere gratitude, gifts (mentioned below), shows of the work of the Mayan and Zoque artists including dialogue with creators to be scheduled.In sum, there will be 4 exhibitions in communities, with performances, 2 murals, 8 workshops, and digital art up in social media in Mayan and Zoque languages.Our motto is ""tsobolotik xkuch ku'untik"" (with collaboration we'll make it).En resumen:Nuestro lema: “Tsobolotik xkuch ku'untik"" (con lo que queremos decir ""La colaboración es más fuerte que la acción individual para combatir una crisis."")","La experimentación del uso de medios digitales presentan ciertos desafíos en este proyecto, ya que la proyección y recepción depende del internet de Chiapas. Cuando las comunidades muy alejadas no cuentan con tales servicios, nos apoyaremos de los recursos tecnológicos locales (megáfonos, radio-comunicación). Otra consideración es con respecto a entrar en comunidades que puede ser delicado por razones sanitarias o hasta de conflicto social, pero, con la reserva de ser siempre atentos, nuestro análisis claramente indica haber condiciones muy adecuados para realizar este proyecto solidario con nuestros pueblos en su momento de recuperación.We need to be vigilant going into communities in times of an easily spread viral epidemic, and, also, social unrest. Communication with digital means limits those not counting with the equipment; we'll augment the communication with announcements by bullhorn and by radio."

Opening on April 5th 1947, The Uptown was Port Townsend's Grand, New, BIG SCREEN venue. Throughout the 50's 60's 70's, 80's and 90's and into the 21st Century The Uptown has provided a Big Screen CinemaScope Motion Picture Experience not found anywhere else on the Olympic Peninsula. This Unique Large Single Auditorium Theatre not only provides an extra special movie going experience... It is living history. Home to decades of Port Townsend special events, benefits and fund raisers, The Uptown is owned and operated by the 3rd Generation of the founding family, The Uptown Theatre is about to embark on a major investment into an even Grander future. Our Project...... only begins with our conversion to Digital Cinema. We are Following up with a full interior renovation (to begin at the end of October) so that upon our Grand re-opening in late November, we will delight our audiences with an Astonishing new environment, atmosphere, and Motion Picture Presentation. The Digital Cinema Conversion specifically involves disassembling the existing 35mm projection and sound equipment and installing the new DCI Compliant Digital Projector and all of the supporting components, i.e. Digital Server, Digital Sound Processor etc. etc.This new Technology will allow the Uptown to not only present an Improved and enhanced movie going experience, it will also open the door to a much broader access to alternative programming, Classic Archive Films and special events will become a regular feature at the New Uptown.Though the Uptown Theatre is a healthy viable entity, (66 years) this major transition from a 100 plus year old medium format is so costly that we decided it would be prudent to be creative with at least a portion of the expense. Enter KickStarter,... With your generous support and involvement, together we can insure the future of one of the oldest and most storied Movie Theatres in the State of Washington and a continued perfect fit in the Beautiful, Historic and Art Loving City of Port Townsend, Wa.* Just a reminder, If we should be so fortunate to fully fund this project, any and all donations that go beyond the minimum will be used to continue our on going renovation of the Uptown i.e. Building Exterior etc. Thank You So Much for considering our project.Sincerely,Richard WileyWiley TheatresUptown Theatre / Wheel-In Motor Movie",Challenges and contingencies re: our project have been looked at from every angle for several years now.

I sure do. The WHEEL-IN MOTOR MOVIE, just outside of Port Townsend, Wa, has seen generations of families enjoy the unique magical experience of Big Screen Hollywood Movies Under The Stars.There is no way to describe the feeling that The Drive-In Theatre provides, and specifically, The WHEEL-IN MOTOR MOVIE.Rated #1 in the Entire Western U.S. by Sunset Magazine, The Wheel-In is a very special place. We have come to the end of 60 years of 35mm film at the Wheel-In.To open again this Spring we must make the extremely costly conversion to Digital Cinema.We have made this conversion very successfully at The Wheel-In's big Sister, The UPTOWN THEATRE, in Port Townsend, and we have a very clear cut and researched plan ready to go. Equipment and Installation will run $65,000, We intend to once again handle as much of the cost as is possible,In addition to traditional funding sources, we have decided to include a crowd funding campaign for the following reasons; #1 - To help everyone understand what we are up to and what the survival of The Wheel-In is dependent on.#2 - The Cost of the Digital Conversion is outside of the typical independent Theatre's business model budget. The Wheel-In, otherwise healthy, falls into this category.and #3 - We believe it also gives us a chance as a community to be a part of not only the survival of an historic and Iconic institution, but to launch it into an even bigger and better future. We most DEFINITELY have a vision for The Wheel-In that is bigger and better than ever, Digital Cinema will facilitate not only an even better Movie experience but also more flexibility and access to a broader range of Programming.Our success with this Fund Raising Campaign is Critical to the survival of The WHEEL-IN. We hope you will come aboard and be a part of the Wheel-In's future!Thank You So Much for considering our project! ","As we have made this conversion previously, we are aware of all the Details involved and have accounted for all contingencies. Once funded we anticipate a smooth and timely install."
https://www.kickstarter.com/projects/hiddenheritage/limmud-poland-2015?ref=discovery_category_newest,hiddenheritage/limmud-poland-2015,"Limmud is a celebration of Jewish learning and culture like no other.Limmud started over 30 years ago as a learning retreat for a group of friends.Over time, Limmud has developed into a community committed to a unique combination of principles and values including learning, teaching, volunteerism, diversity and respect.It is a movement; a community and an unbelievable event.Regular events are held in the UK and around the world.Key to the Limmud experience is the idea that everyone should be a student and anyone can be a teacher.  The success of Limmud has inspired communities around the world to develop local ‘Limmuds’ – from Australia to Ukraine, Canada to Argentina, South Africa to Poland.Why Limmud Poland?For seven years running, Limmud Poland has organized the largest gathering of Polish Jews within the territory of Poland since 1968, and it has been growing each year. Over 1000 participants took part in the last 2014 edition of Limmud Poland.What makes Limmud Poland significant is more than numbers. It is the fact that this volunteer-led event is able to bring together Jews of all ages (from 6 months to 90 years), from all denominations and traditions—Orthodox to Progressive—speaking a variety of languages (Polish, Hebrew, Yiddish, and English) for a weekend of fun and learning. Most importantly, this is also the only opportunity for Jews from smaller communities to participate in Jewish activities and programs. Many families and individuals travel hundreds of kilometers to be part of this special community. For many, Limmud Poland becomes the annual holiday where they celebrate their Judaism. The event involves over 100 lectures and workshops led by world-famous scholars, artists, rabbis, and ordinary community members. There is literally something for everybody—ranging from arts and crafts workshops for children, cooking classes, to speculative discussion of Jewish philosophy and the Hebrew Bible. At Limmud Poland everyone brings his or her areas of expertise to share. Beyond learning, Limmud Poland is also a unique place for community members to socialize and really get to know one another. To eat and pray at the same table, sharing in ways that ordinary life would never allow. Perhaps this is the real key to Limmud’s success; it is about breaking barriers—something that is particularly hard to do given the history of Polish Jewry, where barriers often formed important protections. Letting others know too much about you or your family history has proven deadly in Polish-Jewish history, but in today’s Poland such barriers only serve to keep our community fragmented, which is why Limmud is working to pull such walls down! Limmud Poland, then, is an ideal vision of what we as a Jewish community would like to be—united, sharing in the joys of practicing and learning about our tradition, and planning for a better future.An important message from Jonathan Ornstein, Executive Director of the Krakow Jewish Community Center (JCC)Jewish Life in Poland - Towards a Sense of Joy and Wonder (excerpts)Limmud is the Hebrew word for 'learning'. And learning, we might say, has been perhaps one of the essential components of the contemporary Polish Jewish experience. In defiance of the persisting conviction of many foreign Jews that Jewish life in Poland ended with the Holocaust or with the communist antisemitic purge of 1968, Jews in today's Poland come together and share their knowledge and experience during this unique event.Poland has become a true hotbed of contemporary Jewish identity debate — Polish-Jewish issues are discussed in Europe, but perhaps even more so in America and in Israel, where we so many descendants of Polish Jews can be found.The Jewish identity experience in Poland is unfinished and fluctuating in its nature. Jewishness in Poland aims not at an appropriation of its essence; rather, it thrives on not knowing its “essence.” It is an identity that hosts questions and contradictions. And its authenticity is that of a conversation rather than a text. And in this sense, Limmud is the perfect form of expression for Polish Jewish identities. The very nonessential “essence” of post-transition Polish Jewish identity is in being-in-discussion – in a changing configuration of specific situations we find ourselves in and distinct others we interact with. To be a Jew in Poland today is to participate in a dialogue.Why this campaign and how your contribution will help?This year we have received $50,000 in grants for the 2015 edition of Limmud Poland, which represents just 50% of what has been received in past years.  In order to meet our budgetary goals, we need to match it with at least $35,000, which we hope to raise with your generous help. Our deadline to raise these funds is October 3, 2015, and when we succeed we will celebrate the 8th Limmud Poland on December 4-6, 2015 in Warsaw, Poland. Get involved!Donate! We need funds to turn Limmud Poland 2015 into reality. Any amount helps. Share this campaign!

Of those, many left Poland and moved to the United States and Israel. In 1968, under Communist rule, half of Poland’s entire remaining Jewish population were stripped of citizenship and forced out of the country. For those who stayed, surviving Jewish children were often raised Catholic or not informed of their families’ Jewish heritage.Today, the stories of Jewish revival are more prevalent than ever before.In 2002, His Royal Highness the Prince of Wales visited Krakow and learned of the need for a gathering place for members of the Krakow Jewish community. On his return to London, Prince Charles met with World Jewish Relief (WJR), a London-based charity. With his support and patronage, The Prince of Wales Jewish Community Centre (JCC) of Krakow opened in 2008. “I think it’s really miraculous what’s going on in Krakow,” says Jonathan Ornstein, who has been the executive director of the JCC Krakow since it opened. “Young people are finding out that they have Jewish roots that their families hid during the Communist era that followed World War II...”According to Ornstein, “Our primary purpose is to welcome people with Jewish roots back into the Jewish world.” This includes the woman Ornstein met in Krakow and recently married. In 2017, the JCC Krakow opened the first pluralistic Jewish nursery and pre-school for 10 children, another major milestone.Chuck Fishman has been documenting Jewish life in Poland since 1975.“I support this film and I hope you do too. It’s important and it’s incredible that it has not been done yet. Please support it, now it's the time” Chuck FishmanThe world's biggest Jewish Culture Festival also takes place in Krakow at the end of June.Started by a non-Jew, Janusz Makuch, the Jewish Culture Festival for the last 29 years has welcomed over 30,000 people, offering around 300 events each year. In addition, the sixth edition of the Ride For The Living bicycle ride, a symbolic ride from the site of the Auschwitz Nazi German death camp to the JCC Krakow, takes place the same week. In 2018, the Ride grew to over 200 participants, including three-time Tour de France winner Greg LeMond and two Holocaust survivors.The Jewish Culture Festival, the Ride for the Living and the JCC Krakow are the backdrop of the film’s story.Hidden Heritage: A Jewish Awakening in Krakow is a documentary of many different personal journeys, focusing on the revitalization, rebirth and revival of Jewish life in Krakow and its environs. This character-driven film will center on people who have re-discovered their Jewishness.This documentary will tell the story of Jewish roots recovered, and of non-Jewish Poles committed to cultivating Poland’s Jewish past and future.The search for one’s personal identity is universal. In this film, young people discover what their parents may not have been able to share with them either as a result of the horrors of the Holocaust or the restrictions of Communist rule in Poland: they are Jewish, and they have a rich heritage to learn about and enjoy. It is this emotional story that our film will tell. What does it mean to be Jewish in the Poland of today?The film will also deal with the more challenging environment for Jews in the Poland of today. Since the current government took power in 2015, there are two very distinct trends in Poland: either people are flaunting their Jewishness or once again hiding it. We will try to examine all sides of what it means to be Jewish in the Poland of today and going forward, including the likelihood of the revival continuing in light of the current circumstances.This feature length documentary, which is in the pre-production stage, is planned to be released in the Spring of 2021.

Glenda wanted to bring big city retail she had experienced growing up in Chicago to her native Alberta. It was a labour of love and an altogether new model for Edmonton shoppers. Zenari’s was the first place where you could buy high end kitchenware and a cappuccino from the same counter. In the early 90s, my dad Adriano joined his wife in business and brought with him his love of Italian food, hospitality and service. With his enthusiasm for all things Italian, Zenari’s grew to include a wine bar, expanded menu and catering business.TODAY35 years later, and our family is poised for another big step! Dalla Tavola Zenari is a restaurant concept developed by me, Elisa Zenari, my husband Ran Huget, and my brother, Giancarlo Zenari.Dalla Tavola Zenari translates to from the Zenari table. In effect, Ran, Giancarlo and I want to share our passion for food and hospitality that we developed while working at Zenari’s and catalyzed while sitting around our family table. Honouring the legacy of the flagship Zenari’s is the cornerstone to this new venture but, we’re going to put our own stamp on it.FOODGood food has always been an integral part of our lives and will be an integral part of our restaurant. We want to share the Italian comfort food my family grew up on, and not just pasta and pizza! Italy's culinary history is rich with recipes and local specialties that you only get to try if you're lucky enough to visit. We want to bring some of those dishes to the downtown Edmonton community we've served since 1984. From an expanded antipasti menu (think tapas or small plates) to the Northern Italian classic, Bollito Misto (literally translated to boiled and mixed meats - its so good, believe me), we want our guests to experience a true expression of Italian food, love and family!DRINKLet there be Prosecco! Italians might be as passionate about drink as they are about food and Dalla Tavola Zenari will be no exception. My dad's go-to beverage has always been Prosecco, or a nice Amarone, or even just a simple espresso. His passion for a good glass of whatever he's drinking at the moment, has definitely rubbed off on us. But, it's not just about serving the ""best."" It's also about sharing something you love, with people you love. Dalla Tavola Zenari will have a comprehensive but accessible wine and cocktail menu. We want to compliment our food with an equally amazing glass of wine, spritz, craft beer or cocktail, and we want you to feel comfortable trying something new!LOOK & FEELThe original Kelly Ramsey building may have burnt down, but its been rebuilt into one of downtown Edmonton's most beautiful office towers. We want to honour the history and beauty of the original space we will be so lucky to call our own, and we plan to create a warm, bright, welcoming restaurant that gives a subtle nod to the architecture and design of the period.One element we're particularly excited about is our family gallery wall. They say it takes a village to raise a child; well, we know it took a community to raise a restaurant and we want to honour those who've helped us along the way. Family and community have always been, and always will be, a huge part of our business model and what better way to say thank you than to put your photo on the wall, literally.","Running a restaurant is hard work.The restaurant industry is one of the most volatile industries you can imagine. The dream of opening a restaurant is often romanticized with visions of owners lounging with customers, visiting and sharing laughs while a symphony of action happens effortlessly around them. This sounds amazing but it is not the case. The restaurant business is hard and unforgiving.We consider ourselves lucky. Lucky that our hard work and dedication has brought us to where we are. Zenari's celebrated its 35th anniversary this May. We've seen many businesses come and go over the years and we've learned a lot about what it takes to run a successful restaurant. While Ran, Giancarlo and I haven't managed Zenari's for 35 years, we’ve been actively managing the business for seven years and we have learned some valuable lessons about what it takes to run a restaurant in that time.We live, eat and breathe our work. It doesn't always feel like work when you're as passionate about the business as we are. We can't wait to share our passion and energy at Dalla Tavola Zenari. With a combination of experience and a community of support, we know we have what it takes to run a profitable business.If running a restaurant is hard, opening a restaurant is not only hard but also expensive!Our biggest challenge will be financing this amazing project. We know we have what it takes to run a successful restaurant, but building one is another can of worms. Mechanical, fixtures and equipment can add up quickly. You have to have a clear vision of your project and a firm grasp of your budget to be successful. We've worked really hard to secure some financing through ATB and the Canadian Small Business Financing program.

https://www.kickstarter.com/projects/aidsactivistproject/the-aids-activist-project?ref=discovery_category_newest,aidsactivistproject/the-aids-activist-project,"Introducing the first coffee table-style art book to depict global members of the AIDS activist organization ACT UP, the AIDS Coalition to Unleash Power. Twenty-five years in the making, this labor of love was started in 1989 by Bill Bytsura, a New York City-based photographer and member of ACT UP/New York. This project was born of grief and anger.In 1989, Bill Bytsura lost his partner Randy Northup to AIDS. It was a time when there were few medications available and no promising treatments on the horizon. Panic and prejudice towards people with AIDS — and gay people in particular — was at a fevered height and there was no legal protection when people were evicted from their homes or their jobs because of AIDS phobia. It was a frightening time.After Randy’s death, a friend suggested that Bill attend meetings of the new activist group ACT UP, for support and an outlet for his feelings. While the first meeting was loud, passionate and intimidating, Bytsura eventually found a new family among these people. Being a photographer, he joined the ACT UP Media Committee.While Bytsura documented the many theatrical and angry street demonstrations created by ACT UP, he also felt the world needed to see the private, more contemplative, sides of his brave comrades. Then, perhaps they would not be demonized and their important work ignored.One day, while sitting through another highly emotional meeting, Bytsura had an idea: He would create a series of portraits of activists — not in the streets, where they were protesting in anger, but in more intimate settings where their humanity shone through. the AIDS activist project was born.The project began with sessions in Bytsura’s East Village photo studio. It grew quickly, sending the photographer to cities around America where other ACT UP chapters thrived. Eventually, Bill went abroad, intent on capturing the full diversity of the movement by photographing ACT UP members in other countries.The cities and countries included:New York City, Atlanta, St. Louis, Los Angeles, San Francisco, Miami, San Juan, Amsterdam, Berlin and Paris.Bytsura’s portraits of AIDS activists have been exhibited in New York City and were included in the 1992 exhibition “Don’t Leave Me This Way: Art in the Age of AIDS” at the National Gallery of Australia. In March of 2012, New York magazine showcased Bytsura’s activist portraits in an article on the early days of the epidemic, titled “Pictures From a Battlefield.”","Bytsura has convened a formidable team of artists, activists and educators to make the AIDS Activist Project book a reality. They are:Scott Williams - Layout and Design  Les Williams/Embassy Graphics - PrepressJim Magargee - Master Printer, MVLabs Jay Blotcher and Alan Klein - Public Impact Media ConsultantsMarvin Taylor, Director, The Fales Library, New York UniversityThe success of this project – a living memorial to ACT UP comrades – depends on you. Please support this Kickstarter campaign. Bytsura has lined up a series of unique incentives to thank donors to the project.",https://www.kickstarter.com/projects/aidsactivistproject/the-aids-activist-project-portraits-and-stories-19?ref=discovery_category_newest,aidsactivistproject/the-aids-activist-project-portraits-and-stories-19,"I’m a photographer who’s lived in NYC for over three decades. This book is the result of nearly ten years of work on the front lines of the AIDS activist movement. It’s my personal testimony and a tribute to the beautiful souls who paved the way for medical research, education, acceptance and human rights as it stands today. I’m really proud of this collection and hope that you’ll be moved by the pictures, the stories and the memory of so many fearless, radical individuals.This is how it came to be...I moved to NYC in 1980, leaving a job in a Pennsylvania cigar factory for the wilds of the East Village. I met Randy. I fell in love.In 1987 Randy started losing weight, slowly and steadily getting sicker and sicker. We didn’t know why, but it was happening all around us—young, healthy men succumbing to the sudden and unrelenting pull of death. In less than a year, I found myself spending every day with Randy in the AIDS ward at St. Luke’s-Roosevelt Hospital, taking breaks to walk our dogs before heading back to spend the night. And then he was gone. His parents flew in from the Pacific Northwest, collected his body, and I wasn’t even permitted to attend the funeral.In my shock and grief, I started to attend ACT UP meetings. The first meetings I went to were intimidating. People were angry. Tempers flared. I didn’t think it was the place for me, but I went back again and again. There was a primal urgency that drew me in, and it was the only place that made sense during that period of intense, searing fear. None of us knew how to stop this disease, but we came together to fight and scream and rattle the cages of a society that would prefer we didn’t exist. It was the beginning of a movement that created meaning out of despair, and it changed my life.As I got to know my fellow activists, I came to realize there was something wrong with the response to the AIDS crisis. In the early days, my friends were being evicted from their homes, quarantined and left for dead by a broken healthcare system that was stumbling in the dark. And it didn’t make any damned sense. These were people. Like me. Like you.One night, sitting at a meeting, I looked around and thought, “If people could just get to know my friends, they’d see what I see: A group of amazing, passionate, funny and brave individuals who are fighting for their lives.” So I picked up my camera and began focusing on my peers and their stories.Between 1989–1998 I photographed ACT UP members in New York, Paris and Puerto Rico, traveled to AIDS conferences in Berlin and Amsterdam, and met with activists in Los Angeles, San Francisco, St. Louis, Atlanta and Miami. Along the way, I asked my subjects to write a simple, one-page account of their experiences living with HIV. The resulting portfolio of black-and-white portraits with accompanying personal narratives is the heart and soul of this book, and you can help to make it a reality.This project is my life's work, and it represents the work of so many lives that were lost too soon, too painfully. The book you’re helping to make is an object of remembrance, celebration, education, activism and art.BOOK DETAILSPhotographs: Bill BytsuraForeword: David FranceDesign: Scott WilliamsPrepress: Les Williamson, Embassy GraphicsMaster Printer: Jim Megargee, MV Photo LabsSize: 9""X10.5"", hard cover, 115 pages, 45 B&W photographsRetail Price: $75Publication Date: September 2016Every image will be printed by hand and then scanned.

The portraits will be accompanied by the unique stories submitted by each subject, reproduced in their original form (typos and all), capturing everything from political aspects of the AIDS crisis to the hope for survival. There will also be two-page spreads throughout documenting the political funerals, ACT UP demonstrations, the March on Kennebunkport, The Church Ladies for Choice, the Proud Marys, and all those who made this a vital decade of expression for change.David France (How to Survive a Plague) will be contributing the foreword.ABOUT BILLA self taught photographer, I began at age 14 by picking up my dad’s old Minolta SRT-101 and shooting the fields and woods around my small Pennsylvania town. I was inspired by photography as an act of creation—seeing, capturing, revealing. Over the years, I learned how to shoot, process and print black-and-white film, and in time I gravitated toward portraiture.My work has been influenced by pioneering photographers Dorothea Lange, Sebastiao Salgado, Roman Vishniac, Diane Arbus, Weegee and Andre Kertesz. My images have been featured in Newsweek, New York Magazine, OutWeek and various galleries, but the most meaningful display was in the iconic propaganda of the ACT UP era, pasted to walls and streetlights all over NYC.Black-and-white portraiture better allows the viewer to study faces, noticing lines and wrinkles. For me, a good photograph is one where you can look several times and continuously uncover new details.","When I began putting this project together, I contacted everyone I know in the industry to find out how to produce and finance a high-quality art book. The original book was going to be 144 pages with 65 images, and even after the generosity of my peers who were willing to donate their time and talents, along with printers offering reduced rates, the final price tag was still hovering at $47,000.One year ago I launched a Kickstarter campaign that did not reach its goal. Anyone who has participated in an online fundraising campaign will tell you it's an extreme experience full of highs and lows, elation and panic. I gave it my all, but it wasn't enough. And it was incredibly disappointing.But in the spirit of ACT UP I'm giving it another shot. The first campaign attracted hundreds of backers and reconnected me to old friends, while introducing me to a new generation of people who believe in art as one of our greatest tools for bearing witness. Ultimately it's been an inspiring, empowering process. I've refined the original version and created a layout for the book that's more focused and equally powerful, while reducing the production cost by more than 25%.Making art is a risk, and finding support for work that represents queer experience continues to be a challenge, but I'm standing on the shoulders of giants who were radical, courageous, determined and beautiful. This is for them."

I’m also the founder of Film Threat,which began as a magazine and then became one of the most respected sourcesonline covering independent film, while also giving the middle finger toHollywood. (But in a fun way.)FilmThreat started as a fanzine I created in high school and became a printmagazine sold on newsstands everywhere. The magazine covered people like QuentinTarantino, Kevin Smith and many others who began their careers in indie film.Film Threat built a reputation for telling it like it is and pulling no punchesand it’s been around for 30 years. Movies that were ignored by the mainstream mediaoutlets, could always count on Film Threat for coverage. And when the Film Threat web site launched in 1996, that tradition of championing independents continued. The truth is that the Film Threat web site was actually supported by my television career. At the time, I waswilling to spend $25,000 or more each year out of my own pocket to support thesite. I believed very strongly in Film Threat’s mission to help up and comingindies. But, let’s be honest, I don’t have a TV career anymore. Andconvention appearances only go so far. So, it's really difficult for me to ask, but right now I need your help. Tocontinue Film Threat’s mission to provide a unique voice in the world ofentertainment as well as support a new generation of up and coming independentfilmmakers, I’m asking you to contribute to the Kickstarter to save FilmThreat. And if you’re a fan of my segment DVDuesday from Attack of the Show, Iwill bring DVDuesday back as a weekly web show for a year. (It won’t actually be called“DVDuesday” for legal reasons, but I promise that the new name will reallyexcite you!) I will reveal the new name for the DVDuesday show in an update on Kickstarter once we reach 50% of our initial funding goal.TheFilm Threat web site was launched in 1996. That’s 19 years worth of contentmaking up more than 80,000 stories on a site that has to be redesigned andreformatted. Relaunching a site of this size with this amount of content iscostly and I can’t afford to fund it alone this time. I’ll need money forprogrammers, designers, and for a new server along with a budget for writersand an editorial team to keep it going. The money will also be used to help fund the productionbudget for the weekly DVDuesday segments. A budget will also be needed to create aFilm Threat app and build a Podcast Network to give our writers a voice beyondthe site. The budget I’ve put together should give us the boost we need to continue. And while it seems like a lot of money, anyone who has run a web site with daily content or produced a weekly web show knows that it costs more than one would think. The amount I've budgeted covers the site relaunch, a podcast network, an app and a web series. All of this covers Phase One of Film Threat's return. (I'll reveal Phase Two initiatives once we get to 90% of our funding goal.) If we exceed our funding goal, we'll be able to do more episodes of DVDuesday and we can fund stretch goal projects planned for Phase Two. We’llalso launch a Film Threat Podcast Network featuring a variety of podcasts from the writers on the site. (I'll reveal some of those podcasts once we reach 75% of our funding goal.) In addition, we’ll create aFilm Threat App for IOS and Android that will be available free for everyone. TheFilm Threat site will also feature new episodes of DVDuesday weekly with around up of verdicts and links to where you can see the movies discussed. I’llneed a budget to produce DVDuesday on a weekly basis. So just like on Attack ofthe Show, every Tuesday you’ll get my DVD picks (or “streaming picks” since,well, we don’t really buy everything on DVD anymore.) And DVDuesday will beeven better, because I’ll have more time to discuss each movie. I’ll also beable to use all those words you can’t say on TV. For the first time, DVDuesdaywill be UNCENSORED! (Although, I promise not to overdo the swearing and use my powers for good, not evil.) The Film Threat web site will be back to posting compelling content on adaily basis. There will be a free app to use on your mobile device. And you’llsee DVDuesday every Tuesday, just like the old days (or, y’know, just a fewyears ago.) And for backing these projects, I’moffering all kinds of incentives, so get in early as some are inlimited supply. In addition, I’ll be including some rare collectibles such as original artfrom my own personal archives from both Film Threat and Attack of the Show’shistory. I guess I could sell this stuff on ebay, but I think it would be a lot morefun to give it to you. (Keep an eye on updates to see the items to be given away at the higher funding levels.) It's painful to say this, but the reality is that if we don’t reach our goal, I will shut down the Film Threat web site for good. I just can't afford to fund it on my own. Unfortunately, that means that all of the stories that are in the archives will be wiped clean off the Internet. Forever. And I will be unable to bring back DVDuesday. (And I know from talking to fans online and at conventions, that everyone seems to miss DVDuesday.)So,if you were a reader of Film Threat and it touched you in some way. Help out. Contribute whatever you can afford. And then please encourage your friends to do so too. Ifyou’re a filmmaker and Film Threat inspired you or was supportive in some way, please consider contributing. Ifyou’re a fan of DVDuesday and you loved my reviews and you want to see thesegment return, now is the time to contribute and make that happen. Alsobe sure to tell your friends by tweeting about it or posting on social media, remember to tag @FilmThreat or @ThatChrisGore. In addition to contributing whatever you can afford, spreading the word is a great way to help.Ifall goes well and we reach our funding goal, the Film Threat site will return just a few months from now inJune and I’ll announce the schedule for DVDuesday’s return as well as the newpodcasts and app. Ihope you contribute so we can bring back Film Threat and DVDuesday and continueour mission. Thank you!","When it comes to relaunching the Film Threat site, I've already received  estimates on the costs and can move forward as soon as the Kickstarter ends. After a short testing period, we'll be live in June. The only hold up would be hiring in the editorial arena, but I have already begun talking to prospects including some all-stars from Film Threat's past. For everyone involved, it's a small freelance gig, but more than that, it's a passion project that I know means a lot to many people. As for DVDuesday, I have a G4TV producer from X-Play who will be working with me as part of the production team. I'm currently seeking a studio to shoot the segment every few weeks. In addition, I have been collecting DVDs for some evergreen segments that are going to be awesome. I can't wait to tell you about the Starlost four-disc set I got from Canada. The new DVDuesday should launch no later than August as we begin shooting in June/July. As for fulfilling rewards, I'll get into production on the posters, t-shirts and other items for shipping right after the Kickstarter ends. I'll document their production with updates so you can see as those rewards get fulfilled. Some items are larger and may require special shipping needs, but that only applies to the contributors of higher rewards. When it comes to fulfilling shout outs and set visits, that will be arranged on an individual basis. I expect to have all rewards requiring shipping fulfilled by September. All other rewards involving set visits and shout outs will happen gradually over the next year and contingent upon the schedules of those backers. Any problems as we encounter as we go will be documented here so that contributors will be aware of any scheduling pitfalls, but I know how to build and rebuild web sites, I've published books before, and I know how to create a t-shirt line, so I don't foresee any major challenges. And doing DVDuesday again will be just like old times. Frankly, I can't wait. And whatever the challenges, when I run into any contributor at a film festival or a comic con, I will thank you personally. And if the setting is right, I'm sure we'll be able to celebrate together. (Though I'm sure that last sentence violates something on Kickstarter. I don't think I can offer you a free drink, but if I could, I would.)",https://www.kickstarter.com/projects/thatchrisgore/save-film-threat?ref=discovery_category_newest,thatchrisgore/save-film-threat,"With your help, we have reached 100% of our funding with just days left! Having met our initial goal, we must set our sights higher and aim for a new target. Our original funding goal of $37,500 is earmarked to launch a redesigned Film Threat website, create a podcast network and to release a free app. The app will make it easier to access all of Film Threat’s content on tablets and mobile devices and our intention is to present an upscale, magazine-like experience.Our next goal is to begin production on the documentary, Film Threat Sucks. So now we’re asking for an additional $12,500, which will be used to shoot new footage for the documentary in Los Angeles, New York and Film Threat’s birthplace of Detroit, Michigan. You may have already seen the trailer for Film Threat Sucks. This sizzle reel, cut together by Rune Lind, was the result of 100+ hours of VHS footage as well as thousands of photos from the Film Threat archives. Based on the result, we knew there was a compelling story to be told about the rise and fall of indie film in the 90s through the lens of the magazine that covered that era… along with all the behind-the-scenes drama.But to completely tell the tale, we need to shoot interviews with the filmmakers, the celebrities and the writers who worked at Film Threat during that period. And if we make this stretch goal, ALL backers of the Save Film Threat campaign will be listed in the credits of the film.I hope you’ll help take us to our next goal of $50,000 so that we can begin shooting what we hope will be a documentary that will inspire the next generation of independent filmmakers.Last year I launched a Kickstarter to bring Film Threat back. The campaign did not reach its funding goal, which was very ambitious. Every day since the campaign ended, I have received emails, tweets, Facebook messages and met people at comic cons and film festivals telling me how much they miss Film Threat.With so much encouragement and lessons learned, I am launching a new Kickstarter to bring Film Threat back but this time, we’ll begin in stages. We'll start with a newly redesigned website that will make 30 years of Film Threat content accessible and we’ll launch an app along with a podcast. Our first goal of $37,500 will help us revive Film Threat and if you donate early, you’ll have the opportunity to get special limited edition rewards.Film Threat started as a fanzine I created in high school and later became a print magazine sold on newsstands. The magazine covered people like Quentin Tarantino, Kevin Smith and many others who began their careers in indie film. Film Threat built a reputation for telling it like it is and pulling no punches. Movies that were ignored by the mainstream media outlets, could always count on Film Threat for coverage. And when the Film Threat website launched in 1996, that tradition of championing independents continued. FilmThreat.com became one of the most respected sources online covering indie film, while also giving the middle finger to Hollywood. (But in a fun way.)Film Threat was also partially funded by my personal finances and I spent a significant amount each year to support the site. I believed very strongly in Film Threat’s mission to support up and coming indies. So while it is difficult for me to ask, I need your help to bring Film Threatback.This is a new golden age of indie film with social media, crowd-funding and affordable lo-fi filmmaking on the rise. More than ever, indie films need a place where they can be thrust into the spotlight and find a fan base. My commitment to you is thatFilm Threat will provide a unique voice and once again support a new generation of up and coming filmmakers.Film Threat magazine was first published in 1985 and the web site was launched in 1996. That’s 30 years worth of content making up more than 80,000 stories on a site that has to be redesigned and reformatted. Relaunching a site of this size with so much content is costly. The funds raised will allow me to hire programmers, designers, and I'll need a new server along with a budget for an editorial team.The amount I've budgeted covers the costs of the site relaunch, the podcast, and the app. All of this covers phase one of Film Threat's return.We’ll also launch a Film Threat Podcast Network featuring a variety of podcasts from the writers on the site. In addition, we’ll create a Film Threat App for IOS and Android available for free.The reality is that if I don’t reach the initial goal of $37,500, I will have no choice but to shut down the Film Threat website and the content will be lost. All of the stories that are in the archives will be wiped off the Internet forever. This thought makes me truly sad but with all the folks like you who enjoyed Film Threat, I am optimistic that it will relaunch and continue to provide the high-quality content that you have come to know, expect and love.If we exceed our funding goal, we'll be able to do more Film Threat projects the first of which is a documentary about Film Threat magazine in the 90s. I've been working with a group of talented filmmakers who want to tell our story. Over the past year, we have digitized over 100 hours of VHS footage and scanned 5,000 photos from our archives. I will release the three-minute sizzle reel for the documentary once we get close to our first funding goal. If we can raise an additional $12,500, it will be used for travel and to shoot interviews for the doc. Other stretch goals include a weekly show where I’ll bring back DVDuesday, my popular segment from G4TV's Attack of the Show. I'll detail these stretch goals once we reach 50% of our funding.So, if you were a reader of Film Threat and it inspired you in some way, please help. Contribute whatever you can afford. And then please encourage your friends to do so too. We'll also continue to add exclusive items throughout the campaign, so keep checking back.If you’re a filmmaker and Film Threatwas supportive in some way, please consider contributing. There are rewards specifically designed to help filmmakers and film festivals get exposure with our audience on social media, who never abandoned us.In addition to contributing, spreading the word online is a great way to help, so be sure to tell your friends by tweeting about it or posting on social media, remember to tag @FilmThreat and/or @ThatChrisGore. If all goes well and we reach our funding goal, the Film Threat site will return and I’ll announce the schedule for the launch of our new podcast and app. All donors will get early access to the beta version of the website so that you can offer feedback as we build our new foundation for the future. I hope you choose to support Film Threat so that we can continue our mission.Thank you!We have added some new limited edition rewards and here are some pictures of these rare, exclusive and one-of-a-kind items from the Film Threat archives as well as new rewards related to our documentary Film Threat Sucks.Chris Prynoski of TItmouse Animation Studios provided us with three rough sketches for designs for the exclusive Film Threat t-shirt for backers. Once our campaign ends, we'll ask backers to choose which design will be used for the final t-shirt. Here's a look at the rough designs. Thanks, Chris!","When it comes to relaunching the Film Threat site, I've already received estimates on the costs and can move forward as soon as the Kickstarter ends.

See below for GoBand details.GoGlove is a wearable Bluetooth enabled glove to seamlessly interact with your mobile device. The idea came from our frustration of dealing with music while skiing. There's nothing like flying down the mountain with your favorite tunes but it's such a pain to interact with your device when its in your pocket. We found a better way with GoGloveWith sensors placed in the fingertips and a magnet in the thumb, you can control any music app with a simple tap. Each finger has single and double tap functionality. It's great for running, biking, or any active sport while listening to music. We have working prototypes and when we used the glove, it really enhanced our experience. The true test was a ski trip to Utah last winter where we used the glove all week. It was awesome. It completely changed the way we listened to music. We know music can make the moment and we want to share that experience with you.See how it worksGoGlove uses high quality materials in a thin glove liner that can be worn on its own or underneath another glove. With our patent pending AirTap technology, you can wear any outer glove without losing functionality. We included an ""activate sensor"" in the palm to ensure you don't accidentally change a song. The battery will last up to 6 months of daily use. The GoGlove module can be easily removed from the zipper pouch in the wrist of the glove and used as the GoBand. GoBand AnnouncementWe heard from our Backers that they wanted this functionality with a glove AND without.  We achieved this by redesigning the module to have 4 buttons on top and a thin flexible channel underneath for a strap.  Now you can unplug the module from your glove and strap it to your wrist.The original case would have had one button to power on/off. We have simply extended that to include four buttons, which do the same thing as tapping a finger.The case is currently 1.8"" x 1.3"" x 0.6"" (L x W x H). Those dimensions are subject to change slightly as we finalize everything, but should be pretty close.This design change gives you a stand-alone phone remote on your wrist in addition to the functionality in a Glove.  Its like a smart watch but 4x cheaper and with easy buttons to tap while you are working out or on the go.  The new design makes the GoGlove a truly all-year round product. Strap it to a stroller, put it on a key chain, wear it on your wrist. Now you have seamless device control anywhere, anytime. Our design team is nearing completion of the final specs and all our suppliers have confirmed capability of manufacturing this new design.  Its such a simple fix by adding a few more buttons and drastically improving the versatility.Check out the new GoBand Only pledge levels!!Please note that the original GoBand has been completely redesigned. It is no longer a sweatband since the module itself becomes the GoBand when its removed from the glove.Music makes the moment.We believe Music can be accessed and controlled easier. Interacting with your device means fishing it out of a pocket and fumbling to make a change. This takes you away from the moment, instead of enhancing it. Everyone has their soundtrack to elevate any moment to the surreal. Leave your phone in your pocket and control better and faster than ever before.Tap and Go. GoGloveBeyond MusicWhile GoGlove is perfect for controlling music, it can do so much more. Imagine being able to control your favorite running app from your fingertips, or using GoGlove to control interactive story lines as you workout. The possibilities are endless when you imagine GoGlove in the hands of app developers.Therefore, we will release a publicly available API for GoGlove. Developers will be able to utilize the functions of GoGlove and integrate it into their apps. The API will be available in March 2015 as we first want to focus on making the product great from the start. If you are interested in integrating GoGlove into your app, feel free to contact us.See a sample app here:Stretch GoalsThe first requires $60,000 in funding and will allow us to create an app for iOS and Android to customize your GoGlove experience. Through the app, you will be able to specify which finger triggers which events. If you want to activate Siri with your index finger, you can customize it. If we reach this stretch goal, the apps will be released for free download to the iTunes and Google Play stores.We have cancelled our $100,000 Stretch Goal because everyone gets a GoBand included in their order!! You are welcome!See the rewards below for your pledge:StatusWe have now made 4 different versions and multiple prototypes to include the right technologies. Our design is the perfect mix of functionality, battery life, and size.We have manufacturers lined up for all components and will receive our final samples shortly.

We are happy of the result even if we can't benefit from the donations yet. Now we are aware that we are not alone but there is a community sharing the Warka Water's vision and supporting us. Your kind and supportive words are giving us strength and motivation to go head.Concluded this experience we are now even more determined to continue working on Warka Water and RELAUNCHING THE KICKSTARTER CAMPAIGN, which you can find by clicking here: RelaunchPlease confirm your support by donating to the new Warka Water Kickstarter page, we have reduced our financial goal and the scope of this campaign, We are looking for resources to build the first Pilot Prototype, that we have already started in Addis Ababa, and install it in a rural community. We will be developing the Warkino monitoring equipment later on or eventually now if we get more funding.Thanks for supporting us and helping us spread the word ! Don't forget to Like us on Facebook and stay tuned for more updates.Water is the source of life. It is so fundamental to our lives that we take it for granted. But in some areas of the world, water shortage is an acute and a real problem. Many rural villages in Africa lack the simple water infrastructure to fulfill basic needs.Visiting small isolated communities up on high plateau in the North East region of Ethiopia, we witnessed this dramatic reality: the lack of potable water. The villagers live in a beautiful natural environment but often without running water, electricity, a toilet or a shower. To survive here, women and children walk everyday for miles towards shallow and unprotected ponds, where the water is often contaminated with human and animal waste, parasites, and diseases. They collect the water using dry carved pumpkins and carry the water back in old plastic containers, which are extremely heavy.Recent studies show that only 34% of Ethiopia’s population has access to an improved water supply. This implies that approximately 60 million people lack safe water.  To help improve this dramatic situation, we made it our mission to find a solution and help these people with Warka Water (WW): An environmentally, socially and financially sustainable solution to potable water.Warka Water is an alternative water source to rural population that faces challenges in accessing drinkable water. It is first and foremost an architecture project. WW should not be considered as the solution to all water problems in developing countries but rather as a tool that can provide clean water in selected areas, particularly in mountainous regions where conventional pipelines will never reach and where water is not available from wells. These remote communities, often with limited financial means, struggle to find reliable supplies of clean water for the people, the animals and for agriculture. WW is designed to be owned and operated by the villagers, a key factor that should help guarantee the success of the project. WW not only provides a fundamental resource for life – water – but also creates a social place for the community, where people can gather under the shade of its canopy for education and public meetings. The name of the project 'Warka' comes from the Warka Tree, which is a giant wild fig tree native to Ethiopia. It constitutes a very important part of the local culture and ecosystem by providing its fruit and a gathering place for the community. In rural areas of Ethiopia, infrastructure is scarce, and building a well is neither easy nor affordable. To find water source, you need to drill deep in the ground up to 1,600 ft (500 m). Bringing water to the top requires pumps and electrical equipment, which are both expensive and difficult to maintain.Our focus is on providing sustainable and affordable water sources through the WW. Built with local bamboo, it is easy to be maintained by villagers themselves, and it can run at very low cost.Air always contains a certain amount of water, irrespective of local ambient temperatures and humidity conditions. This makes it possible to produce water from air almost anywhere in the world. Locations with high rates of aerosol and humidity are best to install WW.WW is a vertical structure designed to harvest potable water from the atmosphere (it collects rain, harvests fog and dew), itis estimated to collect up to 26.4 gal (100 L) of drinking water every day.Below are the key details of Warka Water 3.1.WW version 3.1 is 33 ft (10 m) in height and 132 pounds (60 kg) in weight, consisting of 5 modules that are very easy to assemble, from top to bottom.A network of ropes provides additional stability. The tension in the diagonal guy-wire, combined with the compressional strength of the bamboo structure, allows the tower to withstand strong winds. 8 fixation points are placed radially at 26 ft (8 m) distance from the WW base and are tightened with 8 polyester ropes, which are very low-stretch and ultraviolet resistant. Inside the bamboo structure hangs the plastic Mesh that collects droplets of water from the high humidity in the air and the Collector where the dew condensation can happen at night. A textile canopy around the WW bamboo structure creates a shaded area.Warka is designed to be easily built and maintained by local villagers without scaffolding and electrical tools. The materials used are: bamboo, hemp and bio-plastic.A meteorological station designed specifically for the development of the WW, Warkino enables us to study the water harvesting abilities of different types of materials under various climatic conditions. Warkino helps us to monitor the local environment (humidity, air pressure, temperature, winds, water collection, water quality, material surface temperatures). The Warkino is fundamental to launching a successful pilot and improving the water harvesting materials.We have built 9 full-scale prototypes of WW to date, testing and improving the concept. Currently, the 10th prototype is being developed (WW version 3.1).We have faced several challenges so far. The first was creating a tall, lightweight and stable structure out of natural material, using a low-tech and sustainable approach. This process required a number of computer models and simulations, visualized with physical representations. Another challenge was making it easy and economic to construct the tower without using power-tools and scaffolding.The Warka Water project began in 2012 by the Italian design practice ‘Architecture and Vision’, directed by Arturo Vittori, with the support of external collaborators. Since then, we have come a long way and we are ready to begin constructing our first pilot and test it in the field.We have drafted a business plan for the next 5 years, where each year is divided into 2 semesters and marked by the letter (S). The semesters with the (✓) symbol delineate what has been achieved thus far, and the semester with the green mark indicates the current phase, which will be achieved with the help of this campaign. We have also planned subsequent phases of work, among which are the launch of 3 field tests and 3 larger pilots, and monitoring test results, before large-scale production. In 2019, once the project is completed, we plan to start the large-scale production of WW. Moreover, specific training courses will be organized for the inhabitants of the village to construct, use and maintain the WW. We hope to invigorate the local economy through manufacturing activities and give children opportunities to invest their time in more productive activities and education. We believe that WW can be a stepping-stone that empowers communities to build greater independence.We are raising funds to support our first field test in Ethiopia (March 2015) and the development of Monitoring Equipment ‘Warkino’. Without completing this phase of work, the project will fall short of launching pilots and scaling to other regions. The diagram below illustrates the distribution of budget required for this phase of WW development. For example, to construct the first pilot test prototype in Ethiopia, we need to acquire materials, to employ people to help us make the structure, cover the travel expenses, etc.Customs and duties are not included in the pledge amount.Help us to make WW happen andempower the water poor communities with the ability to produce clean water. Your contribution – fromsupporting this project, spreading the word, to reaching out with newcollaboration ideas – can make a difference in remote villages in Ethiopia. We are grateful for all your support and encouragement.Behind WW is asmall international team with a large vision.

We have defined an efficient design that minimizes the need for tools and materials while maximizing water collection, robustness and maintaining elegance.During the project development, we have been facing several challenges. For example, one of the most difficult obstacles so far has been to make a tall and a lightweight structure that is easy to mount and is capable of withstanding various weather conditions. The wind transports water particles in the air through the mesh, giving WW the chance to harvest them. But when the wind is too strong, it can challenge the stability of the structure. For this, we have already conducted several tests and improved the design of the tower. The latest WW version is tested to stand against winds that reach the speed of 40 mph (65 km/h).We have worked extremely hard to get to where we are today, developing and refining the initial concept, and so far have been able to meet the project timeline. A lot of work has already been done, but we are aware that there will be more hurdles to overcome. The next phase of work (the S6), the construction of the first pilot prototype in Ethiopia, is extremely important, and we’ll need to focus all of our energies to address specific challenges that come with constructing WW in a new context – a rural area in the Ethiopian highlands. To adapt the WW design to any changes in the local situation, we must be ready to find all the right materials and tools on site. For example, if local wind conditions pose a danger to WW's stability, we will develop a strategy to avoid any damages. Mesh can be designed to be easily lowered or raised depending on the wind conditions. Another challenge will be to teach and train the local community on how to build and maintain WW. We already have local representatives that can support and bridge the communication and cultural gap.We are confident that we can make WW happen.

It is so fundamental to our lives that we take it for granted. But in some areas of the world, water shortage is an acute and a real problem. Many rural villages in Africa lack the simple water infrastructure to fulfill basic needs.Visiting small isolated communities up on high plateau in the North East region of Ethiopia, we witnessed this dramatic reality: the lack of potable water. The villagers live in a beautiful natural environment but often without running water, electricity, a toilet or a shower. To survive here, women and children walk everyday for miles towards shallow and unprotected ponds, where the water is often contaminated with human and animal waste, parasites, and diseases. They collect the water using dry carved pumpkins and carry the water back in old plastic containers, which are extremely heavy.Recent studies show that only 34% of Ethiopia’s population has access to an improved water supply. This implies that approximately 60 million people lack safe water.  To help improve this dramatic situation, we made it our mission to find a solution and help these people with Warka Water (WW): An environmentally, socially and financially sustainable solution to potable water.Warka Water is an alternative water source to rural population that faces challenges in accessing drinkable water. It is first and foremost an architecture project. WW should not be considered as the solution to all water problems in developing countries but rather as a tool that can provide clean water in selected areas, particularly in mountainous regions where conventional pipelines will never reach and where water is not available from wells. These remote communities, often with limited financial means, struggle to find reliable supplies of clean water for the people, the animals and for agriculture.WW is designed to be owned and operated by the villagers, a key factor that should help guarantee the success of the project. WW not only provides a fundamental resource for life – water – but also creates a social place for the community, where people can gather under the shade of its canopy for education and public meetings.The name of the project 'Warka' comes from the Warka Tree, which is a giant wild fig tree native to Ethiopia. It constitutes a very important part of the local culture and ecosystem by providing its fruit and a gathering place for the community.In rural areas of Ethiopia, infrastructure is scarce, and building a well is neither easy nor affordable. To find water source, you need to drill deep in the ground up to 1,600 ft (500 m). Bringing water to the top requires pumps and electrical equipment, which are both expensive and difficult to maintain.Our focus is on providing sustainable and affordable water sources through the WW. Built with local bamboo, it is easy to be maintained by villagers themselves, and it can run at very low cost.Air always contains a certain amount of water, irrespective of local ambient temperatures and humidity conditions. This makes it possible to produce water from air almost anywhere in the world. Locations with high rates of aerosol and humidity are best to install WW.WW is a vertical structure designed to harvest potable water from the atmosphere (it collects rain, harvests fog and dew), itis estimated to collect up to 26.4 gal (100 L) of drinking water every day.Below are the key details of Warka Water 3.2.WW version 3.2 is 33 ft (10 m) in height and 132 pounds (60 kg) in weight, consisting of 5 modules that are very easy to assemble, from top to bottom.A network of ropes provides additional stability. The tension in the diagonal guy-wire, combined with the compressional strength of the bamboo structure, allows the tower to withstand strong winds. 8 fixation points are placed radially at 26 ft (8 m) distance from the WW base and are tightened with 8 polyester ropes, which are very low-stretch and ultraviolet resistant.Inside the bamboo structure hangs the plastic Mesh that collects droplets of water from the high humidity in the air and the Collector where the dew condensation can happen at night.A textile canopy around the WW bamboo structure creates a shaded area.Warka is designed to be easily built and maintained by local villagers without scaffolding and electrical tools.The materials used are: bamboo, hemp and bio-plastic.A meteorological station designed specifically for the development of the WW, Warkino enables us to study the water harvesting abilities of different types of materials under various climatic conditions. Warkino helps us to monitor the local environment (humidity, air pressure, temperature, winds, water collection, water quality, material surface temperatures). The Warkino is fundamental to launching a successful pilot and improving the water harvesting materials.We have built 9 full-scale prototypes of WW to date, testing and improving the concept. Currently, the 10th prototype is being developed (WW version 3.2).We have faced several challenges so far. The first was creating a tall, lightweight and stable structure out of natural material, using a low-tech and sustainable approach. This process required a number of computer models and simulations, visualized with physical representations. Another challenge was making it easy and economic to construct the tower without using power-tools and scaffolding.After two weeks of hard work, thanks to the support of the the Italian Development Cooperation, the Italian Cultural Institute in Addis Ababa, and the African Bamboo company, the construction of the First WW Pilot Prototype in Ethiopia has started with the collaboration of the architecture students at the EiABC (Ethiopian Institute of Architecture Building construction and City development). Part of the challenge of this first phase was to find and test the local bamboo and the availability of materials and tools. On 5th of February 2015, the structure was fully assembled for the first time. The Warka Water project began in 2012 by the Italian design practice ‘Architecture and Vision’, directed byArturo Vittori, with the support of external collaborators.Since then, we have come a long way and we are ready to begin constructing our first pilot and test it in the field.We have drafted a business plan for the next 5 years, where each year is divided into 2 semesters and marked by the letter (S). The semesters with the (✓) symbol delineate what has been achieved thus far, and the semester with the green mark indicates the current phase, which will be achieved with the help of this campaign.

The last one, some 250 years ago, saw our traditional tartan clothing banned in the Highlands - a ban that wasn't lifted until 1782.During the 36 years of the ban, tartan weaving disappeared from the Highland area of Scotland. Today we want you to join us in being at the forefront of bringing this ancient craft home to the Highlands for good by building a tartan weaving mill - a mill that has been missing for a quarter of a millennium. The time is now.The Black House Mill will be the only tartan weaving mill in the Highlands of Scotland. Based on our extensive research and deep understanding of how the industry is still affected by history, we have battled to meet an ever growing demand for our services and products. We've found that existing provision has difficulty in meeting the demand we've created and having travelled the length and breadth of Scotland to find like-minded disruptors to inject a new wave of creative innovation into Scotland's iconic cloth, it became clear that there was only one solution - to build a tartan weaving mill in the Highlands.Located just a few miles away from the site of the infamous Battle of Culloden that led to the tartan ban in 1746, you will find the traditional industrial steading building that has been acquired for the project. Now awaiting full restoration into a building with historic purpose, the steading and land rights can be dated back to 1787, complete with a Royal assignation. Of quintessentially Highland design, and located deep in the Highland countryside of the Black Isle, it proudly faces North West across the glassy waters of the Cromarty Firth towards the mountains of the West Highlands.But this will be an uprising like never before, where creative disruption and innovation will be part of a 'build the mill' project that weaves our five threads of purpose into a lasting legacy.You will help build the home for the Black House Mill, and with your support we can ensure tartan is restored to the Highlands. We will also be bringing new technology to an ancient tradition and by virtue of this you will also help create employment for at least six full time members of staff through 2018. Building year on year, you will be creating job roles that do not currently exist in the region.Having been on the journey for two years already, we have customers waiting. We have also obtained the necessary pre-planning approval for the restoration and conversion of the existing building into a fully operational textiles mill.Above is our artists impression of the renovated mill, which will feature dedicated space for design, weaving and product finishing.With your support we can achieve the following milestones with the funds raised from this campaign.Should you wish to know more about our five year plan then please request this here.To celebrate our shared success with you our mill founders, we will be holding a founders mill opening event in October 2018 on the Black Isle.

Sadly due to the fairly harsh Highland winters the building of the mill can only commence in early spring. However, the nature of our rewards will ensure that all pledges should be fulfilled early in 2018, with the exception of cloth related items. These very first bolts of tartan cloth will be available from August 2018.Throughout the build period we will be sharing with all of those who pledge to support us, behind the scenes images and film of life at the Black House Mill.At the moment we have a small core team, all Highland based, working with a supply chain throughout Scotland. The mill will allow us to have more passionate staff available in-house thus helping bring back tartan to its home. Our team by their very nature all strive to do things differently from everyone else.Through our journey of the past two years, our small but mighty team have devised a solution to the need we have identified - disrupt history, build a tartan mill in the Highlands and be part of a new Highland uprising that re-writes the rules!Clare is commercially creative or creatively commercial. This is derived from her professional training as a Chartered Accountant and her obsession with tartan design and product design, not a likely combination.However this combination provides assurance at a corporate level but also the ability to take design risks.You can read more about Clare on her kickstarter profile page by clicking here.We believe that the restoring of weaving tartan to the Highlands is a moment in Scottish history that many around the world will wish to be part of. Today, it will be a celebration of returning the ancient industry of tartan weaving to its home of origin and for tomorrow, we are providing a new sector of employment for our future generations to grow in the centuries to come.While there is a market for authentic made in the Highlands tartan, we have discovered that there is not sufficient mill capacity in Scotland to meet the demands that the Prickly Thistle brand has uncovered over the past two years. This is why we're inviting you to be part of the journey where we build the mill that can help fulfil that demand.In return for everyone's support many creative hours have been spent ensuring that we could provide the founders of this mill with something unique. A series of gifts that champion our Made in the Highlands commitment.Should you have any specific media needs then please contact us by clicking on the below signpost.         If you would like to find out more about our journey then please follow us on the below social platforms, and do not forget to click follow..... ","The team at Prickly Thistle has spent the last two years understanding what goes into tartan design, cloth manufacturing and product finishing.We have developed a portfolio of projects during that time and immersed ourselves in partnerships with all of the remaining tartan textile partners in Scotland.We are fortunate to also have secured commitment from an award winning construction company to assist with the Mill redevelopment, and equally commitment from specialist equipment procurement partners who have sourced the perfect looms for us!It is anticipated that the mill will take 6-9 months to develop to an operational stage, and this work will commence in the first quarter of 2018.  During that time training facilities have been secured for new personnel, ensuring that as soon as our looms are switched on we start making tartan history in the Highlands once again.",https://www.kickstarter.com/projects/783047702/buildthemill-continues-restoring-tartan-to-the-hig?ref=discovery_category_newest,783047702/buildthemill-continues-restoring-tartan-to-the-hig,"Who are Prickly Thistle? We are the rebel tartan brand based in the Highlands of Scotland who have a vision to restore the weaving of tartan to its ancestral home by building a weaving mill. This will be the first weaving mill to have been built in centuries in this region.On the 14th October 2017 we shared with the world that the Highlands of Scotlandhad not woven its cloth of identity, tartan, for decades. We took a stance that day and we started the Highland Tartan Uprising. It was a stance that was not only about preserving our heritage and culture but also a voice for the future.   We’d recognised that as well as bringing tartan weaving home, this industry had to innovate like never before. So, we needed to once again value and use our native natural resources while at the same time inject a new wave of design into one of the oldest cloth designs in the world – through this we could  create tartan textiles products that disrupted all stereotypes.Our original plan to build the Black House Mill on the Black Isle remains unchanged, and thiswill happen just a little later than we originally planned.   But to grow our business from a design studio to an operational mill issomething that we have not given up on. As a result of the support we've received from all of our original backers, we are committed to raising the essential funds we need to build the Black House Mill including via Kickstarter. Our aim is to have this building finished for a grand opening - a grand opening where all backers will be invited!This Plan B Kickstarter campaign has been launched to allow us to start raising the funds required to do this. Through the sale of our exclusive product collection, all profits will be invested in the new mill. We have split the cost of the project to allow us to raise specific amounts for each aspect of the Black House Mill. We've decided to build the mill in a number of steps while a pop-up mill allows us to get going with the great Highland Tartan Uprising. The first step starts with us looking to raise £40,000 for the West Wing. The West Wing will be used to customise all of our clients' finished tartan products using the cloth we have woven in the Highlands. The full building fund requirement is shown below.As the Black House Mill will take longer thanoriginally planned, Plan B is also about seizing the opportunity to start weaving tartan cloth in a temporary home as quick as we can, allowing us to deliver on campaign rewards and grow our business to generate further funds to build the Black House Mill.As a direct result of our first campaign, we are thrilled to share with you that two original backers from the Highlands have joined our team. With their financial support and that of our local government agency that now supports our ambitious business, we are delighted to announce that we are now preparing a pop-up mill, which is 12 miles from the site of the Black House Mill.When we had our first campaign to start this disruption in October 2017, we were overwhelmed by support from all over the world. The successes we gained have shown our vision has not gone unnoticed. Prior to its launch we shared the challenges and difficulties we faced in raising the finances that are required to build a new weaving mill and this is why we sought support via Kickstarter. With over 850 backers in the first campaign, we not only made new friends but we also broke down many of the financial barriers that existed in Scotland for the textiles industry.With our pop-up mill due to be operational in March 2018, it will facilitate on site tartan design services, cloth manufacturing and bespoke finished product manufacturing all under one Highland roof. Initially we will be weaving with traditional boat shuttle looms relocated from around the UK, looms that date back to the early 20th Century. We will also have a product manufacturing workshop that will be the creative hub, where we will make the most stunning tartan products, from show stopping fashion pieces to the most sought after interior design essentials. It will be in the pop-up mill that your tartan rewards will be made with Highland passion, but be assured, when the time comes to move into the Black House Mill we will move all our operations home. We extend our heartfelt thanks for the overwhelming support we received from around the world during our first campaign. Each and every backer touched our hearts and have inspired us to continue with this uprising.With this next step, wewould love all to stay with us, and of course welcome all new rebels to join the cause. Webelieve this uprising is something worth fighting for and invite you all to be part of the crowd that changed the history of Scotland.We will also commit to ensuring that all of our Kickstarter supporters are invited to the Black House Mill grand opening. On the day we'll have a true Highland Fling which we hope will mark an important time in history, with the most important people all being there!In return for your support we wanted to make sure you are rewarded with limited edition one off luxury gifts and keepsakes that exude the ethos of the Highland brand we are creating.Exclusively designed by Prickly Thistle, these are all created from available local raw materials and brought to life through highly skilled craftsmanship - all based in the Scottish Highlands.As well as your reward, all of our build the mill founders will be entered into our Highland Register.

She is committed to protecting, preserving and promoting the industry for generations to come.

You can read more about Clare here.We have come back to Kickstarter because our first campaign was an incredible success despite us not reaching our initial target. We received pledges from over 850 people around the world, and many have asked us to not give up on our vision as they wish to continue to support us.This campaign has been set-up to kick start the capital funds we wish to raise over the next 12 months to build the Black House Mill on the Black Isle, Scotland.","We have now secured temporary manufacturing premises to operate the pop-up mill.  This is based in Evanton, 15 miles away from where our steading building and design studio are based on the Black Isle.  Our studio will be relocated to this new site in March 2018.Temporary manufacturing can be carried out for up to 5 years at this site.  We are aiming to secure the full funding required to build the Black House Mill to commence work in 2019, allowing us to relocate in early 2020.Our key challenge is raising the required funds through crowdfunding, sales and grant support during the next 24 months that enable us to build the Black House Mill.All tartan products listed in this campaign are guaranteed to be manufactured in the pop-up mill and delivered on time."

The intrigue unfolds through interviews with the characters closest to Vincent and through dramatic reconstructions of the events leading up to his death.Here are some stills from our concept trailer:Loving Vincent features over 120 of Vincent Van Gogh's greatest paintings. The plot, drawn from the 800 letters written by the painter himself, leads us to the significant people and events in the time leading up to his unexpected death. Vincent wrote in his last letter: “Well, the truth is, we cannot speak other than by our paintings”, and that is what we are doing- letting his paintings tell the story of what the painter had inside his heart, and ultimately, what happened to him.ALL OF THAT HAPPENS INSIDE OF YOUR FAVOURITE PAINTINGS!! Was it suicide, or was he shot? And if it was suicide, what would have led him to such a dramatic act, when he at last was gaining recognition for his work? Every film you see is actually a collection of still images, played back at a speed that makes it appear to be moving. In our film about Vincent Van Gogh, EVERY SINGLE ONE OF THESE individual images will be a painting in the style of Van Gogh. That means our 40 painters (which we will be able to train thanks to YOUR support) will create 56,800 PAINTINGS to make this film!! To make this possible OUR WONDERFUL TEAM created PAWS (Painted Animation Work Stations) that allows us to make the demanding process of stop-motion painting as efficient as possible, by allowing our artists to focus on the painting as opposed to the animation. In fact, over the past 18 months of R&D we've managed to halve the painting time of each frame, while maintaining the individuality of the painters. THIS IS WHAT ""PAWS"" LOOKS LIKE: Vincent Van Gogh is often cited as the father of modern art, and his painting Starry Night is regarded as the most famous painting of all time, after the Mona Lisa. He is known for struggling with mental illness and cutting off his left ear, and also for only ever selling one painting in his lifetime and for shooting himself at the age of 37. What isn't widely known is that Vincent only picked up a paintbrush a mere 8 years before his untimely death, after failed careers as first an art dealer, a book sales clerk and then a preacher. In his short career as a painter HE MANAGED TO PRODUCE AS MANY OR MORE paintings than great masters managed over careers spanning many decades. He went from being a jobless 29-year-old living in a barn in a poor mining area, having never picked up a paintbrush, to, at 37 years old, being proclaimed by one of Paris's (and therefore at the time the world's) most influential art critics as: ""a messiah, a sower of truth, who would regenerate the decrepitude of our art and perhaps our imbecile and industrialist society""IMPRESSED? WE WERE! The most important thing for us is to bring this really amazing story to life. We would like to SHARE with you our feelings on the work and life of this extraordinary and inspiring individual. We are an Oscar-winning animation studio (Founder Hugh Welchman won the Oscar for Best Short Animation for Peter and the Wolf). From the very beginning, our recipe for success has consisted of finding stories and ideas that passionately move us and then going further than anyone else would reasonably expect us to go to make them a unique and brilliant experience for the people watching them.

(example: If I'd like to get a DVD for 40 pounds and the VLogs access for 5 pounds; I just pledge 45 pounds)!Responding to many of your requests, we had decided to ADD a new reward to our campaign: A ""LOVING VINCENT"" - SPECIAL KICKSTARTER LIMITED EDITION DVD! It will include the movie itself, both with full of special bonus videos, produced during the production process and A SPECIAL THANKS VIDEO from the Producer and the Director of the movie!!The video is available as a separate reward and it's also included AS A BONUS in all the rewards ""+150 GBP"". If you want the DVD, but you had already pledged less; you can always add to your pledge the amount of ""+40 GBP"" to get your chosen award AND DVD...ATTENTION! We had previously only included rewards that we knew we could deliver, if the Kickstarter campaign is a success, and completion of the film is definitely down the road once financing is raised. However, due to your requests, we have chosen to include THE LIMITED EDITION KICKSTARTER DVD as a reward, as so many of you had requested it... but YOU SHOULD BE AWARE that this reward is a bit risky, as it is going to be delivered after the production of the movie is over, so in case the film doesn't get made, we unfortunately won't be able to deliver it. To cut a long story short - if you pledge for this reward, you do it at your own risk. We do believe we are close to gathering the production financing, but until everything is signed, on the dotted line can't guarantee that it will.------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------You can find out more about the project here:WWW : www.lovingvincent.comFacebook : www.facebook.com/lovingvincentmovieYouTube :http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r3LSfvcmrf0IMDb :http://www.imdb.com/title/tt3262342/Over the year since we’ve announced the project, the press and bloggers all over the world have been writing about ""Loving Vincent""!

But there’s no guarantee that we can raise the rest of the money to begin production. And that’s where YOUR support comes in!

Setting up microphones in front of his acoustic piano, connecting cables, setting up sound cards and recording software simply took too long.Before leaving his job to make Mikme, Philipp was a software engineer and product manager at AKG—the legendary Austrian microphone and headphone manufacturer— for 8 years.Together, withJosef Scheider (former Head of Mechanical Design at AKG),Alex Pohl(leaddesigner) Richard Pribyl(former lead acoustic engineer at AKG) andKat Earnshaw (designer) we brought this project to life.Mikme is a passionate team of 15 designers, musicians and engineers who have built successful, world-class audio products such as studio microphones and headphones, wireless microphones and Bluetooth speakers for companies such as AKG, JBL, Samsung, Audi, BMW and others.In sum we hold 80+ patents and 40+ design awards.Design and engineering take place in Austria, Germany, Netherlands, Serbia and the USA.

Unforeseen things sometimes happen, but we are convinced that we can start manufacturing the first series in April 2015.The biggest risk eliminator is the minimum-order-quantity. This is why we need funding of more than $217.000. Every additional cent makes it safer.

With some experience and time, we've learned what is important and have already built a solid production line.We manufacture in Germany with the highest attention to detail.Mikme Pocket is 90% identical with the original Mikme Microphone and we can reuse lots of things such as 90% of the electronics, the same ATE (measurement stuff in the production), production tools and processes which ultimately makes the production ramp-up process much smoother and less risky.Also, the software running on the Mikme Pocket, the Mikme OS, is 95% identical with the Mikme Microphone, and the Mikme App can be reused completely.We have found reliable partners when it comes to shipping.We have built and tested about 25 pre-production models of the Mikme Pocket and send them to customers around the world to test them in the past months.Injection molds are finished and we already have the final housing part ready as well as the final working electronics.The biggest risk is the final certification of the device for CE and FCC. But we already did a pre-certification and passed it. So we are on a good path to deliver products to backers."

Scans will retain all of the patina and detail of the now 40+ year old document. This includes any defects in the original printing, in order to be most faithful to the original.BindingWhile the original was bound in a three ring binder, the reproduction will be case-bound (hardcover) in cloth, by artisan inspired binders in Canada. The cover will feature a design inspired by the original manual, screen printed in 5 colours on blue cloth following the standards outlined in the 1974 manual itself.PrintingEach scanned page image will be reproduced at 100% actual size in full CMYK colour using a 10-micron stochastic printing process (equivalent to around 650-line screen), with vegetable-based inks on bright white, archival quality #80 text substrate. Each page will be arranged exactly as it appears in the original document. Pantone swatch pages will be reproduced in CMYK as scanned, to preserve their appearance as it is today.Below is the expected project timeline, as you can see we are on track for shipping in July 2017:Details:- Hand numbered, Limited Edition- Original Artwork: Burton Kramer- Size: 46cm x 61xm (18 x 24 inches) - 3 colour serigraph- 100% cotton stock- UnframedI'm excited to offer a unique art poster designed specifically for this campaign. The artwork is based off of a book cover designed by Burton Kramer for Canada's 28th Parliament (1968-1972) — see the campaign updates for an image of the original book.Those familiar with Canadian history will recognize that the 28th parliament is when the late Honourable Pierre Elliott Trudeau first formed government. The original artwork for the book cover designed by Burton Kramer (now in Canada's national archives) features a maple leaf formed from thick and thin vertical lines of red and blue. As a graphic it's quite striking and as an art poster it will make a decidedly noted addition to your wall:My name is Adrian Jean, a Canadian graphic designer and creative director.I have grown a fascination with the highly prescriptive and deliberately structured world of identity design and more specifically of mid-century Swiss-influenced graphic work.Over the years I became actively involved in my national professional association (GDC) where I was able to connect with national and international design communities. That experience sparked a growing curiosity about Canada's design heritage.This project is my way of helping today's generation of designers connect to and learn from Canada's design heritage, as well as honour the work of Mr. Kramer and celebrate an identity that has become part of Canadian culture, yet recognized around the world.I hope you agree that this project is worthwhile, and pledge your support for it today.I want to personally thank Mr. Kramer for lending me one of his only remaining original copies of the 1974 CBC Graphic Standards Manual for this project, and for the wonderful conversations and encouragement that ensued.I want to thank Arlene Gehmacher and the Royal Ontario Museum for preserving this important piece of design heritage, and supporting this project in principle.I want to also thank CBC/Radio-Canada for their openness, curiosity, support and authorization to proceed with this project.I also want to thank the thousands of people from around the world who showed their support during the petition to rally support to bring this project to the CBC's attention — we are here on Kickstarter today because of you and your interest!","With almost 20 years experience as a designer I have a clear command of what it takes to get a project like this done, as well as access to the resources to do it well.I am already working with a respected and established Canadian printer with a strong track record in high quality printing and while I don't expect any issues, I have padded the timeline to account for unexpected challenges."

THIN: The final design of the bracelet will only add a few millimetres to the thickness of the FreeStyle Libre sensor, making it very comfortable to wear even under tight garments.EASY TO USE: It will be configurable using our intuitive App, already trusted by over 3000 families.RELIABLE: Our customizable alarm system has been available to the public since December 2016, and our families continue to rely on our GNW App, as it has proven to be reliable detecting and alerting alarm conditions day and night.CONVENIENT AND MONEY-SAVING: Our aim is to produce a robust, long lasting product using high quality materials. The bracelet will use an internal rechargeable battery compatible with USB chargers. It will even act as a shield protecting your FreeStyle Libre sensor avoiding the need to replace the sensor due to accidental detachments.WEAR IT 24 x 7, ALL DAY, ALL NIGHT: Our current battery tests already deliver 2 days of autonomy but we will try to push the limits to deliver a product you can wear all the time without even thinking that you are wearing it.DISCREET: Blood sugar level readings can be seen directly on your phone, so no need to swipe a device over the FSL sensor anymore.SECURE: The data sent from the GlucoSentry bracelet will be signed and encrypted, ensuring the privacy and authenticity of your readings.IT JUST LOOKS COOL: Thanks to its interchangeable fabric bands and its sleek futuristic look you can match your style, or make it attractive to your teenager or small child with themed bands. We have lots of ideas for styles and themes but we want to hear from you.Our mobile application GlucoNightWatch was born a year ago, it was conceived to meet the needs of some close friends, whose 9 years old daughter had developed Type 1 diabetes.They had searched without success for an alarm system to help them reducing the risk of nocturnal hypoglycemia going undetected, as they were waking up every two hours to check glucose levels, but the available products didn’t provide a solution to their problem.We ended up developing the free App GlucoNightWatch, an application for Android phones capable of periodically logging readings from the Abbott’s FreeStyle Libre blood glucose sensors using the NFC interface, and generating alarms sent to other phones for situations configured by the user.If you are interested, you can find more information about how we started in our blog.The App was a true success, since we launched thousands of families have benefited from it, and we have received a lot of heartfelt messages of gratitude from parents all around the world.However, although it has been a success, we believe that its adoption has been limited by the need to wear a mobile phone directly over the FreeStyle Libre sensor, as even with the smallest phones this can be bulky and uncomfortable.Ten months ago, we decided to start developing a bracelet that could read the glucose levels from the FreeStyle Libre sensor and communicate via Bluetooth to the mobile phone.We believe that this was the right approach to make the solution more accessible, it also allowed us to develop the GlucoNightWatch App to be compatible with both Android and Iphone devices.The combined solution of bracelet and mobile app will be more comfortable to wear and more reliable for collection of data from the sensor, and will continue to benefit from our simple to use, proven and reliable App.We already have a working prototype, and now we want to reduce its size and integrate it into an easy to wear band that can be comfortably worn all day and all night, a consumer grade product that will be a true guardian of your diabetes.We are a small team of professionals with a background in diverse technology areas related to telecommunications and IT.

They work fast and they save lives. Arriving home after each tour, their struggle becomes reconciling the persistent memory of war with that of everyday life in America.In 2011, Journalist and Director Harry Sanna was embedded with a Blackhawk medevac unit in Afghanistan. Living for several weeks with the unit, he captured unprecedented and unfiltered access to the rush and chaos of their mission. After the completion of their deployment, Sanna followed the team members home, recording their lives and thoughts in the years since their return with an intimacy and access only afforded to a member of the unit.This film tells the very important story of these people who risked their lives saving those fighting for their country overseas. Now these people are trying to get on with their ordinary lives after the glory and trauma of their military experience. Films like Trauma are rare. When we can all can witness the extraordinary experiences of our military heroes and understand the sacrifice that they have made both on the battlefield and in their everyday lives,  we can ensure that we as a nation take care of the people who have fought for us.We have shot all the footage - hundreds of hours of incredible material shot in Afghanistan and across the United States. But unless we can raise the money to hire an editor and cut it all together, no one will get to see the film. So we need your help!Song by Linda Draper - ""Hollow""What’s the plan?If we can raise a minimum of $50,000 through this Kickstarter campaign, we will use the money to hire a top-grade documentary editor to work their magic and complete a principle cut of the film.

Extra funds will be carefully allocated between sound/music and the graphics and animation that will help us to communicate the complexities of the story. The greater the funding, the greater our ability to maximize the benefit of all the services already donated. Every additional dollar over the 50,000 minimum goal will have an exponential benefit to the film.

https://www.kickstarter.com/projects/artofhoshikage/kamiyomoji-calligraphy-art?ref=discovery_category_newest,artofhoshikage/kamiyomoji-calligraphy-art,"Hello, everyone! I'm Japanese Artist, Tsukiyo Hoshikage.The project that I would like to share with you this time is ""Kamiyomoji Kotodama Calligraphy Art"". It is calligraphy art of the ancient Japanese characters called Kamiyomoji along with the use of other forms of traditional Japanese arts such as Kotodama, Haiku/Waka/Senryu, and Sumi-e, etc. Because of the beliefs and philosophy behind them, it makes the concept of this project very unique, the messages that the artworks give out are very positive and inspirational to everyone at the same time. While it gives out an opportunity to be more familiar with Japanese (Asian) cultures by enjoying a visual side of the project, people can actually enjoy learning how to write their own names by themselves in a prayer of happiness for yourself and loved ones. Through those experiences as well as learning the concepts of the project, people can not only enjoy the difference between Eastern & Western cultures, but also can find something in common as well. I think that is wonderful, and therefore, I do believe it is worth sharing with many people as possible, and is worth your support as well. Now, I am honestly feeling that this project is something that I can put all my heart into for a long time from now.Regarding the stage of this project, I have to tell you, including expressions of my works it is still work in progress. So, I would like you to see its potential as well. My basic concept for my art-making is mixture of the Old & New, the East & West. If you could take a look at my portfolio, from the variety of works of my art, you would understand what I mean. Therefore, although the works of this project look a lot like traditional Simi-e water color paintings at this moment, I am also planning to add digital effect to this project.Lastly, here I am, simply asking you for support to restart my art-career with this project. For my personal reasons, I put my art career on hold for several years after I came back to Japan. During that time, my computer broke down and I lost all of my art-related software and new unsaved works at that time. Now I am planning to start the service of writing the names in Kamiyomoji and make it available on the internet. I would like to set up the environment where I can focus on art-making & its promotion. I would like to you to help me on that part.I would really appreciate it if you could read through the stories behind this project, and then decide to be a part of it or not!Meaning of the message: Like the gentle light pouring from the full moon, my gratitude for you can not be contained within myself....About MeI am originally from a small island in Ehime prefecture which is located in south western part of Japan. I was there until graduating from high school, and moved to NYC at the age 20. After receiving art educations at several art schools in NYC, I worked as a freelance artist for about 15 years. My art works have received several awards and shown at galleries in NYC and some magazines. (Please visit my portfolio site for more details)Art of Hoshikage Portfolio SiteIn 2012, I permanently moved back to Japan for my family matters and decided to put my art-career on hold for a while. In the meantime, I traveled around the country visiting many places, while I adjust myself with life in Japan again.For me who was emotionally, physically and spiritually exhausted at that time, traveling gave me a a lot of comfort and healing, and helped me rediscover the beauty of Japanese cultures, especially old & traditional ones. I fell in love with Ukiyoe and Kimomo patterns all over again, got a new hobby of visiting shrines and temples now.Stories Behind The ProjectAs I visit many places, I noticed something very interesting, which is, many of Japanese cultures are strongly connected to the oldest Japanese history books, ""Kojiki"" and ""Nihonshoki"". Although they are academically considered as history books, the stories there are considered more as myths because of the lots of mystical, miraculous contents of it. As a matter of fact, many stories from the books are still told as fairytales to children in Japan. What was fascinating to me is the fact that the deities who show up in the books are still worshipped at the many Shinto shrines in Japan, and the Japanese first emperor was also born from the blood lines. As you know, still many people, not only Japanese but the people from all over the world enjoy visiting Japanese shrines. It has definitely become a part of our way of life. Also, considering the fact that the religion Shinto is strongly connected with Imperial household, I am not religious myself, but I can not deny that traditional Japanese cultures has a lot of religious and spiritual aspects of it. And then, in the process of learning Japanese old cultures, I also learned the existence of several ancient Japanese characters, called ""Kamiyomoji"". (At this point, I know there are 4 kinds. ) It is said that they were used in the era long before the current Japanese characters, Hiragana, Katakana, and Kanji were used, when Japanese deities ruled the land. Because of that, they are called ""Kamiyomoji"" which means ""the characters of god era"" in Japanese, and also it is often considered that they possess mysterious spiritual power. And for me, one of the Kamiyomoji characters called Akiru character and its unique and artistic form of it grabbed my heart. I totally fell in love with it.So, as I practiced writing Kamiyomoji in Japanese calligraphy, I also came up with the idea of combining with other traditional Japanese art forms such as Kotodama, Haiku/Waka/Senryu, and Sumi-e...etc. I believe combining them all together into the one place makes this project very unique and one of a kind.For your information, I will explain a little bit about Kotodama, Haiku/Waka/Senryu, and Sumi-e as well.""Kotodama"" --When ""Kotodama"" is written in Chinese Characters, its direct meaning would be ""Spirit of the Word"". When you look into it in a English dictionary, it says ""The words with miraculous powers"". As you can probably imagine, I think its concept is similar to ""affirmations"" in Western cultures. When you say positive words, you attract positive outcome, etc... In Japan, it is believed that certain words such as ""Arigatou(Thank You)"" carries more powers than other words. It is important that you say those words aloud even though you don't really mean it. ""Kotodama"" has a long history, and it is said that every person who was born in the bloodline of imperial family receive the education of Kotodama philosophy. It is not only from the philosophical or spiritual point of views, actually, certain words are proven to affect the tension or strength of body muscles instantly and make differences in human actions. I often use those words in the message on the artworks.""Haiku/Waka/Senryu"" -- As many of you probably know, they are short forms of poetry, with the rhythm of 5 • 7 • 5( • 7 • 7). Especially ""Haiku"" is widely spread to the world, many people enjoy creating it and share with others regardless of difference of language or cultures. What many people may not know is its history and sacred meaning of it, which is, the message of Omikuji (fortune-telling-paper-strip that you can get at Japanese shrines) was initially only written in the form of Waka as messages from god. So, some believe that the rhythm of 5 • 7 • 5( • 7 • 7) is sacred, and writing the words with the rhythm could be considered as your prayer to gods.""Sumi-e"" -- It is a popular asian art form with a long history. It is a water color painting method using Sumi-ink (charcoal black ink). To me, the part that uses Sumi-Ink is very important. Sumi is charcoal. And, charcoal is actually a very interesting substance. For examples, when a child swallowed a coin by mistakes, doctor often makes the child drink charcoal liquid because it absorbs toxins from the coin. In Japan, we use charcoal in order to erase odors of shoes, some people put charcoal into a rice cooker in order to make the rice more tasty. And spiritually, charcoal-black is believed to absorb negativity as well, that is why it works with Shakyou (transcribing sutras) perfectly.In order for you to see the potential of this project with the use of digital images, here is one of my digital collage artworks.I hope many of you who visit this page agree that this project is worth sharing with the world, and help me re-start my art career with it.Thank you very much for your time and support! May all the good things come to you and your loved ones!!Best regards,Tsukiyo HoshikageP.S. Since I didn't include the images of reward, here are some examples of what you would receive.","As explained in the product description, the amount of the fund is for initial cost to start this project professionally. As the breakdowns of the fund, two third will go to computer equipment, such as a computer with enough memory & speed, adobe software (at least Illustrator and Photoshop), a scanner, and a professional printer for reproductions which will be available through the internet. And the rest will be for quality papers and brushes for calligraphy, the initial costs to create my site and shop on the internet and also for internet marketing. Since I have experiences of running art-business on the internet, once I have the fund, it would not be too hard to re-create the environment needed. I don't mind starting small and make it expand little by little.  Therefore, my challenge will be how I can manage my time, energy, and money for this project in a long run. But, as long as I have faith in this project, I believe that I can handle any challenges that might come along the way.",https://www.kickstarter.com/projects/artofhoshikage/kamiyomoji-kotodama-calligraphy-art?ref=discovery_category_newest,artofhoshikage/kamiyomoji-kotodama-calligraphy-art,"⬇️　I am very sorry for the bad video.

You would be able to get the picture of how it is done there and understand the reason for my intention for the workshop & publishin ideas a little more clearly.I am planning to start the service to write names in Kamiyomoji and make it available on the internet. As I said earlier, Kamiyomoji is believed to possess supernatural powers since it was used in the era when Japanese deities ruled the land. So, when your own name is written in Kamiyomoji, it represents your soul or higher-self, which helps you to bring out your highest potential, and help you live your life in fullest. Even if you don't believe any of those things, still it would be a great one of a kind artwork to look at it. Actually, when I first introduced this idea, I did receive great response. Many people seemed to want it not only for themselves but also for their loved ones. So I am very excited about it.That is why I chose ""Your Name in Kamiyomoji"" to be included in my Thank-You reward for the backers. Please take a look at the reward section for examples of what you would receive once you become a backer for the project. Here are some of example images that you receive as your thank-you rewards:These are 3 separate digital images (4""x6"") which you can print on whatever paper you like.I set the longer duration for this campaign. I will add more images as updates later.So, please follow the campaign for the update new.Lastly, as for my own works, I am also planning to add more digital effect to this project. Some of you who have seen my works from my previous campaign (which I failed by the way!) may already notice, I have already started it. :-) So, it would be much more like my motto for my works, the mixture of the Old & New, the East & West. I would like to set up the new working environment where I can focus on art-making & its promotion, by adding more professional equipments including new computer, scanner, printer, and all other accessaries. I would appreciate it if you could help me on that part as well. In order for you to see the potential of this project with the use of digital images, here are the examples of my digital collage artworks.I really hope many of you who visit this page agree that this project is worth sharing with the world, and help me achieve my dreams.Again, thank you all so much for your time and support you have shown me already for reading this till the end! May great fortune be with you and your loved ones always! :-)Best regards,Tsukiyo Hoshikage~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~P.S. Sorry to be at the last minute update: When you make a pledge on ¥2000-Your Name in Kamiyomoji, each additional print with a different (or the same) name on it is ¥1000. each additional print (just print without your name in Kamiyomoji) is ¥700. But, one pledge = one address please. Which means, no matter how many prints you order, all prints ship to the one same address. Since this is basically a thank-you reward, please calculate it by yourself and be responsible with your final pledge amount. Thank you so much for your support!!","My first obstacle to overcome for the project is my working environment. I would like to approach this project from more professionally in every way. I don't mind starting small, but still want to keep the professional level as possible. That way, I could create my work more freely in a way I want."

Since we're always on the move, we want to enjoy our music on the go. When you want to enjoy all the details in a song, there are two ways to go: pump up the volume, or cancel the noise around us. Since we value our hearing, we chose to develop noise cancelling headphones.We wanted everything: high-end digital noise cancellation technology, the secure fit and durability of sport headphones, and a long battery life without adding weight to the neck or in the pocket.After looking at the market, we figured the best way to get what you want is to build it.  After several iterations, we developed Enclave Headphones. The Enclavehas a combination of features you normally wouldn't find without paying a premium price tag:Most noise-cancelling headphones in the market use analog circuitry, which is pre-set to cancel noise in a specific frequency bandwidth all the time, regardless of environment. However, the noise profile of an office is not the same as that of the plane.Most noise-cancelling headphones in the market use analog circuitry, which is pre-set to cancel noise in a specific frequency bandwidth all the time, regardless of environment. However, the noise profile of an office is not the same as that of the plane.This leads to less than optimum results, so weopted to use a more sophisticated digital circuitry. Digital circuitry uses a special chip called the DSP (digital signal processor) to adapt the noise cancellation to the environment. Though working with this circuitry is more costly, we feel that the improved noise cancellation quality is worth it.Even more than noise cancellation, your music enjoyment depends on sound quality.

Since we're always on the move, we want to enjoy our music on the go. When you want to enjoy all the details in a song, there are two ways to go: pump up the volume, or cancel the noise around us. Since we value our hearing, we chose to develop noise cancelling headphones.We wanted everything: high-end digital noise cancellation technology, the secure fit and durability of sport headphones, and a long battery life without adding weight to the neck or in the pocket. After looking at the market, we figured the best way to get what you want is to build it.After several iterations, we developed Enclave Headphones. The Enclave is engineered with world-class noise cancelling technology, and a potent set of features that cannot be found elsewhere at this price point:With just one click, the rest of the world melts away. Noise cancelling technology continuously measures outside noise, and cancels it with a sends an opposing signal that is 180° out of phase. The end result is total immersion: just you and your music with nothing in your way. Most noise-cancelling headphones in the market use analog circuitry, which is pre-set to cancel noise in a specific frequency bandwidth all the time, regardless of environment. However, the noise profile of an office is not the same as that of the plane. This leads to less than optimum results, so we opted to use a more sophisticated digital circuitry. Digital circuitry uses a special chip called the DSP (digital signal processor) to adapt the noise cancellation to the environment. Though working with this circuitry is more costly, we feel that the improved noise cancellation quality is worth it.Even more than noise cancellation, your music enjoyment depends on sound quality. For lifelike sound, we’ve equipped the enclave with 13mm high performance drivers to give you crisp audio and reproduce a full range of frequencies up to 40kHz.Sometimes, you just want to enjoy your music without all the noise around you. To do that, you turn up the volume to drown out the outside world. However, doing that for long periods can cause irreparable damage to the ears.

The earbuds are angled to fit the ear canal perfectly, and the hook design ensures that it will stay on for your toughest workouts.We designed the Enclave for freedom: It can last 5 hours without a bulky battery box, so you can move unhindered. Unlike many designs in the market, the wire exits from the back of your ear, so it stays out of your way.The Enclave is also built with corrosion-resistant sweatproof materials, so you can push yourself as hard as you want without worrying about your headphones.All the functions are easy to access, giving you full control of your tracks, calls, and music volume while you run.

https://www.kickstarter.com/projects/limpkin/opencvmeter-rediscover-your-capacitors?ref=discovery_category_newest,limpkin/opencvmeter-rediscover-your-capacitors," When designing circuits, many hobbyists take capacitors for granted - but each type (ceramic multi-layer, aluminum electrolytic, tantalum, mica...) has its own unique properties. Nowadays, ceramic capacitors are the most commonly used capacitors in the industry, but many can lose up to 80% of their rated capacitance near their voltage ratings.Enter the OpenCVMeter! This meter aims to provide aCapacitance versus Voltagecharacterization accurate within 1%of the capacitors for your next project (or already have and are starting to wonder about right now...)There are many scenarios where capacitance is critical to the correct functioning of the circuit:In some cases, a lower than specified capacitance may lead to sporadic hardware bugs, or in the extreme, a non-working device. The OpenCVMeter will give you the information you need to ensure this doesn't happen in your next prototype !The OpenCVMeter can also measure currents up to 12.4uA with a resolution of 6nA,which can be extremely useful when designing ultra low power devices.For example, you could use the OpenCVMeter to verify that all your passive components (TVS diodes, electrolytic capacitors...) adhere to their leakage specifications - and ensure your device has maximumbattery life.The OpenCVMeter doesn't need any drivers and works right out of the box with your Windows, Linux or Mac computer. You will be able to:For the past few months, several beta testers have been using our application. Their feedback ensured that the software provides maximum functionality and works as intended. This application is simply installed via the Chrome App Store.The OpenCVMeter case is made from grey anodized machined aluminum, giving it a nice professional look. The above picture is a prototype of the final design.  The final design will incorporate a silkscreen logo with polarity markings. The OpenCVMeter has two standard banana sockets, so you can hook it up any way you like. For good measure, it will be shipped with the following accessories to get you started:All of our source code is already available for download in our official GitHub repository. The hardware files will be added to the repository once the campaign is complete.So you want to know the nitty-gritty?Here are the advanced technical specifications of the OpenCVMeter:","I have already briefed the hardware assembler (whom I've worked with for the past 4 years on a variety of projects) in preparation for a mass production run. Two OpenCVMeter prototype batches have already been produced, and I am confident that the assembly process will go smoothly.Of course, there's always the possibility that something might upset our schedule, but rest assured that I'll do our best to get your hardware delivered on-time and keep you informed every step of the way!",https://www.kickstarter.com/projects/limpkin/mooltipass-mini-your-passwords-on-the-go?ref=discovery_category_newest,limpkin/mooltipass-mini-your-passwords-on-the-go,"(Update: Stretch Goals can be found hereand on the ""Updates"" tab)Our online lives are always expanding and along with new territory come new usernames and passwords... leading us to experience security fatigue. The Mooltipass Mini is designed to help you keep all of your passwords secure, while still leaving them easy for you to access no matter where you need them.Whether you're looking to improve your existing password management methods, or just starting to explore how to manage them all, the Mini has something for you! The Mini connects to any USB-capable device (phone, tablet, computer, etc). To use it, all you need to do is insert your personal smartcard, unlock it with your PIN, and start using your device. You'll be able to log in anywhere with a quick tap on the desk or a few tweaks of the scroll wheel!Here's a quick overview of its features: Excellent question! If you browse the Internet regularly, you have no doubt amassed a healthy assortment of accounts for various sites and services you use daily, monthly, or even once in a blue moon.Do you have no problem remembering all of your unique and different passwords for those services without using something to help you remember them, not to mention each site's differing password requirements? OK, then maybe the Mini isn't something you need... but wouldn't it be awesome if there was a device that could remember all of your passwords for you? The Mini can help with that!Do You Use Something Else to Store Your Passwords?Many people use software tools to store and organize their passwords. That's a great first step, but consider what happens if a piece of particularly nasty malware compromises your computer. It can steal your password database, and the next time you use it to log in to a website, it can also steal your master password. We're not kidding, in fact, something similar happened to a well-known password vault. Since we decouple the decryption key from your computer, it becomes much harder for a malicious program to make off with all of your account information.Do You Use the Same Password (or a Set of Similar Passwords) in Multiple Places?Well, you've certainly solved the problem of remembering your passwords... but have you considered what happens if one of those services is compromised and your password is stolen? An attacker now knows the email address you used to register for the service - and if it has the same password, chances are he can now access a lot of information about you... for example:Hopefully you haven't used the same password for any of those services... but don't forget many services will email you a password reset link.With all of this information at their fingertips, a malicious person can easily take control of your online life!OK, So You Used a Different Password for Your Email Address... But What About the Password Reset Questions?Many people's accounts are compromised because they did nothing more than choose security questions to which the answers are easily guessed or can be found elsewhere online. Your high school, or mother's maiden name? Perhaps those can be found on your Facebook account or LinkedIn profile... You can even have the Mini remember some obscure answers to security questions for you!As You Can See, the Strength of Your Security is Only as Strong as the Weakest Part.As cliché as the information is, the only way to ensure your accounts stay secure are to use unique and complex passwords for each one - and thus we come full circle to the first paragraph of this section. That's why we created the Mooltipass and Mooltipass Mini - to make it easy to start (or continue) good security practices for all of your online accounts. It can even help you out by generating long, complex, random passwords anytime you create a new account somewhere or wish to change an existing password.Not hard at all -we created cross platform browser plugins to add all kinds of features, like automatic detection of login forms, adding/creating/updating credentials, and even adding them to a favorites list on the device for quick access. Just plug it in, unlock it with your smartcard, and start using your computer. You can evenknock on the table to approve credentials requests !Our Chrome extension and App have been used for nearly 2 years now, and we are currently testing our newly developed extension for Firefox.You can also use the Mooltipass Mini on any computer, tablet, smartphone, or any other device that can support a USB keyboard. Then you can just unlock your Mini and select which credentials you'd like to send to the device - no drivers required, and it doesn't matter whether it's Windows, Mac OS, Linux, Android, etc...We've had extensive discussions on the user interface with our beta testers, and the end result is something everyone has found easy to use.  The Mooltipass mini has the same security as its larger brother - namely: The Mooltipass Mini was designed with our users in mind. Many of them commented that the larger version wasn't quite as portable as we'd originally thought. Based on their feedback, we shrank it down to only79 x 37 x 12 mm. We also halved the size of the smartcards in order to keep the unit small and unobtrusive when in use.As economical as plastic enclosures can be, our team felt they just weren't right for the Mini. After some experimentation and a test batch of aluminium enclosures, all of our beta testers fell in love with the metal design. Not only does it look awesome, but it's also far more scratch-resistant than a plastic enclosure - and that's a pretty big plus for something you would carry around a lot.To maximize portability and utility, there are a few additional features we'd like to share:Scroll WheelTouch interfaces tend to need a lot of space to work well. Instead, the mini sports a compact, clickable scroll wheel as its main navigation mechanism.Ambidextrous UseSince the Mini fits so easily in one hand, it can be configured to work with the scroll wheel either on the right, or on the left, whichever you find most comfortable.AccelerometerDon't want to hold it in your hand? No problem, you can use it hands-free! If it is unlocked and you visit a website with stored credentials, you can simply tap on your desk to confirm that you wish to log in.   Mass producing a new product is not inexpensive. We've already done much of the pre-production work, but the final production run is where the Kickstarter campaign comes in. We need your help to fund the fabrication of a large batch of devices, so that we can get them into the hands of anyone that wants one.Some of the work we've already done includes:As you can see, we are well on our way, but we still need your help to make it over the final hurdle. We hope we can count on your support, if you still have questions after browsing the information on this page, please don't hesitate to contact us! We'll be glad to clear up any confusion or answer questions that aren't detailed here.If we hit Fr. 70,000, you will be able to choose from one of these four colors for your Mooltipass Minis: black, dark grey, light grey, or gold. What's more, this finish will be anodized, so you don't need to worry about it scratching, chipping, or peeling like a painted surface. if we reach Fr. 100,000, we'll make it hold TWICE as many passwords (that is, over 3000), by upgrading the flash chip from 4Mbit to 8Mbit... That's a lot of passwords!We're also looking at whether it's possible to implement small file storage on the mini. Unfortunately we can't make any guarantees on when we'll get this bit done, since it requires some work and coordination in a few different areas... but we'll do our best. A little extra bonus feature as our thanks, if you will. Why? Well, some secrets aren't passwords... things like encryption keys, tokens, or any other small bit of info that is important enough to protect, but doesn't fit within the standard Mooltipass password storage.If we make this goal, we'll give you an additional three anodized color choices for your mini: blue, green, and magenta. That brings the total choices up to seven!Why the strange number? Well, it's not far from the second stretch goal, and this isn't a major change on top of already offering color choices, just a little extra in the way of logistics for us.The Mini's design doesn't allow for adding a lanyard hole without significant design changes, but we've found what we believe to be the next-best thing - a lanyard that attaches to the micro-USB port. Fortunately, the Mini is small and light enough that this is a viable option - so we're thrilled to announce it as our fourth stretch goal at Fr. 145,000. We're already well on our way there, which is fantastic!(Yes, the keen-eyed will notice the image above is a mock-up. Samples of the real thing are on their way from a supplier and we'll give you a genuine photo of the result when we've got them in our hands... but we didn't want to wait for those to arrive to announce the stretch goal!)Our team believes that great security can only be achieved through complete transparency. That's why we have been publishing everything that goes into making the Mooltipass on our GitHub repository from the project's start.Just like Linux-based operating systems, open source allows our product to benefit from many engineers' expertise. This results in better code quality, more trust from our final users and verified security implementation. We publish everything we do to provide you with the best possible security device.The core Mooltipass team is located in Switzerland, but we have many volunteers and contributors from all around the world. The Mooltipass is truly a global effort, and we're incredibly proud of what we've accomplished with our team of contributors and their wide variety of skill-sets and backgrounds. We often think that the devices and websites we use are exempt of security flaws. You may see if one of your accounts is part of the 1.5 billion that have already been compromised by visiting thiswebsite.We also compiled a brief list of major security breaches and vulnerabilities found during the last few months:","The Mooltipass project has been ongoing since 2014, and the Mini has been under development since not long after the original campaign concluded. The core team from the Mooltipass product is still at the helm, bringing all of their experience and knowledge from before, in addition to the things we learned the first time around.Just like before, we've already produced several batches of beta units and circulated them to 50 eager beta testers around the globe. We've been working with them and listening to their feedback to improve the product for the last 6 months.As mentioned, we already know our components manufacturers and product assemblers in Shenzhen from the original campaign, and some members have actually been working with them for more than 3 years on other electronic projects.As much as we'd like to guarantee a smooth production run without hiccups, there will always be unpredictable events that may arise when producing large quantities of an item. Rest assured that we will do our best to keep you informed for the duration of the project, and until you have your device in your hands!"
https://www.kickstarter.com/projects/rudolfrubin/the-motor-surrealism-art-collection?ref=discovery_category_newest,rudolfrubin/the-motor-surrealism-art-collection,"My name is Rudolf Rubin, a visual artist since 30 years from Sweden.I would like your support, to give me the opportunity to create and exhibit my next collection of oil paintings.

Cocktail builders then started using the flavoured liquid sugar and eventually it found it's way into our coffee cups, now under the name ""coffee syrup"". Same product, just relabeled.I have designed flavours specifically tailored to coffee. Without sugar. But coffee syrup that is not sweet is a paradox. That's why this product is called Coffee Adder. With Coffee Adder you can choose exactly how sweet you want your coffee, and still enjoy the full aroma of the flavour. With Coffee Adder you can add as much sugar or sweetener as you want. Or not.Why settle for just caramel OR vanilla when you can have them both in a fabulous mix. And we all know how delicious apple pie or a cinnamon roll is with coffee. Now you can enjoy that without all those pesky calories. The amount of coffee adder flavours are virtually unlimited when you start blending different aromas.  I have discovered some truly wonderful blends that will make you forget all about those thick old coffee syrups!All Coffee Adder flavours come in a half liter/17 fl.oz. aluminium bottle with pump that will help you to get the right dosage and eliminate any mess on your countertop. The content is highly concentrated and will be sufficient for 100 cups (100 ml/3.4 fl.oz.) or 50 mugs (200 ml/6.8 fl.oz.) of coffee.Coffee Adders are:Coffee Adders will never contain:That's what we call coffee spiked with spirits in Sweden. Pour in Irish whiskey and you've got Irish coffee. Whatever you call it, coffee with a good whiskey, rum etc. is a great treat! It just gives your coffee that extra flavour dimension. It’s a great example of one good thing + one other good thing = :) :) :) And liquor blends very well with spices, fruit and/or pastry, making flavours to die for!So why wouldn't you use the good ol' booze instead of Coffee Adders, you might ask? There are two main reasons:With Coffee Adder you can drink and drive! Have a coffee with bourbon for breakfast and then drive to work. Another good thing is that although our Kaffe Kask flavours smell and taste like alcohol, your breath will not smell of alcohol after drinking them. A good thing once you arrive at work.The other thing iscost. As you only need to add one teaspoon of Coffee Adder into your cup of java, the bottle will last about 4 times longer than the ol' booze. And the cost of the Coffee Adder is only almost as high as the cheapest bourbon. Not to talk about the Single Malt Scotch whiskey!A classic American whiskey flavour. The smell is sweet and alcoholic with notes of vanilla, caramel and brown sugar. The taste is less sweet than the smell, smokey with notes of charred white oak, caramel, vanilla and with nuances of cinnamon.It has the complexity and characteristic bite of Scotch paired with a strong influence of smoked peat. Just as it should. Some love it, some just don't.It's impossible to describe the complex flavour of cognac but dried fruit and flowers are certainly present. The burning sensation from the alcohol is rather distinct. The only one way to grasp the aroma of cognac is to try it. Paired with it's edgy alcoholic flavour it works wonders with your coffee.Amaretto is Italian for ""a little bitter"" and this liqueur, that is so popular all over the world, with its bitter almond flavour, matches perfectly with the flavour of coffee. If you have never tried Amaretto, try to imagine brandy flavoured with marzipan, a bit of cherry and floral notes (rose water). And a little agreeable bitterness, serving to increase the depth of flavour.IMPORTANT! We are not using natural bitter almond since they contain cyanide (see more information here and here). Instead we use Benzaldehyde, which is the non-toxic compound that gives the flavour to bitter almonds. (Benzaldehyde was first extracted from bitter almonds in 1803 by the French pharmacist Martrès.)Triple Sec is fine rum flavoured with bitter Seville oranges. There are many popular Triple Secs, but perhaps the most famous is the french Remy Cointreau®. The bitterness in Seville oranges matches the bitterness in coffee like they where made for each other. The rum enhances the fruitiness of both the orange and the coffee.A perfect pair! The vanilla adds a tropic elegance and rounds off the sharp edges of the bourbon.A balanced and elegant match between the smooth chocolate and the fruity and edgy cognac. The cognac enhances the aromatic molecules in the chocolate, and the fat in chocolate smooths the sharp edges off the strong alcohol. It's a perfect marriage.Rum based with a rich, elegant vanilla scent steeped in floral nectar aroma, paired with notes of date and a smooth honeyed nuance. Lots of work and time went into this one to make it truly unique!Caramel is an extremely popular choice in coffee flavourings, I mean who doesn't love caramel? Caramel can also be added to almost any other flavour to give it an extra dimension. So how is caramel without sugar even possible?The scientific answer: just like all aroma flavourings, sugar is a hydrocarbon (made up of carbon, hydrogen and oxygen atoms). When heating sugar it melts down to a liquid form and turns a light brown colour. What happens is that more oxygen atoms from the surrounding air joins the party (oxidation) and the sugar molecules break down and produce several different compounds. The sugary, sweet taste is replaced by a more burnt, bitter flavour and fragrance. This reaction is named the ""Maillard reaction"" and it's the same reaction that makes a dough change to bread when you bake it in an oven.Simply put: it tastes caramel but not sweet. In traditional caramel coffee syrups, much more sugar is added afterwards. When you use Coffee Adders you can of course add a desired amount of sweetness to your coffee. Or not.Vanilla is another very popular flavour. Vanilla has a wonderful smell as well. Vanilla is popular because it is basic but adds a touch of elegance to everything it is added. It is also very useful to mix with other flavours to smooth out a pungent or sharp tang.Our Almond flavour is a well balanced mix between sweet and bitter almonds. A great companion to coffee.A deep, intense chocolate flavour for grown-ups. No milk and sugar!We have managed to produce a pure cinnamon flavour without the woody note!A divine combination!A tropical blend of two of the most cherished flavours in the world. And of course it's composed with our heavenly ""Cinnamon Royal"".A flavour combination loved all over the world!We all know what this Christmas treat taste like. But why only enjoy it once a year? When our ginger cookie treat comes without all the pesky calories!This is the most sophisticated nut-and-chocolate flavour!Coffee and cinnamon roll is an absolute favourite treat! A most delicious flavour combination including bread, butter, caramel and of course our Cinnamon Royal!The french variety of apple pie, Tarte Tatin, is our apple pie flavour. The idea of putting the apples on top is to get them to caramelize (the Mailard reaction again). It's an apple pie with the traditional flavours of both green and red apples, buttery, caramellic and crusty bread, and of course a touch of cinnamon.The flavours of almonds, caramel and rose water makes your coffee magic! The almond flavour is slightly bitter to embrace the bitterness of your coffee.This flavour is like having your birthday during Christmas!This is our ultimate ""All in"" flavour! Unforgettable!It all started when my dear wife offered me to try coffee syrup many years ago but I was stubbornly convinced that my coffee tasted perfectly fine as it was. Eventually I tried her coffee syrup just to please her. Although I liked the variation it gave my coffee, I found them all too sweet. I wanted more flavour and less sweetness.Thats when I started to develop my coffee flavour concept. A ""coffee syrup"" without sugar so that one could choose how sweet the coffee should be. And instead of sweetness I focused on making ithighly flavoured!I have since spent a long time researching, experimenting and letting my friends sample, to create flavours which are not just ""good"" but conjure emotions and perhaps even memories, like grandmas unforgettable apple pie or that first time you tasted bourbon. I love to combine fine essential oils with valuable aroma flavourings and spices, to make aromas that make people close their eyes and say ""aaaah"" and believing that what they have in their coffee is actually whiskey, rum etc.Doesn't it always feel good to introduce someone to something new and exciting?

Using their engineering skills and experience, the PFx Brick has evolved from a concept to a mature pre-production prototype.The aim of this Kickstarter campaign is to make the PFx Brick widely available to LEGO® fans everywhere by funding the effort to put the PFx Brick into volume production.Keep in touch with Fx Bricks at fxbricks.comCheckout this awesome PFx Brick showcase video made by one of our well-known beta testers, Sariel from Poland.  His feedback has been immensely valuable to our product development.Lights, sound, action; these three words perfectly summarize the essence of the PFx Brick. Never before have these capabilities been available on a single device, in such a small form factor, and designed specifically for LEGO® builders. That is, until now!For detailed specifications of the PFx Brick, please consult our website or go directly to PFx Brick Specifications page.Click this link for additional detail on the Light Fx Features.Click this link for additional detail on the Sound Fx Features.During most of 2016, we worked very hard to take the PFx Brick from a concept to a mature pre-production prototype. Development was focused on three key aspects of the design:1. ElectronicsAt the heart of the PFx Brick is a small electrical printed circuit board (PCB). This contains all of the electronics that make the PFx Brick work such as the CPU, motor drivers, audio circuits, light drivers, and power regulation. The PCB also forms part of the mechanical design by precisely aligning all of the external interfaces and connectors such as the Power Functions™ pins, lighting dock connector, speaker connector, etc.The PFx Brick PCB has progressed through 3 main iterations to date. The current version 3 design is considered mature enough to become a production PCB with little to no modifications.2. SoftwareThe PFx App software development included not only the main graphical user interface (UI), but also a collection of test and debug tools which support hardware development. The PFx App was conceived to be a cross platform application capable of running seamlessly on both MS Windows and Mac OS X. Within a month of development, we had successfully implemented a common code base capable of building Windows and Mac OS X versions of the PFx App.The PFx App is at a mature stage of development and will shortly be ready for a public v.1.0 release to coincide with reward fulfillment.3. Mechanical DesignThe electronics cannot function meaningfully in a LEGO® creation without a brick form factor enclosure. This enclosure allows the PFx Brick to be connected to LEGO® System and Technic elements so that it can be built seamlessly into your LEGO® creations. The enclosure includes studs on the top, anti-studs (or tubes) on the bottom, and Technic axle holes on two opposing sides. Furthermore, the enclosure includes Power Functions™ compatible mounting connectors on the top and bottom. The visual and electrical design of these connectors is differentiated from the original LEGO® implementation in order to respect the patent status of the Power Functions™ connector and also to improve the robustness of the design. Our implementation uses gold-plated, hardened nickel pins in order to improve electrical performance and increase durability.We have progressed through 4 iterations of mechanical design for the brick enclosure. We have fabricated numerous 3D printed prototypes of the brick, which we have actively used in the development process to test and refine the design. This includes the major revisions we had to implement in order to make the brick design compatible with the plastic injection molding process. We are confident that the design is now suitable for actual tooling and mass production by injection molding. The last aspect of the mechanical design involves the accessories; namely the speaker bricks and the light accessory boards (LABs). We have completed successful designs for two speaker sizes: the M Speaker and the XL Speaker. These speakers will be 3D printed for production purposes and injection moulding of the speakers is not included in this funding campaign. Light accessory boards act as the modular connection gateway between the PFx Brick and your LEDs. This allows for quick connect/disconnect of the PFx Brick from your model and allows you to use LEDs from different sources and with different electrical connectors.The design of PFx Brick has reached the point whereby it is suitable for volume production. Clearly, the costs involved with achieving volume production are well beyond our means. We have already invested a great deal of time, money, and effort to get the PFx Brick to this stage. We need your help to make this next step a reality.Volume production of the PFx Brick involves 5 key tasks:1. Electronics2. ABS Plastic Brick EnclosureTooling and production for the plastic injection molding of the PFx Brick enclosure3. Speakers4. AccessoriesPFx Package rewards include bundled accessories so that you can immediately enjoy all of the PFx Brick's capabilities right out-of-the-box.5. CertificationObtaining legal and regulatory certification can be very costly and require the services of accredited testing laboratories and agencies. We intend to acquire certifications for European CE mark, USA FCC part 15/B, and Canadian ICES-003. These certifications verify that electronic products meet the necessary electrical safety, electromagnetic interference and electromagnetic compatibility requirements defined in these standards.We have carefully considered the tasks involved for the volume production of the PFx Brick. By using a combination of external suppliers and in-house resources, we have put together a production schedule which should deliver at least 1500 PFx Bricks in a reasonable time frame. What happens if we are fortunate enough that this campaign demands more than 1500 units? We have already considered this possibility and have plans to scale and adapt our production schedule accordingly with very modest impact on the overall delivery schedule. We have used our collective engineering judgement and experience to guide our project estimates, and we will work diligently to achieve this reward fulfillment schedule.Our goal in choosing the PFx Brick reward tiers was to offer a simple and clear structure that emphasizes the value of packaged rewards. When you receive your PFx Brick, we want you to immediately benefit from all of its awesome capabilities, especially for lighting and sound. That is why we have bundled the PFx Brick with both speakers and LEDs into several value packages. We also offer discounted 2 and 5 pack bundles which allow you to save on shipping costs. For DIY builders, we offer no-frills PFx Brick rewards so that you can integrate your own LEDs and speakers.We have decided not to include so-called ""early-bird"" reward levels. We believe that this makes the reward tiers more complicated and penalizes backers who simply need more time to think about backing our project. This strategy might impact our campaign momentum, but being fair to our backers is more important to us.The table below summarizes the available reward tiers. The pricing shown in USD and EUR currencies is for guidance purposes and you should consult current exchange rates from CAD for the latest pricing.As a footnote, we would like to thank our friends at Brickstuff™ for partnering with us to offer the amazing picoLEDs™ included with our bundle rewards. These tiny LEDs offer incredible flexibility when lighting a LEGO® model since they can be routed through the smallest spaces. We intend to offer the popular warm white picoLED™ with 6 inch (152 mm) wires.Our campaign goal of $140k will be used to fund the basic production of the PFx Brick, including its plastic injection molded ABS enclosure. Unfortunately, this funding is not sufficient to also injection mold the enclosures for both the M and XL Speaker brick accessories. Instead, they will be produced with 3D printing. Therefore, we have offered a stretch goal of $165k to pay for the tooling and production of plastic injection molded speaker bricks. It would be awesome if the entire PFx Brick and accessory range could benefit from the consistent and superior finish of ABS plastic injection molding; but we'll have to rely on your generosity to make it happen!Lastly, we have a surprise reward for backers if we reach a second stretch goal of $200k. We won't reveal what the reward is until we reach the base campaign goal of $140k. Believe us, it will be worth it! All PFx Brick rewards will be eligible to receive one surprise reward item. We have put the PFx Brick into many different demo models of all different sizes, shapes, and themes. In addition to our own extensive testing, we have recruited a team of awesome LEGO® builders from different building themes to really put the PFx Brick to the test! Their valuable feedback will ensure that the PFx Brick does truly capture the needs of builders and meets our desired levels of quality and reliability.The PFx Brick is truly built by AFOLs (Adult Fans Of LEGO®) for AFOLs! We have been passionately involved in the LEGO® fan community for many years. We have exhibited and given talks at LEGO® fan conventions in Canada, the USA, the UK, and Australia. Along the way, we've made many great friends and continue to be dazzled by the diverse creativity and awesome skills of fellow LEGO® builders!We both have extensive professional engineering backgrounds in the domains of electronic design, systems integration, and software development. Michael has significant engineering management experience including the role of CTO of a defence and aerospace systems company and CEO of his own engineeringconsulting firm. Jason has held senior developer roles in prominent commercial desktop productivity applications. Our combined knowledge and experience and our passion for the PFx Brick, is strong assurance for this project's successful completion.The PFx Brick is very much a personal project. Our goal was to inject extra magic and excitement into our own LEGO® creations. The journey to create the PFx Brick has inspired us to reach out beyond our own creative efforts and that is why we're so excited to share the PFx Brick with you! We can't wait to see what you can do with it!1. Are shipping costs included?No. Shipping costs for your region are added to your reward pledge as part of the Kickstarter checkout process. The shipping costs (for single and 2x pack PFx Brick rewards) by region are as follows (in $CAD):For 5x pack rewards, shipping is: Canada $15, USA $25, EU $40, and Rest of the World $45.2. What about taxes, duties, and other fees?Canadian customers will be charged HST and provincial taxes as required. Customers in other countries may be subject to import duties and VAT charged at delivery. Shipping packages will have a commercial invoice attached for value declaration at cost.3. How can I save shipping costs?If you have a friend who also wants the same pledge reward, choose a 2 pack M or XL value package. These packages are charged the same shipping cost as an individual package. Thus, you save half the shipping cost. The 5 pack value packages also have lower shipping rates compared to 5 individual packages.4. How do I get more accessories for my PFx Brick?The Fx Bricks web store will allow you to purchase additional accessories such as light accessory boards, speakers, and much more. 5. What's the deal with LEGO® patents and Fair Play?Fx Bricks respects the intellectual property rights of the LEGO® group. We want to clearly state that the PFx Brick is notofficially endorsed or supported by the LEGO® Group and is not an officially supported Power Functions™ compatible device.The Power Functions™ system is a registered trademark of the The LEGO® Group. Therefore, items such as the Power Functions™ compatible connectors on the PFx Brick are visually different from the LEGO® group implementation (similar to the Power Functions™ compatible connectors on the SBrick and BuWizz products). Furthermore, the electrical design of the PFx Brick connectors is different in that we support a wider range of operating voltages, arbitrary use of the signal pins (both for input and output), and we use gold-plated, hardened nickel pins rather than folded tin-plated tabs.The infrared protocol used by the LEGO® Power Functions™ system is publicly documented and use of the protocol as described is prohibited for commercial use. However, the PFx Brick does not use the LEGO® Power Functions™ infrared protocol as described. Rather, the PFx Brick is agnostic of infrared protocol detail in much the same way as other universal IR remote control devices such as the Logitech Harmony universal IR remotes. The PFx Brick is capable of operating with a wide range of IR protocols and carrier frequencies. The PFx Brick supports the use of LEGO® brand IR remotes because it has passively recorded the IR signature of each IR action—even from IR remotes not documented by the LEGO® group. This signature is used to trigger arbitrary actions. The protocol detail within the message signature is completely irrelevant and isnot even processed by the PFx Brick. The benefit of this approach is the ability to support a wide variety of IR remote control devices. Obviously, our priority is to support LEGO® brand IR remotes since the PFx Brick is focused primarily on the needs of LEGO® builder community.1. Electronic Component ProcurementSupplier lead timesThe electronic component market is very fluid and dynamic. Inventory that was available last week may disappear the following week. It's not uncommon to find lead times for replacement parts well into months.Discontinued, obsoleted, unavailable partsFor the same reasons, we may find some parts have been discontinued...We can mitigate some of this risk by identifying form/fit/function replacement parts for as many components as possible. In fact, we have already done this for many of the components. This will allow us to quickly substitute an equivalent part if we find that it's unavailable.2. Plastic Injection MoldingThe process of tooling a plastic injection molded part always carries risk. These risks extend to the mechanical tolerances of the final product, the mold quality, material quality, and much more. We have tried to mitigate this risk as much as possible by making many 3D printed prototype enclosures. These prototypes helped us validate placement, alignment, and clearance issues. We have also validated our design with plastic injection mold suppliers to verify its suitability to their process. 3. CertificationWe are reasonably confident that the PFx Brick will comply with the requirements of CE, FCC part 15/b, and ICES-003 certifications. However, there is still a risk that small design modifications might be required in order to satisfy the test. Furthermore, these certification procedures are burdened with a great deal of documentation and process. This could impact our delivery schedule if the amount of effort required becomes greater than expected.4. Schedule RiskAs with any engineering project, we have tried to estimate the delivery schedule as best we can with the information available. However, there will always be unforeseen circumstances which can add delay to our schedule. These delays could result from lead time issues, insufficient labour capacity, insufficient inventory, engineering design changes, etc.In the event of any significant delay, we assure you that we will maintain transparent communication via timely updates to our valued backers.",see above.,https://www.kickstarter.com/projects/fxbricks/pfx-brick-special-fx-for-lego-creations?ref=discovery_category_newest,fxbricks/pfx-brick-special-fx-for-lego-creations,"Introducing the PFx Brick!

https://www.kickstarter.com/projects/189900848/finclip-the-easiest-way-to-don-doff-your-fins?ref=discovery_category_newest,189900848/finclip-the-easiest-way-to-don-doff-your-fins,"Patent PendingFINCLIP is the result of years of observing divers struggling to get their fins on, loaded with equipment and trying to keep their balance on a swaying boat.Of course, those of us that are not quite so young anymore and perhaps also enjoy the delights of excellent cooking, fine wines and thirst quenching beers, often find this manoeuvre even more difficult.I had always wondered why the evolution of fin straps hadn't developed alonside that of ski bindings. Considerig this, I started to imagine ways of a simple design that would make putting on fins as easy as it is today to clip ski boots to skis.We spent over a year looking for an innovative solution.With the help of a design studio, many ideas were experimented and several prototypes were developed and tested.We came up with a product that can be fitted to fins of all sizes and most major brands on the market without modifying the fins in any way.The way FINCLIP works is really quite simple and is very similar to how you would use a shoehorn.  The difference is that while a shoehorn needs to be removed, FINCLIP remains where it is. In fact, if you had to remove even just a part of FINCLIP, you would have to bend down and use your hands, which is not what FINCLIP is all about.FINCLIP consists of a clamp which needs to be secured to the back of an open heeled fin.The clamp is hinged  to a heelpiece which has an ergonomic profile that adapts to the heel of the diver on the inside and a grooved track with a sliding cursor and rotor at the back which regulates the elastic that connects the heelpiece to the fin. A knob at the base of the track stops the cursor from running off the track but can be released to free the elastic if necessary When the heelpiece is lowered, the cursor slides to the base of the track and tensions the elastic which, being slightly lower than the fulcrum it is attached to, keeps the heelpiece down and allows the diver to easily slide a foot into the fin.Once the fin is on, all you have to do is slightly raise your toes and gently push down with your heel. The cursor slides back up and the elastic blocks the heelpiece in the up position to secure the fin. FINCLIP is also an optimum solution when removing fins in the water.As we all know, removing fins in water is not that easy. The suction effect between foot and fin and not having anything to rest on often makes this operation quite troublesome.When the heelpiece on  FINCLIP is open it offers a handle which can easily be pushed to slide the fin off your foot. During the testing of FINCLIP we decided to use one of the most common attachment systems. It is our intention to produce and market FINCLIP for all types of attachments.We aim to make FINCLIP suitable for 90% of all the fins currently present on the marketFINCLIP can be produced in different coloursNow we need your help to put FINCLIP into production and make it available to all those divers who want to make their lives easier.This will only become reality with your support.Thank you. SPECIAL THANKSI’d like to end by thanking all the people that have worked with me on this project.Without their invaluable professional collaboration, FINCLIP would have remained just an idea in my mind.DESIGNSUMISURA  took the FINCLIP project to heart right from the start. Their dynamic team have demonstrated true enthusiasm and I would say that they really had fun while developing the various prototypes.Located in Milan, DESIGNSUMISURA supervised both the design and engineering of FINCLIP and provided professional support throughout all  the phases of the project.Alberto, Jannu and Lorenzo have yet to become skilled divers, but they are experts at designing indoor and outdoor sports equipment. I am very confident about the FINCLIP project and look forward to continuing my relationship with DESIGNSUMISURA right through to the manufacturing in series stage and beyond. www.designsumisura.itMarcel, 45Marcel has been working in the TV and Radio business since 1996, and he has been a scuba diver since he grew up close to the shores of northern Germany. Later on he combined his love for moving pictures with his diving skills by creating underwater videos. Based in Cologne, Marcel produced the latest promotional videos for our dive resort Profondo Blu and has now filmed, edited and lent his voice to all the FinClip-videos – a project that he supports wholeheartedly.info@steuermann.videoMarcel.Steuermann@t-online.deAdriana, 48Adriana has taken care of all my Italian to English translation needs for many years and is also a great lover of the sea. She has been a professional English language consultant for over 25 years and offers a high quality professional translation service  as well as teaching English at all levels to all ages.Based in Turin, she doesn’t get the opportunity to dive as often as she would like but is looking forward to experiencing how much easier it is to don fins using FinClip the next time she pays us a visit at our resort.adriana.dowling@gmail.com","This project is the fruit of over 20 years’ experience in the field of recreational scuba diving, together with my natural aptitude for analytical observation and the desire to find solutions to problems.For the first 20 years of my professional life I successfully owned and ran a motor spares distribution company where I put into practise my management and innovation skills on a daily basis.I created revolutionary solutions in the motor spares distribution sector and, thanks to a very competent and efficient team, enjoyed recognizable success.In 1998 I decided to sell my ongoing business to dedicate my time and energy to what has always been my true passion: the sea.Unfortunately (or perhaps fortunately!)  my powers of observation and the pleasure of researching solutions to improve things and situations never abandoned me. I believe that FINCLIP is a great solution to a minor problem that is in fact experienced by many divers.Thanks to the experience I gained in the automotive sector and together with the collaboration of a design studio composed of innovative engineers, I am convinced that I can produce an optimum product.

Finclip is the fruit of a group of experienced professional divers, designers and engineers. With Finclip, donning your fins has never been easier.Finclip is a device that has been specially designed to don the most popular models of adjustable fins with exceptional ease, without having to bend down or use your hands.Finclip is fixed to the base of the fin with a serrated clamp hinged to an ergonomic heelpiece. This features a grooved track and a sliding cursor to tension the bungee cord that allows the heelpiece to hold the fin firmly in place during diving.Finclip couldn’t be easier to use.Once the fin is on, just gently push down with your heel. The cursor slides upwards and the bungee cord pushes the heelpiece against your ankle.It only takes a few seconds to be ready to enter the water.To fix Finclip to your fins simply clamp it to the rear end of the fin and secure it by tightening the screws. Once the elastic has been hooked onto the posts on your fins Finclip is ready to be used.One of the features of Finclip is that the distance between the heel and the end of the fin can be adjusted. This adjustment, combined with an elastic that can be varied in length, allows Finclip to be used whatever the size and model of fin you are using.To regulate the tension of the bungee to meet your personal needs, we have developed an adjustable system that allows for 3 different lengths up to a maximum of 36mm. When putting on your fins, all you have to do is pull the heelpiece down until the elastic is below the fulcrum point. This way the heelpiece will remain down when you slide your foot into the fin. Finclip will then close when you gently push down with your heel.Thanks to the particular design of the heelpiece, the force exerted by the elastic is no longer concentrated in one point but distributed all the way along the back of your heel, resulting in never before experienced comfort and avoiding the annoying consequences of constant rubbing during swimming.The rubber sole applied to the base of the clamp avoids slipping on the fiberglass surfaces of boats and can be replaced when it becomes worn.Finclip is also an optimum solution when removing fins in the water. Once opened, the heelpiece can be easily held and used to overcome the suction effect between your feet and the inside of the fin.At the end of a dive, just move the heelpiece forwards. Finclip’s reduced size will allow you to place your fins back in their bag as you always have done. Finclip can be attached to the most common models of adjustable fins, regardless of the size.The Finclip bungee strap is compatible with all fins that have posts similar in design to Mares. Compatibility with other popular brands is being developed and will be available soon.We have found a way to make Finclip suitable for fins that have a thicker rear edge: such as Scubapro Seawing Novafins.We reached our goal by developing a new lower clamp part, characterized by two holes for the positioning of the upper clamp part. If the lateral pins are positioned in hole (1), Finclip can be fixed to fins with a rear thickness of up to 10 mm. If instead the pins are positioned in hole (2), the maximum rear thickness of the fin can be up to 18 mm.You can mount and adjust Finclip in a very short time.Finclip will be available in four colours: black, blue, magenta and yellow.You will be sent a survey allowing you to choose a colour after the campaign has been funded.We spent over a year looking for an innovative solution.With the help of a design studio, many ideas were experimented and several prototypes were developed and tested.","This project is the fruit of over 20 years’ experience in the field of recreational scuba diving, together with my natural aptitude for analytical observation and the desire to find solutions to problems.

This means Mojobot is full of fun and game play game play!What's more Mojobot has infrared navigation sensors that ensures that Mojobot will always move correctly to each location in the map. The infrared sensors will detect the the marked square pattern on the corner of each block in the map. This means you can code Mojobot to move in an infinite square loop and still keep its correct position.Here's a demo of Mojobot's precise movements.The Console is like the command center for Mojobot. To command Mojobot put coding tags into the Console and press 'GO'. The job of the Console in to read the coding tag data, process it and send it over to the robot. The lights on the console help kids to debug and learn the way the code flows and executes.What's more? We designed the Console to be modular and extendable. For us it is very important the children's creations are not limited to 8 lines of code. To extend the code just connect the Add-On Console to the Main Console. Then your code can be as long as you wish!Main Code ExtensionSub-Routine Code ExtensionMain + Sub-Routine Code ExtensionMojobot has got tons of different coding tags. With these you can command Mojobot to do different tasks and show different behaviors. Our tangible coding platform is a comprehensive system that allows the use of loops, if statements, wait command and parameters such as numbers and sensor inputs. Mojobot has 6 main types of coding tags:With the Basic Set you will get coding tags for Movement, Numbers and Actions. Once you've mastered the basic commands, move on to the more advanced content of the Extension Set which will contain Control Logic, Sensor Inputs and Sub-Routine coding tags.There are more than billions of coding possibilities you can do with these coding tags, and this is just for one Console!Your Mojobot will come with a Mojotown.

We have been working in the area of STEM and robotics education since 2015. We work with schools and we have experience teaching children of all ages and background. We have a small team of software and hardware engineers based in Bangkok who are also involved in teaching. Our team is led by Dr. Pooh Eamcharoenying who holds a Phd in Mechanical Engineering specializing in robotic systems.From our experience teaching coding and robotics to children from ages 4 to 30+ year old students, we have found that there is a lack of teaching tools for younger children ages 4+. We also think the concept of tangible coding is really cool, especially because it is something which can make coding more engaging and social for people of all ages. For these reasons we really wanted to build a comprehensive tangible coding platform that allows kids of various age groups to code both simple and complex algorithms as if playing a toy or a game.We have been working in teaching STEM and robotics to kids for a long while. Some of our work include working with the Prime Minister's office to develop and implement robotics curriculum in Thailand.Our journey to create Mojobot started around one and a half years ago. The goal was to create a comprehensive tangible coding platform that allows kids to get into the juicy aspects of computer science and robotics in a fun, accessible, and social way. Our team started off quickly as we built our first prototypes with Arduino and other open source development platforms.After completing our initial prototypes, while on tour to get the market feedback we found our now partner Silverlit. Since then we have been working in collaboration with Silverlit to get Mojobot ready for market and manufacturing production. Silverlit is a well-known electronics toy manufacturer. With Silverlit's expertise and track record in hardware design and manufacturing, you can be rest assured that all Mojobots will be made to a high quality and reasonable price.We expect to get our production batch out and delivered by July 2019.

Born for this very project, Symphonium was established by animation director Hiroshi Nishikiori and producer Yasutake Honjo in July 2015 with the vision to create a brand new form of anime.CHIKA*CHIKA IDOL is a new CG animation project being produced through crowdfunding. This heartwarming idol anime depicts the passionate performances and everyday lives of three “underground idols” - young fledgling idols mainly active in live music venues, yet to appear on the media.If this project is successfully funded, the following anime will be produced!By reaching our goal we’ll be able to make an anime of at least 15 minutes in length, but with everyone’s support we can make it even longer! (See our stretch goal below!)With the success of this project as a first step, we hope to be able to turn this anime into a series - one that walks and grows alongside its fans!We hope you will join in on supporting and cheering on these girls as they pursue the path to becoming idols!CHIKA*CHIKA IDOL is the story of three young girls in the old towns of Tokyo who dream of becoming idols.They can’t get into a talent agency, nor do they have any albums released - but they can’t sit around and wait for that to happen! They want to get up on stage and perform with all their hearts - now!CHIKA*CHIKA IDOL is a brand new idol animation project, depicting underground idol girls whose activities are centered around live performances. This episode in-the-making will unveil the very first live performance of the 3-girl idol unit, Pâtithree, the events leading up it, and what happens afterward!The story in the anime will be based on the comic (currently available on the official website), and will continue on to depict the developments that follow, so be sure to check out the comic first!Fifty pages of the official comic in English are available to read for free here!Next episode here >1. Fans Walk Hand-in-Hand with the Idols-to-Be!This is an anime which operates on crowdfunding, enables interaction with the production staff via social networking platforms and the official website, and encourages exchange of ideas and fan voting in English too. Just like idol fans support their favorite idols, we’re experimenting with this style of direct fan support, but for the creators of the anime and the production process! We believe that this fan participation will also become a key part of the experience and fun!2. The Girls’ Passionate Performances and Everyday Lives, Drawn in Beautiful Cel-Shaded CGAbove all else, the highlight of this anime is the depiction of the adorable girls’ daily lives and high-energy performances, and that adorableness is best depicted through our cel-shaded CG technology, producing dynamic 3D CG without losing the hand-drawn feel of traditional anime. Watching the girls’ daily toils come to fruition on the stage will inevitably move you to tears. Sing with your idols during their performance scenes, and share the joy of cheering them on with your fellow fans!3.  Incorporating Fans Worldwide!We aim to create an anime that fans throughout the world will enjoy, so we’re running our crowdfunding project on two platforms during almost the same timeframe - Makuake for the Japanese community and Kickstarter for the English-speaking community! (The ultimate length of the anime will depend on the total sum of funds raised from both Kickstarter and Makuake, but please rest assured that even if only the Kickstarter is successfully funded, our anime will be produced at a minimum length of 15 minutes!)We’re incredibly grateful that Japanese anime is enjoyed by fans around the world today, so we would like to incorporate the international community as much as possible in this project!(As mentioned above, you can read the official comic in English here!)We at Symphonium are a CG animation studio launched by anime director Hiroshi Nishikiori and original planner/producer/scenario writer Yasutake Honjo.We’ve both been so excited to get this project off the ground that we’ve invested our own money and have worked tirelessly over the last six months to produce a 4-minute 3DCG promotional video, theme song, official site, a 50-page comic, image boards, and more.Now we need your help to make this anime a reality!Hiroshi Nishikiori (Director)Twenty years have passed since I began working as an animation director. In that time, I’ve been involved with many works, including TV series and films. Lately, I often hear people in the industry talking about things like “how will animation be released from here on out?” and “will it really be alright to rely on DVD sales?”For this project, we’ve taken on crowdfunding as a method to create anime through the support of its fans. And we want to involve fans throughout the entire world.CHIKA*CHIKA IDOL depicts the lives of young girls giving it their all to achieve their dream of becoming idols. Tenka and the others bear a sincere and strong desire to sing and have their songs reach many people. That’s the core of this project, and that’s what we’ve decided to present to the world.In the future, we’d also like to pursue next-gen forms of entertainment, such as virtual live concerts and VR.Please join Tenka and the girls as they spread their wings and soar throughout the world.We hope you will support CHIKA*CHIKA IDOL!A freelance director who graduated from Tokyo Designer Gakuin College and has worked for T2 Studio and Nippon Animation.Nishikiori made his directorial debut with the TV series I’m Gonna Be an Angel!. Some of his other works include Angelic Layer, Azumanga Daioh, Melody of Oblivion, Jyu-Oh-Sei, Ghost Slayers Ayashi, A Certain Magical Index, Trinity Seven, and Milky Holmes TD. He has also worked on such films as The Doraemons: Doki Doki Wildcat Engine, Magic Tree House, and A Certain Magical Index the Movie.Yasutake Honjo (Producer, Original Planner, Scriptwriter)A graduate of the Keio University Department of Literature and Philosophy. Honjo has edited comics as well as directed, produced, and written the scenario for many bishoujo games.He is the CEO of Symphonium.His standout works include the doujin visual novel Resign (scenario writer, director), and bishoujo games including Seifuku Tenshi (scenario writer, director, producer), which won the Moe Game Award 2012 for Best New Brand. In addition to producing the CHIKA*CHIKA IDOL project, Honjo is also in charge of the scenario for the comic and anime.Anime Production: Behind-the-ScenesWant to know more about this project? Check out our featured article on Tokyo Otaku Mode!As many of you know, anime is commonly viewed for free around the world, making Blu-ray and DVD sales (the main source of revenue for anime production) very difficult. As it is already, the Japanese anime industry is a harsh place for anime creators, who have no choice but to work long hours on minimal pay just to ensure that anime is produced. That is why we are taking the initiative to search for new ways to create anime, in order to be able to continue bringing fans around the world the anime that they love!With crowdfunding, we aim to create an anime series born from the direct support of its fans. Not only do fans get to directly support the production of the anime, they also get to receive special, unique rewards!Furthermore, we intend to give back to anime creators their deserved share of returns. We believe that with this model of direct fan support, ethical pay in the anime industry could become a reality.Upon successful funding, we plan to use funds for the following: Kickstarter Project MembersIf we receive funds above our initial goal, we will aim to extend the total length of the anime, and add subtitles in more languages!We’ve been working nonstop to prepare for this project for the past six months out of our earnest wish to bring a new form of anime to the world.Everyone, we await your support!","About Refunds (After Kickstarter Funding Ends)As the funds raised from this Kickstarter campaign will be put into funding the anime production immediately after the Kickstarter campaign ends, refunds will not be possible 21 days after the end of this Kickstarter .

With this official localization project, we aim to faithfully share all of its wonder and emotion with the English-speaking world. This project will take the consumer version (Xbox 360, PSP, PS3) of this game and create an official English edition for PC (Windows).First released in 2005 by Japanese video game developer AKABEi SOFT2, Sharin no Kuni is now celebrated as a masterpiece in the history of Japanese visual novels. Acclaimed for its cleverly crafted story and human drama, it has earned fans from beyond the boundaries of its genre and received further releases for the Xbox 360, PSP, and PS3 in succession between 2010-13. Its popularity extends beyond the borders of Japan as well. On English visual novel websites it is listed at the top of the charts next to renowned titles such as Fate/Stay Night, Muv-Luv Alternative, and Clannad.Out of the desire to release an official and faithfully localized version of this game for fans around the world to enjoy, this project was launched as a collaboration between AKABEi SOFT2, the game’s licensor; Frontwing, in charge of translation and localization; and Tokyo Otaku Mode, in charge of Kickstarter and international shipping operations.The official translation will take the fan translation into account (with permission from the creators), and will be significantly reworked and improved to present an accurate, natural, and more enjoyable experience. In addition, newly added scenes in the all-ages edition will be translated for the first time ever into English by our team. Creating a high quality localization is a long-term project that requires each member of the team to possess a deep and full understanding of the story, setting, and world within the game, and involves repeated rounds of editing and discussion. We have decided to set the crowdfunding goal of this Kickstarter at the absolute minimum amount required to properly carry out the localization project. We will carry out the project taking as much of your feedback into consideration as possible. We also have plenty of rare items that you can only obtain from this project prepared for backers.Please lend us your support so that we may bring this incredible title to people throughout the world - both visual novel lovers and those new to the genre!■ Product SpecificationsFurther information regarding the 18+ version of the game can be found on the following website: http://syarinad.tumblr.com/ Early summer.A society which imposes special ""Duties"" upon everyone who breaks the law.The individuals who oversee these criminals' rehabilitation are the ""Special Elite""ーa rank the protagonist, Kenichi Morita, hopes to attain. To do that, he must pass his final exam, for which he arrives at a certain country town.At the school Kenichi attends, he encounters girls bound by various “Duties.” Those obligated ""to observe a 12-hour day"" are forbidden from being awake for more than 12 hours per day, and those obligated ""to remain in infancy"" cannot grow up. It is meeting Natsumi Hinata, the girl who ""cannot fall in love,"" that throws him out of gear.Soon, Kenichi makes a series of odd discoveries… his own grave, erected secretly on a clifftop; his patrimony, hidden deep inside a cavern. Kenichi finds that he must search for his own atonement in this dystopian society. What is the truth behind the Land of the Spinning Wheel? Discover for yourself through Kenichi's eyes!A touching story with a deeply profound message, depicted with a serene touch and moments of lighthearted comedy, this visual novel is an experience not to be missed, for both old fans and new!■ What’s Special About This Game?While many bishoujo games focus on depicting bittersweet romances between the protagonist and the heroines, this title is different. In Sharin no Kuni: The Girl Among the Sunflowers, Kenichi is at odds with his obligations, and players stand together with him in his battle against those who wield tremendous power over his life. In order to become a Special Elite, Kenichi must work to rehabilitate three classmates for his final examination. The events that unfold take Kenichi—and the player—on an emotional ride of twists and turns. While some scenes overflow with intensity, there are others that offer various degrees of comical relief. Over the course of the visual novel, players truly share the wide range of Kenichi’s emotion and heartache.The game is not simply genuine and emotionally raw, but also masterfully written and constantly surprising. For some, the narrative of anime and video games can become dull and predictable over time. However, thanks to clever writing—both subtle and shocking—throughout Sharin no Kuni: The Girl Among the Sunflowers, we are confident that this story’s ending will blow past all of your expectations. Foreshadowing, plot twists, and revelations will have you constantly reconsidering your predictions. Chances are, you will be left speechless once you uncover the truth.

The story, script, world building and characters have been in the writing process for over 2 years and I am finally ready to make it all happen.But in order to get the project into production I need a little help to put together a budget so that I can hire an animation team. Even the smallest pledge will be helpful, and if you are unable to help financially then it would mean the world to me if you could help me spread the word about the project on social media.If I am really going to do this, I want to do it well. I want to create something of high quality and for that I need a big budget. Other sites lets you keep whatever you get, but you are still expected to make the product no matter how little you managed to scrape together. With Kickstarter it is all or nothing, just the way I like it.Because I will be striving for high quality, my budget goal is around the same amount that it takes to create an anime episode in Japan. It might seem like a overwhelming sum, but when it comes to things like this, its all about many individuals giving a little, which all then equals up to something big.Think of it like this:If 1000 people give $2, that´s already $2000. Then just imagine what a bigger number of people can do with bigger pledges.You have nothing to lose by pledging to the project. If the Kickstarter is a flop then you will still have your money.

Even our so-called public radio and TV are compromised by their dependency on funding from corporations, foundations, and government. And while there are thousands of excellent independent bloggers and citizen reporters out there, it’s not easy to find and identify the “good ones” and keep up with them all.For everyone who has been dreaming of a major independent media platform that’s free from the compromises and partisan agendas that come with a reliance on corporate advertisers and a dependency on the ultra-rich, that dream is about to be a reality. Newsbud—Where Media Integrity Matters.Newsbud will be a truly independent alternative because it will be one-hundred percent people funded. Plus, while it will share a similar spirit with the bloggers and citizen reporters, Newsbud will have the resources and staffing to make it an easily accessed center stage for high-quality, independent reporting. Headed up by award-winning activist, publisher, and author, Sibel Edmonds, in partnership with a network of seasoned and international producers, editors, and independent investigative journalists, Newsbud will offer original stories and investigative reports, video-podcast productions, editorials, and discussion forums. Newsbud will be a news and multimedia network unlike anything else online, in print, or on TV. It will offer all of the elements people expect from a large news organization and also utilize social media, a mobile app (news alerts, etc.), and other Internet platforms. All Newsbud reports and multimedia productions will be entirely independent and nonpartisan and will be developed, written, produced, and vetted by our staff, who will be paid with funding from the public.Except for special forums and roundtable discussions, all Newsbud contents will be free to the public. For those who want access to all of the site’s contents, the subscription fee will be $12 per year. A monthly payment option of $2 per month ($24 per year) will also be available.Our objective is to have 50,000 subscribers by the end of year one. Assuming a $12 annual subscription, 50,000 subscribers equates to $550,000 (50,000 X $11 [annual subscription fee minus credit card processing fee]). We’d supplement that amount with two annual fundraising events. Our goal for the end of year two is to expand our subscriber base to 75,000. That would equate to $825,000, which would be enough to support Newsbud’s annual operations. Every dollar we receive that exceeds our goal will go to funding further content, expanded program offerings, additional journalists, etc.We will operate 24 X 7 and deliver:For a society to be responsible and empowered, it must first be informed. News media, as our primary source of information, should be the number one force for transparency and accountability. But this can only happen when reporters and media sources aren’t accountable to powerful people with vested interests in the stories being told.For a decade and a half, Newsbud’s founder, Sibel Edmonds, has been fighting for the public’s right to know. From whistleblowing while working as an FBI interpreter and years of leading congressional investigations, to forming the first and only National Security Whistleblowers Coalition and establishing an independent online information forum, her life’s mission has been to create an informed citizenry.It’s time to stand up for our right to be informed and to establish an empowering, publicly funded media network that is accountable only to its viewers and to the truth.To launch what we believe will be the first truly independent and agenda-free major media network, we need to raise a minimum of $950,000 in under 60 days. To help accomplish this, you can pledge anything, from the cost of a cup of coffee to a $10,000 sponsorship.Your help will enable us to set-up and begin operation by September 15, 2016. Your pledges will fund the following:1.	Web Development, IT & Recording Studio (hardware/software & furniture): $95K2. HQ Office, Travel Budget, Logistics& Services (insurance, payroll, tax): $135K3. Hire First-Tier Staff:a.	Investigative journalists, analysts, producers & columnists (6 full time & 6 part time): $365K;b.	Editors and technical, managerial & support staff (4 full time & 3 part time): $230KEstimated total for set-up and one year of operation: $825KAfter we are up and running, subscriber fees will enable us to continue operating year after year—even as we allow non-subscribers to view the bulk of our site’s content for free.Our funding goal of $950K is the absolute minimum amount required to accomplish our objectives. We have slimmed down our start-up costs to one-hundredth of what online news networks typically spend, and we’ve done so without skimping on quality. Our journalists, producers, and columnists are world-class talents, known for their integrity, professionalism, knowledge, experience, and track record. We have already identified and enlisted our first-tier team members and have shared their bios below.  If we exceed our funding goal, we’ll be able to bring on additional journalists, producers, content, shows and more.We’d love you to support our effort with a pledge. We also need your help to spread the word about Newsbud and activate others. Sharing on Facebook, Twitter, Google+, Instagram, YouTube, and other networks will be critical to the success of our collective dream.Without you, we cannot build the independent news source that we the people deserve. We can only do that when we are 100% publicly funded, and that means we need you, your voice, and your commitment to our cause.Meet our stellar team of internationally recognized journalists, producers, and analysts:Sibel Edmonds, Founder & Editor-in-ChiefSibel Edmonds is editor and publisher of BFP Report, founder and president of the National Security Whistleblowers Coalition (NSWBC), and author of the acclaimed books Classified Woman: The Sibel Edmonds Story, and The Lone Gladio, a political spy thriller.

We’re confident that when we deliver the high-quality, wholly independent media outlet we’ve promised, readers and viewers will be satisfied and support us with their subscriptions.",https://www.kickstarter.com/projects/141490519/support-a-100-people-funded-online-news-outlet-pha?ref=discovery_category_newest,141490519/support-a-100-people-funded-online-news-outlet-pha,"In February, we launched a Kickstarter campaign to fund a 100% people-funded online media outlet. While the support for our project was resounding and the pledges flooded in, we did not meet our goal. Still, the outpouring of encouragement we received has made us confident that, together, we can still make our vision a reality.Rather than give up, we’ve changed our funding strategy and launched a new campaign. The great thing about our new strategy is that we will begin creating and delivering programs and articles in early June, so everyone can check out what we’re producing before the campaign is even over!Before getting into the details of our new plan, here’s some background for all of you who are new to our project:These days,major media sources have too many ties with people and organizations that want to influence what’s reported—think billionaire owners, mega-corporations, and big-money advertisers. Even ourso-called public radio and TV are compromisedby their reliance on funding from corporations, foundations, and government. And while there are thousands of excellent independent bloggers and citizen reporters out there, it’s not easy to find and identify the “good ones” and keep up with all of them.For everyone who has been dreaming of amajor independent media platform that’s free from the compromises and partisan agendas that come with a dependence on corporate advertisers and the ultra-rich,that dream is about to be a reality. Newsbud—Where Media Integrity Matters.Newsbud will bea truly independent alternativebecause it will beone-hundred percent people funded.Plus, while it will share a similar spirit with the bloggers and citizen reporters, Newsbud will have the resources and staffing to make our outlet an easily accessed center stage for high-quality, independent reporting.Headed up byaward-winning activist,publisher, andauthor,Sibel Edmonds, in partnership with a network of seasoned and international producers, editors, and independent investigative journalists,Newsbud will offer original stories and investigative reports, video-podcast productions, editorials, and discussion forums.Newsbud will be a news and multimedia network unlike anything else online, in print, or on TV. All Newsbud reports and multimedia productions will be entirely independent and nonpartisan and will be developed, written, produced, and vetted by our staff, who will be paid with funding from the public.To achieve this goal, we will:1. Run four Kickstarter fundraising campaigns over an 18-month period. For each campaign, our funding goal will be $150K.2. Run an ongoing subscription drive during all four Kickstarter campaigns. The subscription fee will be $60/year or $7/month.3. Encourage people to both pledge and subscribe to bring in additional funding.4. Begin creating and posting daily videos and podcasts, weekly articles, and analyses right away. These will be available for all to view starting in early June so everyone can see the quality product Newsbud will deliver. (Development of our website will come in a later phase, so until then we will operate Newsbud via BoilingFrogsPost.com.)This is important too: While our goal for each phase is $150K, the more we receive, the fewer phases it’ll take for us to start operating at 100%.Phases 2-4:With each successful Kickstarter campaign and funding drive, we will launch additional programs and content and bring in more staff. At the end of Phase 4, Newsbud will be the fully operational, truly independent, 100% people-funded news sources we’re all waiting for. Upon completion of the fourth phase, subscribers will have access to:Once we are fully operational, Newsbud will be a subscription-based service. People can subscribe and have full site access for $60/year or $7/month.But we want as many people to be able to access our content as possible, so we’ll make everything we produce available for free two weeks after its initial airing on our site.For a society to be responsible and empowered, it must first be informed.News media, as our primary source of information, should be the number one force for transparency and accountability. But this can only happen when reporters and media sources aren’t accountable to powerful people with vested interests in the stories being told.For a decade and a half, Newsbud’s founder,Sibel Edmonds, has been fighting for the public’s right to know.Fromwhistleblowingwhile working as an FBI interpreter and years of leading congressional investigations, to forming thefirst and only National Security Whistleblowers Coalitionand establishing anindependentonline information forum,her life’s mission has been to create an informed citizenry.To launch Phase 1 of what we believe will be the only truly independent and agenda-free major media network,we need to raise a minimum of $150,000 in 45 days.To help, please pledge whatever you can.We’re also asking you to subscribe—don’t worry, you’ll get to start viewing articles and programs by early June even if you don’t subscribe or pledge!Finally, please tell everyone you know about what we’re doing by sharing onFacebook, Twitter, Google+, Instagram, YouTube,and other networks.Please, support our effort—pledge, subscribe, tell people.Without you, we cannot build the independent news source that we the people deserve.

Soft and casual as a sneaker yet elegant as a dress shoe.

Never too casual and never too elegant. And it’s super comfortable.Einar is a luxury product made in Europe. It's a handcrafted leather derby with a soft, woven leather upper. It features a thin and very flexible leather sole. The upper and outer sole are stitched together using a special method for maximum comfort and durability.Most shoes with similar features cost more than 4500 SEK (500 USD) in stores. Our goal is to match the price of a luxury sneaker, and we aim for a retail price of 3600 SEK (400 USD), without compromising the quality. However, during our Kickstarter, we will offer you a far superior price, which we’ll never be able to match again.We have chosen an excellent Portuguese factory, capable of delivering handwoven leather, to produce our shoe.

This applies to all backers, US, Sweden, EU and international.We are Oskar and Viggo, two brothers working together to bring back an old shoe and launch our brand, Bay & Wall.A couple of years ago we received a box with a few items from our late grandad, who passed many years before. Among the belongings were a pair of woven leather shoes. Oskar was more than a bit disappointed to note that the shoes were several sizes too small. Viggo tried them on, reluctantly admitting that it was a perfect fit.When summer came, Viggo was falling in love with the shoes. He used them more and more often. They were simply the most comfortable shoes he ever wore.Time passed, and with increasing envy, Oskar saw Viggos love for his inherited shoes. He also noted how well they worked with all kinds of outfits. Big feet isn’t always a plus. To calm his feelings, Oskar decided to buy a pair for himself.Years passed while roaming stores and the internet for the perfect woven leather shoe. Oskar was devastated to conclude he was decades too late. Meanwhile, Viggo had walked many miles in the already worn shoes. Now they were barely holding up, with no replacement to be seen.This brings us to today. It didn’t feel right that such an iconic shoe as this, should just pass into oblivion. Besides, we could hardly be the only ones with a beating heart for this sleek woven leather shoe. So, we set out to produce it. The last year we have worked hard to source a factory that can help us make a remade version of this gentleman’s shoe.Now, we are two brothers, united and passionate to revive the shoe of our grandad. In loving memory, we will call it Einar after our grandfather. The shoe is ready for production.The fate of our woven shoe is in your hands.

By using woven leather, there is more surface for the moisture to evaporate. Kind of like a heat sink. Moist leather wears more easily. Woven leather increases the strength of the material while still being really soft. A full leather shoe doesn’t get as smelly as a sneaker full of textiles.We have chosen an excellent Portuguese factory, capable of delivering handwoven leather, to produce our shoe. Using the best Italian leather, we believe this is an outstanding combination of skilled craftsmanship and fine materials.There are many woven leather shoes out there. What sets us apart is STYLE, QUALITY, and COMFORT. We’ve been searching for a shoe like ours for years, that's why we decided to produce it ourselves. We never found a shoe that really looks the way we want it to. What we’ve seen is that many woven shoes of high quality, are actually hard as wood. Their uppers are even more rigid than a non-woven shoe, and the soles are really stiff. Our shoe has a super soft upper and a flexible sole. They are comfortable from day one. Other woven shoes are falling apart after just a few days of wearing. Our shoe is handcrafted from high-quality leather, and the stitched sole makes sure it holds together. There are of course beautiful exceptions, but they often cost twice as much.We are using European sizes for our shoes.

This gives you a UNIQUE opportunity to get a pair of shoes before everyone else, at a price far below the future high street cost.It’s also worth noting that no money is charged until the end of the campaign, and only if our project has reached its goal.We are Oskar and Viggo, two brothers working together to bring back an old shoe and launch our brand, Bay & Wall.A couple of years ago we received a box with a few items from our late grandad, who passed many years before.

He was looking for an alternative device because traditional air conducted hearing aids are based on the technology of sound amplification, they not work well, and even cause gradual inner ear damage.↓However, whenMr. Tetsuji looked for suitable equipment that could help hearing impaired people listen to music, he could find nothing.↓While developing the next generation hearing aid, he came across a new type of transducer that uses giant magnetostriction technology.↓He first put a number of years into perfecting the transducer for use in bone conducted hearing aids. With this technology, sound is changed into vibrations without reproducing the acoustic sound, and then transmitted through the skin to bone in the skull which travels directly to the cochlear, the sound center of the ear.The result was a device with more than 1000 times better sound production.↓The Grammy awarded recording engineer Jeffrey Jones recommends it.Give the gift of hearing music back again to your loved ones !!","We expect to be ready by December, 2015.The headphones are basically ready for production. However, our greatest challenge has been improving the comfort for extended use. We recommend experimentation for adjustment for comfort. The problem is with the positioning of the large and heavy transducer in the housing. Adjustments for comfort have been the most difficult as the transducer of our system is unique, and therefore does not fit in traditional headphones.

https://www.kickstarter.com/projects/1327284950/gehenna?ref=discovery_category_newest,1327284950/gehenna,"The essence of a great horror film is in its story. The recent success of James Wan's THE CONJURING proves that a great story doesn't need a great budget to be effective. His clever use of the camera, coupled with well-written and relatable characters helped audiences forget they were watching a movie and instead invested them emotionally as a seemingly All-American family was terrorized by the unknown.Today, too many horror films have lost that edge, choosing instead to rely on gore, torture, or unrealistic CG effects to shock movie-goers rather than engross them. Over the last several yearsI've written and plotted, taking time between sculpting monsters and creating make-ups, to tell the story of GEHENNA. There’s a significant challenge to telling a story with a limited budget, but it was one that I was up for—inspired by others before me.Rod Serling’s The Twilight Zone is a terrific example of story over budget, spinning surreal tales with limited locations and engaging actors. Oddly, its low budget was the catalyst of its great success, forcing writers to create believable characters with interesting stories. It’s because of the series success that it serves as the model for GEHENNA.Paulina and Tyler visit Saipan to locate the ideal property for their new company resort. After finding the perfect location, they discover a hidden cave on the property and decide to explore with Alan, their local coordinator, and his assistant, Pepe.The cave reveals a long abandoned Japanese military base, dating back to WW2. Further investigation uncovers several dried up corpses, but curiosity outweighs fear and they walk further.From the darkness, an elderly man approaches; a man barely recognizable as human. Horrible deformities ravage his frail body, as if he had been living in the cave for his entire life.Alan panics and pushes the old man backward, sending him crashing into the wall with a force that ends the old man’s life.A deafening explosion sends rocks and rubble everywhere. The intensity of the turbulence shakes the entire cave, knocking the group unconscious and seals them in the cave.They wake to find the dead body of the old man has disappeared, as well as the other corpses…Desperate to find an exit, they wander further into cave and encounter more sinister secrets in it depths. As the various sources and clues unwind the cave’s mysteries, they’ll learn that the most shocking conclusion still awaits them...YES! As long as no conflicts arise in scheduling, beloved character actor Doug Jones is onboard to scare the C%@P out of you!GEHENNA will be a film of traditional practical effects, provided by the leading visual art house Spectral Motion (HELLBOY, X-MEN 3, ATTACK THE BLOCK, HANSEL AND GRETEL).Spectral Motion Demo reelDigital effects are a great tool, but often tend to be overused and can result in audiences suffering from “pixel fatigue”.GEHENNA will employ the use of CG for rod/rig removal and/or compositing only.The $250,000 will pay for equipment rental, cast and crew, special make-up effects, costumes, sets, sound editing and post production. Funds will also be used in promoting the film, using Kickstarter and to fulfill our promises to our supporters.$250,000 sounds like (and is) a lot of money, but it will be a very tight budget to accomplish this ambitious film. Remember, this is a labor of love and many will be volunteering their time to keep costs low, but the more money we're able to raise, the more we'll be able to put up on the screen.The primary shooting location for GEHENNA takes place in the secret under ground Japanese base from WW2. We will build a set (location to be determined) in Los Angeles for filming.The additional location in the story is on the island of Saipan. Since this is low budget film, we cannot go there to shoot, so we’ll scout for a place with tropical look in the Los Angeles area. If we raise enough money, it may be possible to go to southern island to shoot there, which will add a greater sense of reality.It’s up to you!I have made many friends over the course of my 23 years in the effects industry and this Kickstarer campaign could not happen without them.The following friends (including myself) are commited to delivering the high quality we/you expect from GEHENNA.Joey OroscoFor over 20 year's Joey has been Designing ' Sculpting ' & Painting Well known Creatures ' and Characters for the Film Industry .""

It is his feature film debut and it will scare the &%$^#@% out of you.TOP: Hiroshi with Doug Jones as ""the creepy old man"" from Gehenna - Where Death Lives.BOTTOM: Steven Spielberg telling Hiroshi (far left) he loves his sculpture of David (from A.I., scene where David sees the replications at the robot factory). Looking on, far right - Hiroshi's boss at the time, the legendary Stan Winston.Paulina and Tyler visit Saipan to scout locations for their company's newest resort. They find a perfect location. But there's some sort of hidden cave-like structure on the property, so they decide to explore it, enlisting the help of Alan (their location coordinator) and his assistant Pepe.The cave turns out to be a long-abandoned Japanese military installation. It dates back to WW2. As they move underground through the cave, they encounter dried up corpses. Though it shocks them, they continue undaunted - their curiosity outweighing their fear. (This would not continue for long.)Emerging from the darkness is an elderly man, alive, barely recognizable as human, deformed, ravaged by time. His frail body, with its loose hanging skin, makes the group surmise he's been living in the cave for decades, or maybe his entire life.The old man gets too close to Alan, and Alan panics. He pushes the old man backward, sending him crashing into the wall with sufficient force to end his life.A deafening explosion sends rocks and rubble everywhere. The intense turbulence shakes the entire cave, and knocks the group unconscious.When they awaken, the dead body of the old man has disappeared, the dried corpses are also gone, and they ... are sealed inside.As you might imagine, fear now sets in. The group searches for an exit. They wander in every direction, uncovering information. They cannot be sure what will prove helpful and what are just new sinister secrets. Each member of the group also finds themselves strangely confronting their own most private secret, something from each of their pasts. Strange visions (and other revelations) cause reality to blur for each of them. For the group as a whole, it's becoming a living nightmare.With time and each experience, fear draws closer to terror. They are smart, though; and they try to reason it through. They find some clues, but are unsure how to interpret them. They start to disagree on what course to take, and soon begin to clash among themselves.As the secrets of the cave unfold further, the group now turns its focus purely to survival. They feel they are unable to fully trust one another. And they are rapidly becoming unable to trust their own visions and thoughts. As reality blurs still further, so does the distinction between what is life ... and what is death.Sources and clues unwind the cave’s mysteries at last, and the result leads to a most shocking conclusion to Gehenna - Where Death Lives ...Hiroshi speaks about the Essence of Horror: A truly great horror film should first and foremost strive to be a great film.Too many horror films today feature one-dimensional characters, formulaic story progression, and a reliance on gore. Gehenna - Where Death Lives will rely instead on those elements which make any film great - an excellent story line, believable characters, a talented cast, and tasteful direction. Of course, to be great within the horror genre, the believable characters have to be placed in a predicament, and the depth of the predicament must grow throughout the film, so that worry and concern turn to dread, panic, and terror. Then there is the technical side of a great horror film - also hugely important - in our case, practical effects from an amazing team of effect artists (there is nothing more realistic than practical effects, and our team of artists is second to none), plus the skilled use of lighting, camera, music, and other devices.As director, the test for my success is whether the viewers undergo transference, where they care so much about the characters, and empathize so much with their predicament, that they subconsciously transfer themselves into the story as a character or alongside a character - (think whether you identified with Shelley Duvall in The Shining, James Caan in Misery, the fabulous Cabin in the Woods [that I worked on], and of course, a lot of Hitchcock). Because when a viewer inserts themselves into the film, then their heart beat accelerates, and they think and feel alongside the characters. It blurs the distinction between the film and reality and viewers are immersed. it is from that distinction and that immersion that you get true horror, or - to put it more out there - a film that will scare the&%$^#@% out of you.I will strive to deliver this, and that is a promise. (And if you have a pacemaker recently installed, please don't back this project; I suggest a comedy.)THE MEANING OF GEHENNAThe word Gehenna dates back to the early Hebrew Bible - an evil place where children were sacrificed by fire as tribute to false idols - later expanded to mean the valley of slaughter, an accursed place, a destination of the wicked, and the final punishment of the ungodly.In the New Testament, Gehenna took on the broader meaning of a place where punishment was endless, and was used as a metaphor for hell. In Matthew 5:29, Christ states that it is better to lose an eye than to be thrown into Gehenna. In summary ... it is a very nasty place.Saipan is an island in the western Pacific Ocean; it is one of the Northern Mariana Islands, proximal to Guam. The Battle of Saipan took place during World War II, in 1944. It is known for some of the fiercest fighting of the war, with heavy casualties, a determination to fight ""down to the last man"", its many suicides, and rumors of far worse.Top: Located in the Pacific between Japan and the Philippines, today's Saipan is idyllic and tourism is a primary industry. It's past is cloaked in mystery and not quite forgotten. Bottom: Saipan had some of the fiercest fighting in World War II, with many casualties and rumors of horrifying things.The island periphery consists of beaches, lagoons, cliffs, and reefs, and its interior is mountainous. It has many caves, which were used during the war for hiding during the day, and making sorties at night.Later referred to as Hell's Pocket and Death Valley, Saipan was chosen by Hiroshi for its large caves, used as bases during the war. Saipan is a place laden with superstition and folklore, and there is some real life horror embedded in its 20th Century history. (On a lighter note, a young future film star named Lee Marvin was shot in the buttocks during the Battle of Saipan and received the Purple Heart.)Hiroshi Katagiri was born in Japan, loved film as a child, showed artistic talent, and moved to the US at age 18 to pursue a career in special makeup effects. He became a primary artist at Stan Winston Studios,mastering the art of sculpture and character creation at a high level, which led to him being a sought-after (creature) designer by Steven Spielberg (3 films - Jurassic Park, A.I., and War of the Worlds), as well as Rob Marshal, Guillermo del Toro, Sam Raimi, and others. His39 film credits in special effects, and 11 in makeup effects also include such titles as Wolverine, Pirates of the Caribbean, Alien v Predator Requiem, Cabin in the Woods, and The Hunger Games. His TV credits include being part of an Emmy winning team for The X-Files. He is a true fan of the horror genre, and has written and directed several acclaimed horror shorts.Hiroshi is dedicated to his craft, loves to work, and also loves to teach. His sculpture seminars are widely attended in both the US and Japan. He is a longtime student of Aikido - a Japanese martial art that teaches one to ""unify their life energy"".It has been his ultimate dream to now produce and direct a full length feature film that will scare the pants off its audience, and he is thankful for all interest and support.below: Hiroshi speaks on his personal love of film, horror, and practical effects. Practical Effects are special effects that are produced physically, without use of post-production techniques like photographic manipulation and computer generation. Practical Effects involve the use of sculpture, prosthetic makeup, animatronics, puppetry, suitmation, and other techniques that most realistically create the appearance of living creatures.Other Practical Effects include the use of scale models (Miniature Effects), aerial rigging (Mechanical Effects), pyrotechnics (for fire and explosions), and squibs (for gunshot wounds). Gehenna - Where Death Lives will feature many Practical Effects of the highest order, created by Hiroshi Katagiri and his All-star team of true makeup and special effects masters.Doug JonesYes, he was the Silver Surfer. He was also in Hocus Pocus, Pan's Labyrinth, both Helboy films, and the list goes on. Well known to fans of science fiction, fantasy, and horror alike, actor Doug Jones began his career as a contortionist, and his lithe malleable frame had made him ideal for playing characters that are non-human (or barely human). Says Hiroshi: ""Schedule permitting, Doug Jones will be perfect as the creepy old man. Yet in real life he is not old, and definitely not creepy. This is because he is such an excellent actor.""Top, L to R: Mike Elizalde working on Jones, Jones and Hiroshi after a long day, and Hiroshi with Jones as the creepy old man. Bottom - a few of the many non-human characters embodied by the amazing Jones.Spectral MotionSpectral Motion is an award-winning and Oscar-nominated effects house helmed by Mike Elizalde whose mission is ""to elevate the art and science of practical visual effects by tirelessly striving to build a better creature"". Says Hiroshi: ""They have been so helpful to me in my career, and it is an honor to have them aboard Gehenna - Where Death Lives.""Award-winning sculptor, painter, and creature creator, worked on Godzilla, created Grommash Hellscream (from Warcraft), and was concept artist and coordinator on Predator. Co-owner of Alliance Studio. Says Hiroshi: ""When Steve came aboard, I knew I now had one of the top all-star makeup and effects teams ever assembled for an indie horror film.""Joey OroscoJoey is a master sculptor and painter. His work has been featured in many gigantic films, including Avatar, Superman (Man of Steel), and all 3 Jurassic Park films. He also designs fine art. Says Hiroshi: ""Joey is an amazing talent and a good friend, it is like working with my brother.""Mike ElizaldeArtist, businessman, and - Hiroshi says: ""guy who has helped me a lot"". Supreme boss at Spectral Motion, and a huge proponent of practical effects; honored to have him personally involved as an artist, in addition to his company and all the talent it brings with it.Kouji TajimaYoung, talented concept artist, based in Singapore, expert at 3-D modeling, worked on Hunger Games: Catching Fire, Godzilla, Transcendence, many others. His Gehenna poster will rock.Tim GoreTim is an innovator with a 30 year track record (even though he doesn't look old enough for that). His diverse styling has been seen in Passion of the Christ, X-Men: The Last Stand, The Chronicles of Riddick, both Hellboy films, and lots of TV. Says Hiroshi - ""a talented guy, knows all about teamwork"".Neil WinnAn experienced effects guy and top--notch painter. Films include Fantastic Four, Pacific Rim, and Hansel and Gretel. His sketches, digital and oil paintings are also masterful. Says Hiroshi: ""a true artist with an artist's heart"".TIMELINE:HIROSHI'S COMMENTS: The pre-production period for Gehenna - Where Death Lives commences soon after the conclusion of the Kickstarter campaign; the shooting commences 4 months later (entirely in Los Angeles), and post-production is projected to be a 4 to 6 month process. Obviously, we will be able to fulfill rewards earlier than October, 2016 - BUT - we cannot realistically send out DVD's and downloads for a film that we want to release to art cinemas and other locations near Halloween. However, many rewards, like sculptures, t-shirts, and posters WILL go out much earlier.BUDGET/USE OF PROCEEDS:After Kickstarter fees, credit card processing fees, and the fulfillment of all Rewards, the balance of the budget will be spent as follows:35% on Pre-Production: props, costumes, set building, and special makeup and other practical effects.35% on Shooting: cast and crew (talent and staff); camera and lighting and sound; and misc (location fees, food and amenities, etc. ).15% on Post-Production: mostly (sound and video) editing.15% on Pre-Marketing and Pre-Distribution effortsHIROSHI'S COMMENTS: Obviously, $220,000 for a full-length feature film with world-class effects seems ambitious. However, consider that thefilm shoots entirely in Los Angeles, and within that, takes place almost entirely in a cave/bunker, thus limiting the expense of set creation. Consider that the primary characters who enter the cave/bunker get sealed in, so the number of overall characters in this film is limited; this also adds efficiency to the production. Consider that the special makeup and other practical effects used in this film, will be largely engineered and executed from my friends and associates of my many years in this business, who will deliver masterful results, partly as a labor of love. And consider that my post-production team are also longtime friends and associates. In summary, if the Kickstarter campaign succeeds, the film Gehenna - Where Death Lives, will be made, it will be awesome and scary, and all rewards will be delivered fully and on a timely basis, perhaps even sooner than projected.This project has come to Kickstarter for several reasons, mostly so that Gehenna: Where Death Livescan be an independent film, true to the vision of its creator. Hiroshi's visions are specific - especially in terms of what constitutes great horror, and how the use of practical effects is best and most realistic - and he believes that the Kickstarter community is his best option for ensuring support of these visions, which he believes will add to the impact and success of the film. In his own words:HIROSHI'S COMMENTS: I am big fan of Kickstarter and have seen how many creative visions have remained independent because the community believes in respect of its artists, more than to use formulas from big corporations. I have done much work on big budget and small budget films, and I love them both and understand how the process is different. Over years, I have planned this film, from idea to script to building team. Everything so far is from my sweat and my head and my own limited funds.Gehenna: Where Death Lives is a horror film where there are plausible characters in a confusing situation at first, that becomes more strange and finally terrifying. The building of suspense will be with both steady and sudden events, and the way the cast of characters reacts to clues, this character development is a little different than typical Hollywood horror. I think everyone will like this difference, and they will find it delivers. I am glad to live in the time of Kickstarter so that this campaign is possible. Arigato!Our goal was to make the Rewards desirable at all levels. Every backing counts, and we are all part of the same kickstarter community.For only $15, you get a digital download of the film, for only $28 ($20 if you act early) you get downloads of the film, script, and cool artwork. Beginning at the $60 level, you get thanked in the film credits. The crew t-shirt is beautifully designed, and the poster (by Kouji Tajima) will be an item you'll cherish.Higher levels in the hundreds include hanging with Hiroshi and talking film, touring Spectral Motion (amazing place; just what's on the shelves will blow you away ...), tickets to Premiers and After Parties (LA, Tokyo), and then - beginning at $410 - awesome fine art sculpture busts of creepy Gehenna characters.For those seeking a truly special experience (and a great gift idea) - you can play a dead guy (or an extra) in the film, be involved as an Associate Producer, or even be an Executive Producer with territorial rights(subject to discussion).And finally, for those seeking valuable, cool, amazing, and - did I say valuable - collectibles, there are uniforms and props, Hiroshi will sculpt your face (you can proudly call it ""Creepy Me""), there are life-sized creepy bust sculptures by Hiroshi, or you can choose one of the two coolest, most one-of-a-kind items - Steve Wang's Creepy Guy on Floor, or the full body puppet of Creepy Old Man worn by Doug Jones.Arigato!","Hiroshi says: Making a full length feature film is a challenge, for me and for anyone, even for a major studio. It is a substantial endeavor, with many moving parts. I have done my best to minimize risk and maximize use of funds without the slightest compromise to quality, and I have done this in several ways:1. The lion's share of the film takes place in the cave/bunker, and so there are a limited number of sets. This adds efficiency to the production, and also creates an eerie environment to serve as a justifiable basis for the terrifying experiences of the characters.  2. The characters who enter the cave/bunker get sealed in, and although there are a few additional characters (and specters representing their personal nightmares,) there is a limited number of overall characters in this film, which also adds efficiency to the production, and makes the viewer more likely to identify with one in particular. Watch out who you pick. 3. The special makeup and other practical effects used in this film, will be largely engineered and executed from my friends and associates of my many years in this business. This also adds efficiency to the production, while delivering the most masterful effects from the most top-level talent imaginable.4. I have substantial experience and great understanding of the film making process and have detailed a realistic schedule of scope of work, time frames, and budgets.In summary, if the Kickstarter campaign succeeds, the film Gehenna - Where Death Lives, will be made and all rewards will be delivered fully and on a timely basis.Thank you. - HK"

Please have a look at “Current progress and future plan” and check the details of “Rewards”. And, please become our “Backers”この一文だけではまだ、どんなものかよくわからないPSVitaユーザーのあなた、はじめまして。上越電子工業株式会社です。少し長くはなるがこのあとの「本製品の背景と詳細　Background and detail」をご覧いただければ、弊社の製品がPS4,PSVitaユーザーのみなさまにとって必須アイテムであることがきっと理解いただけるはず。是非、バッカーになって、楽しいゲームライフのお供として弊社の製品を使っていただきたい。If you have your PSVita, but don’t get idea what it is, nice to meet you. We are JEC. You will know how beneficial this product is for all users of PS4 and PSVita, through“Background and detail” below. We wish our product helps your happy gaming life, and you join our “Backers”.<背景>わたしたちJECの事業メインは基板実装だ。最近では家庭用ゲーム機のアクセサリーの開発にも力を入れている。2015年に「PSVita2000型用 L2/R2ボタン搭載グリップカバー」と「PSVita1000型用 L2/R2ボタン搭載グリップカバー」を発売。このグリップに搭載された物理ボタンを押せばvitaの背面タッチパッド上に割り当てられたL2/R2を指で直接触れることなく入力することが可能となる。これで「リモートプレイ」を利用する際の操作性が向上する。「リモートプレイ」とは据え置きゲーム機『PS4』のソフトを離れた場所で携帯ゲーム機の『PSVita』を使い遠隔操作することを言う。テレビなどのモニターがなくとも環境に縛られず、自由なスタイルでゲームを楽しむことができるのが「リモートプレイ」だ。ただ、『PS4』と『PSVita』はそもそもコントローラーの形状やボタンの配置、ボタンの有無などに違いがある。そのため、操作感覚にはそれぞれ違いがある。[Background]The main part of our business is board mounting. Recently, we are focusing on the development and manufacture of game peripheral devices. We released “L2/R2 Button Grip Cover for PSVita PCH-2000”and “L2/R2 Button Grip Cover for PSVita PCH-1000” in 2015.  This PS Vita grips that add L2 /R2 buttons provide you for a more comfortable use of PS4 “Remote Play”. “Remote Play” is a feature that allows you to play your PS4 games from anywhere far. You can enjoy your gaming life as you like without TV or any displays. However, there are some difference in the shape of PS4 controller and PSVita controller. And it makes the gap on control feeling.特に操作に影響がでるのが『PS4』のコントローラーに存在する「L2/R2」というボタンが『PSVita』にはないという点だ。その代わり『PSVita』の背面にはタッチパッド機能がある。このタッチパッド部分に『PS4』の「L2/R2」ボタンが割り当てられていることが多い（ゲームソフトによっては前面スクリーンに割り当てられることもある）。しかしこのパッドには配置場所ゆえに「誤入力の誘発」、「タッチしづらい」というユーザーの声があった。そこで弊社のグリップカバーは本来『PSVita』にはない「L2/R2」ボタンを搭載した。このボタンを押すことでクリップ内部の機構を通じ、ゲーム機本体の背面パッドが反応する仕組みになっている。「ゲームをより遊びやすく」をデザインの根幹に据え、『PSVita』の機能を最大限発揮できる周辺機器を目指した。タッチパネルはシンプルな操作に対し効果的だが、不意の誤動作を引き起こしやすい。一方ボタンを押す動作は入力の有無が明確になることで、ユーザーに安心感を与え、複雑な操作を可能にする。このカバーを付けることで『PSVita』の機能の素晴らしさを多くのユーザーに知ってもらえると思い開発した。The biggest difference that affects playing is PSVita doesn’t have L2/R2 buttons that PS4 controller has. Instead of these buttons, PSVita has touchpad on its back. This touchpad often has a function as PS4’s L2/R2. But, this touchpad had comments from users, such as ‘causing miss touch’ and ‘hard to touch’ due to its location. That was why our grip cover was released with L2/R2 buttons. The inside structure delivers input to touchpad on its backside by pushing buttons. The idea based on the design was ‘better gaming experience’. We set a goal to create new accessory that maximize the function of PSVita. Touch-panel is suited for simple input actions, however it often causes mistake. A movement of pulling buttons is much definite way of input, and it lets players relieved and enables complicated controlling. We thought we can deliver better gaming experience with PSVita for more people, and we developed this grip cover.その後2016年には、前面のスクリーン側の上部にL2/R2が割り当てられたゲームソフトのために、新たに前面と背面の両面に対応するグリップカバー「前面背面タッチパッド対応型L2/R2ボタン搭載グリップカバー」を発売した。ただしこの製品はPSVitaのなかでもPCH-2000モデルの専用カバーで、長らくPCH-1000専用の前面スクリーンに対応したグリップカバーは発売していなかった。それは、PCH-2000モデルに比べ、PCH-1000の利用者は世界的にみても少ないため、需要自体も少ないと考えていたからだ。しかし、実際には背面のみ対応の既存モデル「PSVita1000型用 L2/R2ボタン搭載グリップカバー」は今なお根強い人気があり、また、前面に対応したPSVita1000型用のグリップがほしいというユーザーからの声も今なお多数弊社のもとに届いている。In 2016, we released “L2/R2 Button [Front and Back touch screen] Grip Cover for PSVita PCH-2000” that both front and back sides for games that configure L2/R2 on the upper side of front screen. However, this product was only for PCH-2000, grip cover with L2/R2 buttons on front screen for PCH-1000 was not released for long period. Because, we thought there is a few demands only comparing the numbers of user for PCH-2000. But, actually existing model, grip cover added L2/R2 on back touch panel side “L2/R2 Button Grip Cover for PSVita PCH-1000” is still popular, and we have received a lot of requests on PCH-1000 grip cover added L2/R2 buttons on front screen side for PCH-1000  from users.<詳細>私たちはKICKSTARTERを通じ、樹脂成型のための金型費用の資金調達を行い、新たにPSVita1000型用の「L2/R2前面ボタン」後付けパーツを開発したいと考えている。「L2/R2前面ボタン」後付けパーツの構造はすでに発売済の「PSVita2000型用前面背面タッチパッド対応型L2/R2ボタン搭載グリップカバー」の構造を踏襲し、さらに改良を加えたものとなる。すでに「PSVita1000型用 L2/R2ボタン搭載グリップカバー」を持っているユーザーが後付けで「L2/R2後付け前面ボタン」を装着することで、両面対応のグリップカバーとなる。支援いただいた「バッカー」のみなさまには、「リワード」として完成した「L2/R2後付け前面ボタン」を用意する。また、まだグリップカバー本体を持っていないユーザーのために「PSVita1000型用 L2/R2ボタン搭載グリップカバー」と「L2/R2後付け前面ボタン」をセットにしたリワードも用意する。[Detal]We want to develop new “L2/R2 front button upgrade parts for PSVita PCH-1000” by raising funds for a cost of a mold with KICKSTARTER.

The simple idea of taking your baby out of the house entails a surprising amount of responsibilities. One of the most troublesome is trying to carry the countless items of things for your baby, from bringing toys to handling a baby stroller. Parents often bring thermal bottles to maintain the right temperature for their baby’s milk. This is not only very heavy to carry around, but it also takes up a lot of space! However, not bringing thermal bottles out is not an option. If you are looking for hot water in public, it could result in a disaster. You would have to resort to ask for hot water from convenient stores or from restaurants nearby. Yet even if you do find the water, there is still the risk of the water being unhygienic, or it being the wrong temperature; either too hot for reheating breast milk or too cold for making formula milk.  Algoflame Milk Warmer’s PRECISE CONTROL allows you to accurately heat up your beverage to any temperature you want in minutes!The Algoflame accommodates to your infant’s needs by demonstrating a various range of temperatures by colors. A green light indicates the beverage is ready to drink. Red light indicates that the temperature is too hot.You can use Algoflame Milk Warmer in most feeding bottles you can find in the market. You can also use it to heat other beverages, such as coffee or tea!Your safety is our priority!Algoflame Milk Warmer is made of food-grade materials. It also has double safety system.

Printersare becoming better and better, with higher print speeds, new features and capabilities. It is now time for the 3D printers' counterpart, the filament extruder, to join the race.Introducing the DNA Extruder, a never-before-seen combination of speed, precision, quality and aesthetics. An entirely new approach to the filament extrusion process.DNA is a new and innovative filament extruder created by Protea Design. Meticulously engineered, DNA is aiming to bring a new meaning to dependable high-speed extrusion. Our goal was to create an extruder which has features and performance of a machine double its price. After nearly 3 years of development we were able to create something that is compact, fast, tough, lightweight, affordable and easy to use. The DNA Extruder will be the last filament extruder you will ever want to own.  During development of DNA we paid special attention to solving the issue of slow extrusion that many extruders available on the market face. With the use of our patent pending screw and barrel design we were able to increase extrusion speed to levels never before seen in an extruder priced below $1,000 or even $2,000. The DNA Extruder is capable of extruding filament at a rate of 10 feet per minute, which amounts to 1 full roll of filament in 1 hour. These speeds were easily reached even while extruding ABS materials, which is a much tougher material to extrude than PLA. With the extrusion speeds provided by the DNA Extruder you will never have to wait more than 1 hour to get back to 3D printing with a full roll of filament.To keep up with the extrusion speed of the machine, we equipped the extruder with a hopper large enough to hold roughly 1kg of pellets when fully loaded. With a fully loaded hopper you will be able to extrude an entire roll of filament in one go. Just load the hopper and have a brand new roll of filament in an hour. No more waiting around and feeding the machine, or being restricted by a small hopper.Specifically for this project we designed a new and innovative thermoplastic extrusion screw and barrel combo, which allowed us to reduce the overall size of the machine and provides users with a machine capable of extruding a higher quality filament. The use of this specific thermoplastic extrusion screw helps to promote higher pumping pressure for extraction of water vapor and air from the filament, and improves mechanical operation through a direct connection to the motor. All of this amounts to a much higher quality and consistency of filament being extruded. Each extrusion screw is individually machined out of a block of steel and tested by a professional before it is delivered to us for further testing and installation.The DNA Extruder is ready to go in minutes. Equipped with a 600W internationally compatible power supply, DNA allows you to easily switch between 110V and 220V whenever the situation requires. What's even better, there are no special plugs or cables needed to get the extruder going. We decided to make things as simple as possible by giving you the ability to use the same power cable you use for your PC. This allowed us to reduce costs and simplify everyone's lives just a little more.Continuing with our focus on simplification, we made DNA very easy to operate. The temperature is adjustable up to 250C with the use of a digital PID temperature control unit. Speed is also user specified and can be adjusted with a simple twist of the wrist. There are separate switches for the extruder, the heatband and the motor.The DNA Extruder is ready to go in minutes. Just don't forget to let the machine warm-up.The enclosure is a one-piece unibody design made from a lightweight, high tensile strength, and heat resistant polyurethane material, bringing the extruder’s final weight to a total of 4.7kg when fully assembled. The unibody design gave us the ability to reduce weight by excluding extra materials that would be used to connect multiple pieces together. This design also provides increased rigidity and toughness to the enclosure. We further strengthened the enclosure by designing mounting points for mechanical components in areas which appeared to need reinforcement. Each shell is individually checked for any structural weaknesses or defects before assembly begins.One of our biggest focuses when designing the DNA Extruder was to reduce the final price and increase availability of replacement parts. This lead us to using easily found components rather than custom components. Watch the video below to find out more about what we use.  There is a simple reason for choosing to extrude your own filament. It's much cheaper. And with the use of the DNA Extruder, the costs just keep falling. The efficiency that is offered by DNA will have you getting a return on your investment in no time. Whether you decide to make filament for your own 3D Printing needs or for sale to others, there is no better choice than DNA.

Thank you for showing interest in our project.PRESS KITHave a look at our journey creating the DNA Extruder!","Just like with any new product, there are always risks and challenges. However, it is our mission at Protea Design to anticipate and mitigate any that may arise. Unlike many KickStarter projects, we have finalized our prototype and found manufacturers and suppliers for each component way before starting our campaign. Furthermore, we have already received a production sample of each component and have tested everything for durability and high quality that we at Protea Design are requiring each of our suppliers to provide. We wanted to be confident that we could meet any demand that might be generated and avoid delays or faulty components. Each of our suppliers have passed the quality and timeliness test, reinforcing our confidence in this campaign. Nonetheless, there is always a chance that something can go wrong on the supplier side, no matter how much you prepare. Therefore, we have backup suppliers for our components and stand behind our promise to deliver a quality product to each and every one of our backers without fail. If for any reason there are delays or any issues do happen to arise, we will make sure to update everyone on the situation and what is being done to resolve it.",https://www.kickstarter.com/projects/704208956/selectra-multi-material-system-for-your-3d-printer?ref=discovery_category_newest,704208956/selectra-multi-material-system-for-your-3d-printer,"Good news!! --> No one likes to read a ton of text so we've kept it essential in this campaign!Even better news!!! ---> Expand your printing capability with Selectra, the multi channel filament feeder for all! No longer just for team orange°, now YOU can enjoy this capability too!Selectra is a multi channel filament feeder system for typical 1.75mm FDM 3d printers and allows dynamic filament switching during a print. Users are able to combine any colour, any material or any colour and material. We refer to this capability as ""Multichromat"", multiple chroma + multiple material. All of this driven by only two stepper motors and your existing electronics!Current consumer level 3d printing is essentially a monochrome process and although users are able to select any 3d printable material or colour variant to print with, the choice is locked until the print job completes. At the moment, the costs involved with printing multichromat is typically accepted as being high, not just in terms of price, but also retrofit limitations, complexity and space requirements for additional hardware. Primarily designed for 1.75mm Bowden tube type printers, Selectra replaces your existing filament feeder and also adds a 5 to 1 splitter block in the flow path towards the hotend. Selectra has also been tested with direct drive extrusion systems. Although a more advanced retrofit, this case sees Selectra feed the hotend mounted stepper its required material. An excellent solution for ultra-mega-flexible materials.Functionality relies on either a second separate* extruder stepper driver port on your 3d printer’s control board OR an electronic switch expansion**. You are able to use Selectra if one of the above requirements are met.Retrofit is pretty straight forward. Users are required to print a mount for their specific printer(s), hook-up the wires and tubes, and enable dual extrusion in their firmware. ""Extruder"" is the name given a mechanical assembly consisting of a raw material feeder and an extrusion shape die. Within your 3d printer, these parts would consist of the filament feeder + hotend assembly. Selectra can be thought of as a collection of filament feeders, stacked together into an compact package. Combined with its selection mechanism, a single feeder within this stack is referred to as a ""channel"". Due to the way Selectra works, there can theoretically be any number of channels beyond the 5 channels currently offered. As mentioned, Selectra uses two stepper motors, they are employed as follows: The feeder stepper is connected to the control board’s primary extruder driver port in order to be driven like any monofilament system. The selection stepper is connected to any free stepper driver on the main board. The user must ensure that ""Dual extrusion"" is activated in the 3d printer’s firmware before attempting operation. In case you are thinking of going the expansion board route: All steppers are connected to their particular output port on the expansion board. The board itself is connected to the specified auxiliary signal pins on your 3D printer's controller. Finally, the extruder stepper driver (typically labeled ""E0"") is connected to the input of the expansion board. Within a channel, Selectra drives filament by means of a hybridized constant distance - constant pressure pinch wheel mechanism. The result allows for a firm grip on the filament when operating and a zero contact idle position.At the heart of the selection mechanism is a linear cam, driven by the rotation of a threaded rod (selector shaft) as mounted on the selection stepper. Thus, depending on the selection stepper's direction of rotation, the selector shaft causes the cam to advance or retract. Each one of Selectra's channels are comprised of: Channels are engaged by means of the channel actuator block being displaced when the selection cam interferes with its resting position. This displacement causes the actuator to push on the transfer spring thereby causing any filament in a given channel to be pushed against the main filament drive shaft. The full displacement position from the cam results in a compression of the transfer spring, supplying constant force to the filament via the pinch wheel. If you happen to select an empty channel, the idler block will NOT come in contact with the filament drive shaft at all. Awesome!Each Selectra kit will at least include the following:User supplied parts must include:The name “Selectra” is derived from a combination of the English “select” (to carefully choose the best or most suitable) and the Italian “allegro” (a musical term to describe a brisk or quick pace). Together they describe the ability to choose the right thing, quickly.Finally, we would like to mention that you can choose to grab some extra value ad libitum.ADD-ON INSTRUCTIONS: To include an add-on with your pledge, follow these steps carefully:1) Press the ""Manage Your Pledge"" button.

Will the Blu-ray include original Japanese audio tracks and English subtitles?A. Yes, both English/Japanese character voices will be available for you to switch between, and also on/off for English subtitles.Q. How can I back both the Anime(Blu-ray) and Live Action movies?A. By popular demand, we have prepared add-on menus. Please check the ""NEWS: Reward Add-Ons started!"" section below.Konnichiwa from Tokyo! Maybe you've read the online comics, heard about it from a friend, saw it on Crunchyroll or just happen to stumble on this page... welcome!Whatever your experience with ""The Island of Giant Insects"" a.k.a. ""Kyochu Retto"" might be, we are here to join hands to take this Japanese anime movie to a WHOLE new level - an ""English Dubbed Final Edition"" so you, and the world can FINALLY experience this cult hit insect survival horror to its MAX potential.Originally an online comic series, ""The Island of Giant Insects"" (""Kyochu Retto"" in Japanese) is a fresh take on the survival horror + ""ero-gro"" (erotic and grotesque) genre - combining it with accurate and detailed depiction of insect ecology. It has become a cult hit not only in Japan but all over the world. Recently it was turned into a long awaited anime movie, hit theaters in Japan, and internationally streaming on Crunchyroll with added English subtitles.The story starts off with a school trip plane crash, causing a group of students to be cast ashore on an island infested with gigantic insects.The palm-sweating survival horror scenario combined with realistic depiction of monster insects, blood, guts, gore, and ""ecchi""(erotic/sexy)... it's everything you could dream of, from a Japanese cult movie. Don't believe me, just watch the trailer! (Top of page)Here are some screenshots from the current anime movie - remember, it's this good already, and we are trying to make it EVEN BETTER!So the current version of the anime movie is already released in theaters in Japan, and internationally on Crunchyroll with English subtitles. Why do we need an ""English Dubbed Final Edition""?Obviously trying to follow the subtitles is a HUGE distraction that can limit the movie's full expressive and exciting potential. Especially when the movie is all about fast-paced, visually-oriented scenes filled with blood, sex and gore! (Not to mention the main character Mutsumi's bombardment of insect-maniac info the movie centers its theme and plot on.) We are almost certain the movie has so much more to see and feel, only if we could allow you the freedom from being glued to the small text at the bottom of the screen. And we want to take you there.With the current version, some of the extremely sexy/gory scenes were partially censored for Japanese movie industry ratings, but for this ""English Dubbed Final Edition"", we will get rid of all that - for all you sick minds' viewing pleasure ;)On top of this, imagine the giant insects buzzing, girls screaming and moaning, and blood & guts splattering ALL AROUND you. With the successful funding of this campaign, it will allow us to release the movie's first ever Blu-ray disk with 5.1 surround sound.*IMPORTANT NOTE: Sorry backers in Japan, we can only offer Blu-ray to backers OUTSIDE OF JAPAN, due to the production team's initial contract terms.＊ご注意点：申し訳ございません、映画製作者で定めた契約条件により、日本国内のユーザーに向けて「Blu-ray」を提供することができません。To make things even more exciting, we will create new scenes that will integrate with this Kickstarter campaign.

This will be the creator team's dream-come-true, to finally have our work break language barriers, cross borders and become an international anime it deserves to be.As some of you may know, this is our 2nd try for this project here on Kickstarter. 1st time around we tried to pack too much, which raised the bar too high. (Still managed to fund approximately 30k yen = 27k dollars from close to 200 people!) Learning from that experience, we now know exactly what our fans and audience are looking for. So we managed to slim down everything to cut down unnecessary costs, all while keeping what's important and fun. All we need to do is collect about the same amount as last time, and we're there!

So I'm a very new developer on the Gamejolt scene and I'm looking to create my first game and make sure the game is complete and working. As it's my first game, I'm starting small so I have something to add to my portfolio. Endless 8-Bit Shooter is a game to just mess around on. This game has no story, no meaning, just a game to beat your highscore and waste some time. This game is in early development and will be way different once the game is completely finished.Plan:So the game is already published on Gamejolt but the game is still in very very early development. The game was released just to show off a basic concept of how the game will work. I plan to develop this game into letting the player have full customizable control over their character and allowing the player to keep finding new parts to the game.Budget:The game, as you can tell, is a complete indie game and is very small so the game won't take a whopping amount of cash to develop. The only thing I'll be needing is an extra artist who will help me design a crazy amount of customisation and maps.",Possibility of data loss and files loss but I'll be happy to redraw and program the game if needs be.

https://www.kickstarter.com/projects/pablovillalba/guh-la-linea-de-juguetes?ref=discovery_category_newest,pablovillalba/guh-la-linea-de-juguetes,"Mi nombre es Pablo Villalba soy diseñador gráfico canario amante de las ideas y la creación de proyectos, si son sociales mucho mejor. No puedo dejar ninguna libreta sin ideas. Mis últimos proyectos fueron la publicación de dos libros: Ninguna idea es una mierda y La historia de Caperucita multicolor y el lobo feroz, este último es un libro para que los niños puedan colorear a Caperucita a su manera mientras leen el clásico cuento del lobo feroz.Guh nació del sueño de ayudar a los niños y niñas con TEA con el objetivo de conseguir un juguete que les ayudará en su día a día y al mismo tiempo ser un juguete más que usen para dejar libre su imaginación.El proyecto comenzó como parte de un Doctorado en Diseño donde empece todo el proceso previo al diseño con la idea de trabajar codo con codo con la institución APANATE (TENERIFE) especializada en personas con TEA. Por falta de tiempo tuve que paralizar el doctorado pero con la idea de continuar el proyecto por libre ¿mi meta? llegar a tener el juguete real y que pueda usarse libre por todos aquellos que lo necesiten.El problema es la fabricación de los prototipos y el coste que supone, por cada prototipo en dimensiones reducidas tenía que pagar unos 20€, cantidad alta porque el proyecto requiere muchas pruebas de ensayo y error. Por otro lado se pierde mucho tiempo mientras esperas que un tercero realice la impresión.Para poder fabricar el juguete necesito tener una impresora 3D en casa, una sencilla que me permita por lo menos hacer los diversos prototipos.La impresora que quiero comprar es la siguiente:La impresora tiene un coste de 300€ más los colores de bobina de impresión que necesito para fabricar el juguete. Para los prototipos podría usar un único color pero para el juguete final si necesitaría varios colores.Es un juguete que puede ser usado tanto por una persona con TEA como con una persona neurotipica sin TEA, es simplemente un juguete que ayuda a la motricidad, habilidades sociales y como juguete.Guh busca ayudar de la siguiente manera:La idea es que colegios e instituciones puedan usar guh sin coste alguno si realizan ellos mismos la impresión o un coste reducido si tengo que realizar yo mismo la impresión.Con Guh nace una iniciativa para crear juguetes libres e inclusivos que busquen fomentar la imaginación de los más pequeños.El posible riesgo que puede ocurrir es la rotura de la impresora 3D, en ese caso buscaría arreglarla lo antes posible para continuar con el proyecto.Me apasionan el diseño y más aún poder ayudar haciendo lo que más me gusta, crear.Muchas gracias por la ayuda.Pablo Villalba","El posible riesgo que puede ocurrir es la rotura de la impresora 3D, en ese caso buscaría arreglarla lo antes posible para continuar con el proyecto.",https://www.kickstarter.com/projects/pablovillalba/diario-de-peter?ref=discovery_category_newest,pablovillalba/diario-de-peter,"Diario de Peter es un diario de genero ficticio donde se muestra una sociedad distopica donde las personas han dejado de sentir dolor de forma general.

It can be seen as captivating art; a form of art that demands contemplation. The mixture of words and pictures can tell a story, or highlight a pivotal moment. Themes are splashed over ever- changing canvases: billboards, tunnels, transportation, and buildings. Graffiti can be a way to connect with one’s community, or anonymously express yourself. The portable spray paint medium allows artists to create with ease, often spontaneously. Whether the graffiti is created spontaneously or methodically, its presence catches your eye and invokes a response.Why playing CardsPlaying cards have also recently become an eye catching, thought provoking art form. Much like the magician telling stories and evoking emotions, playing cards are a medium that can place you in a specific moment in time . For instance, that one time you tried to do a trick at your family holiday party, and it went awful. Maybe the cards bring memories of happier times; like when you completely nailed that move you had been practicing day in and day out. The Balloon Playing Cards deck captures the blend of iconic art with the allure of cardistry; the tuck alone can draw a viewer in and becomes a conversation starter. The design is meant to toe the line of street art and classic art styles, resulting in a timeless feel. This deck was created for any magician or table worker looking to add flare, and leave a lasting impression.The art- Girl with Balloon by BanksyGirl with Balloon is a series of stencil murals created by the graffiti artist Banksy. The murals depict a young girl with her hand extended toward a red heart-shaped balloon, carried away by the wind. Banksy’s first work appeared in 2002, on the Waterloo Bridge in London.Several other murals graced buildings around the city, although as of present day they have been removed. Banksy has used several variants of this design to support social campaigns including: the West Bank Barrier (2005),Syrian refugee crisis ( 2014) , and UK elections (2017). The last work had a profound impact on many citizens. A 2017 Samsung poll ranked Girl with Balloon as the United Kingdom's number one favorite artwork. In 2018 a framed copy of Girl with Balloon spontaneously shredded during an auction, by way of a mechanical device Banksy had hidden in the frame. Banksy confirmed he was responsible for the shredding and gave the altered piece a new name, Love is in the Bin. Sotheby's said it was ""the first work in history ever created during a live auction.""Influence by ArtistBanksy’s societal contributions through art have resonated with me for years. Given the level of expertise in deception of some master workers, I am shocked that this art has not been previously used in the card community. One motivation behind using Girl with Balloon was to preserve its notoriety, and to honor the social significance of the piece. So, with all respect to Banksy, I hope that this deck is well received by the card community.","Challenge will be how this deck and design is received by the community. This is my first time designing something like this, I don't have a name in the community. So I hope to gain some connections and friendships by being vulnerable and sharing my ideas on a public scale. I hope to learn through this project so that I can improve my designs with later decks in the future. The risk is solely my reputation, because a first impression is everything. Cost of this project is mainly to cover quality manufacturing of not only the playing cards from the United States Playing Card Company but also, designs of the private reserve, packaging of custom decks and shipping. The plan to overcome this is to follow through and provide the best level of quality that I know how to, reaching out to professionals in the field for guidance to ensure the best chances of completion of this campaign.

I was dragged on the internet by a roast page on instagram. I was given feedback that there wasn't enough media (i.e. pictures) so this campaign is my go at it again. I want to try and get the prototypes in the hands of those that did believe in this project. It's the least I can do for you guys. I'm going to reach out the USPC and see what's the lowest amount they are willing to produce but if nothing else, I will be getting the decks made by Shuffled Ink.

Have a great day! :DFAQWhat size will they be?These pins will be no larger than 35mm (1.38 inches)How many posts will each pin have?These pins will have between 1-2 postsWhat clasp is included with each pin?Each pin will include one of each clasp type (Military, Rubber, Deluxe)If all rewards are sold out but I still want some pins, how can I get them?if all rewards have been taken, you may still be able to buy the pins through my website (www.cloutarmy.com). These will be very limited, and may include “B"" grade pins at a discounted rate.What are these pins made out of?These pins will be made of iron or an alloy of.What grade will these pins be?These pins will be (on inspection) separated into two classes (A,B). Class “A"" are the pins in the most impeccable condition. Class “B"" pins will be pins that have slight defects due to the mass production process. This is commonplace with enamel pins. Don't worry, as a backer you can be assured that you will receive the highest quality pins.I love the artwork, who did it?Thank you! I love the artwork too. These were illustrated by the super talented Shayne Smith of Nineteenth Block. you can see his work and get in touch through his website: https://www.nineteenthblock.comWhat happens if the funding goal isn't met?If the funding goal isn't met, unfortunately I wont be able to have these pins produced, and these designs may never see the light of day :( I will be immensely grateful if you support this project.","One of the greatest challenges/risk involved with this project is finding a trustworthy manufacturer that also produces high quality pins. I have spent nearly two months engaging with nine manufacturers, obtaining prices, and samples to ensure I choose the most reliable and quality assured manufacturer. I have formed a strong relationship with two manufacturers and will engage one of them to produce these pins.Another risk taken is in relation to the artwork. I worked closely with a local artist to design these pins in relation to specific topics. I have already paid for these artworks so if funding is unsuccessful it will be a shame to not have these produced.Another challenge will be quality control of these pins. Whilst I have full confidence in the quality the manufacturer can produce, as with anything slight errors can happen. Because of this, Each pin will be hand inspected by myself before they are shipped to backers. This will ensure each backer receives the highest quality made pin. This will also allow me to randomly distribute the Limited Gold edition pins.A common risk with enamel pins are pins that have defects. From my research around 10-20% of an order depending on the size will be defects. This can include incorrect or missing colours, colours with specs of unwanted colours, or poor moulding. To reduce this risk I have factored in 30% of the entire order to be defective. This will ensure that all backers are guaranteed that all the pins they will receive are the best of the best. These are generally referred to as “A” grade pins. The defects are usually sorted into two classes “B” and “C” grades. These grades will be available after the campaign ends through my website cloutarmy.com.",https://www.kickstarter.com/projects/cloutarmy/fuck-2020-enamel-pins?ref=discovery_category_newest,cloutarmy/fuck-2020-enamel-pins,"2020 has been one crazy year.

Please share this project with your friends or with anyone who has a love of pins, memes, cheeky products.Thanks again! Have a great day! :D","Risks and challengesOne of the greatest challenges/risk involved with this project is finding a trustworthy manufacturer that also produces high quality pins. I have spent nearly two months engaging with nine manufacturers, obtaining prices, and samples to ensure I choose the most reliable and quality assured manufacturer.I have formed a strong relationship with two manufacturers and will engage one of them to produce these pins.  Another risk taken is in relation to the artwork.I worked closely with a local artist to design these pins in relation to specific topics. I have already paid for these artworks so if funding is unsuccessful it will be a shame to not have these produced.Another challenge will be quality control of these pins. Whilst I have full confidence in the quality the manufacturer can produce, as with anything slight errors can happen. Because of this, Each pin will be hand inspected by myself before they are shipped to backers. This will ensure each backer receives the highest quality made pin.This will also allow me to randomly distribute the Limited Gold edition pins.A common risk with enamel pins are pins that have defects. From my research around 10-20% of an order depending on the size will be defects. This can include incorrect or missing colours, colours with specs of unwanted colours, or poor moulding. To reduce this risk I have factored in 30% of the entire order to be defective. This will ensure that all backers are guaranteed that all the pins they will receive are the best of the best. These are generally referred to as “A” grade pins. The defects are usually sorted into two classes “B” and “C” grades. These grades will be available after the campaign ends through my website cloutarmy.com."

Follow Jack Asher as he becomes an all powerful Angel in this Scifi, action packed webcomic about a boy who will do anything to protect what is dear to him.Garden of Angels is an action packed, shonen inspired, scifi twist on Angels Vs. Demons. I have developed this idea for a while now and I have finally decided to do something with it and hire an artist! If you like action comics, mange, and shonen type anime this should be right up your ally! I am a sucker for heart heavy, hype moments! Character building! Interesting plots! Everything that makes your skin get goosebumps!In my idea Humanity is on the edge of total destruction. The only hope left is a super city known as the Garden. Protected by a barrier, the Garden houses all that is left of the population. The barrier and all of the sub cities are powered by a mysterious power known as Ark energy. In select humans, Ark energy can be injected into the bloodstream to gift them with incredible abilities known as Affinities. Humans with these affinities have the power to fight off Hellwalkers, to protect the Garden. They are known as Angels.Jack Asher is my main character in this story and when tragedy strikes, his destiny as something greater is realized. I DONT want to spoil too much but I really want to give you guys and idea of what im trying to create. As of now my prologue issue is in the works by an amazing Artist! I'll attach one of my teaser scenes done by him here!So as you can see this will be the art style of my webcomic which will be published to Webtoon.I have some character concepts that were done early on from another artist that I will attach and explain below!Jack is my main protagonist of this story. He is strong, determined, compassionate with a desire to protect what is dear to him. As tragedy strikes, Jack realizes that he is special. He has the power to harness Ark energy naturally.Evabell is an artificial Angel who is very distant and keeps to herself. She is a a good fighter and a dedicated soldier. Her only flaw is that she is afraid to get close to others.Sasha is a lose cannon with a flashy ability and a proud mouth. She fights hard as an Artificial Angel to prove her worth and show everyone that you can be anything you desire, even the greatest hero!Leo is a humble fighter who never gives up on trying to become strong. He is loyal to his team and an easy going character who likes to have fun. He is considered the weakest link, but he has every reason to change that.Noah is an artificial Angel created by the hands of Adam Prescott in hope to make a more powerful weapon. Noah is hard to get along with and doesn't mind calling others out. Deep down he wishes to be seen as more than a weapon.Enzo Sazashi is the steadfast leader of the Angel Squad. He is straight laced, strong willed, and ready to lay down his life for his team. He is a cool headed and tries his hardest to make sure the mission is a success.Adam Prescott. The creator of the Garden and the Angels. The discoverer of Ark energy. He has a mission to save the Earth from the hell invasion by any means necessary, but first he must make sure the Angels are ready to protect the Garden and his research.The Hellwalkers come in many forms, but all of them want the same thing. Total, Eternal suffering for all of humanity. They are savage, monstrous, powerful, and the biggest threat to all of humanity. The utilize the power of Hell Energy to trample any who stand in their way.Ash is the counterpart to my protagonist. Ash is on a mission to bring down the Garden and take out his ultimate foe, Jack. Ash is powerful, mean, and ready to do whatever it takes to strike a deal with the underlord himself. But just like Jack, Ash has a long way to go before he can become who he wants to be.I hope you guys can grasp what i'm trying to do here! I have already paid for the prologue out of my pocket to make my idea come to life. Funding this project would mean the world to me to try and put out something I think people would really like.I work a strenuous 40 hour a week job and I always find myself wanting to do more! I want to create stories that make you get goosebumps. Stories that make you shout, and cry, and feel for the characters in them. I have a lot planned for this idea and I hope that you guys can help me bang out this first part of my Webtoon! It may take a while because I only have a single artist but he is working hard to make something unique and individual!If you like Shonen, comics, manga, anime, or anything action packed and scifi slathered...please help me fund this! You would not only be a big help, you would be a crucial keystone in this series development!Thank you for reading my pitch!-Alex Melton",Common risks would include my artist falling ill or not being able to make the issues super fast. I think with a no rush time frame he can do wonders though!,https://www.kickstarter.com/projects/christophermelton/garden-of-angels-issue-one?ref=discovery_category_newest,christophermelton/garden-of-angels-issue-one,"The Garden is humanity's last frontier after the The Great Extraction, An extinction event that released Hell on Earth . Savage Demons from the depths stalk the Garden's Ark barrier, waiting for a way in. When the Barrier falls, the last line of defense is a group of individuals with the power to challenge Hell Itself: The Angels. Jack Asher aims to become the strongest Angel in a world where each fight could be humanity's last - but Jack has a secret that could change everything.Genre: Sci-fi / ActionThe Prologue issue is finally completed! So what’s next? Well, as of right now Episode One is now in the works as I type. My plan is to just get the issues created right now, I am still trying to figure out the best time to post them. Everyone who backs with $20 or more gets access to the Episode as soon as it is completed though. This gives you guys day one access to something awesome.I created this series and knew that I had to get it made into something. My artistic abilities are not the greatest. I decided if I wanted my story made into a Webcomic, I would need to hire an artist. I had some amazing character concepts done on Fiverr by Diogoddesigns to get me started. Check them out!My goal with the designs was to depict Angels in a sci-fi Realism type of way. My vision is to depict a more surreal version of Heaven vs. Hell. I tried to keep a good diversity to my character roster to give everyone a reason to enjoy my series. My idea was to create a story with characters you fall in love with and fight beside.Awesome fact about the Protagonist, Jack Asher: He is the first ever Human to possess natural Ark Powers (The type of energy powers the Angels use). Every other Angel is given the power artificially, using the Ark Serum.After I had the character concepts, I needed someone to tackle the Webtoon. I scrolled across some of Erik’s work on Tiktok and said “Man! I need that guy.” I messaged him about the work I needed and offered up $600+ dollars for a badass prologue issue. Erik is talented and he has been doing a wonderful job. This is his first Webtoon project ever (Same as me) and he is even juggling it between Art school. Dedicated. He works hard. I saw his style and It fit my vision perfectly, here’s some miscellaneous work done by Erik for GOA.Love this style!My inspiration for as you can see comes heavily from Shonen Manga / Anime. I’m a sucker for the Goosebumps, Big fights, and unmatched spirit these works offer. I also tend to lean heavy on the Sci-fi Genre. I love the sleek looks, Bright lights, and sick fights this genre can implore. Garden of Angels is the Child of everything that has given me goosebumps on screen or paper.I seek funding for this project because I work a simple job that is tight. I wish to continue to offer Erik the payment he deserves for his hard work because he also enjoys working on this series just as much as I do. I want people to read my comic and say “Oh Sh*t... that was awesome!”Please consider backing my project so that I can expand the world of The Garden and show the story of how Jack Asher becomes the most powerful Angel who can protect anyone. Your support matters to me immensely.Please be sure to follow the official social medias for Garden of Angels:Instagram: @GardenofangelsIgFacebook: @GardenofAngelsofficialFollow the talented artist Erik Meyers:Instagram: @GummysoleBack now and help me create a hit series!",Common Risks I see are just the typical unforeseen events such as a big event in my life or the artist's.

We seek to grow a readership and community around talent that is far too often overlooked and publish high quality and entertaining fiction. We want to publish a magazine that we ourselves would want to buy.We hope to deliver a new 48 page issue featuring over 30,000 words of content every three months and eventually monthly. Our first issue features several fascinating stories, essays and articles, as well as book and movie reviews. It also features a great interview and artists profile on artist Michael Rechlin and will also have a section devoted to tabletop gaming.The magazine will be available as a pdf and a print copy as well as on other platforms such as Amazon Kindle, Apple's iBooks, Kobo, etc. and will be released under the new publishing studio we have formed, Graveland Studios through www.magcloud.com.Who We Are? We’re tabletop roleplayers, authors, artists, graphic designers, jack-of-all trades and dreamers.What Are The Funds For?The money raised will go toward the purchase of interior art and acquiring new content in the form of fiction, essays and articles. Some of the funds will go toward promotion and advertising.If you are unable to contribute, remember that you can always help us spread the word. Post about this Kickstarter campaign on your blogs and social media sites. Any assistance is greatly appreciated. Thank you. RewardsRewards will be kept simple. We will be including a thank you page in the magazine for all of our backers. As well as providing pdf and print copies of the magazine and posters of the cover art. If our stretch goals are met we will also be offering t-shirts featuring the cover image and logo.","The biggest challenge we have is finding the best content. With more funds raised we will be able to commission better quality writers and staff. The magazine is constantly being formatted and tweaked for the perfect layout design and new stuff added as it is edited and accepted, so the magazine will come out in one form or another.

The characters are displayed in a very realistic, lifelike form and arerendered digitally in full color using the latest in graphics andmodeling software by myself and several experienced artists.Like the first volume, the cards can be used in several ways.

No one seems willing to talk to anyone with a different opinion. However, 5 strangers with varying political views are willing to put their differences aside in the name of friendship.Rife with classic era Simpsons humor add a steaming fusion of internet culture, toss in some topical issues with universal themes and top it off with the belief that everyone across the political spectrum is worthy of ridicule and you get Game Night; the comedy that America deserves but also the one we need.Game Night is a half-hour animated adult comedy that follows five strangers: LEO, PRUDY, JAMIE, MARIE and LEXI. Together, they navigate the treacherous seas of friendship in a post-civility America where opinions on policy either make you literally Hitler or a degenerate tearing down the fabric of Western Civilization.Along the way our friends deal with a mad kid’s-show-scientist, Mecha Christianity vs Mecha Mecca, toxic masculinity and his girlfriend feminism, otherkin, and, yes-- literal Nazis.Each episode our friends gather at a Game Night where these issues will fester. Some episodes will deal with our friends working together to beat a game, some will explore the character's lives deeper as we see how they got to their political beliefs and some will see them go on insane adventures as they discover what it is they truly believe.The key to a great comedy is great characters and to help us bridge this politcal divide we want to discover why we think the way we think. A big part of this show is exploring these characters and uncovering the comedy and tragedy of their lives that bring them to where they are today.LeoA paragon of the classic conservative male. Leo left college to pursue a career in construction. His closest friends are fellow construction workers who've sworn off women.While Leo hasn't sworn off love, he's uncomfortable with showing his emotions which gets in the way of finding the one.PrudyA Disney Princess trapped in the modern world, Prudy loves hedgehogs and classical romance.While she grew up in a very masculine home with four brothers and a wild older sister, Prudy escaped into the worlds of Anne of Green Gables and Little Women. Now she owns a hedgehog matchmaking service where she matches hedgehogs with owners based on their personalities.JamieAn ally to all, Jamie strives to make up for his privileged background by being a representative of the underrepresented.He's always on top of the most cutting edge technology and the most progressive ideas. Always the giving one, Jamie finds himself as the loving half of a toxic relationship.MarieA lost soul trying to figure out what she wants in life. One thing for certain is that she wants out of her relationship with Jamie but doesn't have the will to end it.She works as a Post-Modern Webcam Girl in which people give her money to watch her do mundane tasks such as filing her nails, reading magazines, and browsing the internet on her phone.LexiA 30-something recluse who still lives with her parents. Her retired mother dotes on her all day, while her father wants her out so he can spend his golden years getting freaky with his wife.Lexi has never had a relationship with an actual person and instead spends her time  on the phone with her Navy Seal-Spanish Prince boyfriend, Roger, a Catfish whose convinced Lexi to give him thousands of dollars.As the series continues we explore all of our major characters and watch them all as they grow into more complete people, healing from their past and growing into their futures.Nocturnus Studios was created with the idea that anyone should be able to make animation.

With a unique world-view and perspective, The Book of the Demon Slayers promises to be the story of this generation.Hi, Nicholas here! Just before we get into the meat and potatoes of the campaign, I wanted to let you know that ALL backers will get the pre-release copy emailed to them immediately after pledging, so you can get a taste of the comic before the end of the campaign.The Book of the Demon Slayers has been a life-long pursuit of mine. Starting in high school reading Tolkien, watching anime and action movies, I began forming pieces of it from what I love from all of these different media influences; from Cowboy Bebop to Boondock Saints to Lord of the Rings. This gave me ideas for new stories and I began creating the early versions of The Book of the Demon Slayers.In college I studied animation and screenwriting all to perfect my skills and abilities to get this idea refined and ready.Flash forward to this past March...what a time to be alive, eh?When the global pandemic happened, I saw this as an opportunity to begin getting this story out into the world.I want my stories to have a very human angle.The story takes place in a big world filled with characters and adventures, but from the outset I wanted this big world scaled down to focus on the individuals and what these things mean to them.I noticed looking around my house how many symbols and images that I have that show how I'm a fan of different tv shows and anime, but nothing that really expressed my beliefs and who I really am as a person.This is when I began setting out to create the story for The Book of the Demon Slayers issue 1. I thought of the idea of a consumer who's consumed by his obsessions, who worships his media and entertainment. This was where The Book of the Demon Slayers will begin.While the first arc may be about Anthony (read below), the story of The Book of the Demon Slayers is about Nocturnus.2,000 years old Nocturnus has seen most of the whole world and even witnessed some major events in human history first hand.He began his young life as a thief and barbarian until he met a woman, Mara, who was the first woman he ever loved, and who led him out of a selfish world of violence and destruction. She made him into a loving husband but she was taken from him.In his heart he knows that she is alive somewhere, thrown out somewhere on earth in another time, perhaps thousands of years in the future.When he met the mysterious Demon Slayer Akiva he gave Nocturnus the power of immortality but with it the responsibility of being a Demon Slayer.So, Nocturnus travels the earth for centuries hoping that one day he might finally find her.This first arc of The Book of the Demon Slayers will focus on Anthony, an obese porn addict who becomes obsessed with an anime character, Moo Moo Mimi-Chan.Issue 1 sets up Anthony's backstory, how his relationship with the people in his life lead him down this path. When a demon uses Moo Moo as a gateway to devour him he's rescued by Nocturnus.The subsequent issues will be about these two forming a friendship and a bond that will change him and make him into the man the world is going to need him to become.After creating the story line, all the initial sketches are done by myself. They are then sent out to my team for adding the final lines and coloring.All pledges get an exclusive The Book of the Demon Slayers Desktop Wallpaper.Pledge Level 1 - Digital Copy – Book of the Demon Slayers $5A digital copy delivered immediately to you after the campaign ends.

This film will address numerous issues relevant to our society including the growing threat of nuclear war, the topic of refugees and mental health diagnosis such as Bi - Polar and Schizophrenia. The movie is being produced through my art mentor-ship and will serve as the introduction to an ongoing series. My tutor and I have been working for around eighteen months with the goal in mind of completing the project within the next year. A book titled 'Five Kingdoms' is also being written in conjunction with the anime which tells the broader story of life in the New World.Chapter one begins with our hero Nate experiencing a series of schizophrenic hallucinations which show him the dark future that will follow a global nuclear war. The young magicians visions depict a prosperous new civilisation emerging from the ruins of the Old World as millions of refugees migrate to Australia and resettle. A divine force then urges Nate to a nearby beach where he is greeted by his spirit guide Bodai who takes control of his body and begins instructing him in martial arts. This training session is intended to prepare him for the violence his future holds. After releasing Nate from this possession the ghost urges him to warn the regions locals of the coming war. Nate then begins making his way around the CBD covering the streets in chalk statements reading ""There will be a nuclear war soon"" and ""The end is near"". The next day Nate is arrested and taken to a psychiatric ward for evaluation but whilst he is there the war happens. Chapter One :This is me animating a scene in which our main character is possessed by his spirit guide who helps him practice martial arts.This is Taejin, he has been my mentor for around two years and has taught me a great deal about creating art.The Quest :Months after the war Nates spirit guide returns urging him to organise a team and embark on a quest to the nearby refugee settlement. Their task is to locate and protect a group of monks burdened with the responsibility of restoring balance to Nature. This divine mission will only be complete if these holy men succeed in casting an enchanted stone down a great hole which leads to the centre of the Earth. Upon impacting with the planets core this magical rock will disintegrate releasing an ancient elixir brewed to purify the environment. If the team fail radiation from the war will poison Gaia killing all her life.Please enjoy some of the concept art we have developed for the project.Meet the characters.The Wizard Nate:Before the war Nate was just a street magician and knew only tricks, that all changed however when his schizophrenia began manifesting as visions of a nuclear apocalypse. This premonition led him to pursue knowledge of an entirely different form of Magic, the Occult.Angel :Angel is a career busker and a passionate activist. She stands for social equality and women's rights.The Oracle :After a series of successful predictions including the election of an American president and the release of secretive government information Jacob becomes known to his friends as 'The Oracle'.

https://www.kickstarter.com/projects/storytellingron/grimbah-the-brutal?ref=discovery_category_newest,storytellingron/grimbah-the-brutal,"Ralph Bakshi, animation director of 1978 ""Lord of the Rings"" and 1983 ""Fire and Ice"" sent me this email, after viewing my first solo animated feature “World Gone Mad”:Ron, first let me tell you how much I loved the film, the staging, great. The  not taking itself seriously, but not trying to be cool, by letting me know, you know, is perfect filmmaking. You avoided all the cliches and put together a fun film. The hero was ugly and strange, that made it great. Same with the girl, the setting was also perfect, the pacing, cutting great. ---- Hollywood has trouble with this kind of movie. They think Pixar only. ---- Congrats. Heavy traffic was also honest. You have just joined the club. -- What would you need  to do another one?  RalphA feature-length CG animated film set in the gritty Dark Ages.""Grimbah the Brutal"", is a pagan warrior doing the bidding of a dark sorceress. After abducting a beautiful princess, Grimbah is betrayed and must go on a vengeful journey to stop the wicked witch and her black arts.The StoryIt opens on ACTION... Grimbah and his pagan warriors killing with blood lust, taking whatever they please. Grimbah and his minions worship the Sorceress Mahalet. Her abode is a hell on earth, with sacrifices and pagan rituals. But when Grimbah abducts a princess for sacrifice and desires to keep her, the Sorceress turns on Grimbah, attempting to sacrifice him and the princess to her demonic gods. Grimbah slaughters his way out, saving the princess and realizes the meaning of love... whatever that word is... he returns her to her people, to keep her safe... then turns back, for revenge. Using the black arts the Sorceress sends forth her elite minions to stop Grimbah’s brutal vengeance. Who will win?What's out there? Not much!This is meant to be a fun, rousing pulp adventure. I have not seen this kind of straight forward sword and sorcery in animated or live action films, well it seems like forever. Have any of us seen a sword wielding powerful warrior fight big demonic beasts? I'm not into cluttering this style with too much story or dialogue... This will be a gruesome, gorey, gritty, bloody violent, voluptuous, dark, sinister film where the anti-hero Grimbah returns to his master Sorceress, killing every pagan warrior, minion, summoned beast, sinister demon and vile witch to get to her, and bring an end to her bloody reign in a gorey demonic finale!$50,000 to $100,000 This is incredibly low for a feature. But I have proven I can do a feature with “World Gone Mad”. Started in 2006 on one home computer and finished less than 2 years later..that film had 2 separate sales agents who spent their time seeking a distributor. It was in the 2008 Hollywood Film Festival, premiered on the big screen at Arclight Cinemas in Hollywood (which looked awesome btw) and showed at the American Film Market twice. Oh and an entertainment lawyer who saw it, worked pro bono on the contracts!My solo indie feature film, ""World Gone Mad""I suggest you get the biggest screen you can, the loudest volume you can, and the darkest place... to watch this 84 minute feature film!I believe ""World Gone Mad"" was my learning project, getting where I did, meeting who I did, but I want to make something more rousing, more close to a genre, the brutal sword and sorcery genre, like a brand, that we all get immediately, that is marketable, that is visually awesome, that distributors get... thusly, ""Grimbah the Brutal""!Clips from the unfinished ""Conan Red Nails"" animated feature:I just posted these for Kickstarter adding the original 1982 Basil Poledouris score! The original clips have gotten the most LIKEs on my youtube channel. I worked full time with additional resources and a paycheck on these. I was able to focus on the animation.My production abilities and limits:I have been there, close, and show that I can make a film. I did everything on the ""World Gone Mad"" feature but the female voice. The problem of course, is polish. As you can see by my Conan animations, I can do good animation, with good references and source material. On “World Gone Mad” I did everything on the fly, as quick as possible with limited 3d animation software, that even at the time I made it, was dated. To this day, I still do not have up-to-date software or computers. I can do it, make a gruesome full length feature in one year. I will focus great medieval animation with the best animation software and tools.Why I need funds:I am looking to use most funds for up to date software, some rendering machines, utilities, female voices, better voice recording gear. And freeing me up for one year, full time, to live and breathe this production. I will use the latest roto-scoping and motion capture techniques to make the fighting intense. With my medieval fighting experience, up close and personal, I know I can bring to the screen an intensity and brutality we all dream of seeing. And in a brutal pulp fiction style sword and sorcery genre so utterly lacking in film and animation today.The spark, you fans:I was the lead animator on a doomed Conan “Red Nails” film project, on my youtube channel, many have asked why thatwasn'tfinished. And those animation tests have given me lots of encouragement.I'vedecided to go this route, to make something so lacking in films today, especially CG animated ones. A gruesome brutal sword and sorcery adventure yarn in the likes of Conan the Barbarian (1982 version), Excalibur, and Ralph Bakshi's two fantasy animated features. The Conan animations I did were going to be used as source animation for the cell animators but, the Animation Director loved them so much, they were going to use them as is.ADDITIONAL FUNDSIf I get more than $50,000, ALL of it will go into hiring others. So instead of Grimbah fighting through 3 or 4 guys in one awesome scene, he'll fight through 10! Or instead of him hacking off a demon's limb and blood squirting. It will be him cutting through a demon's belly and its guts pouring out and hacking off a limb and blood squirting, flying and splatting. Etc...The scaling of production:My first feature, “World Gone Mad”, produced part time from 2006-08 probably had one to three passes on animation, and not much in the way of live action sources or preparation. At the base level, I will use my own sword fighting skills and aggression for the animation but with each level of funding, I can add more animation passes, to fine tune and time the swings and impacts and acting and add more characters, more epic scenes. The bigger the budget I have, the more characters, animation, action, scenes, length, gore, details, f/x, beasts and scenery there will be.","The Delay in Rewards:I have done a lot of thinking and researching on this, and have gone from frugal to opulent to excited but have decided, to get back down to earth and be a realist. If I do not get the funds because my rewards are so late, then so be it. I realized, as a solo project, and promising a feature film, I will not have the time, energy or focus to accomplish both the reward disbursement and the making of this film. My time is incredibly precious, to punch out 6-8 minutes of animation per month, will require me working 5-7 days a week, on top of my personal life. If I spend time making and packaging 200 plus parcels, that will destroy my initial pledge and kill my finances. A year of full time work will require expenditures to keep my time focused. That is the goal. After the film is complete, I will be focusing on marketing and festivals and distribution deals, so I will then be able to focus on you, the backers as well. Not finishing it: I have proven I can do the monumental feat of completing a feature length animated CG film. The worst case I can think of, is it taking a bit longer than 1 year. I have chosen a subject matter that's macho fun to animate and with the latest tools, I do not see this as a big issue. Quality: This is one of the bigger risks to me, will the audience, especially distributors expect super high quality like Pixar or some motion capture almost realistic style look seen in most game cinematics today? With the latest tools and if I can hire high end supporting artists, we can approach this look, yet with a bit of rough around the edges style. ""Grimbah the Brutal"" should allow some wiggle room. I believe my ""World Gone Mad"" faltered in two regards, the opening is very micro... it doesn't have a real big set up. I've heard from my sales agents, the first few minutes has to sale. But they were so confounded and intrigued by such an original production, they kept watching and realized how entertaining it was and worth committing time to. I'll start off with a big money shot at the beginning. Also, with better software, hardware and rendering, I can make it leaps and bounds better.REWARDSConcerning the rewards, just remember, once complete, I will be looking for a theatrical or other distribution deal, which will have a delaying effect on release of film to kickstarter backers. But exclusive and screenings and the like will still be high priority and will be part of any distribution deal I am able to make. If no distribution deal happens say in a few months after film completion, I will look into dispersing a kickstarter only DVD/bluray to all backers. The posters and screening should happen relatively quickly after film completion.",https://www.kickstarter.com/projects/storytellingron/epic-goblin-campaign?ref=discovery_category_newest,storytellingron/epic-goblin-campaign,"I've been a DM since 1980. Lately I've started a youtube channel and its been a blast of positive feedback and growth. I know so much about story telling and production I feel its time to put that all into a great work.A goblin campaign is surely needed! Goblins aren't just for 1st level anymore! This will be a sprawling epic sand box campaign with many maps, every paper mini needed, and tons of unique goblins and their many pets, monstrous comrades, villainous sorcerers and powerful leaders.I want to make a campaign that is epic in scale and will last a long time as your players delve into the vast land to find out why the goblins are so powerful, why their land is ever encroaching on the lands of men, dwarves, and elves. And how they can keep building up raiding parties and terrorize everyone.This campaign will draw on players at 1st level to 10th & up, to ever push further into the goblin realm, discovering new secrets and encountering more and more powerful foes. They will also get to explore a lot of locations, discover unique items, magic and goblin contraptions.There will be new rules on conducting fun, fast paced, and rewarding battles, and possibly, with stretch goals some added allies to create that epic struggle of good versus evil.I hope there a few good DMs out there, as hopeful as I, that one day... a great epic sprawling goblin campaign will rear before them, giving them a chance at greatness! This could be... it.What is included:Quite frankly, I want to do more!$5000, another month of work, I'll make a compendium pdf filled with the three kingdoms of humans, dwarves & elves that could come to your aid. Each will have towns, fortresses, a break down of NPCs, access to smiths, apothecarists, armorers and more. There will be mob units to lead into battle, and quests! And yes, all maps and minis will be created! And of course... there may be a need to defend some as well. Epic!$7500, a third month of work! Phew! I'll add an underground, underworld, underdark realm! Where all the goblin lairs will be connected and the conspiracies and power sources will delve deeper, darker, dastardlier, demonic, and downright yikes!","The biggest risk I see... is not meeting your expectations. And that's always a tough one. As you can see with my video, I've shown that I can do all the things I promise, I've done them. I've just never had the budget and audience base to focus on one epic project and get it out there. I can do this. I just need the support. I've done my best to show the amount and level of quality I work with. This campaign is meant to be fun, with a lot of fun maps and minis. So, undoubtedly, I won't be illustrating top quality maps or artwork, but rest assured, there will be enough and in that doodle style I use, that, just as my players have thoroughly enjoyed, so will yours!One other risk, is that I want to do a lot, really a lot... so I could see a delay, just to make sure I create enough minis, maps, locations, and story connections so you will feel this is truly an epic campaign that will last a long while. We can solve this two ways: one, just wait and be patient knowing I am making it bigger and better. Or two... I can always send the latest pdf, knowing that I will update it, send out the new one, as I add the bigger, badder, higher level locations, challenges and encounters. Either works for me!Concerning printing it. I'm unfamiliar with how that works. I suppose I could do it through DriveThruRPG... but would have to figure out the best option for Kickstarter supporters. I'll certainly look into the 'at cost printing & shipping' for anyone that pledges $10 and $20."

There are unforeseen challenges in everything and we will have to deal with them as they arise.",https://www.kickstarter.com/projects/q-ornaments/3d-caps?ref=discovery_category_newest,q-ornaments/3d-caps,"Creating a new way that will allow people to keep their drinks safe, prevent spilling, and being able to always identify a drink because now you will have a unique top.This project was inspired by Jordan, who he spent many long years losing his drinks in the sea of water bottles that flooded his home, his family and other visitors contributed to the ongoing frustration and confusion of half drank beverages, in his attempts to quench his thirst.Jordan thought there must be a simple way to ensure his most prized possession, his drink, would never be lost to the rivers of time and other people's drinks. So he originally wanted to change the type of caps people use in their daily lives.However, many years past, the struggle continued as his ideals of having the right cap seemed to be washed away. Little did he know, that a solution was coming to him. Someone finally would help him flush out his problems, and create what he always desired. Jordan could finally sleep peacefully knowing no foreign lips had touched his drink or that he mistakenly drank somebody else's.Paul is the person's name that joined Jordan's cohort. Jordan and Paul facing treacherous brainstorms gathered their strengths and went on an Odyssey.Paul introduced Jordan to Kickstarter, as well as informed him about having a 3d printer. Jordan was interested in creating distinctive caps that could apply to all types of bottles of different dimensions. Paul in understanding more of the dilemma, now. Looked internally for a cap that would satisfy these needs.Until Jordan and Paul finally discovered that a 3d printer and human imagination could create nearly limitless designs to apply to everyone's drinks. However, in testing out their new apparatus of the 3d printed caps they needed a way to attach them.Jordan thought that perhaps they could tap it, which is using a tool to add threading to 3d printed design. However, this proved time consuming, and unfortunately, while possible, unfruitful.The problem was that different drinks have different threading or size. So one 3d cap won't apply to all bottle types. So Jordan and Paul realizing the limitations of threading the caps and the fact that there is no universal bottle size.

https://www.kickstarter.com/projects/trugritsgirl/help-me-bring-my-food-truck-to-life?ref=discovery_category_newest,trugritsgirl/help-me-bring-my-food-truck-to-life,"Covid-19 has affected everyone in some kind of way. For me, it slowed me down and forced me to make a decision about the company I was working for. I needed to be my own boss! I stepped out on faith and decided I would open a food truck that serves food that I crave but can't readily find.In August I purchased a white box truck with the intent of turning it into a food truck. The truck is called TruGrits because we serve grits (cheese grits) as a side with the lunch menu, as a main dish (shrimp & grits), and even as a dessert (Horchata Grits with churros). I've combined both of my cultures (Hispanic and African American) to create ""Pan-Soul"" (Hispanic- Soul) food. You can have BBQ Ribs or Sofrito Mac & Cheese, Jugs of cold Horchata made from scratch or Kool-Aid, Fried Pickles or Patacones, slices of homemade cake or Horchata Grits. These are all a part of my diverse menu and things you can enjoy once this truck comes to completion.I'm working to get it up and running by mid January 2021! We are in the electrical and plumbing phase of the truck right now. We just finished painting the truck inside & out by hand in my garage. All of the work is being done solely by my husband and I (sometimes the kids help too).So here I am, in the next phase of my life, starting my food truck from the ground up. Nothing too fancy, schmancy- just me chasing my food truck dreams!!","The potential challenge is startup costs- we are doing all of the work ourselves, You Tube tutorials go a long way :). I've created a budget and we are sticking to it. We plan out a project each week and if we are to go over budget, we have to find that money somewhere else in the project.The potential risk I am taking is starting a business in the middle of a pandemic. The mobility of my business allows me a little flexibility, also I have become a little more creative and diverse with my menu so that I can offer things that are not already in the market.",https://www.kickstarter.com/projects/trugritsgirl/completing-the-trugrits-food-truck?ref=discovery_category_newest,trugritsgirl/completing-the-trugrits-food-truck,"Recently I decided to follow my dreams, be bold and step out! So here I am, building a food truck lol. Literally building the thing from scratch so that I can do what I love- cook & serve :)First I purchased a Chevy box truck and started converting it in my driveway with the help of my husband. So far we have installed the electric wiring, built the walls and floors, and my brother has done all of the beautiful artwork on the outside of the truck. I'm now at the phase of installing plumbing, the exhaust system and cooking equipment. There aren't many grants available to start up businesses so I figured I'd give this a shot, building a food truck isn't cheap even when you budget. We are making great progress though and I plan to be up and running by the end of December- we have events already booked for January- isn't that amazing?My goal is to bring delicious foods and unique ways to eat foods that we already eat by doing what I love to do. Also by fusing my ethnicities (Hispanic and African American) I have been able to create a new type of food (Pan-Soul food)that offers you traditional dishes from each background that you've never had before. Horchata Grits served with Churros, Sofrito Chicken Mac & Cheese, Twice fried plantains or fried pickles, TG loaded fries and Grit Balls. Many different options in addition to our traditional shrimp & grits. Now, some of this may sound strange to you but you cannot knock it until you've tried it. This truck is all about smiling, having fun & eating! We are most definitely having fun bringing this dream to life!!",I would say Covid is my main challenge because people can't gather the way they used to but since it is a food truck we can move around.

This scientifically proven Sensory Meditation practice is an alternative way to turn your unpleasant thoughts into a state of calm.All package includes our Free Session Gallery software. No extra Cost !!( Pre-Practice - Mobile UI prototype )( Software tutorial - Desktop or laptop users) (BETA Version)The biggest challenge in meditation is staying present, not getting lost in memories of the past, dreams of the future or the running commentary that your mind creates about whatever you’re experiencing. Having an anchor, a place that you can return to when your mind wanders off is an incredibly useful tool for all meditators, regardless of how long you have been practising.Therefore, the most commonly used anchor is breathing. As you are always breathing, the sensation of your breath is easy to access. Based on the mindful breathing exercise, we developed a sensory practice that involves the sense of sight, smell and sound through the beauty of nature. The Multisense Practice is taking on an important role when you using Package. Multisense is a bridge between your Home and Nature.Sensory stimuli can help to retrieve memories. Think about the immediate, overwhelming sensations you can experience when hearing a familiar sound or seeing a familiar image. Our senses can evoke very specific memories and do so without conscious decision-making on our part: the memory simply floods our awareness. For this reason, the practice uses sensory stimuli such as nature related smells, sounds and videos to evoke past Nature experiences.One of the most important anchors is smell. This is something we instinctively feel when we say ‘smell brings us back’. While the herbs have the pharmacological power to induce a meditative state, you can underpin this with the associative power of smell. If you use any of the essential oils in meditation or relaxation, whenever you use them again, your body will remember that particular state you were in – physically. Your body will recreate that state, just through the associative power of smell.As you know Nature is filled with opportunities for finding sounds that can be used as anchors, such as the sound of water to birdsongs. When using a sound, it is best to find something that is reasonably constant. so that it will help you stay in the present moment. One of the aims of this practice is to bring these sensory experiences into harmony.The MULTISENSE practice is a combination of popular meditation forms. Our team has spent more than 5 years to overview all related literature. The current practice is based on recent third-party neuroscience researches and own concluded EEG sessions. As well as we working extensively with aromatherapists and mindfulness teachers. Our main goal is to bring smell experience into a sensory-based meditation.We created an illustration for you to make it easier to understand the idea of our own developed sensory meditation practice collaborated with mindfulness teachers.The first part of the MULTISENSE practice is intended to focus on the user’s video display. This is where the practice starts. It teaches us to focus on something specific. The aim of this practice to give a job to “monkey” mind to avoid other external noises. There are many types of attention that the meditator can practice through sensory experience. For example, let see the shifting attention practice, when the meditator begins one sensory experience and stops to shift their focus on another experience.Keeping your eyes open and concentrate on the Nature video and background Nature sound as detailed as you can for few seconds, then turn your attention to the essential aromas and imagine your consciousness dissolving outward to the scent as if you were touching it, merging with it, flowing into it. Single-pointed focused meditation is pretty much the central tool and the starting point a sensory-based mindfulness. Also, important to remember that open monitoring is not really possible until we develop focused attention.The second part of the practice aims to achieve a relaxed, non-judgmental awareness of your thoughts, feelings and sensations. In other words, here the Mindfulness means maintaining a moment-by-moment awareness of our thoughts, feelings, bodily sensations, and surrounding environment, through a gentle, nurturing lens. Observation to 3 stimuli around us but not taking any effort no needs to focus anything particular. This is an open monitoring phase.Well known open awareness that involves the intentional observation of one’s thoughts, feelings and sensory perceptions in the present through opening the aperture of one’s awareness. Keep during your practice, you are simply observing and not focusing on stimulus. From here you are able to trace the activity of your thoughts in relation to your emotions and become aware of certain patterns. The key is to become aware of the details of your moment. This stream of awareness is often referred to as mindfulness. With practice, you will notice that whatever comes to the surface of your mind will naturally pass. This allows you to gain insight from a point of clarity, focus, perspective, and wisdom.The last part of the practice is more about your fantasy. Recent studies show there is a strong relationship between creativity and vivid imagery performance. Vivid imagery sometimes referred to as guided imagery or visualisation techniques offer yet another avenue for stress reduction. These techniques involve the systematic practice of creating a detailed mental image of an attractive and peaceful setting or environment. The MULTISENSE imagery is the act of using nature stimulus to create more realistic images in the meditator’s mind.The practice is simple, closing your eyes and remembering everything you can about how it looked, then looking back again, then away, and so on. The goal is to memorize the nature image for as long as possible. Followed by the guidance close your eyes to detach yourself from external distractions, just keep the previously observed nature view in your mind but continue the observation of sound and smell upon your own created visualisation.Our mission is to help people achieve their inner peace and harmony. The current market solution only allows a passive audio-video experience for the users. In contrast, our research results show that the use of smell adds an important element in the physiological effects of mood, stress, and meditation.Therefore, we aim to combine this scent experience with audio-visual contents through this meditation package. We believe this immersive and functional product can make daily routines easier and contribute to better mental health.Our story started whilst at university, where we had been investigating the benefits of a nature-related stimulus upon our mental state; the process is called multisensory integration. We completed an EEG pilot research in 2018; additionally, we collected many related EEG studies to prove our concept.After many experiments we came to the conclusion that those people who were exposed to aromas and well-chosen audio-visual content of nature, showed more increased alpha wave activity during open-eye mindfulness meditation, therefore we were able to reduce stress naturally. In 2020 we are planning to run more neurofeedback experiments using this phenomenon to give real-time sensory experience via a brain-controlled interface.","As with all crowdfunding projects, we are extremely grateful for your contributions.

Your body will recreate that state, just through the associative power of smell.Mindfulness meditation is a mental training practice that allows you to slow down racing thoughts, let go of negativity, and calm both your mind and body. Mindfulness techniques train attention, where you learn to stay on a particular task usually with a guided narration. Generally, mindfulness meditation involves a breathing practice, mental imagery, open monitoring and single pointed focus.It's a well-known fact that nature decreases stress. Studies have shown that after exposure to a stressful situation, being in a natural setting or looking at a scene from nature can actually help lower the physiological effects of stress. Recordings of sound from Nature evoke physiological responses, a video of Nature encourages a healthier stress recovery pattern and aromatherapy has been shown to carry many benefits in terms of anxiety and stress relief.Based on the mindful breathing exercise, we developed a sensory practice that involves the senses of sight, smell and sound through the beauty of nature. The MULTISENSE practice is a combination of popular meditation forms. Our team has spent more than 5 years to overview all related literature. The current practice is based on recent third-party neuroscience researches and our own concluded EEG sessions. As well as, working extensively together with aromatherapists and mindfulness teachers. Our main goal is to bring smell experience into a sensory-based meditation and build a bridge between your Home and Nature. During the practice you will be guided with gentle nature videos and aroma oils.DR GAIL D - Academic ScientistI am Dr Gail Davies, an academic scientist. What makes Multisense amazing is how it makes meditation so accessible for those who are struggling with traditional techniques such as maintaining a single-pointed focus on breathing. Multisense is an easy way to bring a little bit of Nature into your Home or Workplace.SUSANNA L - Yoga TeacherHi, My Name is Susanna, My experiences as a Yoga teacher is that relaxing background videos, music or scents may deepen your practice. Thanks to the Multisense Package you can create a lovely environment for your yoga sessions, indoors.ANDREA CS - Essential Oil SpecialistI have been working with essential oils for the past 6yrs. I know how beneficial the scent of smell is for relaxation. Multisense is a brilliant way to experience the power of natural aromas. These oils are blended beautifully, and they are matching with nature's visuals to give a real-life experience for the user.The session gallery is a web-based customisable media player that helps you to find the perfect match between Nature video, audio and smell. The gallery comes with a lot of useful features such as a breathing exercise, voice/smell guide, noise check and colour therapy sessions. The web application runs on any device, such as PC, Tablet, Mobile.Rising levels of background noise in some areas threaten to make people oblivious to the uplifting sounds of birdsong, trickling water, and trees rustling in the wind. We are aware that meditation can't always happen in blissful silence, therefore we highly recommend to reduce noise around you before you get started. With this simple tool, you will truly be aware of how noisy your environment is.​You can launch Multisense using a NFC-enabled smartphone with one touch, without performing a complex setup operation. Start your daily meditation on any computer or mobile phone without installing anything. Isn’t that wonderful?Use your TV for Meditation! We had a dream about a meditation tool that is not limited only to your mobile phone. Just imagine a meditation app that you can use as a remote control for your SMART TV for your video sessions. Would you like to enjoy our Guided Nature videos on your 4K TV? No Problem - Start your sensory meditation with 4K screencast support, powered by YouTube.A special blend of carefully selected essential oils to cater for all your moods whether you desire mental clarity or seek relaxation based on your favourite Nature element. The combination of our special oils in the MULTISENSE brand are reputed to assist in reducing issues caused by anxiety.Our story started whilst at University, where we had been investigating the benefits of nature related stimulus upon our mental state; the process is called multisensory integration. We completed an EEG pilot research in 2018; additionally we collected many related EEG studies to prove our concept. After many experiments we came to the conclusion that those people who were exposed to aromas and well-chosen audio-visual content of nature, showed more increased alpha wave activity during open-eye mindfulness meditation, therefore we were able reduce stress naturally. In 2021 we are planning to run more neurofeedback experiments using this phenomenon to give real-time sensory experience via a brain-controlled interface.Our story started whilst at University, where we had been investigating the benefits of nature related stimulus upon our mental state; the process is called multisensory integration.

The world’s first digital audio workstation at your feet, giving you all the flexibility and power of a software solution in a standalone, compact, lightweight and durable case. Available in two styles: looperEYE, with a camera-driven interface, and LOOPEREYE-B, with a classical button interface.Perform and produce with your guitar or other instruments using a flexible and extensible interface with user-assignable buttons. Record high-quality, non-compressed stereo audio. Easy to set up and use letting you create, save and share multi-track loop sessions in seconds.All this and more is possible with LOOPEREYE and it’s small enough to fit in your hand!At the heart of LOOPEREYE is a powerful and flexible looper engine with a high-quality audio interface, including an embedded synthesiser, that you can use standalone. Through a touch interface you can access the state of the looper as well as advanced configuration options. But wait, why pay for a touch interface when you already have one your phone? That’s why we moved all the options to an intuitive Android/iOS app!The current market for loopers ranges from low-cost simple single track/button loop pedals, that are compact but very limited in functionality, to comprehensive multi-button loop stations and software based solutions, which have better functionality but are more expensive, complex and less portable.We wanted all the flexibility and benefits of a software driven solution with the convenience and portability of a traditional looper pedal. The simplicity of looper pedals makes them fun to use and frees you to be creative. We realised there are users adapting to their loop stations rather than their loop stations adapting to them, thus LOOPEREYE was born!LOOPEREYE connects wirelessly to an easy to use and interactive Android/iOS application. Through the app it’s possible to get real time feedback about the state of the looper, the action mapping of the buttons as well as which track has been selected. The app, number of tracks and buttons are configurable to suit you, but this is the default setup:The next video show the application in action.This version has all the same functionalities and features as the button version, and it's equally easy to use, but it doesn’t have a physical switch to drive the operation of the looper. Instead, it combines an integrated camera with state-of-the-art image processing to control a user configured bank of virtual buttons. See next video to learn how to set up and use looperEYE to revolutionise your live or studio sessions.See the camera-driven LOOPEREYE working with the app.LOOPEREYE allows you to build your song with up to 32 individual tracks, each of them with virtually unlimited track record length, and the way they are related depends on the operational mode you choose: automatic, normal and metronome. For instance, in normal mode, you can set the tempo with the first track and then synchronise the others tracks to it. Or, in metronome mode, all the tracks will be synchronised to an internal metronome. On each track you can record, overdub, replace, insert, mute, and much more!LOOPEREYE has four factory operating modes: normal, automatic, metronome and unsychronised.Normal modeIn this mode, one of the tracks is configured as master. All the other slave tracks will be synchronised to the master, and they will be quantised to the length of the master. This means that the length of the slave tracks will be 1, 2 or N-times the length of the master track. Overdubbing is not bound on any track.Automatic modeIn this mode, one of the tracks is defined as the master. The recording of the master is triggered automatically when you start playing. All other tracks will start recording as soon as you hit record. Just as in normal mode the length of all the other slave tracks will be quantised to the length of the master. Overdubbing is not bound on any track.Metronome modeThere is no master track in this mode, all the tracks are synchronised to an internal metronome. You set the tempo, metric and quantisation through the app. In future releases we will support an external MIDI clock.Unsychronised modeThere is no synchronisation or quantisation in this mode, tracks are recorded independently of each other, making this mode great to record and solo different parts of a song.LOOPEREYE allows you to connect more than one application at the same time so that you can control your loop sessions from multiple controllers at the same time! This makes LOOPEREYE a great tool for collaborative jamming sessions!Through the embedded synthesiser included on LOOPEREYE you can play dozens of instruments, controlling it with plug-play supported MIDI devices or MIDI over WiFi, through the app, or by mapping MIDI commands or notes to LOOPEREYE's buttons.The following video shows how the embedded synthesiser is controlled by a MIDI-USB controller, making it easy to incorporate piano and drums along side the guitar.Traditionally looper pedals are driven using switches/buttons that control several options related to the recording of tracks and configurations of the looper. The functions that map to these buttons are defined by the manufacturer with little opportunity to change them. With LOOPEREYE you can map loads of actions to the buttons, and switch between button banks on the fly from the app or using one of the buttons as a scroll. The following boxes show some of the main commands but there are many more.In the next video we demo the configurable button banks of LOOPEREYE. The first bank of buttons has Next track, Rec&Overdub, Undo, and NextBank. You can scroll through the button banks using the app or by mapping the scroll action to one of the buttons on LOOPEREYE, which is what we've done for this demo. Then we can see this in action, recording a new track, scrolling to the next bank and showing off the reverse function, all without using the app.Switching between different parts of a song is very easy with LOOPEREYE, by selecting and soloing the next track just with one single click, whilst you play or overdub on top of them. In the video shown in the Application section we have a simple song with three independent tracks, the first one with the verse, the second with the chorus, and the third one with a bridge, and we switch between them just by pressing a button.With LOOPEREYE sessions can be stored and loaded letting you pick up where you left off. All track information is preserved and sessions can be shared between LOOPEREYEs!You can use LOOPEREYE as a MIDI foot controller to control remotely other hardware or software. The next video shows how easy is to control the POD HD500X functions, just by configuring some LOOPEREYE's buttons with the proper MIDI command!Help us out and share LOOPEREYE with your friends! Let them know about LOOPEREYE by sharing our project with them.We have uploaded a bunch of videos showing LOOPEREYE in action, so come check us out on Instagram and YouTube.Something freshClassical guitarThis is our proposed timeline and work plan detailing the work required if the Kickstarter funding is successful. We will be ready to start shipping by March 2020.If the Kickstarter campaign to fund LOOPEREYE is successful, here's what the following months will look like.November/December: Survey and Finalise DesignThis time will be used to make any final design changes based on community feedback and allow a minimum viable product to be created and fully tested.January/February: Manufacture & Software TweakingThe final two months will be dedicated to manufacture and assembly of the PCB's, coordinating with the machine shop to perfect the enclosures. In tandem with the physical product development, the software will be finalised and fully tested.Early March: ShippingAt this point, we will be ready to start sending backers their LOOPEREYE. We will maintain communication with backers via email and our website support will be updated to include support for software downloads, etc.The potential of LOOPEREYE doesn't end with the product released for Kickstarter. We have a great set of features and functionality to deliver now, but have identified a number of additional features and functionality we aim to provide as incremental upgrades. Some of these require a simple software upgrade and will be provided at no cost to our backers. So as well as getting a great deal on LOOPEREYE hardware you will also get a host of new features to add even more power to your looper for free!We are at an advanced prototype phase of development. Everyone that has seen and tested LOOPEREYE has been impressed and fully supportive, but we are looking to build a community to support and help us take LOOPEREYE to the next level.We have produced a few working prototypes and are looking for the support to complete our development and get them into your hands right away. Your financial support will enable us to offer LOOPEREYE at a more attractive price point. The manufacturing costs associated with creating a small batch of prototypes makes them expensive. Successful funding of the Kickstarter campaign will enable us to fund the manufacture of a greater number of LOOPEREYEs, lowering the cost per unit and helping to fund the remainder of the development effort.By backing this campaign it shows you support what we do. Your funding helps us develop the product and as a thank you, we send you the rewards that you want as soon as they are finished.When you support this campaign:As musicians we love the pickup and play experience you get with looper pedals. No prolonged set up and configuration to get in the way of your creativity, simply connect your guitar and you’re ready to start looping. As engineers we love the flexibility and power a software-based solution gives us, unlocking an almost endless potential of possibilities. When we couldn’t find a looper that fulfilled both these needs, we decided to make one.We set out to make LOOPEREYE the most powerful, extensible, reliable, compact and low-cost looper; using the best components available and providing features from a usability and user perspective. We didn’t lose sight of the simplicity and fun side of looper pedals when we made LOOPEREYE. It is really easy to setup and use, just being able to pick up and play is at the core of what makes using a looper so fun.Every aspect and detail of LOOPEREYE has been carefully considered and refined to create the ultimate loop station. From the robust die cast aluminium box, to the unique set of features and high specification ensures a superior experience with lots of room to adjust to your preferences -- keeping you looping for longer!It all started when Francisco moved from his home in Argentina to Scotland. An avid guitar player he was keen to keep practising his hobby, but wasn’t able to bring all his gear with him on the long journey -- including his favourite item his looper pedal.Initially, he used a software based looper running on his laptop. It was great because it opened up a whole new level of flexibility he never knew was possible with his looper pedal. However, having to set everything up each time he wanted to play was taking away from the fun he had using his looper pedal.He set out to find a looper pedal that matched the capabilities and flexibility he found in the software solution. After failing to find such a looper pedal, he decided to put his engineering skills to the test by building one that was compact enough to take with him wherever he moved to but also powerful and flexible enough to adapt to his needs and capabilities.Influenced by his time using loop pedals and making various foot controllers to use with his guitar, Francisco found a way to combine all the power of a software solution with the portability of a looper pedal. Thus LOOPEREYE was born, slowly crafted over a couple of years and culminating in a powerful looper that keeps things simple and doesn't lose sight of the fun side of looping.The team behind LOOPEREYE aims to provide a more dynamic and feature rich experience to all types of musicians and live loop enthusiasts. We’re very passionate about improving the user experience and really want to work on giving musicians new ways to create, share and explore their musical creativity.Francisco is our music and product expert. He has 10+ years experience developing hardware and software across a range of industries. Although, his background is in electronic design and manufacturing, his passion is music. With over 20 years of playing and producing music Francisco is our go-to guy when it comes to understanding what musicians want.Phil is our embedded systems engineer and oversees business development. He has a background in electronic design with over a decade of experience taking products from prototype to manufacture. He spends his days working on next generation satellites and understands the importance of quality and reliability.Sebastian is the iOS developer, although his love for music and computers is the same, his ability to play instruments is inversely correlated to his ability to develop software. Sebastian has experience in a variety of industries, but music is the one he loves the most. Sebastian has 10 years of experience developing for different industries including video games, banks, automated warehouses and more, he also has experience in research, publishing several papers.Ray is the in-house quality engineer, tester and photographer. As someone who has been a live and session musician for over ten years, his experience has helped by providing an outside perspective during the development of the looper. He also has a keen eye as a photographer and is responsible for all the amazing photographs of LOOPEREYE.","Like all Kickstarter projects, we will face certain risks and challenges in delivering this product at the high quality we demand. We are committed to producing the best possible product and through our experience in engineering and manufacturing we've made every effort to mitigate these risks for our backers.

https://www.kickstarter.com/projects/surinseattle/sur-in-seattle?ref=discovery_category_newest,surinseattle/sur-in-seattle,"Hi, My name is Rohit and I am a lyricist/music composer. As an artist, I have struggled to find a comprehensive platform to be able to showcase my work. The idea to create a platform for me and other artists was always a dream and in late 2015, A few of my like-minded friends and I decided to try and make it a reality.We started Sur in Seattle as a youtube channel (tinyurl.com/surinseattle) with no intention to monetize it. The first 3 episodes in the series have been funded out of pocket and we have tried to make sure all the technicians and artists involved are paid fair wages for their work.Quality work requires a fair bit of funding and our severely limited budget is making it very difficult for us to maintain the standard we have set with the first 3 episodes. We humbly ask you to help us in achieving our goal of creating beautiful music and creating a platform for other artists to do the same.We plan on using the funds raised here to complete 8 episodes of Sur in Seattle this year. The funds will go to pay for artists such as singers, musicians, videographers and sound engineers. Also some of the funds will be used for online marketing, CD production and venue rentals (studio) If any funds are left over, We will use them towards Season 2.We chose Indian music because that is our area of expertise. With your support, we hope to be able to collaborate with musicians and artists in other languages and music genres as well. Thank you for your time and support. Please be sure to share and subscribe to our youtube channel (tinyurl.com/surinseattle).Cheers!Rohit",The biggest challenge we face is the possibility that someone might watch our work and steal/copy it without our consent. We simply do not have the funds to get comprehensive copyrights in place but hope to do so with your support.Another challenge is to keep the channel going for as long as possible without stagnating musically. We hope to create 8 songs every season and come back the next year with recharged minds to combat creative fatigue.,https://www.kickstarter.com/projects/surinseattle/lennon-award-winner-seeks-funding-for-3rd-album?ref=discovery_category_newest,surinseattle/lennon-award-winner-seeks-funding-for-3rd-album,"Sur in Seattle is an award winning, ground breaking project born of cultural musical exploration. The brainchild of Rohit Batra, an artist who embraces the intersection of both his South Asian and American identity to write and compose original Indian music. Along with George Varghese of Verge studios, Rohit has produced two full albums of original music, employed local musicians and technicians, and gained recognition as the recipient of multiple awards.Rohit was born in New York, but moved to India when he was young. He has always had a passionate relationship with the arts even becoming an award winning playwright in India, but returning to America for family commitments. He developed inspiration and influence from these experiences which have been burgeoning ever since he founded Sur in Seattle.Sur in Seattle's mission is to be a grassroots creative project that can reach out to the local music community in the Pacific Northwest. It serves as a platform for singers and musicians to explore their talents and collaborate with Rohit resulting in a fully produced piece of music. The impact of this work has fueled the local music industry which Seattle has always been known for.Since Sur in Seattle's inception from a grassroots effort it has won several awards, making it a very accomplished project. It is the proud recipient of the John Lennon Songwriting contest (Grand Prize), the Lennon Award, the International Songwriting Contest (Semi Finalist), the UK songwriting Contest (Semi Finalist) and the Unsigned Only Contest (Semi Finalist).With the onset of Covid-19, Sur in Seattle's ability to hire local talent to produce these genre bending tracks has dwindled. In just the last two years Rohit has written and produced 12 self-funded tracks, which is quite prolific. He already has written music to develop a third season of Sur in Seattle but needs your help to continue to hire these incredible artists and musicians to make Season 3 a reality.Sur in Seattle would really appreciate your support to make this third season of the first of its kind in World Music a reality. The passion and achievements behind this project and the future impact on the community will become a silver lining to come out of the darkness with your help.Links:website - www.surinseattle.comYoutube - www.youtube.com/c/SurinSeattleFacebook - www.facebook.com/surinseattleThe journey of an artist is sometimes lonely. But it does not need to be. There is true magic in collaborating with other musicians and vocalists. I truly believe my humble success as a songwriter is because of all the amazing people I have been blessed to collaborate with. In these dark times, many talented musicians are looking for work. Not only for financial reasons but also for the simple joy of collaboration. The joy of working out a piece of music with another person. For many of us, this way of life has come to an abrupt halt. We all need to continue creating and collaborating because that is our way of life. I thank you for your generosity and look forward to all the happiness working on this project will bring to our music community.Warm Regards,Rohit","Risks:The biggest risk to this project would be further worsening of Covid in Washington state. The previous two albums were released on August 15th of 2019 and 2020 respectively. We intend to release season 3 with your support in August of 2021. However, with ongoing restrictions due to the Covid pandemic,  delays could become necessary. Regardless of any delays, Season 3 will be completed. We will be communicating any potential delays to our backers as soon as possible."

Your drinks are easily stirred by pressing on its single-button (located at the bottom of the unit).Its unique engineered mechanical design makes the use of the Spinner Cup look like magic.

There’s the main unit – the cup itself – and its attachable base, which uses a magnetic spoon to have your drinks stirred inside the unit’s main compartment – its cup.The Spinner Cup is perfect for those on-the-go, as it allows anyone to mix their favorite drinks in mere seconds.

Particular attention will be paid to WWI, WWII, The Korean War, Vietnam, Iraq, and Afghanistan. These particular military conflicts were selected to correspond with various time periods of government policy and societal viewpoints about LGBTQI issues that impacted the lives of active duty and retired veterans. Special attention will be paid to analyzing the impacts of the active duty and retired veterans contrasted against public policy at the time including sex perversion laws, courts-martials, Don’t Ask; Don’t Tell (DADT), and Transgender service bans. The curriculum will include an examination of some of the untold stories of LGBTQI service including the WWII-era Veterans Benevolent Association which leads to the formation of many of the LGBTQI advocacy organizations of today. Through the lens of the Military Officer Wives Clubs during DADT, the program will examine the implication on the active duty soldier contrasted against that of the same-sex partner. The program will also include an examination of the paradox of serving one’s country while hiding who you truly are and the impact of that on veteran’s mental health and continuity of service.The electronic curriculum will be provided free-of-charge through an interactive web portal to 6th-12th grade educators nationwide.WWII-era:These sources include both primary and secondary source information designed to describe the three themes discussed previously.

As he gets to know Alice, a young waitress who's moving away to Florida in a week, he spends that last week seeing if she fits into his idea of the ""perfect girl"" for him.When we are hurt, or in some sort of pain or displeasure, we begin to live in the illusion of the world as life. We begin to see everything or something that doesn’t exist just used as an escape. Begin to believe in what we see for what it is, rather that what it can be.Blue Glass Heaven is about Tyler, who is hurt by the world around him for various reasons that his past has shaped. His coping mechanism is living in a ""dream world"" and trying to mold everything into fitting this perfect reality he has created in his mind. Alice might just fit that reality, but he has to be sure. He spends a week, the week before she moves to Florida, to find out. Tyler will come to learn that there is no such thing as a perfect world he must decide if his feelings for Alice can overcome whatever doubts he may have of if she is ""perfect"".We've been working on this film's development for over a year now, but now we need you to help us fund the production itself and bring Blue Glass Heaven to the screen!OUR AUDIENCEBlue Glass Heaven - the fourth project our team has come together to make - is positioned to be a strong collaborative effort that, due to the high amounts of energy, standards, passion, and talent coming together, will produce a film festival worthy effort.We want our movie to shine a light on a side of millennials that isn't explored in films often: the side that shows that not everyone’s young adult story has a happy ending, the side where we satirize millennials by pointing out our flaws instead of portraying us in a dreamy fairytale world all the time, the side where a young millennial is stuck in the mud and not out in the race and where the person who doesn’t have a plan and goes with the flow has a brighter future than the one who’s an optimistic perfectionist with a clear plan, and the side that shows that the way to treat others is actually probably the biggest indicator of our own growth as people.OUR PASSIONOur team has worked together multiple times in the past and we plan on getting bigger and better with every project. Never before have we been more excited for a project. Most of us our young filmmakers attending school at UNC's School of the Arts. Our passion includes creating movies whose narratives consist of simplistic storytelling that are, at the same time, rich with in-depth themes, told with unique perspectives, exploring interesting sides of the American culture that are not often explored.We are a group of super hardworking individuals who, if given the chance, and create something special that hopefully a lot of people can relate to. We want everyone, not just millennials, to look at this film and recognize a little bit of themselves in the characters and narrative.OUR TEAMAdam Jumba is a directing student at UNCSA who has made multiple short films in the past as writer/director. Originally from Pittsburgh, Adam has been interested in filmmaking his whole adult life and draws influence from Stanley Kubrick, Ingmar Bergman, Federico Fellini, and many more prolific directors.Malik Dowdy is a freelancing Director of Photography within the South, while attending The University of North Carolina School of The Arts studying Cinematography. Hailing from Atlanta, Georgia, Malik grew up absorbing much artistic inspiration from his family and environment, traveling the country for sports and music. Dowdy has worked in film all across the country, including places like Los Angeles, California and New York City, New York; working for companies such as Netflix, ESPN, and Interscope Records. Dowdy has lensed a multitude of films, ranging in genre. While Dowdy specializes in narrative filmmaking, he also has experience with commercial and music video work. Dowdy is also experienced in shooting film, as he produced and lensed a short film on 16mm in 2017. Malik is currently prepping a rang of projects that will release this year.Joe is currently living in Pittsburgh where he is studying filmmaking, particularly producing, as well as business. He has been in business management for years and hopes to translate his leadership, organization, and operation skills to the film world.Christian currently lives in Boston and has trained to be an actor in North Carolina in the past. He played ""CJ"" in the Oscar-Nominated film Manchester by the Sea. He also played the lead role in the recent ""Bauer Hockey"" commercial.OUR GOALAbove is a graphic representation of where the money will go to. $5000 would help us create what he hope to be an influential, powerful film that leave a mark on all those who watch it.OUR PITCHWe ask those who would like to support young filmmaker trying to live out their dreams and leave a mark on the lives of those who watch movies to help us achieve what we are setting out to accomplish.

From the Texas Cowboy (Colby) to the smooth-talking construction worker from Boston (Boston Rob) to the epic world-traveling adventure storyteller (Coach) and everyone in between, Survivor truly is a gathering of the some of the most interesting people this country has to offer.The only downfall is that we only get to see these people outside of their elements, trapped in a jungle or on an island or in the middle of a desert. How awesome would it be to see Coach conduct an orchestra? Or see Boston Rob build a house? or see Rob Cesternino host a podcast in LA? Or see Wendell build furniture in Philly? Or see JT on his cattle ranch in Alabama? Or see Troyzan swing from the vines in his private jungle-island in the Florida Keys? Or see James dig graves in Louisiana? Well, if the answer is ""very cool"" then this is your place.And who better to spend a ""day in the life"" with these amazing characters than one of Survivor's most polarizing, popular, and interesting characters himself: Russell Hantz. With every episode intending on following a different fan favorite to see what a day in the life would be like when they are in their natural habitats (not on Survivor), Russell plans on traveling to all corners of this country and documenting it with interviews, eating their favorite foods, exploring the cities that shaped them into what they are today, and getting to know your favorite Survivors: in their element.Traveling expenses (including food and lodging) for the crew, the equipment, and editing for a show like this are not a small amount. We're going to need a pretty penny to make a season. So, our approach is to make one episode (a pilot) following a fan favorite, perfecting it (say, 45 minutes long) and then pitching it to various potential producers to try to make an entire show out of it. And it all starts with this first episode.We need your help to raise money for food, travel, lodging, camera equipment, lighting equipment, and to pay for an editor. We need this first episode to be entertaining, look as professional as possible, and feel like something special so that it will get us the attention and funding for the entire season that we feel like this project deserves.We have various awards/perks for your gracious contributions to our projects. If you're a fan of Survivor or of Russell, it's gonna be hard to say no to these rewards. Here are just some of the amazing perks we have to offer for your generosity:","The biggest risk to this project is that this pilot could end up not leading to more episodes in the future. We hope to overcome this by making sure the production quality is top-tier, the distribution is done right through Russell's connections with CBS, and the overall determination and passion we have to producing Survivor content to the fans!"

It's a short film from award-winning filmmakers, about how we jump to conclusions about those who look a little different form us, or who happen to have something in common with those who are featured in the news for all the wrong reasons.It's a day in the life of Ibrahim, a regular northern British Asian guy. We see a simple household chore (going out to buy an axe to cut down a tree in his garden) turn into something that, in the eyes of the careless observer, suddenly turns into something much more dramatic and dangerous.In the era of ""Muslim bans"", ISIS, Brexit, refugee crises and the flood of angry comment on social media, it's almost impossible for many people to have any sense of what's what. It's always the same people who get caught in the crossfire: immigrants, foreigners, religious and social minorities.The Walk takes these issues of misunderstanding and misrepresentation and pokes a stick at them, watching our protagonist, Ibrahim, suffer the consequences. Made by award-winning filmmakers, it's one step in a programme of films that we hope to bring to the world over the next year, including feature projects on which we'll be starting development soon.Simon Bolton-Gabrielsen is a Director, writer and producer based in Yokshire UK, working with a team of talented filmmakers in the region.

Death isn't used to people making the job this difficult, and gives chase, struggling to manage the things we all take for granted - riding the elevator, finding change on the bus... and dealing with adoring Goth fans. It's all a bit much for an immortal entity.Finally, having given several neighbours the fright of their lives, arriving at Harvey's house, Death finds him at ease at last. Far from being afraid of dying, he just needed to say goodbye to the things that matter most - his home, his past, and the loyal, cosy cat much loved by his late wife. Intrigued, Death takes the time to sit and share a whiskey (or three) with Harvey, but for all the friendly warmth of this exchange, the unfortunate reality can't be avoided that Harvey is due a rather permanent disruption to his plans and, taking another bite on the takeaway pizza they're sharing... Well, ""always chew every mouthful before you swallow"", that's what my mother used to say.""The Grim Reaping of Harvey Grieves"" is an unexpected and hilarious comedy, and an honest tale of an elderly man knowing what really matters to him, that says something meaningful to anyone who ever had something, or someone, they care about.Director Peter TrifunovicPeter Trifunovic is an award winning Writer/Director from Leeds.

Meeting our goal will make securing the ideal budget much more likely, but still not completely guaranteed, and a shortfall will mean working to a different financial model.  We have made films of a similar scale for budgets a little over the £10k mark, but without the ability to pay proper wages to cast and crew, and with very significant challenges.  That's not how we want to do things, and it would have an effect on the final film.  There is an additional consideration with the progress of Covid 19, and the effect on filming practices.  However, we are satisfied that we will be able to film safely, even if some restrictions are still in place.  We are working to a safe production slot in May 2021, taking time to ensure the production is as secure as possible."

I also happen to be a curly girl with super coily hair. Four years ago, I founded COIL Beauty Inc. with a simple idea: to introduce a new age of beauty designed for the twenty-first century.(Top Left:Tiffany, Top Right: Nicole, Bottom Right: Destiny, and bottom left Robin B)During my time as a hairstylist, I saw a huge gap in the market place when I noticed that all women were having the same hair issues, across the board no matter if they had straight, wavy, curly, or coily hair. Namely, their hair was dry and they couldn’t find a beauty product or professional to assist them to get the hair they desired and deserved.So, I decided to build the COIL app which is the first mobile technology of its kind. Connecting curly women to the products, stylists, and salons that know exactly how to work with their hair type, all from the click of a button on their cell phone. Saving our clients thousands of dollars, generating business for trained stylists who can help these clients and overall improving the hair and beauty experience for both paying customers and professionals alike.Our mobile app saves time, saves money and gives you the information you need. No more wasted hours trying “miracle” products that doesn't work. No more failed hair appointments with stylists that really don’t know what to do with your hair. No company is currently successfully solving the problems of curly-haired women and men with effective technology. Until now.The COIL Beauty App will use expert-driven technology to find stylists, products/regimens, tools, and beauty experiences that curate the perfect fit/solution for women or men based on their curl type and lifestyle. The COIL Beauty app also helps beauty salons all over the country by providing a platform to get more customers and advertise their goods and services. We hope to completely transform our clients’ and customers’ curl experience at home and professional salon to provide efficiency and maximum results using technology.We also plan to license our software out to salons to build a more technology-driven salon space that helps both stylists and customers. We’ve decided to split the COIL Beauty App development process into two stages. Right now we are in the first phase, building our Minimum Viable Product (MVP) so we can release our beta test version. The second phase will involve refining and fine-tuning the beta app version based on feedback from users. We will release the salon version of the app after this. One of the best features of the COIL Beauty App is the “Ask Alicia” function. This feature works as a virtual personal hairstylist, that will give you personalized advice based on your unique hair type on what products will work best for you and the best stylists closest to you. “Alicia” will be able to answer questions about curly hair types and give expert advice whenever you ask.Right now, we have come to you, on Kickstarter, for help raising the funds that we need to complete the application backend development. Our funding goal through this crowdfunding campaign is $50,000, which will put us in a solid place financially.

My clients often tell me how meaningful their hair is to them, what it represents in their view of themselves and how it connects to their whole identities.A major cornerstone of every culture, hair is never just hair – as Nia, the main character in my book God Created Me Coily, is starting to realize.My book follows Nia, a smart and curious young girl, as she asks BIG questions about her hair – like, why is my hair coily and curly?Many children of color, grow up their entire lives feeling ""UGLY"" in the United States.So I posed the question of why? Why is it that our children feel UGLY because their ""hair isn't straight"" and Skin is not White? This is a SERIOUS PROBLEM in the United States. When I looked deeper, this is what I found. See the statistics below:According to Lee and Low Books “In the last 24 years, only 13% of Children’s Books contain multiracial content, even though 37% of the US population are People of Color.” There are more ""Animal and White"" Characters in Books than any other race in 2018. Often because our children don't see themselves being represented in toys and books they often think they are not worthy enough to be represented. In the future this leads to self-doubt and lack of confidence that follows them well into adulthood in regards to their identity. Clearly, the Industry has failed us, lets not allow for the industry to fail our children.Leading Psychologists have mentioned often :""Kids that hate themselves will grow up to hate others.""(YOU deserve to be REPRESENTED in the Industry)I have written this book in response to the self-acceptance challenges I know many young girls face as they go through their childhoods. As well, I have written it in response to the distinct lack of Black characters in children's books and the distinct lack of Black dolls with hi-texture hair in the toy market. Our Story with Representation Matters in 2020.The message of my book is clear and straightforward: embrace yourself, your authentic self, and discover your own creativity and uniqueness.By combining story and representation we create a world where your child learns and feels empowered by their identity” Passionate about beauty, tech and entrepreneurship, I am the founder of Coil Beauty. I want the God Created Me Coily Book Series + Doll Experience to motivate your girls to pursue their grandest dreams.Long-term, I would also like to launch my own line of diverse dolls through Coil Beauty, but to get to that point, I need to be able to hit my minimum order goals on the first edition of the ""Nia"" Collection Dolls. This is the priority of the crowdfunding campaign, pushing funding over the edge so that I can cover those costs.I am looking to raise $10,000 to cover the costs of publishing, manufacturing, marketing and distributing God Made Me Coily and hitting 300 presales of the first edition of the ""Nia"" Collection Dolls, planning an expansion of doll line next. As long as I can reach this goal, I will be able to launch my book and doll series in a timely manner.Contribute now and claim your copy of God Made Me Coily Collection Rewards!(You have the option to donate your Doll + Book to a little girl in Need)(Readers become Leaders! We will released 1-3 more books in the ""God Created Me Coily Series"" this year and send directly to your child)In addition to making a monetary contribution to this campaign, you can show your support for me and God Made Me Coily Collection by sharing a link to the campaign on Facebook, Instagram, Twitter, and any other social media platforms you use. The more people are aware of this doll and book prior to the launch, the further I can spread my message of self-love and self-acceptance.","While I do not foresee any major difficulties ahead, I will be sure to keep all my contributors in the loop. If I do run into any challenges that cause a delay in my timeline, I will send out an update, remaining transparent throughout this process.Let's get the word out about this project together!I appreciate all your support, both monetary and non-monetary, and I thank you for taking the time to read about what I am doing."

https://www.kickstarter.com/projects/armanisarfeinial/the-secrets-of-terra-silenti?ref=discovery_category_newest,armanisarfeinial/the-secrets-of-terra-silenti,"Film is a great medium. I have found, that with my love for fantasy, few can capture the awe inspirational tales of the lord of the rings or even anything that Disney has done. But what appears to be short sighted is high fantasy novels and stories that just aren't done well, take Eragon for instance. That would have done well if there was more magic involved and greater care within the narrative. The novels are already done, the plot holes are tied with more books already on the way. This project is for a professional script writer to turn these fantasy books into a grand magical performance to be pitched to major producers for a shot to show what the fantasy Genre is truly capable of. I am tired of mediocre fantasy movies that don't sit well with me, I want more movies like the Lord of the Rings, and filled with the magic of Dungeons and Dragons with the good quality effects, great story telling, great characters, and antagonists you grow to hate.The project: This will fund the script writing and some of the advertising along the way for the novels themselves as they are currently undiscovered. The funds are primarily for the scriptwriter, any excess will be used for marketing and advertising and marketing materials. Once the script is done, it will then be marketed and pitched to producers, which some of those funds will also be used for that.","Risks: once the project is funded the only thing I can promise is that the script will be pitched and written for the film. I would like offer e-copies of the film but that likely will be beyond my control and capability. Once this is funded, the rewards are promised. The novels I have a prolonged date as these books will be printed by demand, shipped to my office where I will sign and then ship them directly to you.Once again, there is no promise that the film will be made, or a franchise will start. The goal is to make the film and that is no small task. What I can assure you, is that I will be doing everything in my power and capabilities to make that happen.",https://www.kickstarter.com/projects/armanisarfeinial/a-hunting-paranormal-trip?ref=discovery_category_newest,armanisarfeinial/a-hunting-paranormal-trip,"I am pleased to announce a Novel, which I have been able to source out a professional screenwriter who has connections in the big industries ie) Disney. This project is going to turn a fantasy adventure, plot driven story filled with likable characters, detestable enemies, and very confused goblins into a film. I have always wanted to see the great old Dungeons and Dragons films returned and this falls within that same vein, although, heavily inspired by the Lord of the Rings.I know this can be successful, and I know this can be entertaining. This project is going to turn the first novel in this series, The Secrets of Terra Silenti into a script. This project is then going to fund the pitching to these major studios which will ideally get accepted for production. This project doesn't guarantee that a film will be made, but we're going to try for that movie deal!","My time line for funding this is tight. I am needing most of the funds before Christmas. Much of the challenges is the funding for the project while we are still actively working on marketing. The hardest part, is going to be the marketing to create enough traction for it to be noticed by major studios without much additional assistance with an cinema agent. If this project is funded, unfortunately there is no promises for the movie, but that is goal! But you will still be able to enjoy the novels and the sneak peek!"

They’ll put in information like their first and last name, email etc. Customers can send a notification requesting help. The grocery bag carrier will receive a notification on the mobile app that a customer has requested service. If a bag carrier accepts a request all he or she has to do is meet up with the customer at their grocery store location and deliver the grocery bags to customers doorstep for a fee. Bag Carriers get paid after the customer clicks on transaction completed through mobile app.If the customer for some reason cannot click on transaction complete for example, their phone dies or they just forget completely then the carrier can go the app and request payment and we can send a notification to the customer’s account and request that customer authorize transaction complete, if no response within a certain time frame then we’ll automaticaly mark the transaction complete and will issue funds.Customers can give the carrier a star rating based upon how respectful and courteous the carrier was and how well they did the job. Who the service benefits: People who live in cities where apartment buildings have no elevators and the have to walk several flights of stairs, apartments complexes where parking is a hassle and you might not be able to park close to your house, People who buy lots of groceries, the ederly, single moms who go shopping with young kids, People who want extra convenience, people with disabilties such as a broken arm or foot who might need help carrying grocery bags home.This company can be great for people seeking employment as an independent contractor. Perfect for a weekend job or can be a daily job, We’re taking the hassle out of having to carry groceries to your door for millions of people when they get home.Company overhead will be minimal since it’s a peer to peer service, and with proper maintenance of website and mobile app) No business stores needed.Online grocery delivery services exist but, a vast majority of people still prefer in store shopping versus online grocery shopping. People like going to there favorite stores to shop but they don't like carrying grocery bags home. With Yuuver you never have to worry about missing items, not the right brand of items you wanted, or late deliveries.

Then my job will be to serve to who ever wants. Any extra funds I collect will go to extra bike frames and extra packaging. They will also be assembled and packaged ready to be shipped instantly, when I open up.Who am I? I'm just a young inventor from Eastern Connecticut that's full of ideas. This project took me about a year to finish and it took me 3 to 4 months to make the parts on a cad. What's funny is that this is my first time doing all of this, exciting XD. I love being outside and I like bikes in general. Seeing my project come to life would mean a lot.I care about this project because it's my Idea. But at the same time I would like to travel to places without having to refuel or recharge once and I'm definitely not the only one. There's no way I'm the only one XD.I promise that this bike frame will help the rider reach speeds of 75mph or more, depending on how fast you pedal. For anyone that is planning to get an e bike forget about it. XDEVOLVE bike frames are very customizable. Yes, you can build it to suit your needs like any other bike frame. But all EVOLVE bike frames will be white, letting each and every one of you take full control on color and design.How is this even possible?I'm glad you asked. What I basically did was add a 1 to 32 gear ratio inside the bike frame. So when you pedal once, your rear wheel will actually spin 32 times instead of once.COOL RIGHT and no electricity needed just your pedal power.Still don't believe? Here's the math on how the EVOLVE bike frame works.So if you had an average pedaling speed of 60rpm and we want to know how far and how fast your traveling in an hour with this EVOLVE bike frame. This is how the math will look like. 60rpm x 32 x 60min x 81in = 9331200in. That's how far you will travel in an hour in inches. Convert the inches into miles AND YOU GET YOUR SPEED OF 147 MPH!!!YEAH that's how fast you will go if pedal once every second!It's UNBELIEVABLE. Lowkey a motorcycle XD.Any Bike Business Big or Small Interested in selling my product when the time comes?This will be a great product for you to sell. Just add your preferred seat, break, wheels and ect... Then place your price.Price.Each bike frame costs 9k each. I'm asking for 100K. This will help me start off with 10 bike frames including packaging. 9k each because the materials, processes and shipping ain't cheap. I was highkey shocked but nah it's fair. Giving that is custom parts. Coming all the way from China.Guess how much for shipping for 1 bike frame, 600 dollars!!!! The process for the two big parts of the bike frame is CNC machining. They knew my intentions from the beginning. Which is transportation. So we made sure all the parts are durable and safe. So they recommended ABS and Steal. If I could've 3D printed those 2 big parts form 1 3D printer the price could've been much cheaper. But the 3D printers where too small so CNC it was. But the CNC machine was small as well...... So they said we have to cut the parts and glue them together. But I didn't like the way that sounded. So I asked for specs on the glue and they gave me a spec sheet of glue, telling me how strong and resistant it is.( I asked and checked everything even on the materials.) The glue checked out but I still didn't think it was safe enough even if the glue was strong.So I told them to cut the parts in a way so they interlock when you join them making the bond even stronger with the glue. I told them, when they join the parts make the seems as seamless as possible and they said we'll make sure it's a seamless as possible. All the other parts are Steal 3D printed.LIMITED EDITION BIKE FRAMES.You want this to happen?Please share this campaign to as many people as you can. It will be deeply appreciated.One last thing.If my project gets fully funded just know that there will be a bigger, WAY bigger project coming soon. We are all expecting a big change to come soon right? Especially this year? 2021 I'm hoping for it to be THE BEST YEAR FOR ALL OF US and all the other years to come.PEACE",No risks or challenges.:),https://www.kickstarter.com/projects/blanx/who-wants-an-evolve-bike-frame?ref=discovery_category_newest,blanx/who-wants-an-evolve-bike-frame,"my name is John I'm 18 years old and I'm from Willirico CT. 2021 Is coming soon and I was hoping to start the year off with my first ever business. Selling my own custom 3D printed bike frames. This bike frame is called EVOLVE and it helps the rider go 70 mph plus by just pedaling! All these funds are going to a 3D printer, Filaments, Ball Bearings, Packaging and a Camera. I will post a link to my website on updates somewhere in January for ya'll can see the video review of this bike frame and also by one!One day I was with my friends leaving puddles. We we're on bikes trying to get to someones crib to go smoke. The journey was long it was hot summer day I was exhausted and dehydrated. To the point that I couldn't even keep my head up. So my forehead was on the handle bars constantly, wishing that I'll see water soon. While I was low key dying XD, I was looking at my pedals the chain the wheel and I said to my self. ""Imagine if there was a bike that if you pedal once you will go farther than this"" all I wanted was to reach my destination faster. Then I figured out that a gearbox can do that. So I made my own custom gear box on paper and I decided that the ratio should be a 1 to 32 gear ratio because why not I like going fast. Then I went with a bike frame instead of a bike because I noticed that all of this can fit inside a bike frame. I did some research on some high brand bike frames to understand why the dimensions are what they are. For you can fit parts to my bike frame easily and for it could be safe and comfortable to ride in high speeds. I took the best dimensions and also wrote that down. The last thing I had to do was make 3D cads for all the parts to make the EVOLVE bike frame. 2 fails a lot of time wasted but I finally finished.This bike frame is a 1 to 32 gear ratio. So if you had an average pedaling speed of 60rpm and we want to know how far and how fast your traveling in an hour with this EVOLVE bike frame. This is how the math will look like. 60rpm x 32 x 60min x 81in = 9331200in. 81in is the circumference of a regular bike tire. Anyways that's how far you will travel in an hour in inches with this bike frame. Convert the inches into miles AND YOU GET YOUR SPEED OF 147 MPH!!! YEAH that's how fast you will go if pedal once every second!It's UNBELIEVABLE. Low key a motorcycle XD.If you don't believe that this bike frame works. There will be 2 video links at the bottom to help you grasp the concept of my bike frame. This bike frame works I just don't have the money to make one. That's the reason I have no video for ya'll. Just some photos, math on how it works and some links.This video represents how you can pedal normally with a HIGH gear ratio.https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YJ4JuUFLJkgThis video represents how physics works on a bike.https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JGO_zDWmkvkAny questions?",No risk or challenges just orders are going to be slow.

So to this I have 3 solutions.  First - We have patents in play and can block the. Second we have an API which can run on any coupon site under their private label. Third, we are already talking with them via co-marketing our app on their platforms.  The last big challenge will be licensing our software into other countries.

The average family of 4 spends over $1000 per month in this category not including fast food or Starbucks! I personally use my app and save a minimum of $50-$200 per month which includes a little travel. Bogos have also given me big savings and the chance to stock up and my favs. The cool feature is I am alerted 3-4 times before ANY of my offers expire.

Frequently, they are installed for free when signing a contract with a security monitoring service.Magnetic contacts are the most common sensor installed in Home Security Systems. They are switches that are activated by the presence of a permanent magnet. When the permanent magnet is moved away, an alarm is triggered. Magnetic contacts are found on, in and around doors and windows in various form factors. In stark contrast, industrial and military grade systems use more sophisticated magnetic sensors. A professional intruder can walk right through a Hone Security System undetected, so more elaborate means are required. However, it has been shown that these more sophisticated sensors are just as vulnerable as the simple Home Security versions. There are hundreds of videos on YouTube showing how to defeat Hone Security Systems and ""Defeat by Trivial Means"". A professional paper published by John Jackson in the Journal of Physical Security, Argonne National Laboratores shows how. See: https://www.jrmagnetics.com/security/defeatbms/defeatbms.phpAll passive electrical magnetic contacts (switches) in any combination are ultimately defeatable by Trivial Means. That means a school boy probably knows how to do it for fun. The JRM1212 High Security Switch Magnetometer invented by John Jackson is the solution. It is a 3D magnetometer that sees a magnetic field like photographic facial recognition. It is an active device that requires 12 V power and has an on board computer to analyze the data from the magnetometer array. The firmware algorithms for magnetic field recognition are proprietary. Imagine having the world's most advanced military grade sensor on your door. It can be wired directly into your existing Home Security System. No false alarms, no sabotage, no tampering and solid state reliability. Features:Specifications:Installation instructions are here: https://www.jrmagnetics.com/security/howto/jr1212asm.pdfYou get one JRM1212 High Security Switch Magnetometer and magnet actuator with two spacers. John T. Jackson, Jr., MS, the principal designer and engineer, received his BS Physics from Oregon State University and his MS Electronic from the University of Nevada, Reno. He is the inventor of the ""Wide Air Gap Permanent Magnet Motors"" (slotless Motor). He has many patents in the field of physical security. He is a magnetics specialist and maintains a private research and development laboratory in Hong Kong.This phase of the project is complete.The PCB is fabricated and stuffed at secure locations in Hong Kong. All subsequent manufacturing is done by Jackson Research at their facilities in Hong Kong. This is not a commodity and not well suited for mass production. It is high tech industrial/aerospace grade merchandise. PCB fabrication takes two weeks from the confirmation of receipt of the funding. Stuffing the boards takes two weeks after that. Final assembly, programming the on board computer and testing takes another two weeks.The entire process from start to finish takes six weeks. We ship by registered Hong Kong Postal Service at no extra charge, unless specifically asked otherwise. An additional shipping charge will be assessed, if other carriers are requested.","Our team, comprised of Silicon Valley aerospace professionals, has decades of design and manufacturing experience. The only risk we see is the usual logistical delays which have been calculated into the project time line.",https://www.kickstarter.com/projects/jrmagnetics/rf-ultra-wide-band-antenna?ref=discovery_category_newest,jrmagnetics/rf-ultra-wide-band-antenna,"AboutI was never statisfied with the commercially available wide band antennas. They were all too large or did not have suitable VSWR over the frequency range generally required by SDRs. I read many research papers and ultimately made a omni-directional ultra wide band antenna, but it was too expensive for most people. Details regarding that antenna can be found at https://www.rtl-sdr.com/constructing-a-3d-printed-wideband-900-mhz-to-11-ghz-antenna/However, a bi-directional antenna was good enough for most people, so I have made a flat one. The antenna I ended up with is 5 inches by 4 inches and about 3 mm thick with an SMA connector. It is quite definitely not a square patch antenna, which usually has a narrow bandwidth.This antenna has a VSWR measured to be under 2.00 from around 750 MHz to over 3 GHz. It simulates to have a VSWR under 2.00 out to over 6 Ghz. This is enough for most of the available SDRs. It works very well with WiFi, Bluetooth, Zigbee and other systems within the bandwidth.Existing AntennasThe log antenna, Figure 2, has a wide bandwidth, but it is specified as having ranges, because the VSWR rises over 2.00 several times over that range. The antenna measure sover 40 centimeters long, which is problem for me in a laboratory setting. It is too large to fit anywhere and wants to be permanently fixed to a pole or something like that.The other antenna I have is a discone type device, Figure 3. It is huge. There is not practical for it to fit on a lab bench around various RF devices. It is measures around 28 centimeters at its base. It needs to be elevated above any ground planes, which complicates a laboratory environment with metal bench tops. I have it sitting on a shelf above the computer monitors on the opposite side of the room away from the lab bench. This does not work well when I am trying to deal with wireless devices connected to USB hubs on the bench with short range features.Figure 4 shows the Flat Antenna next to the Log Antenna for a size comparison that illustrates just how much space saving there is with this new device. This is no small feat. This Flat Antenna is useful around all manner of RF devices on the bench without causing space issues, getting in the way of instruments and couples well with all of the wireless devices I am using. It is small enough with a convenient shape for moving it around and keeping it above a metal bench top. It only needs to be a few centimeters above any ground planes when perpendicular, not horizonal.Due to its size and shape, near field problems have not been a problem, as with the other antennas. The antenna is quite directional, which is not much of a problem, since the RF bounces around all over the place. A Faraday shield is the only way to keep this device from picking out everything in the vicinity. The neighbors IoT devices create mountains of RF clutter. This antenna picks up all of it. If you only want restricted bandwidths, band pass and reject filters can be used. The load impedance is 50 Ohms across the band making an excellant match for all of the filters I have here.SpecificationsFigure 5 shows the VSWR as measured by the NanoVNA Version 2. It only goes out to 3 Ghz. The device must be calibrated before use, or you will get extraneous results. I am told the VSWR never goes above 2.00 until after 6 GHz. This is a remarkable antenna. I never found anything comparable to it on the Internet.It can be used for all wireless and SDR applications normally within the 750 MHz to 6 GHz bandwidth. This is not guess work or speculation. The network analyzer shows the response clearly.The antenna is 5 inches long by 4 inches wide by roughly 3 mm thick, not counting the SMA connector.Several people asked about Tx power limits with frequency. The transmit power is only limited by the SMA connector as shown in the graph.Bandwidth from 750 MHz to 6 GHzEveryone was asking about the frequency response above 3 GHz. Qspectrum displays the output from the HackRF One SDR. Please note the very strong signals above 4 GHz in restricted channels.Multiple AntennasI use two identical antennas: one for Rx and one for TX. I transmit with the HackRF and receive with the RTL-SDR. It works very well with WiFi, Bluetooth, Zigbee and other systems within the bandwidth as well as cell phones and other WLAN devices. I use them with Ubertooth One and a UD100 Bluetooth Adapter. The Bluetooth range with this setup is awsome.Wideband Antenna ArraysSimple broadband Wilkinson power combiners can be used to construct a higher gain wideband antenna array and potentially be designed as a Phase Array Antenna.What You GetYou get one (1) antenna, as shown in Figure 1, for each US$50. You cannot do this yourself for that price. Your time alone is worth more than that after you do the calculations, simulations and prototyping. You also would have to deal with fab shops to get this done correctly, which is not always convenient for many people.In other workds, this is a remarkable Ultra Wide Band Antenna at a remarkable price.EngineeringThis has already been done. I have a Masters Degree in RF Engineering. I also have all of the simulation tools that are not available to most people, with the exception of some university students.ManufacturingI have sources that I use all the time. I just put this one into the queue. We also have a minimum order, which is why we Crowd Fund this operation.TimelineOnce in the queue, it takes about two (2) weeks. After that, we are only concerned with delivery time. We intend to use ordinaty Postal Service mail, to keep the cost down, so time of delivery may vary depending upon the destination.","We already have laboratory results, so there is nothing to risk in performance.  The only other thing that could be troublesome is the lead time by the vendor that manufactures the main component or any delays caused by the Postal Service."

https://www.kickstarter.com/projects/theonlineschool/the-online-school?ref=discovery_category_newest,theonlineschool/the-online-school,"What is The Online School?An online platform that allows all students to gain access to free live schooling delivered by qualified teachers. The service has tailored its learning style and content for students aged 5-18 years old. We teach according to the UK curriculum.The dream is to ensure that every child can get access to great quality education so that they can create a better future for themselves.If we achieve our £500,000 KICKSTARTER goal then we will be able to:- Have a revamped online platform that allows for automatic booking of classes, optimised user journey and enhanced classroom/student security- Be able to evolve from just a single timetable that offers a mixture of classes for various ages throughout the day TO having three unique, simultaneously operating timetables (1 Timetable for Ages 5-11, 1 Timetable for Ages 11-14, 1 Timetable for Ages 14-18)I appreciate that online learning is not a new concept but the way we have adapted our approach is something new and has not been done before.In the book ""The One World Schoolhouse - Education Reimagined"" by Salman Khan (the creator of Khan Academy), he essentially implies that online learning requires human interaction in order to truly help people learn.Our answer to the online schooling conundrum addresses that exact need of assisted learning :)We have:AS WELL ASALSOWho Are We?The Online School is being run by 3Lance Education. We are an Education Hub that provides a range of services to cater for the education, health and social care industries. Our main services entail recruitment for teachers worldwide, outreach services for students and teachers as well as private/group tuition.Due to COVID-19, we found that we were in a unique position where we could leverage the lovely teachers that we work with to do something selfless and positive for the world at large, at a time when the world needs it most.Our MotiveCOVID-19 has made it difficult for students to maintain routine and gain access to quality education. This, in turn, means that parents have an added burden of responsibility for their children which ultimately leads to frustration. If we aggregate this effect across an entire country then the impact is significant and not positive.The Online School will act as a bridge to continue education for children as well as doubling up as a respite service for parents. This way children can remain occupied, engaged and continue to receive structured interaction from well-versed teachers.We have some awesome rewards and gifts to giveaway to you as our way of saying thank you for your pledge. We are also offering you the chance to donate your gifts to refugee children.WHO IS ALI?Hey Everyone, I hope you're all well. I thought the best way to do this was to write a direct message sharing some key experiences I've had in my life and how I feel they may be responsible for the person I am today.At the age of 7 I watched my mum care for children with special needs, she used to foster a child every weekend. I guess it definitely taught me a lot, I appreciated what I had, what others didn't and vice versa. My first job at 16 to pay was working as a carer at an adventure playground for children with special needs (obviously I was a natural at the job after watching SuperMum doing it for so many years!)I worked at the adventure playground for 6 years, by then I had my education out of the way and moved off into the corporate world. However I wanted to still remain part of the playground and coincidentally saw an opportunity to help ensure that the children attending the centre had great carers for themselves. Because it's important for a child regardless of their needs to have someone who can understand them. So I created an education recruitment agency and they were my first client, I helped the playground go from a grade 3 to a grade 1 from OFSTED by providing quality staff.Along side this I began doing charity work at the time of the Syrian refugee crisis in 2015. We made a number of trips out to Europe to try to understand why things were happening and to see if we could do our bit and help out. It just felt awful to see people in desperate need at our door step. But it was really nice to see how so many people came out to help. Then one summer Hardial (a friend) and I raised money for an ambulance to deliver aid to refugees in Lesvos, Greece. We drove from London to Greece in 5 days flat (which was very cool). However during those 5 days we got to see manypoverty stricken/problem areas in certain parts of Europe. Whilst in Greece, we partnered up with Team Humanity and continued supporting them over the years. We wanted to do something for the refugees so that they could also have a support structure around them. We knew that in the future, we would definitely come up with a way of helping out the many refugees in the camps rather than just a few.These stories may seem somewhat random but I feel that these are just a few key moments that have helped define the course of my life. A determined, passionate person who wants to help those in difficult environments and provide them with the tools they need to better their lives.Weare in our fifth week of running The Online School, with on average 20-25 classes a week across English, Maths, Science, Yoga and Dance currently being taught. We have on average up to 30 students per class learning and interacting.We have a current base of 1000 students who have either registered their interest on our site or are currently attending lessons at The Online School.The team is working hard to build up our base of teachers and ensure the website will allow for the school to be operated solely online.The Online School wants to be the leading social platform that connects teachers who have time to volunteer with young people who desire access to our resources (regardless if there is a worldwide lockdown or not).The GoalsWe also have more specific goals for our kickstarter which are as follows:WHAT WE NEED THE FUNDING FOR?PEOPLEThere are 8 people in our team currently that cover a variety of functions (many of them juggling multiple roles). The funding will help us bring in more people that will help us manage the increasing workload more effectively. Primarily we need more moderators that help us maintain the quality of our classes. These aren'texpensive but they are necessary. We will also be able to streamline our resourcing and booking function to better manage the resourcing, compliance and booking of teachers.TECHNOLOGY/PLATFORMThe current website is what we would consider to be a minimum viable product (MVP). This platform helps us manage a single timetable very effectively, however it will be difficult for us to manage multiple timetables and classes simultaneously unless we have a scalable online platform. So a big part of our funding will feed into the development aspect of this. We will build a bespoke website that doesn't rely on Wordpress (which it currently does).The website itself will then cater for online automated student/teacher registration, compliance, weekly class enrolment and performance tracking.BESPOKE CONNECTIVITY PROJECTS WITH REFUGEES AND LOW LITERACY AREASBefore we can educate the world, we need to ensure that they have the necessary tools and equipment required to use our service effectively. So we need to ensure that children have viewing equipment (such as laptops/projectors) as well as access to strong internet which is fundamental.Meet Elle, our fantastic english and drama teacher.Meet Vanessa, another amazing English teacher.Below are a few videos of some of our live classes. The videos have been chosen at random because I want you all to see the school in it's purest form. It's important we understand the dynamic and how these classes are delivered.We have removed the video element of children for the videos below for safeguarding reasons.But just to explain the structure a bit better.... Our classes are awesome because we have a dedicated moderator for every class! That means the teacher can focus on teaching whilst the moderator ensures:- Children are listening- The teacher is fully supported through any technical issues (because this is real life so it definitely happens sometimes, but what's important is how we deal with it!)- Online safety procedures are being enforced (no private chats between students, only appropriate messaging and video content being shown etc)We have been using the Trustpilot account for 3Lance Education (where we currently host our Online School, in future this will live on it's own domain theonlineschool.io) to gather feedback from 1st April 2020 to help us ensure that the service we provide is effective and valuable for both children as as well parents.Have a look below at some of the feedback we've received.We've compiled some reviews from our students to share with you.Below is some of the homework that students have submitted to their teachers @ The Online School.Some of the students also wrote us some reviews so I thought to share those with you too!In the future we will be delivering our Education Outreach Programme through The Online School. The programme is based around reaching out to young people to help them:- Better understand what careers are appropriate for them by connecting them with experienced professionals from their chosen fields of interest i.e. if a student wants to become a footballer, we source the footballer who will attend a session with our students and help them understand the intricacies of pursuing such a career.- Learn life skills that they may not necessarily get in a conventional school (such as what is a mortgage? what do I do in an emergency? what are my rights?)- Help raise awareness around topical issues that surround our youth nowadays such as gangs/gang grooming/abuse.This project was approved by Ealing Council (Local Authority in West London) in late 2019, where the agreement was to be able to pilot the project in two of their community centres where young people attend.Unfortunately due to lockdown, delivering such a programme with Ealing Council has its own challenges. But with The Online School we plan to deliver this programme with full force :)As part of our efforts to help provide free education to the world, we have teamed up with local school teacher Abraham Zulu to help us deliver our mission in Zambia.We have teamed up with Team Humanity who will be instrumental in helping us to prove that we can in fact help provide great quality education to refugees in Greece.Established in 2015 by Salam Aldeen, Team Humanity became one of the leading NGOs on the ground in Lesvos, Idomeni and Athens. They are responsible for helping to save hundreds of thousands of lives.Team Humanity are established in Camp Moria, Lesvos which is home to more than 20,000 refugees.We will be giving all of your gifts that have been pledged to refugee children inside Moria Camp primarily. Video and pictures will be provided so you can have full faith that your pledge reached its intended recipients. Beyond this we will be using funds to help the children in Camp Moria to start learning @ The Online School.In Camp Moria there are approximately 5,000 are refugee children. We want to help provide a consistent timetable of education just for the children of Camp Moria. If we hit our STRETCH GOALS then we could be in a position to say EVERY REFUGEE CHILD IN CAMP MORIA IS RECEIVING GREAT QUALITY, LIVE EDUCATION :)I will leave you with this video of the children in Camp Moria making some noise!Stretch GoalsOur end goal is to be able to provide a constant flow of live lessons for each age group. Currently we are delivering a single timetable that includes various classes for different age groups. With your support we would love to get to our utopia which is multiple timetables (one per age group) occurring simultaneously. Each additional timetable that we introduce requires additional resourcing of teachers, moderators, class planning, infrastructure support and testing.The focus for us is to ensure that the rest of the world is set up to attend classes @ The Online School. This means establishing deals with electronic hardware suppliers that can provide laptops and projectors as well as enhancing internet quality and in some cases establishing internet. Once the groundwork is done, then the children can continue to learn for free.","The biggest problem we face is time. The pandemic is now and this is when people really really need the support.

Teachers can also use this area to select if they want to declare their availability for private 1:1 lessons.Interactiveness is one of the main elements of a great class. So teachers have the ability to create custom polls as well as use pre-built polls to help query the understanding of their students. Teachers are able to see the individual answers of the students as well as at an overall class level. This is useful so teachers are able to adjust the pace and content of their lessons accordingly.Teachers are able to build up their Video CV, a track record of all of their previous classes as well as see their ratings from students/parents. Teachers can use this to get more private 1:1 bookings on the platform but also use this to help them secure a new permanent role in the future!Students from all around the world are able to gain on demand access to qualified live lessons across MATHS, ENGLISH, SCIENCES, HUMANITIES, ARTS, LANGUAGES AND CODING that are suitable for ages 5 - 18.All of these lessons are taught by TEACHERS. People who genuinely start a career to make a positive impact on the lives of young people!Teachers are able to develop their digital profile aka their ""Video CV"" which is available in their dashboard and has a portfolio of their previous online lessons as well as useful metrics like ""reliability"". These are really useful for parents and students to help them choose what teacher they want to learn from. Teachers can also share this with prospective employers i.e Schools.The Online School fairs well against the major players within the EdTech industry. Our specific approach to online education is unique and we believe it is this approach that will help us thrive!It's February 2020 and Ali is already cold whilst booking plane tickets to Regina, Canada (note: it was -30 degrees celsius.. and for a London boy... this is a bit of a shock to the system) but nonetheless, the trip was necessary as we were going to some teaching universities in Canada to find graduate teachers who wanted to relocate to the UK.The trip lasted a week and was very successful. We were able to get 300 great teachers who wanted to make the journey across the pond to UK! Once we got back to the UK, we couldn't wait to get started in finding these amazing Canadian teachers great roles in UK schools. But then....Schools were forced to close. Students and Parents were stuck at home and our Canadian Superstar Teachers were reconsidering the prospect of relocating away from their families. Was our trip to Canada in vain?!We had an army of teachers (not just from Canada) but globally from our prior work and experiences in Education. We had the technical know-how on how to quickly develop and deliver functional digital applications. And most importantly, we saw that the world was struggling to respond to COVID so we wanted to do our fair share to help too.So we created The Online School.We operated for 7 months delivering hundreds of free group and private lessons every month to over 10,000 students. Not only were we able to provide lessons in the UK, USA and Europe but we were able to provide live lessons in refugee camps, low literacy areas as well as orphanages.Our specific mention starts from 2 mins 4 seconds. Please note that the recordings shown were of our old platform that we were using when we first started in March 2020.We subsidised the operational cost for the business and made it free for all at the time as our way of giving back. But now we want to make The Online School sustainable so it can be an ""always-on"" hub for live education that aligns to support UNSDG 4.So the dream now is to create a thriving commercial model that works on charging students £6/ group lesson and a teacher-set price for 1:1 lessons. We will use part of our revenues to reach out to vulnerable communities that are below the poverty line (anyone who's household income is less than £1000/month) and sponsor them with access to free group lessons. **On our new platform there is a means tested application process for those who wish to apply for free lessons**The Online School entered the EdTech market as a free service for everyone, everywhere. But unfortunately this isn't sustainable. However our approach has helped us create a lightweight approach to education. We are able to provide quality group lessons at the lowest price point in the market.However we appreciate that for some parts of the world there is no capacity to pay anything for education. There are in fact over 300M children in the world without proper education. So we will commit to using a significant portion of our revenues towards:If we hit our target we will be able to help grow our team of moderation and compliance officers. This will enable us to maintain a quality of lessons as well as ensuring that teachers are being managed and registered smoothly.If we exceed our initial goal, we will look to establish the following stretch goals:We will expand our product to include an Augmented Reality feature that teachers can use to help illustrate concepts and ideas to students during their lessons at The Online School. Imagine as your teacher is talking about the jungle, monkeys swing across the screen!We will be able to hire our own in house production team that can help to create recorded, interactive lessons which can be used for those who live in areas with poor internet connectivity. This way there are multiple checkpoints that a student will have to ensure remain engaged.We will create an android and iOS app which hosts our recorded lessons as well as our live lessons. This will help us reach communities that have limited access to internet.Establish an Education Centre that has it's own radio station as well as a filming studio where teachers record new content for The Online School for both our apps and website but also to deliver bespoke content to the vulnerable communities that we work with.Below are some examples of lessons that awesome teachers have delivered on our platform.We also help provide meaningful live content to address issues such as racism, knife crime, bullying as well as teaching life skills.The Online School has an amazing team and without them the project wouldn't have gotten this far.","The team behind The Online School has extensive experience within the education, digital and NGO industries. They have been able to achieve a lot in the 7 months from when they had formed (March 2020).  We're not raising funds through Kickstarter to learn or to put together a team. We are launching on Kickstarter to build the The Online School community and together with our early backers, bring the best feedback and ideas to The Online School. We are building a product that matters for people who care. But delays may happen and unexpected events may affect our timeline. We promise to be open, transparent and responsive to you, the The Online School community. To us, the single most important consideration will always be delivering a fantastic product and we will always prioritise quality over schedule.If you have any questions, concerns or feedback, or simply want to drop us a line, you can reach us at info@theonlineschool.uk"

I am and up and coming independent R&B singer, trying to come out with my first album. I am a mother and I have been trying to sing all my life, but couldn't because I had to raise my children. I was a young mother with 3 children my biggest fan was my mother, I din't know my father, I lost my mother when I was in my teens, and she was just turning 50. So I had to raise my children alone with no help,so I put my career on hold to raised my children. I had 3 children, lost one son and my grandson to cancer, that really did devastated me and my family.I am just now kind of getting myself back together after the lost of my son and his 16 year old son my grandson, trying to start over again with my music.My mother and my son was my biggest fans, I know they are watching me, I wanted to show them that I did do my music and made it. Now my children are now grown and I wanted to try again. So that's the reason why I want Kick starter to help me is because, I don't have the money to pay for my studio time.

Sejlo and mail the animal and the portrait back to you. Portraits of stuffed animals will be posted here and on my website www.hofmanncomedy.comThe collected portraits will be featured on my website www.hofmanncomedy.com","I guess the trickiest thing with most of my conceptual projects is convincing people that they are real! I have a strong background in visual arts, but my current creative push is mostly stand-up comedy. I'm trying to combine my bizaare sense of humor with my visual and conceptual art skills. I hope people can find enjoyment in this project. It is all just for fun and is meant to bring joy. Both of my kids love the drawings that I make for them of their stuffed animals. I think parents of children and people who have small children in their life would appreciate a portrait of a child's favorite stuffed animal."

This is my first book and I am so thankful for you toconsidersupporting its success! -SLOAfter three years of studying and writing haiku, it occurred to me that others may enjoy reading them and that they should be brought into a collection and published. This project will be the author's first book of poetry.The book will contain traditional and contemporary haiku written by the author. They will be about life. A haiku is a poem that traditionally started in Asia, which focuses on the seasons, and consists of three lines in a 5-7-5 syllable format. The poem is used to convey a precise idea, memory or feeling. The Haiku in this book will consist of poems about the world we see today both of nature and the people who live in it. A well written haiku will either bring a feeling or an idea to the reader, or will act as a puzzle for the reader to dwell on. Here is an example;The soft cool whisper,of a soon to come winterwarmth passing byThis poem was written about a chilly wind the author felt on a warm fall day. As you see the how the poem is set you may also notice the first two lines usually are in contrast to the third line, making the poem more defined.As soon as this project is funded the book will already have been written and personally edited. It will then be submitted to Create Space to be professionally edited, and designed. Once this is complete and ready to go the book will be copyrighted and submitted to the library of congress. Then it will be for sale on Amazon and its affiliates as a paper-back and ebook.This process, if all goes well, can take as little as two months. However, when I asked other authors they said to give extra time to make sure you can improve the quality of the book through the editing and design process. This being said, the project should be at completion no later than one year after funding approval.Why I need you!One because you are amazing and I would like your endorsement on my project. Also you are the first run to see if this book will hold interest. This book will eventually be published but you can be the person to make it happen this year. Publishing takes money and people willing to read and endorse the work. That is you, you are the reason this is going to be published. If 1000 people can support me by buying a signed copy of the book at $25 dollars this project is paid for and you have made me a published author!Below you will find the rough financial breakdownThis budget insures that there is no risk to you receiving your reward for this project. All prices have been researched to be the best deals and rounded to the nearest thousand to make it simpler in raising of funds.I want to give a shout out to my wife who has supported me in branching out and starting this project, and a special thanks to Jessica Kantrowitz for her advice and help with this project!","The Risk of HaikuMaking my backers bewareMy plan brings reliefThere are three major risks.      1. Production delays. I am self publishing through Amazon's affiliate ""create space."" After a lot of research I settled on this company because it is the most reliable out of all the self publishing groups. However its review included complaints in the past of delayed printing and shipping, due to the publishing pending.     2. Consumer interest. The market for poetry is not as large as those of other literature genres. With research and planning I will be able to release the book with the same quality of others yet at a lower price. I am also investing in marketing to get the word out. This is also one of the reasons this project is on Kickstarter. If the book is fully funded then that means I have already sold roughly 1000 copies. This is all the interest needed to start.     3. The end of the world. There is always the risk that the world will end and my project will never be completed. If however the world does end your rewards for funding are then changed over to giving a good sock in the jaw to the author.",https://www.kickstarter.com/projects/306692605/valintine-love?ref=discovery_category_newest,306692605/valintine-love,"Spreading Love, want to surprise a friend. let a lover know you care? or simply get some mail?This project is a simple valentines day fun.

Like our Facebook page and follow us on Twitter! Feel free to visit all our pages: Web: http://forvmromanvm.com Blog: http://forvmromanvm.com/blog Facebook: http://facebook.com/forvmromanvm Twitter: https://twitter.com/ForvmRomanvm We are a young team from Sofia, Bulgaria, highly motivated to achieve the ambitious goals we have set ourselves. Martin Doychev is studying Computer Science at the Sofia University and Valentin is a Chemical Engineer at UCL in London. Between the two of us we have experience in app development and several entrepreneurial projects. Our graphic designers- Denitsa and Martin Mirchev have extensive experience in their area of expertise as well. If you would like to know more about us, feel free to contact us using the details below. Forvm Romanvm is a massive multiplayer online roleplaying game- MMORPG for Android, in which players can choose to be a Roman merchant, commander, politician or even all at the same time. In addition to the economic and military modules of the game, what makes Forvm Romanvm stand out from the standard MMORPG’s is the unique social system, which allows the players to define the game by passing their own laws and acts, electing their governors, making court rulings and picking the wars their society fights – it’s up to the Patricians (1), Equestrians (2) and Plebeians (3) to build Rome and the world. We aim to provide players with immense freedom of choice, allowing tons of possible scenarios to develop based on their decisions. For example, imagine the following situation – the Senate passes a law, stating that nobody can possess more than 5 ships. Disregarding the new law, the Consul (4) decides to buy a fleet of 20 ships. At the same time, a budding businessman makes an identical move against the law. The Court can prosecute both parties for the crimes they have committed. However, due to the Consul’s influence on the judiciary, the Court decides to only sue the businessman. The whole plot can play out in mere hours, all orchestrated by players. 1- Patrician- The Roman political elite 2- Equestrian- The Roman aristocracy 3- Plebeian- The general body of free Roman citizens 4- Consul – The highest elected office of the Roman Republic.The game is constructed of 3 modules – economic, war and socio-political, which are all related and closely interconnected. Every player can develop their career in all three modules of the game at the same time, although, since money is a finite resource, some may find it a bit challenging to keep up in all aspects of the game. Forvm Romavm is turn-based, meaning that every several hours the world is refreshed and players have to make more decisions for their society. The economic module deals with the issue of earning and spending game money. Farms, fishing ships, slaves, natural resources and, most importantly, the sestertii (5) were the driving forces of the ancient Roman economy. Ultimately, all that matters are exactly those coins, regardless whether you will be using them to bribe the plebeians, maintain legions or reinvest them to earn even more.5- Sestertii (sing. sestertius) – ancient Roman coin, introduced as a ¼ of a denarius.The war module deals with the issue of spending money. Battles are fought automatically during the end of every turn and detailed reports are presented to players through their “advisors”. The main army unit is the legion and, although there are different types of legions with varying characteristics, the goal is always the same – “Veni, vidi, vici”. Nevertheless, no matter how good you are in battles, senators will decide whether you deserve a Triumph (6) in Rome. You are now probably asking yourself -“Can I conquer all of Rome for myself?” You have to prepare yourself for a long battle against all odds. You will need loads of money, devoted soldiers and loyal friends to even get near to crossing Rubico (7). 6- Triumph – celebration and sanctification of an army commander who had won great military successes or completed a foreign war. 7- Crossing Rubico – an idiom, meaning to pass a point of no return; referring to Julius Ceasar’s army’s crossing of the river in 49 BC. The socio-political module is by far the most interesting one in Forvm Romanvm. It addresses many issues but in short – “Divide et impera” (8). If you can show the Senators, the Patricians and the Consul himself that you can be trusted, you will have all the money, all the power and all the armies you want. Lose their confidence and you may be left all on your own…or, worse, even killed. You can do anything – become a Senator or even one of the Consuls; talk to the people at the Forum and convince them that the war against Egypt, for example, is not in Rome’s best interest. You can be a Dictator or a King, if you can convince the Senate that drastic measures are needed. Laws are created and enforced by players and, if someone violates them, the Court, responsible for punishing offenders, is also represented by the players. If the judges decide there is enough evidence against you, you will have to prepare for some hard time in jail or turn over your pockets, even if you are not guilty! 8- “Divide et impera” – latin for “Divide and rule”We have decided to choose “freemium” as our business model– you can play for free, but if you decide to boost your account, you can do so by taking advantage of in-game purchases. Although we want the game to make a profit, we will not allow the paid purchases to disbalance the dynamics of the game.As any proud Roman would do, we would like to offer you rewards for any pledges you contribute to the project. Some may call them bribes, but, as we all know, Roman politicians never take bribes!You can take a look at the table below and consider which reward package suits you best. As you can see, once the game is launched, every contributor will get coupons of value equal to the amount pledged. Attention: In order to preserve the game balance and fair-play, we will impose a limit to the amount of coupons that can be used per player over a given period of time, e.g. 10 coupons per month. More information on this will be supplied later. True Roman Email and Wallpaper All our backers will receive our sincere regards via email. We appreciate your support and we want to show that. In addition, we will attach a cool Forvm Romanvm wallpaper to remind you of our project while we are developing it. In-game coupons For any pledge you will get the same amount of in-game value once we launch. Your account will be credited with coupons that you will be able to spend in any way you want, but keep in mind that we will impose a certain limit to the coupon usage in order to keep the game in balance early on. Of course, this limit will be carefully set, taking in consideration the total amount of coupons. “Pledged” badge An exclusive badge for your profile in Forvm Romanvm – this feature will only be available to our backers here in Kickstarter. It will be an accolade in your profile page, showing everybody you are a part of the idea. Rules&Art PDF The name says it all – the complete rulebook of Forvm Romanvm, together with some exclusive art. Beta access Invitation to the beta testing of Forvm Romanvm, the last stage before our official launch. Learn all about the game mechanics and winning strategies first.

Building naming rights Rome is famous for its architecture, among many other things. This reward will allow you to name a building in the way you think it should be named. Still, the name will have to be thematically picked, as we are willing to preserve the atmosphere of the game. We will discuss it together to make an unforgettable experience. House naming rights Similar to the previous, this reward will give you the right to pick the name of one of the houses in Forvm Romanvm. Discussion with the team to keep the atmosphere and authenticity of the game is, again, a requirement. Soldier look-a-like Our legions need leaders and who would suit better than our backers? Send us some of your pictures and our artists will do all the rest. Your face will represent one of the several army types in Forvm Romanvm. New Feature Our goal is to allow the players absolute in-game freedom. This reward is the closest we thought of in allowing players to define the game. We will hear your idea, mold it together and make a perfect new feature for Forvm Romanvm. Producer You are “Julius Ceasar” – one of the most important people ever born in the whole world. Your opinion is a law to us, your voice – the voice of the Gods. You get all previous rewards and some special treatment from our team. Ave, Ceasar!  We sure have a lot of influences on this popular topic, but to mention a few – Rome Total War (PC Game), Spartacus (TV series), Rome (TV series), Gladiator (Movie). At the moment, we have the whole game system, mechanics and dynamics developed and ready for use. The graphic designers have provided some concept art, which you can see throughout this page. As the project goes, we will supply even more game art. We have a modest prototype of the app, as you can see from our screenshots. Still, we believe that implementation will require far less effort than what we have accomplished so far. Original Goal: 15000 GBP – “Rome meets Android” The original goal includes the full product development of the game for Android as we have described it so far. Stretch goal #1: 20000 GBP – “Mercenary Endeavours” Our Mercenary Endeavours stretch goal expansion would include an additional quest module, giving players more opportunities to receive rewards by completing a variety of tasks based on their game progress. Stretch goal #2: 25000 GBP – LOCKED! Unlocked after completing original goal. Stretch goal #3: 30000 GBP – LOCKED! Unlocked after completing stretch goal #1.We are young, determined, well-prepared, educated and ready to take on the world. Our experience so far has motivated us to take on a project of such scale and we believe we have the right team, driven by our common passion to make it all happen. If this campaign succeeds, not only we will make a great game, but we will be learning valuable lessons and gaining extremely important experience, not to mention the amazing time we will be having making this project come true.

i am covert23 and i would like to offer you the full back catolog from deep cover studios...580+ finely crafted pieces of music ...some have been released and are on beat-port now https://www.beatport.com/artist/covert23/345133/releases , but there are many a hundred fresh tunes waiting to be discovered...i have been in the studio making beats for the past 17 years and have built a fine collection of my own music and its time to share it... ive been a dj/producer for over nearly a quarter of a century and have seen many styles come and go leaving its mark on my sound, from the humble bedroom dj in 1990 to playing the very last gig at the hacienda in manchester, ive played at teknivals all around europe and even had gigs in the usa,   my music has been released on a quite a few labels from usa to mexico to italy to way over in Belarus... getting great feed back from the dance-floor and music community...there are currently 580 tracks on my soundcloud account from which you can listen before you decide to fund the project... heres a linkhttps://soundcloud.com/covert23 or just get the whole vault 580+ tracks on a verbatim usb memory stick in wav format....if we get lucky we will get a limited press vinyl of some of my latest releaseswe need to raise £800 for vinyl production..so that option needs 80 backers before we go to press...if we dont get 80 backers for the vinyl option those backers will be offered money back or a t shirt and sticker and the top 20 downloads instead of the vinylbelow is a very small selection of the music available...the above two tracks are my latest ep on cobb recordings from belarus...like i say its a work in progress so we will be adding tracks as and when they are made all will be included on usb before shipping.....january 2018forward thinking dance musik...xxxBack in 89, i first went to angels in burnley to see markus k and the hypnotist. it blew my mind and was everything i was looking for,the club was a classic sweat pit. i went week in week out with the likes of carl cox. k klass, altern 8 and many others graced the stage.the lasers and lights and potions altered my perception of life and how the human race could live......Weeks flew bye and my love for the scene grew, me and a few core friends used to travel miles for the free partys, blackburn raves, wigan peer, sequins blackpool, the orbit in leeds, life in manchester, the hacienda to name a few...we all used to end up at mine after the club,i would empty the house and garage and have free partys hundreds came and went with no fuss ,no mess and always a friendly smile on everyone's face....i started spiritual groove promotions with a mate called murt... he now runs monster trucks all over the uk and europe and i make musik....back in 90 we hired a club called the white rose and did a few club events, with free partys afterwards at mine...we also did gigs at the bluenote in todmorden .in 93 me and ben flew to the states with records in our bag...We got gigs at tracks in tampa,voodoo in key west and simons innermind in gainsville, in 95 i managed to get an old basement in todmorden and with the little cash i had,converted four rooms into a little club called mad space,the party started on friday and ended usualy mid week,we spent days in there,people from all over the world used to end up there and every body had big smiles when they left.it was there i met rob and sue from desert storm.we got talkin and talkin led to partys called fijit techno....We did gigs all over the north of england in quaries on the moors at mad space and the blue note, in 97 i went to Portugal to play at starfish, a party put on by Jayne and Steve and family it was wicked,i managed to get a residency at a local club for a few months so i stayed for the summer....then came back and continued with space and our mad partys...In 99 i took my records to spain,to papingyon.to the end of the world free tecnival with ati and woodi n ian, i djd with Kieth from desert storm,the gig was massive there were rigs from all over europe,it was just crazy,six days on a hill by the beach..the same year i played the very last gig at the hacienda, it had been squatted by the occasional cafe collective,i got there at midnight with my record bag and got on the decks at 1 oclock and played my last record at 8 am a seven hour set not bad for a novice...The club was rammed at least a thousand people there, far buisier than any club night,it was absolutely mental people were swinging from the rafters going crazy to my musik... what a gig.... my best yet......In 2000 i did a millenium party on a farm in norfolk, a monsterous 30 hour set, i was rooted to the spot at the end...that year i played at exodus in luton, Glastonbury and also check teck. 9 days in a field. i spun the wheels on a 50k rig to thousands of people. what an experience... from there we ended up in holland with spiral tribe,desert storm,hectic and many other rigs...The past few years have been spent playing at local free partys and in deep cover studio learning new things and trying new techniques trying to get my own sound together...so if you ever need a dj or producer leave a message, will travel anywhere in the world. Peace and love Michael......i did another mix of the above that david guetta championed on his radio show.....go to sound cloud now and find your musichttps://soundcloud.com/covert23this was a classical composition I made when my farther past away...",the only risk i see with this project is that we don't get 80 backers for the vinyl option and a memory stick or two fail in which case send them back to me and ill get another one sorted as for challenges... the biggest challenge has been completed and thats evident on sound-cloud 580 pieces of crafted music...there is no risk just benefits from this project

I want to ask the Kickstarter community to help by backing us on our journey. We would love your support good vibes and prayers for safety as we journey.For every $33 raised (up to $330) a location in need of a cleansing will be sought out. Once such a location is found trash and recyclables in the area will be collected--I'm big on recycling, if there is a reasonable place to drop them off and I'm able to safely clean and transport them then the recyclables will be separated. I’ll keep an eye out for items that can be terracycled as well (If you don’t know what that is check this out www.terracycle.com)--.Once cleaned a shrine will be made with the intent to bless and give thanks to the land.I will take and upload photos to my Facebook where you can follow the journey and share in the adventure.

I've been making art all my life. I like to work with all types of 2d mediums and I decided to try sculpting a few years ago. I stumbled upon needle felting while browsing Pinterest and thought, ""I have to try that!"" So I did. I've only made typical animals like dogs, deer, and horses. The largest one I've created is about 6 inches long. I want to expand my ideas and create bigger and unique sculptures.Some works I've done:I've had some requested and sold, so I wanted to to it a step forward. I want to go bigger and more extreme. So I've decided to make hybrid and mythological creatures. I want to combine human, animal, and plant aspects into these pieces; this includes materials. I've experimented with this by using twigs as antlers for deer. I want to try using beads, threads, and fabrics to make them more doll like.Unlike my paintings, my sculpture work has leaned more towards craft.I want to create three sculptures to show the relationships between plants, animals, and humans and three more representing the three ideas. (I'll add concepts soon.)45% supplies for felting and rewards35% printing costs20% shipping costs","I am a college student, but I will make time for this project.

These felted creatures I make, as well as my 2d works, are so fun to make that I've dedicated my whole life to them. I discovered needle felting a few years back and loved it ever since. I'm raising funds to aquire more materials and supplies for more projects like this one.Since these creatures started out as drawings, that's where I'll begin. The sketches will be what I want them to look and will become the illustrations for the rewards. The process is simple and I can make them fairly quick, so the wait won't be so unbearable.",The only risk is the postal service.

I have chosen to instead of placing a video to place one of the songs titled Vampire Chronicles episode 6 The Lonely Hunter. It's about the loneliness that the hunter(vampire) feels.If this project is funded Strange Graphs plans to buy some more equipment for the development of the project including FL Studio addons and some more new headphones.,There will be some obstacles creating some of the songs in such a way that they will all make sense for the story/concept of the album.

I do this all out of pocket, and through createspace, but my books and eBooks are on all major sites. I want to take this a step further, and start making hardcover books. This is not a cheap process at all, and even with minimum orders it's still a chunk of change. I would like to be able to have stock though, because I will be doing more classroom, library visits and also book signings in hopes of helping to inspire creativity and learning.  Unfortunately the wall in comes in to play when doing everything on your own.

Hours, days, weeks, even months can be spent on a single project before the vision is realized.I've been working with chainmaille for a couple years now, and have up to recently been satisfied with selling a piece here or there to have money to buy more materials. Now, I'm trying to take that leap from hobbyist, to professional. I'm enrolled as a vender in a few events this year, but I want to bring my work, and the art of chainmaille more mainstream. I've seen several kickstarter projects do really well with just bracelets, but I've yet to see any slave bracelets. So, I've decided to make a project to hopefully help me along the way to creating a viable business in a craft field that I've come to realize, many people love.I've set my goal low, so that with just a few backings, people who support the journey will get to benefit too.

By clicking, you earn gold, with gold you can unlock different stages. Each level has a different puzzle to solve, what makes it a really hard game to finish. With earned gold you can also buy clothes and accessories for your character, which is the main face of your progress... you also click him to get that gold!I really want that game to stand out, that's why I need something that I can accomplish it with. Graphics is necessary in order to provide high valuable gaming experience. I'm putting 100% in, but that's not enough. I realised that I also need sound effects, licenses for publishing and at the same time, I need to make sure that everything is going in a good way.Thanks in advance to everyone that helped, tried to help or read this.

I am starting this campaign because that game, for now, is everything to me. I want to make something, that me myself, will be proud of it in the future. Also I am trying to fill up my portfolio, because I am only 18 years old. The game itself doesn't need a lot of money in order to get it looks better, but as I am currently studying, the costs don't fit in my budget. The campaign will raise the money for necessary graphics, licenses and sound effects. I tried to make it as low as possible!Is the game published?Yes, it is! You can find it under the link below!https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.rawrstudio.riddleclickerGame is in beta. What that means?It means that there is still lots of work to do, but I hope I can make it come true with you!Is the game being updated at least?Yes, it is! I update the game daily, providing at least one new level a day! Each week I am trying to add new features to the game, such as new gambling methods, or new elements, like shop, settings etc.Project:In Riddle Clicker, you click to get coins, which you can spend on either new levels or gambling! Updates are every day, in which I always make at least one new level! Although of the big popularity of clicker games, and a vast collection of them, I decided to make my own. Through the entire history of Google Play, I've never stood upon a game, that was a clicker and had riddles instead of normal shop. After short period of time, I decided to take my thoughts out of my brain, and put it inside the game. Creation of this game took a lot of time, because the whole project is made by me. It is also worth to mention, that the game is my first ever created, so I had to put 110% into making it. Daily I spend lots of time on creating the game, but also playing, and enjoying it. You should also try it out!Above, you can see the clicking scene, which is almost the most important thing in the game. You click using you finger (you can use as many fingers as you want). Randomly, between a minute and more than five-six minutes, a coin will pop up, which upon clicking on it, gives random amount of coins! P/C is your clicking power, you can upgrade it by completing levels!Each day there is one new level. I will be doing it until I run out of puzzles, but for now, I have lots of ideas for them! Of course, each level gives something in return, i.e. every single one of them, gives P/C! Depend on level difficulty, there are different amounts of P/C that you will get. Also, in order to get that level, you need to have coins, that's why clicking is important, but not the most important. Mostly, focus on completing the levels, they give you P/C which makes the prize in Wheel Of Fortune greater! It is probably the time, to show you at least one level!Above, you can see one of many riddles. In this particular one, you need to type something in, but my riddles aren't always about typing. In some of them, you need to move something around, try to put it into different places, sometimes you also have to use google to search up possible answer! Many, many options of solving the riddle, educating yourself in a way, and having fun at the same time! If you run out of riddles, you can go and try your luck!You can either try your luck on roulette, or wheel of fortune (I prefer roulette)! Everything that you see, was made by me, every script and every graphics (maybe not the coin or the smartphone vector but you get the idea). In roulette, obviously, you try to hit the colour by betting on it! I have lost many coins on roulette so far, so use your head and do it wisely!That's the end for now! I hope I somehow encouraged you to download, review or at least spread the word about my game. If you do so, stay tuned every day for new updates! More people come around, more energy I get, which in return, gives me courage to make even bigger updates!I am thankful for reading this, and I hope, I'll see you in my game!","The biggest challenge in making this game, is being able to publish it on iOS and get good sound effects. These are two of main goals why I started this campaign. Hope, as a community, we can make it happen!"

However, the average person does not use a computer to create drawings because it's too difficult, expensive and inefficient.I started my career drafting. I am acutely aware a drafting board and straight edge is not cutting edge technology, but the speed, beauty and convenience of hand drawings should not be lost in our rush to embrace a technology with a much higher cost, learning curve and complexity.Sketching, good, clear, concise illustrations, drawn quickly by hand, using simple tools, will be always be one of our most fundamental tools for design and collaboration.I developed Sketch-EZ as a tool for both the developed and especially less developed parts of the world. To be inclusive and diverse in manufacturing, adaptation and use.","Sketch-EZ has been in development for several years. I have made hundreds of prototypes and tested many, many variations. Sketch-EZ has performed wonderfully in testing.The Sketch-EZ design specifically reflects low cost tooling and ease of manufacturing while maintaining excellent utility.  I have several hundred of my custom white vinyl 12x18 magnetic sheets in stock and will start shipping them within days. These are for the crafters and early adopters who might want to experiment and mount the custom magnetic sheets to their own cutting boards, or their backer of choice and make their version of my straight edge.

Now that my wee bairn is getting older I'm finding myself with more time and would love to help my partner out. It's always about money right?! Just kidding. I need non domestic things to do! I need to keep my digital skills and portfolio sharp! Why else did I get an art degree?That's why my KS goal is so small. Just high enough to fulfill my minimum order requirement and cover my Kickstarter fees.About this project!I love the simplicity of silhouettes. They are classic, heirlooms to be enjoyed for generations! Growing up we had a few stashed away of ancestors that I always enjoyed trying to identify. I love that people are starting to bring them back with a modern twist! Animal silhouettes in nurseries! Yes please!I feel it also makes a great way to remember beloved pets and to showcase their unique features.All of my silhouette prints are printed in a professional lab on high quality paper with a deep matte finish. The keychain is then encapsulated in a rectangle of plastic to protect it from your keys!How it'll work: just sent me a side image of the subject you wish to have the silhouette make of. I'll do the rest.Stretch goals are a thing if you want them.Let's say:@ $150 you can order a second silhouette for an additional $10! or a second copy for $5.Feel free to tell me what you would like to see as a stretch goal for $300!","My greatest challenge will be creating all of your lovely silhouettes with a small baby in the house! I may be required to stay up late into the night, listening to the cicadas in order to get them all completed!"

Fast forward to 2017 and photography has remained one of my key passions and has remained even more so important than ever! I have since moved onto a DSLR to push my creative boundaries further!In 2016 when I started to set up the basic elements of business, I signed up to the 'Explore Enterprise' course with 'The Prince's Trust' within a month I was put forward to 'Tomorrow's Talent' which is a competition exploring creative talent with big names such as 'Oasis Fashion', 'Fat Face' and 'ASOS'. I ended up winning runner-up with one of my images out of hundreds of applicants with 'Oasis Fashion' which I'm featuring on one of the post cards designs! For more information on this achievement please read more here:https://www.princes-trust.org.uk/about-the-trust/initiatives/tomorrows-talent/2016-competitionThe aim of this project is to launch some 'Creative Kent' postcards all featuring my own images. To start with I'm launching just the four postcards but with your support this could stretch to more if the goal is met! I'm also aiming to provide support to those who need help with their creative careers through classes and hands on help! With your pledge this can become a reality and will assist those within areas of Kent! This is about helping communities that once helped me and my way of giving back to those individuals. I'll also include updates to you as regularly as I can to show the progress being made and to show the difference being made to creative talent.I'd like to thank those who have already made a pledge, It's making a huge difference to boost overall confidence towards this project so a huge thank you to those individuals, It means the world.Jasper.","With hope of completing the project, Initially the focus will be about meeting supply and demand for the postcards and keeping everyone who has helped this make a reality happy, from that point onwards it's then moving onto supporting the community that helped me. If the Kickstarter is successful then there should be no problem with starting classes and inspiring other like minded individuals with their goals! This'll be my go to example of success I'll refer to- providing it's hopefully positive outcome.",https://www.kickstarter.com/projects/1425003592/memoirs-of-africa-postcards?ref=discovery_category_newest,1425003592/memoirs-of-africa-postcards,"‘Jasper Moorhouse Photography’ as an individual in late 2016 visited Nairobi and other areas in Africa for just over a week. During my visit I took over one thousand images of animals, scenery and nature. This was all thanks to the great company that entailed on the visit. Fast forward to 2017, I’m now looking to do something with my images from my adventures abroad. Having been on this trip of a lifetime, My initial thoughts were to try and push my abilities to make something worth while and quirky! Using my newly found confidence to create and with the amazing community that is Kickstarter, I thought that this was the best way to explore this creative idea and push it further than the boundaries of my local community.The idea?The aim of this project is to launch some ‘Memoirs of Africa’ postcards exclusively for all those on Kickstarter. I am intending to launch five postcards at first, providing it’s successful outcome the amount of postcards could stretch a bit further if the goal is met! Some postcards could include these images below. The asking amount is enough to cover the costs of 5 lots of postcards, as mentioned, if I get anything over it’ll go into supplying more postcards to you! Once the supplier has made and produced the postcards, I’ll then begin to distribute the postcards to my pledgers, shipping them out straight away almost (perks of living near a post office)… Because of how this project is calculated and structured, your pledge includes postage so there’s no hidden costs once the project is funded!","Kickstarter is an incredible platform for making creative ideas come to life there’s no doubt about that. Having already put measures in place on what to do once the goal is met, it’s all about meeting supply and demand and delivering on time within the limit which should be by November 2017.  The money raised from this campaign will go straight to the print supplier to give back to you in the form of some super swanky postcards! In the unlikely event of if there is any delays or issues, I will do my upmost to keep you updated the best I can."

Happiness is like a unicorn, forever elusive and just out of reach! You spend your whole life chasing happiness: working really, really hard, but will you ever find happiness? Probably not!!! And if you do, it'll just last for a second and disappear again!Sadness is here and present! Sadness is always there, you never have to go far to find it! Unlike happiness, sadness comes free, there is no work or effort involved!Taking into account the universality of sadness, I've decided to open up a Sadness Museum & Hotel.

The Soska Sisters were absolutely thrilled with my work and kept gushing about it as well as coming back multiple times as repeat customers on the 2nd and 3rd days of the con. It may be a little hard to see, but here they are wearing custom earrings they requested from me.A better image is that of Tristan Risk (Little Miss Risk) wearing her choker and matching custom earrings.If you look closely, you might be able to see that the center piece and the pieces dangling on the earrings are tiny glass vials. Sealed inside those vials are real preserved octopus tentacles! These came from a fish market where they would have been tossed in the trash to rot so they were taken and preserved instead. They were not hunted/caught with the intention of using them for this purpose.Tristan is the only one with that choker, but she, the Soska Sisters, and Jessica Cameron all have matching earrings that I custom made for them while at the con and they've all said that they absolutely love them!A new piece I have designed and started making is chainmail pouch necklaces that you can put small things inside of. Things like stones, dice, or other small trinkets that you want to carry with you. The large ring serves as the opening when held sideways or it closes the bag when hung by making all of the closure rings hang at the bottom of it.Another unique piece that is also my own design is the Skeletal Hand Bracelet. Below I have a picture of one of the steampunk Skeletal Hands that I've made. Each one is unique in its decoration and how the gears or other pieces are placed, but they are all made with genuine Mother Of Pearl beads for the wrist and metal links in between the joints to make them flexible. The rings on each finger are adjustable to fit anyone and if the wrist piece doesn't fit, I do also make bracelet extenders for them to fit larger wrists.I've also started dabbling into lampworking (making glass pieces) and just started creating glass tentacles.This picture shows one still on the rod just after making it.And this one is just after making a complete necklace with one of them. All of the glass beads on this necklace were hand made by me and there are also 2 genuine jasper stone beads carved into heart shapes. I used a mix of red and silver chains and added a heart shaped toggle clasp to connect it. (This necklace is one of the rewards)My hope is to continue to make more and more interesting pieces that people will love... even custom pieces!The best thing of all is that with every single piece I make, I make a promise... if for some reason something I've made breaks in some way, and it's a way that I'm able to fix, I will fix it for free! You just have to bring me all of the pieces. If there are missing pieces or things that need replaced (that I can replace), you just pay for the pieces I need to use to fix it, generally no more than a few pennies or so depending on the piece(s) needed.","My biggest challenge would be being able to get rewards made and sent on time if this over-funds, but even if things are sent a little late, they will get done and sent before the end of this year.

Contributors to the project are going to be the ultimate determiners of what the art looks like in its final form.It works like this.Above is an image captured from a fractal. At zero iterations, the picture you see wouldn't exist - it would be black. For each person that contributes, I will iterate the fractal an additional time.

When the clock runs out on this project, I will run the fractal with the number of iterations equal to the total number of contributors.

I was recently watching Animal Planet and the monkeys on whatever show I was watching were making some crazy faces, so I wanted to see if I could replicate it. On TV, the monkeys looked like they had a little bit of sass in them, so I wanted to make sure my animals were saying some crazy things, too. Make sure to check the Updates page to see ALL of the sticker designs!How big are the stickers? The sassy stickers are 1.5"" x 1.5"" squares, and the non-sassy are 1.5"" diameter circles.What if I don't want the ""sass""? You can actually pick whether you want the sassy version (square) or just the cute little animal (circular). Look at the rewards section for details.What are you going to do with the money? I just graduated from law school, so I have a lot of expenses related to school and the bar. Since I'm not working this summer to study for the bar, your participation will help me put food on the table and gas in the tank.These are awesome! Why is your goal so low?! I set my goal at a (hopefully) relatively easy target to make sure I hit it. Of course, I would love to far exceed it!Thanks for looking. Let me know if you have any questions or comments!Grant",

The Checkers have been improved from their original design for the ease of 3D printing. They can be printed hollow to save on plastic and achieve light weight parts, or solid for even more weight and rigidity. The classic checkers game pieces are typically black and white, but you can choose any color plastic you wish to print and customize your checkers. This also goes for the special game case offer!The classic style checker has been recreated into a new 3D printable design. By avoiding supports, the parts surface quality is greatly increased. When printed hollow, more parts can be created with less plastic. The game pieces were made to nest into one another for use during game play (""King me""). Above the lower ""step"" of the piece is a specially angled taper which allows for great support-less 3D prints and excellent part fitment. I have found my most quality prints are achieved by using the printers lowest setting speed, a 2mm layer height, and individual prints.The 3D printable checker is designed to be used with a classic style 8x8 square game board which has a total of 64 squares.

All the brackets are made using industrial pipe which is polished to a high shine finish but left untreated, a lot of people using copper pipe like to lacquer their product to maintain the shine, I don't. The reason I don't is twofold. First of all, not everyone wants a high shine look they like the copper to tarnish naturally which increases the appeal for them, if you do want it to remain shiny then just use some Brasso once in a while. Secondly lacquer chips, no matter what you are promised, lacquer chips, that means you have an ultra shiny shelf bracket with areas of it tarnishing naturally where the lacquer has chipped off, it does not look good.All the joints are cold welded with an industrial grade two part polymer adhesive which contains metal, they do not come apart. I don't solder joints because it is not as strong as cold welding and the heat also affects the look of the pipe and fittings.Each bracket has two munsen rings and backplates for securing the bracket to the wall.If you would like any more information on my project please feel free to message me.","The risks are simple, if I don't achieve enough backers, I won't be able to complete the project.My only challenge will be finding enough backers or if I am too successful completing the thousands of brackets I will produce in the timescale I have set!"
https://www.kickstarter.com/projects/1281568439/ode-to-order?ref=discovery_category_newest,1281568439/ode-to-order,"The Standard Model of particle physics contains many precisely measured parameters, including the masses and g-factors of electrons and protons, whose numerical values appear to be unrelated but in fact are constrained by certain proportions. I've written a poem expressing this subtle mathematical order as a sequence of equations that, with your help, will mark a turning point in our understanding of time and space.To commemorate this grand moment in history I intend to have the first page of the poem laser engraved onto a sheet of titanium, which will be placed near the location where the poem originated (in Setauket, New York). For a contribution of $20 you can have your name engraved on it and immortalized as a ""Special Thanks,"" or for $400 you can have your own titanium memento with a personalized, engraved dedication.Ok, why titanium?The strength-to-weight ratio of titanium is superior to all other solid elements due to the presence of 22 protons within each atomic nucleus. After reading the poem it will be clear that the unique mass-energy of titanium is not an accident but a consequence of the underlying order of space-time.Isn't space-time already described by string theory?All versions of string theory define basic units of time and space in terms of Newton's gravitational constant (G), Planck's constant (h), and the speed of light (c). Believing these Planck units to be fundamental to the nature of space-time, string theorists obtain mathematical consistency only by assuming there are extra spatial dimensions hidden from observation. The inability to test this critical aspect of string theory is a major flaw that invites serious thinkers to look for a more rational alternative.If instead we assume the squared speed of light is equivalent to (135)(136)/20^2, and consider the fundamental limits of time and space to be complementary distances of 20 and 2, as I advocate in my interpretation, then a pattern involving multiples of 22 found among several highly stable natural structures provides strong evidence in support of this alternative conception of space-time.What pattern?Hydrogen, titanium, carbon dioxide, water density, standard amino acids, mitochondrial tRNA, human autosomes, and the solar magnetic cycle all form exceptionally stable structures that exhibit clear proportionality with multiples of 22.So what?So this pattern spanning various scales of space-time is precisely what we would expect to find if the limits of time and space reduced to complementary distances of 20 and 2, respectively, which follows naturally from the hypothesis that the squared speed of light is equivalent to the ratio (135)(136)/20^2.So I'm a pattern in space-time?Yes and the proof can be found in the mathematical order of this poem and the accompanying explanation.In closing, let's consider two possibilities: The first possibility is these relations are meaningless. The pattern involving multiples of 22 is nothing more than a numerical coincidence with no relevance to the actual nature of space-time. In this case, either string theory is an accurate description of the universe at its most basic level or we will eventually find another theory that does not regard multiples of 22 as having any special significance. It would then be obvious that these relations are just a silly waste of time.The other possibility is rather profound in its implications. First we would recognize that multiples of 22 do indeed have special significance to the true nature of space-time, then we would realize that string theory and similar ideas are misguided, and finally we would seek a rational, geometric interpretation of the order evident in these relations.If you'd like to learn more then I encourage you to visit true22.blogspot.com and peruse some of the articles there. Please understand that while the poem is essentially finalized, the interpretation and explanation is a work in progress.","• What if it's wrong?The poem itself conveys only the truth expressed in the universal language of mathematics.• I mean, what if the poem is irrelevant to our understanding of space-time?Then this will all have been a big waste of time and, if the project is funded with your money, then a waste of that too. Of course, if these relations turn out to be essential to our understanding of time and space, as they appear to be, then your support will be crucial to this historical development and that makes for a pretty good story.In the spirit of kickstarter, this is truly an all or nothing proposition.",https://www.kickstarter.com/projects/1281568439/proof-god-exists-as-an-omnipresent-harmony?ref=discovery_category_newest,1281568439/proof-god-exists-as-an-omnipresent-harmony,"Let's put aside the ancient texts and ignore our intuition for a moment while we try to determine rationally whether or not God exists.If there is an ultimate source of order, which operates all around us and within us for all eternity, then that entity must be God. So when we question the existence of God we are asking whether this all-pervasive creative entity is real or imagined. By studying the limits of matter we can determine with high probability that such an entity does indeed exist.The rational case for God rests on 3 key facts:Altogether these observations compel us to conclude there is a subtle omnipresent harmony that functions as the source and guiding force of matter throughout the universe. Because these traits are understood to be exclusive to God, we thus have definitive proof of God's existence.The full proof can be found here:www.proof-god-exists.blogpot.comThe goal of this kickstarter campaign is to produce an 8x12"" aluminum plaque containing the main set of proportional constraints for the fundamental physical parameters that will be sent to the head of the Physics Department at Stony Brook University, which not only has a world-renowned physics program but is also near my home. Why an aluminum plaque? Because it's cheaper than titanium and more permanent than paper. Why the Physics head? Because the best way to establish the validity of this proof is for a respected physicist to acknowledge the significance of the parametric constraints, which are currently unknown to the physics community.For every $100 in funding I'll be able to send 1 of these plaques to an expert who may be persuaded by the truth to affirm the significance of these observations. Sending these plaques out to multiple people increases the odds that at least one of them will see the light. I'll also send along a copy of the full proof with a section that includes the names of all the backers to this project.For a donation of $50 I will send you one of these aluminum plaques and you can own a piece of history.For a donation of $100 I will send you an aluminum plaque with a personalized thank you on it and I will send another plaque (with your personalized thank you) to the expert of your choice.For a donation of $30 I will send you the ""22"" t-shirt, which is black and features the elegant constraint for the nuclear masses and g-factors. Made from organically grown cotton by American Apparel, it's soft and very comfortable. (Men's and women's styles available.)For a donation of $10 I will send you the ""Proof God Exists"" poster (18x24"") that contains the main set of constraints, a diagram of the toroidal structure of space-time,a section that describes the pattern of stability among natural structures, and a short blurb that explains why this constitutes proof of God's existence. Like the periodic table for chemistry students, it's an excellent teaching aid that concisely expresses an intrinsic pattern in nature.By contributing to this project you are helping to spread the news of a unique proof of God founded on physical experiments and rational thought. This is not an endorsement of any particular religion. Rather it is an explanation about the space we share that provides profound insight to those who take the time to understand it.","I have already made successful prototypes for each of the reward items so there should not be any problems on that end.The main risk seems to be that the experts who receive the plaque won't take the time to read the explanation or offer a response. Since the aim of this project is to convince rational people that these observations constitute evidence of God, if they outright reject the idea then the project will not be deemed a success. However, backers can rest assured that even if the campaign fails to spark a larger conversation right away, their items will forever express the eternal truth about our material existence and it's only a matter of time before this truth is more widely recognized."

I started working for free in the sewers of my home town thru the Ontario Youth Apprenticeship Program just to get my foot in the trades and won awards for my work as an Apprentice Industrial Electrician. Due to a major mix up moving across the country I lost all those hours and was forced to restart my apprenticeship when my car broke down with no way home. At age 21 I wrote and passed my Journeyman certification and at 26 I became fully certified as a Master Level Electrician. In 2013 I was robbed at work during Canada's costliest natural disaster, Calgary's floods, while I was evacuated from my first home in the Flood Zone just days after buying it. Someone cut the locks and stole every tool I had from my top of the line power tools to the basic hand set. Most of which was passed down from my Father or been with me every day for the past 10 years. Losing those tools and my frustration with the lack of respect in this world for working people was the spark my fire needed. At age 28 I was lucky enough to connect with a local community access TV channel and Tool Show was born! We enter our third season this fall and it's time to really go for it! Working full time as a Master Skilled Tradesman has given me hundreds of thousands of amazing notes and ideas. Enough easily for 20-30 years of high quality programming that will only get better with time. But this is where I need your help.I've been a one man wolf pack for years working all over the country but should have found out sooner you need a great team to go great places.Working so much in the trades has held back my shooting abilities for the show. With the insanely, good karma funding you're giving that is so infinitely appreciated I promise to use every second I can take off to make Tool Show even better than I could ever imagine. I can honestly see it when I close my eyes and feel it in my soul. So many people have made fun of me behind my back and usually directly to my face when I tell them my dream. But I know out there in this world, there are people just like me who were helped and now can help others in return. I don't want to be the richest man on earth. I just want to do good things and be a positive change for all the negativity out there. Thank you so much for your help and I promise you will never be forgotten! This is our year!",My main hold back? Currently I'm laid off from work due to a horrible local economy looking every day while filming and editing for Tool Show in every spare second I get. I have a mortgage and bills that will require me to find full time work as soon as possible but my goal has always been to work on my show as a full time job. Anyone who needs money to live knows that not having enough adds extra stress on an already stressful life.

Whether you're on the board, in the gym, or on the field, AnkleJoy socks will reduce the chance of injury-- whether it be to the ankle, the heel, or the toes-- while simultaneously improving lower extremity blood flow, therefore improving the athlete's overall performance.The overall design of the sock has been finalized, however Research and Development is currently underway, with a finalized model to be manufactured.","I must test how the prototype works for various athletics. The design is intended for skateboarding, however I believe it could also prove effective for almost any sport. During my R&D phase, I intend to test the limitations of my design, and if the sock is effective in treating certain podiatric disorders, especially those associated with being flat-footed.",https://www.kickstarter.com/projects/mjomelon/the-university-of-skate-app-realize-your-potential?ref=discovery_category_newest,mjomelon/the-university-of-skate-app-realize-your-potential,"IntroductionHey, my name is Michael. I've been on the board for just over 8 years now, and in this time I've tried many methods to try to learn tricks faster. I was young then, but now that I'm older I understand how making practical goals is vital to learning how to skate; if you're inconsistent with your practice, you'll be inconsistent with your kickflips. Having ADHD didn't help me with my goal-planning (as you might imagine), but the app provides a basis for skaters to master these skills. I have no doubt that my app can and will help anyone at any skill level to evolve into the skateboarder of their dreams.I am a student of Kinesiology at the University of Western Ontario; I have a particular interest in human biomechanics and athletic injury rehabilitation. Lastly, I'm a National Academy of Sports Medicine (NASM) OPT personal trainer. I am also passionate about human physiology, psychology and human movement neuroscience. Combining my passion for skating with my knowledge of how the human body functions, I had decided to create the ""University of Skate"": the free, all-in-one skate coach app.App DetailsThis app is designed for skateboarders of all skill levels to learn tricks through videos, track their progression, and provides a dynamic practice regimen that will allow the skater to know when they're fully ready to complete one of their ""Dream Tricks"". Not only that, but the skater can also use the ""Hype"" button to get a random skate hype video, check out videos for other tricks (or even some by other skaters), and use the ""IS MY LOCAL PARK DRY?"" button to instantly see which nearby parks are usable based on recent weather. Lastly, the skater will be constantly be receiving feedback and statistics on their current level of skating.The goal is to develop a routine (anywhere from 1-day/week to 7-days/week) that is geared towards your current level of skating, give feedback on strengths and weaknesses (aka how you're dope vs. what needs a bit more work).As a personal trainer, I highly appreciate the health benefits of skateboarding; increased flexibility, core strength, and explosiveness to name a few. However, skateboarding is notorious for creating muscle imbalances throughout the body; which are the main cause for injury and pain. To further supplement the skaters growth, the dynamic practice regimen provides personalized and up-to-date recommendations for warm-up and cool-down exercises intended to treat their current issue. The skater can also enter certain common issues like you would on WebMD, such as ""back of knee pain"", or even one that happens on the board, such as ""my board keeps going in front of me when I try to do a __________""With biomechanical issues addressed, the challenges and goals will automatically adjust in response to changes in your current routine. Say you had to leave the park 1 hour early, so you couldn't do those 5 switch front-shuvs. The next routine takes that into account and adjusts accordingly. The amazing thing is that it automatically updates what it knows about how you've used your body skating, and then reactively changes the routine towards balancing out how muscles have been used in your body, and what will provide the greatest playing field for learning new tricks.Furthermore, the app provides all of the video material you could ever need, or want for that matter. Hype videos of the best skaters doing your dream tricks and step-by-step tutorials for any flip, grind, stall; you name it. Users will be able to post their own clips and tutorials as an additional way to share their skating with the world, and hopefully gain recognition for their hard work.This is designed for anyone who wants to become a better skateboarder. Alongside this, the app is also intended to help reinforce important skills such as planning, goal-setting, and maintaining schedules.Final NotesSay what you want about Nyjah Huston; if it weren't for Eric Koston, Nyjah would be the Michael Jordan of skateboarding. The 24-year old is active in the gym and does physio several times per week. Now more than ever, skateboarders (especially the rich, competitive skateboarders) have personal trainers, have gym routines, and otherwise exercise outside of skating. The University of Skate is designed to provide anyone with an access to a phone or computer the same level of training that only the very best of the best can even afford (being absolutely free). It might take some time to reach that level, but you know well as I that skateboarding isn't about immediate success. It's all about progression.Thank you, and welcome to your freshman year at the University of Skate!","It may be difficult to assemble a dedicated team to keep the app continually updated. With your generous funding, I will be able to hire a software developer to assist me during development as well as in the future. I will need to continually test my knowledge of what has worked for my personal training clients to address musculoskeletal system issues. I will also need to keep up to date on the sciences of biomechanics and rehabilitation to ensure my users are receiving only the best information for their particular set of circumstances. I should note here that any advice given is not intended to be recieved as medical advice; please consult with your doctor before performing any recommended exercises or routines. I may be held liable for injuries experienced by skaters performing a recommended technique, exercise, or stretch. As such I will have an extensive consultation with an attorney to ensure the safety of myself and my investors. I will continue to supplement my understanding of app development and coding so I can make changes to the app as I see fit.To accommodate all skateboarders, the goal is to have videos available in any language. This is simply a matter of time and effort so I am confident in this goal."

Master Craftsman Emeritus Stanley D. Saperstein passed on the trade and the talents to his son, and now Master Craftsman Eric M. Saperstein. Eric partnered with a third master Michael Pietras who introduced a modern perspective to his period mentality. The two are now trading skills to provide restoration services for all furniture, a new portfolio of modern furniture, and now an eclectic and eccentric array of wood turning projects. Michael and Eric have introduced a new twist on turning manzanita burl; sourced in southern California this product of firebreaks and road construction was previously discarded and burned in mass.  Although it produces a vibrant fire like coloration of red, yellow, and orange with inclusions of brown, white, and black, the material is so harsh and unpredictable to work with that it is often shunned by wood turners. Many try, most turn away in frustration; it’s this exact quality that caught the attention of Eric and Mike.Meanwhile experiments in spalted and otherwise rotten materials that likewise would be tossed in the firewood pile by most artists yielded some amazing results. Treatments and stabilization procedures have proven successful and they are on their way towards utilizing this natural resource. Producing unique turnings requires some heavy equipment; in this case they are looking to purchase and configure a new lathe. We are evaluating equipment and will purchase, depending on our funding success, we are getting a Powermatic lathe, then hopefully a Vega bowl lathe.Each of these professional machines gives us the advantage of safety, weight, power, vibration dampening, control, performance, and flexibility. Each must be outfitted with a series of proprietary and general equipment, accessories, sharpening equipment, and tools. This includes coring rigs, hollowing tools, tail stock drilling chucks, various inboard/outboard face plates and chucks, and additional turning tools and sanding equipment. Our Kickstarter campaign is designed to provide funding for the purchase of this machine; we already have the skills, ambition, and space to operate it. We just need the machine! In return, we are offering the first bowls, vases, and vessels produced on this machine to our supporters. The values listed are offered to be “at least,” meaning many will be far more valuable on the open market than our set value for this campaign. This is our way of thanking all of you for supporting us!We’re giving it about six months to obtain the machine, setup, configure, learn its quirks and behaviors. We’ll be producing bowls in that time frame, and we’ll include yours in that mix.Don’t worry – we’ll hand select the best of breed as our rewards.

We have a virtually unlimited supply of materials from three suppliers for manzanita, we have a huge supply of spalted maple and other material on hand from Hurricane Sandy and other local sources. We have multiple lumber suppliers local and nationwide that can provide us with some of the most unique material imaginable.

We spin it at a high rate of speed, and we stand in close proximity stabbing at it with sharpened metal spikes. Perhaps we're a bit insane, but that's often what makes a great artist.We challenge ourselves to find and adapt techniques to unique materials from around the world. We focus on what makes that particular piece interesting. We find the balance of natural edge and polished surface to bring out the beauty of each blank. It's like finding the ideal cut for a diamond, spicing your sauce to perfection, or blending your colors to an enticing brilliance.Please note all the examples below are examples, as every piece we produce is a one-of-a-kind we can only state that we will offer you a piece of similar size, material, and value.

My name is Mathea and I make textile art pieces under the name of Esparta Fiber Arts. I am originally from the United States, and that is why Fiber is spelled wonky. The work I produce is technically a quilt, but it isn't very traditional. I love to paint and I love the texture of stitching...so I combined the two.Thank you for taking the time to take a look at my project. I do hope that you will become a sponsor or patron. Please share my story with friends, family, and other potentially interested parties, every little bit helps!What do I want to do?I currently reside in the Bay of Islands region of New Zealand. It is an amazing and inspiring place to live. I have many, many ideas for quilts and want to produce larger art pieces. I also want very much to contribute to my local community that has made me feel welcome and an important part of our adopted country. There is a constant need for comfort quilts for those who have suffered loss, illness, or financial struggles. I also volunteer at one of the local schools, teaching after school arts and sewing. I have been attempting to set a good example for the students with regard to adding art into every day life as well as give them practical skills. Finishing quilts for other quilters and having my own ""quilter for hire"" business is one of my ultimate goals, as there are very few people who offer this service here in the Far North. This would enable me to make a financial contribution to my family, and is where the project comes in!In order to produce more and larger pieces of art and larger beautiful utility quilts, I need a larger machine and access to larger quantities of materials. Not only are these items difficult to get here in very rural New Zealand; but they are even more difficult for me to acquire, being a recently-arrived resident. So Kickstarter is pretty much my primary option.Kickstarter is an all or nothing funding source. I originally hesitated because the thought of meeting the reward obligations was daunting. But if the funding goal is not achieved, neither party is obligated to produce anything. I thought long and hard about venturing into this, as my items are not manufactured. They are created ""one offs""; that means they take time to produce. I also refuse to send low quality products to my sponsors or patrons, so I probably will spend the next year and a half producing the rewards with the exception of the postcards, notecards, and artist prints.Fast links to: Quilter for Hire and Funding/AllocationWhat do my quilts look like?I usually use white cotton, silk, or some variation thereof and paint with inks, dyes, pastels, and paint, then lay it on batting/wadding and a backing, and proceed to stitch the living daylights out of it. The result is a very unique quilt.Occasionally, I break out of this mold and collage various fabrics then stitch. Throwing Apples is the first art quilt I ever did...Why do I need so many $$$?Artist supplies, fabric, and related machinery are not inexpensive anywhere; but here they seem to be substantially more. Although I prefer to shop locally, many of the items I use are not available locally or even close to local. Many of my items will need to be sourced from further afield in New Zealand and from other countries, which tends to add to the overall cost.The largest part of this endeavour is the long arm sewing machine. These are very hard to obtain and they cost a small fortune. A long arm is more than an industrial sewing machine. It is a sewing machine that rolls on casters on a 12' to 14' set of rails. The rails hold the fabric, and I will be guiding the machine to create the quilting patterns. Some of the brands available are APQS, Handiquilter, Gammill, A1, Innova, etc...For a full break down of costs and how funding will be allocated here is a link. Costs/FundingAllocationWhy can't I do this on my current machine?I can to a degree. Once the quilts get over about a metre square, they start getting very heavy and hard to manoeuvre through the machine. It is a bit like trying to force a watermelon through a hole the size of a quarter, not easy and not particularly accurate.The long arm machine will enable me to complete larger pieces of art work, as well as being able to quickly and efficiently quilt the community quilts. Eventually once the rewards are completed, I will start my ""quilter for hire"" business. More on that here Quilter For Hire. Long arms usually come from the United States and are very hard to come by. There also are a few notions that are useful for long arm quilting, such as special rulers and pantographs to name a couple. There are a few dealers here in New Zealand, and I have been researching which machine will be a best fit for me.How am I qualified to be able to accomplish the goals?I have been involved in the arts for a long time. I pursued creative endeavours like painting and drawing in high school, university, and in my adult life. Once my son arrived, I needed to switch my medium to be more child friendly, so I moved to fibre. I have been creating textile art since 2006. Many of my pieces have been awarded ribbons or have been juried into national and international shows. I work very hard at improving and broadening the scope of my work.With any new machine, be it a car or sewing machine, there is a learning curve until a comfort level sets in. It should take me a month or two to get acclimated to the long arm's processes and quirks. I will avail myself of any possible local training; but realistically, travel will have to happen to gain advanced classes. In the meantime, there is a lot to be said for internet classes, Skype/Facetime, and practice!How will my rewards be fulfilled?I expect it will take the better part of a year and a half to get the rewards created and delivered.I utilise Moo printing for my business cards, postcards, and note cards and have been using them for years now. They provide excellent and timely service, so I do not anticipate any issues there.For the art prints, I am checking out local printing houses for quality work. I haven't totally ascertained which group I intend to go with. As soon as I know, I will be posting an update.For the original pieces, I will be creating those from scratch, unless there is a piece in my existing inventory that is in line with the reward bracket that is chosen. Every one of my pieces is unique.What does it take to actually make one of my art quilts?Well it starts with an inspiration of a form. Usually some sort of life experience, texture, plant, etc... Sometimes there are size constraints.Then to figure out which method of workmanship will suit the idea best. Painted, collaged, embellished, traditional pieced or appliqué, whole cloth or any combination thereof are all mulled over.Preliminary sketches will happen and items needed listed on the sketches.Then the cutting the fabric to size, painting, piecing all must happen. It is never a quick process.Then the preliminary quilting happens also known as ""colour"" quilting.Then the the paint gets touched up and intensified.Highlight quilting goes in, then more paint and shading or highlighting as needed.All of the threads need to be woven in, and the quilt needs to be squared up and trimmed down. All usable scraps are saved for other projects.Then the quilt is bound, faced, mounted, and labeled in some way.Here is a video of ""Colourful New Zealand"", a 100cm x 60cm piece that is touring with the Living Colour exhibit, and the progress to put it together.Why are handmade quilts more than the blankets that you can buy at the store?The quilt above is 100cm x 60 cm, hand painted on white cotton, hand painted with ink, pastel, and paint, densely free motion quilted, batting/wadding is cotton-bamboo, and backed with black cotton. The cost of materials for fabric, paint, batting/wadding, and thread is in the realm of $200.00. It is the labour that causes the cost to go up. The hours required to draw and paint the piece totalled about 40. To quilt the piece, and no, the machine does not do this for me, was about 85 hours. The process of free motion quilting is similar to moving a piece of paper (the quilt) under the pencil (the sewing machine needle). If I were to be paid a minimum wage ($14NZ), the labour hours would cost $1,750.00 and coupled with the materials cost a total of $1950.00. It is not currently for sale as it is a touring piece.A quilt or blanket that is mass produced uses lower quality materials and often times it is produced in a country that has lower labour costs. They are not necessarily a quality production. And generally, they are not considered art nor are they expected to last a lifetime.Thank you!Thank you for taking the time to watch and read my story. Please pledge if you are able, and share my page often! Hopefully, I will be sending something fun via the post to you...isn't nice to get fun mail instead of circulars or bills! Thank you!The above video is to show some appreciation to my video helpers... I am not much for being filmed and my family is very supportive of this Kickstarter effort. I figured it would add a little levity!","This the part that no one wants to think about. But realistically, we all face difficulties at one time or another. The causes for delay in fulfilment for this project are likely to be the time it takes to acquire the long arm machine. We are in New Zealand, and the machines come from the United States. Since I live rurally and have limited access to the art materials, and they all usually have to come from further afield as well, it can take a while for things to arrive. That being said, anything that I can produce on my smaller machine with materials that I have ready access to, will be done (albeit less efficiently) as quickly as possible. If there is any sort of issue, I will be keeping everyone updated as to what the issue is and how it is being resolved!",https://www.kickstarter.com/projects/1826280123/estrogen-explosion-pants-around-northland?ref=discovery_category_newest,1826280123/estrogen-explosion-pants-around-northland,"For pants loving people everywhere!These aren't your skimpy pants, nope, these are the nice, won't go up your bum undies...and they need to travel.

He even has women willing to be tied up, spanked, and completely at his mercy, all while calling him Daddy, fulfilling his secret fantasy. On the night of his thirty-fifth birthday, Max finds a goddess waiting for him in his hotel room. She is beautiful, sexy, and very willing, yet the fruit she offers is very forbidden. Not only is she barely legal at nineteen, but she also happens to be the daughter of his best friend and political advisor. Mackenzie Wade has had a crush on the senator for years. When an overheard phone call affords her the opportunity she needs to make her fantasies a reality, Kenzie jumps at the chance, offering herself as a birthday gift. Throwing caution to the wind, Max gives in to temptation and gives them both what they have been yearning for—a night filled with ropes, floggers, and toe-curling sex. Although satiated, one night of passion isn’t enough for either of them, and they begin a clandestine affair. For Maxwell, the solid ground on which he’s built his career starts to shift as his hopes and dreams for the future begin to change. In what can only be described as a landslide, Max holds on tight to the only thing that he can—Kenzie. He goes on the ride of his life, knowing all along that in the end, he may have to make a gut-wrenching decision between the woman of his dreams and a path to the White House.PLEASE HELP US REACH OUR GOAL!",There are no risks because we have this book out already.

Apart from this the blog is also designed to be educational, I would like to show people, mainly students, how easy it is to render images as I will be posting tutorials on a weekly basis on how to use CAD and rendering software's, and how to make a 3d model look super realistic.

This music video is called Hindsight and the lyrics are about reflection on people, things, and realisationsin life. It is also about understanding a situation, only after it has happend.We are trying to raise funds to help this complete this project and get our plannedfuture projects started. As you can see the video isn't quite finished. The music track still needs to be edited and composed properly and the sound levels need to be adjusted. The video has only been cut from start to finish, so we still need to add titles, effects, and credits. An important asset to this is also the colour correction which still needs to be completed in the best possible software. The video was filmed using a DSLR with very minimal equipment and lenses. So before we can start creating more videos we need to invest in some basic equipment such as a handheld rig.We plan the get the track composed as best as it possibly can, have the video edited to its full potential and add any effects to make it more exciting. The locations we filmed in also required traveling which also requires money for petrol. These all require significant funds for each project we do. Paying the artists is also an important asset.We need the motivation, backing, and confirmation from our audience to prove to us that there is potential in this andthat any future videos we may decide to do will and can be successful.You can see any of the soundtracks by RwdyMusic Group by visiting the SoundCloud page: https://soundcloud.com/user-441730799",One of the challenges we have is adding the effects and editing techniques we want such as slow motion. To overcome this we will try and use the best editing software that we can get hold of. We plan on using Avid Media Composer. Another challenge or risk my arise for future projects. To film in more exotic and exciting locations we are going to need backing to invest in a handheld camera rig. This will support the camera as much as possible and help us the create the best cinematic images we possibly can.,https://www.kickstarter.com/projects/1304708075/hindsight-ft-trizzy-music-video?ref=discovery_category_newest,1304708075/hindsight-ft-trizzy-music-video,"Tre Barret (Trizzy) is a rap artist from London who is currently based in Leeds.

It is also my first autobiographical work. As such, it is both very personal and at once somewhat embarrassing. But it is also lacking. I have been collecting documents and notes and other items with the idea that someday I would write an exhaustive autobiography. This little volume is the result of my decision to start immediately, my new thought being that someday my collected works may be used by myself or some other to write a biography, but that I can also have the current satisfaction of having something to show—something to give. Having said that, I hope the reader will understand that there is more to the story—more to me—than herein revealed.I took a trip to Russia in the summer of 2007. I stayed for six weeks in St. Petersburg, on the Gulf of Finland. It was an amazing experience. I met some good people. We travelled to Moscow. I visited the Hermitage multiple times. Culture and music and food were abundant and diverse. But all throughout the trip I was plagued by one idea: that I could possibly start a relationship with a certain someone whom I met on my first day in Russia. She was part of my group of ten Americans which met collectively for the first time upon arrival in the airport. For whatever reason she struck me – and I was bothered by that for the rest of the trip.The end of the story is that I am now happily married (and my wife is behind this project 98%). It was a psychological fling - and an interesting autoethnographical journey. I'm glad that was all, and rather than be embarrassed by the fact that I had a high-school type 'crush' in my 20s, I'm embracing it. It is me.Thank you for your support.I'm compiling a bunch of poems taken from a 6-week journal from a trip to Russia into a book with photos.","The project will write itself.

Thanks in advance for your time and support!Sincerely,   MargieMY STORY Little girlslove headbands with flowers and bows and feathers and whatever else you can put on them. The problem that results is plastic bins full of different headbands that get tangledor brokenand take up a lot of room. The solution - Dress A Band, one headband and beautiful removablehandmade accessories. It is the first truly customizable headband. My granddaughters love it!Now you have a satin-covered headband, one single headband (14 1/2"" long), andunlimited accessories that can slide onto and off of the headband with ease. The fun part, eachband can easily hold 3 accessories (1 large, 1 medium, and 1 small) and with 5 accessories in the Dress A Band Starter Set that isthirty-three (33) different combinations.Seriously, one headband plus five accessories equals 33 different headbands!!! Purchasing additional accessories either in the same line (pattern specific) or coordinating pieces expands that number as well.Girls five to twelve will love the individual accessory pieces such as flowers, bows, etc. that are handcrafted and allows them to create their own headband. It is as easy as 1 - 2 - 3 to add and remove accessories. 1 - Hold the band in one hand and the accessory in the other ...2 - and simply slide it to the left, right,middle, or wherever .....3 - it's exactly how she wanted!!Each accessory is made tokeep its shape,stay firmly on the headband,be easilyassembled by small hands, and is made as if one of my granddaughters will bewearing it. An added bonus- there are no wires or clips to catch in their hair or hurt behind the ears. They are 100% kid friendly!Girlslovebright colors and prints, and in their world everything fits whether it's stripes, or dots, or whimsical patterns, or a combination of all.They willlove ""dressing up""their ownheadband.So after a lifetime of working outside the home (honorably discharged U.S. Navy veteran and early retired civil service analyst) I have to now work inside the home so that I may care formy husband, an honorably discharged/disabled U.S. Navy veteran and a blessed organ transplant receipient as well. SoI needed to create a business that I would love doing andthat travels easily and can be done from a waiting room couch!! This is it !!That gets me here, to Kickstarter, asking that you have as much faith in this project as I have. Thanks for taking time to read about my project and I hope you decide to become a backer and make a little girl smile.

The purchase of additionaldieswill allow me to expand accessory options.Custom labels to be sewn on each accessory piece will also be a reminder of where additional accessories can be purchased.And finally the purchase of a digital camera so that as new accessories are created and ready for sale they can be shown with the vivid colors and patterns they actually possess.THE FUTURE OF DRESS A BANDIn the coming year I want to introduce projects for all of the major holidays as well as something special for birthdays, sports, animals, etc. The potential for growth is unlimited.Additional marketing venues will also be explored as well. As the business grows I hope to be able to provide part-time work to an assistant or two who will then help to prepare and cut fabrics and help with the packaging and posting of orders received. ","The biggest risk and the biggest challenge are one in the same.  If I make you smile when watching your little one in high gear creating a one-of-a-kind headband and she is smiling and happy to wear it, then I have overcome both the risk and the challenge. With 20 years experience as a program manager/analyst (and more as a mother and grandmother) I have developed excellent time management skills and the ability to successfully work multiple projects to their conclusion within specified time frames.  I can apply those skills with my attention to detail and my love for making my granddaughters smile to launch and build Dress A Band into a successful business.  Since I use multiple fabrics and notions from multiple suppliers, unless all of the cotton mills totally shut down, there will always  be an abundance of materials and supplies.  However there are natural disasters we can't predict or plan for and most of those would affect the logistics of shipping and delivery.  With that said I will keep all of the backers updated with the project progress on a weekly basis, and encourage you to address questions or concerns you may have at any time in the process.",https://www.kickstarter.com/projects/42422927/holiday-headband-accessories-by-dress-a-band?ref=discovery_category_newest,42422927/holiday-headband-accessories-by-dress-a-band,"Every girl likes dressing up for the holidays and atDress A Band we know the perfect finishing accessory is for the hair!! So we are introducing a line of Holiday headband accessories which includes, for the first time, BOWS!! As with all of the Dress A Band accessories these festive flowers,ribbons and bowssimply slide on to the white satin-covered headband. It's that easy!! This bow was my size prototype - your bow will have a white attachment for the headband not green!!THE VIDEO - I'm sure you couldn't tell from the video that I'm not a movie maker, seriously,butI ama grandmother who loves making her granddaughters smile. Dress A Band does that and more, it lets them create their own look and change it as often as they want (which sometimes is on the hour).And they will probably be wearing their snowmen bows in July but if it makes them smile who cares.MY GOAL- Sincethe beginningmy vision for the brand has grown and my 20+ years experience as an analyst is helping me to keep my plan on track, but my supplies and inventory are exploding.Funding this project will help me to expand our catalog and create an appropriate and easily accessible storage system for my raw materials and my finished accessories.WHAT'S NEW -For the 2014 Holidayaccessorieswe are introducing our first bows!!! They are all handmade, double layered, and are accentedwith beautiful holiday colored buttons, and they slide on and off the Dress A Band headband with ease. Whether she wants to wear the bow in the middle or on one side it's her choice and she can change it anytime she wants!! REVIEW THE BASICS - If you want more info you can check out my first Kickstarter project which even though it did not get funded it got Dress A Band off the ground. What makes Dress A Band unique is that the accessories can be changed constantly (even by the tiniest of hands) to keep up with the ""current dress up"" theme or the fleeting thought of the moment by girls ages 5 - 12,even though they have been worn by both younger and older girls. It is as simple as 1 - 2 - 3!!!MY STORY - I am a retired (which I did early because I am still 29) civil service analyst, an honorably discharged U.S. Navy vet, wife, mother and grandmother. My husband, honorably discharged Navy vet as well, was blessed with an organ transplant shortly before my retirement and was in need of full time assistance, so I retired. ""In sickness and in health"" means just that. So I needed to work on something that I could pack around to and from hospital waiting rooms. My granddaughters love the headbands so it was a natural move to build it into something bigger and that is how Dress A Band found its simple beginnings.REWARDS START HERE - So here is a peek at the awesome rewards for backing this project. But remember that the biggest reward you get will be to see that smile on her beautiful little face!! Enjoy the blessing!!!FIVE DOLLAR REWARDS - 1 Medium Accessory - Headband IncludedTEN DOLLAR REWARDS - Headband IncludedOption 1 - Choose the red or greenOption 2Option 3HOW THE FUNDS WILL BE USED - Funds will be used to help purchase a storage system for the flowers, and the felt, and the fabric, and the buttons, and everything that goes into makinggreat Dress A Band accessories.Felt and fabric stock is die cut in large quantities Supplies are currently stacked and sprinkled throughout every flat surface in my home.As the business is growing and hopefully getting even bigger (with the launch of theonline storein early 2015)time spent running from room to room to put together the perfect accessory can result in chaos. Being able to sort through supplies and create from a single location would be great and time-saving.THE FUTURE - There are more holidays to discover and special occasions like birthdays and dance recitals. There are hobbies like music and sports as well as the love of animals, and Dress A Band wants to make special accessories to celebrate them all. Eventually I would like to be able to provide jobs for women like myself who have to work from home and those that choose to work from home. And , coming early in 2015,you will be able to buy Dress A Band accessories directly throughour website.","I will keep my backers informed if there are any unforseen changes to the delivery schedule. Please feel free to contact me with any questions or comments.  Risks are minimal when funding is reached as I already have the stock and most of the items completed.  I guess that a huge early December snowfall could delay delivery by a day or two at most but that should be the extent of the risks.I will contact my backers immediately for selections and shipping addresses then it should only be a matter of packing the items, addressing the packages,  and sending them on their way."

It was mostly used as a tradition for weddings, to decorate bride's hands and foots. Now henna art is becoming as an accessory, part of stylish look or even tattoo on the body.As a drawing in India, for example, it has such a big meaning. Every small detail is a symbol of wealth, love, health, joy, happiness and much more. As well, drawing henna is very meditating and calming pleasure. I am so happy I had an opportunity to learn drawing henna for myself, and now I want to share this with everyone else.Backers for this project will get an opportunity to receive such an amazing piece or art, to decorate your home or gift it to friends.

Not a lot of brides nowadays wants to have henna drawing, it is more like vacation body art.On the other hand, I have henna drawings on my skin every week,I enjoy it so much and people don't pass without noticing and complimenting.

Henna art is the part of India culture and now becomes a part of fashion world. You can find so many Instagram users and bloggers decorating themselves in such way. but it stays only week on your body part. So why not having great henna drawings on your morning coffee cup for the rest of your mornings? :)These cups are decorated with special paints and secured in high temperature, that after could be used as much as you want and washed even in dishwasher.With henna drawings there is never going to be two totally same cups, because it is made and designed directly on the piece, using only artist imagination. So this makes them so different and so valuable. ","For henna artist the most difficult part is to find customers and be as free minded as possible. Nowadays not a lot of brides decorates themselves in such way, or tattoos are getting over henna drawings. Also on the body parts it stays only for a week. But it is very nice idea to decorate your dishes this way, that your friends could enjoy such a wonderful experience and story having your cup of coffee."

Why incorporate hops in anything but beer? Well, here are a few reasons:1. Keeps Skin Young.Hop is a good source of antioxidants, which means that it helps the body fight against free radicals, giving the skin a radiant and youthful glow.2. Treats Skin Inflammation. It may be the main ingredient in beer, but also used in various cosmetic products for skin treatments. The oils and minerals in the plant provide an anti-inflammatory effect to the skin and is used to decrease the surface blood vessels.3. Reduces Hair Fall and Dandruff. Beer gives a natural shine and helps to reduce dandruff. Beer is also used to rinse the hair because it contains antioxidants and mainly hops, which help to reduce hair fall. The hop extract can also be directly used to wash your hair. First, rinse the hair with a mild shampoo, then use hop extract on the scalp. It is quite helpful in the treatment of scalp and dandruff. The essential vitamins and oils present in the hops help to open the tiny pores of the scalp and reduce the hair loss. The oils in this herb help to cure the dead skin on the scalp and remove dandruff, which blocks the pores of the scalp. It is easily available in the market, but can also be used directly from beer, which has high contents of hops.4. Eases Nervousness. Hops are also used to treat insomnia. As they are related to the “cannabis” family, they are used as a drug for relaxing muscles and treating people suffering from anxiety.5. Relaxes and Soothes Muscles. Hops help in relaxing the aching muscles and body pain. Easily available, it is used in many pain killers.6. Relieves Anxiety. Anxiety is one of the biggest problems most people face today. And if it is your problem too, then you better start using hops essential oil right away! The sedative quality is what makes hops essential oil useful in combating anxiety and mood swings. It helps calm the mind and body. Check out our newly created website! www.beerdcare.comStill have your doubts? Would you like to ask us a more specific question?

Kino in einer Vorpremiere zeigen, nur für geladene Gäste also.Wir wünschen Dir und uns allen ein schönes und erfolgreiches 2016 ;)-An artist with no money wants to make a film, to show his skills.He writes a script.He finds 26 actors (from 1500 contacts).Three musicians.Produces an entire feature film.Financed with € 1,054.From blood plasma donations.He cuts it.Adds English subtitles.He´s ready after just two years.Wow?Now the film must be sent to the festivals.New year, old problem: With which money?Do you want to help us?It was a great, crazy and incredibly strenuous adventure, where I could motivate me and my people repeatedly.What led to the successful conclusion, and quite honestly - I'm very proud, about my folks and me!The film has even become pretty good, if I may say so (which is not quite my nature).But now we have to send it to as many festivals as possible, around the world, so that we can at least reap some renown.And, in the best case, find a distributor.Or someone who wants to finance our next film - I wrote about 20 scripts, and I'm hot to the next one :)Do you like movies?Do you like people who run their own thing against any opposition ?That follow their own ideas, to create something new, thereby making seemingly impossible things possible?Then you should like this, because the style is certainly memorable:With sheer willpower, with borrowed professional camera, all worked on provision basis.Found 68 locations, several pubs and a whole disco for nothing (do not ask how I had to talk myself blue in the face)with just 1050 Euro on 52 days of shooting all got in the box.Guerilla-style, without barriers, permits, etc., and always good takes!Then written own music, rebuilt a special guitar especially for this. Cool?Why support? Everybody knows that an artist in Germany has a rough start and also stand.However, there are always artists and freaks who make and move something new.The pity is that many of these creative minds get no chance.Well - who has no chance, makes one to himself :)Do you want to help us now to get a little success it deserves?What happens with the fundings?Most festivals cost around 50-75 €, and there are hundreds of them.Of course we would like to send him around the world to any festival, but that should be probably utopian.It would cost thousands.Primarily, our goal is to ""save"" our work, by being shown - a few hundred euros would help enourmously.Therefore, I set the success threshold very low, but of course in the hope that as much support arrives.Who is behind it?30 artists and some generous helpers spent time, nerves, and even their own money for travel expenses etc., invested to produce ""Psycho Capital Monster "".Do we deserve a little respect and success?Of course you would like to see it and then decide to join us.The problem is that we can not publish it, because otherwise the festivals no longer accept it.A real quandary.So we can only hope that the trailer is good enough to make you curious!After all, we can send it as a thank you for your support! Just as the movie poster - which looks quite chic :)Then we can offer you a movie ticket, because we planned to show it in a preview, for invited guests only, in April 2016 in a Cinema in Berlin (!) .We wish you and us all a nice and successful 2016 ;)","Risiken bestehen keine.

However after Eric starts to lose confidence, she finds it hard to accept and tries her best to push him, for better or for worse.The film starts with Eric and Kelly having a conversation about their 'first time' although we presume this is about intercourse, it in fact is not. The couple are talking about when its going to be and how long they will take to be ready for the occasion. The twist is, the couple aren't such a nice couple we thought they were are the beginning and their 'first time' will be their first time committing murder, and essentially stealing another couples identity.The other couple, Frank and Sue are a middle class married couple that live in a nice house and have very nice and valuable belongings.Frank is a man that comes from a wealthy background but also does very well in his line of work.

My name is Toni Scales. I hope everyone is doing alright this holiday season.I have recently self-published two books of poetry. The first collection is entitled In a Candlelight Palace, and is written through the eyes of a young funeral director assistant. This is the book I am really concentrating on marketing, for I believe it is my best work. I am attempting to raise funds in order to purchase copies for book signings, giveaways, possible professional marketing services, and the like. For I am obsessed with and burn with passion for this project. And why do I feel the book is so important? I am aware of the fact it is of an unusual and macabre nature and may appeal only to a small target audience. I must be candid in saying it is definitely not for everyone. Though it is tender, empathetic, and sorrowful, it is also grisly, cynical, and controversial, for it originates from the viewpoint of a person in spiritual crisis who cannot find answers to the troubling questions concerning both death and existence. It also reveals many of the grim realities of the funeral business. It was not my intention to hurt or offend anyone with these poems. But I could not help writing them, for when I was employed in that capacity the words pulsed out of me in effortless release, and the poems truly ""wrote themselves"". It is the only time when my writing has been truly genuine, when I did not have to think about it or spend hours upon its technique and diction. But it concerns itself with something so much more than simply the reactions and experiences one has when working in a funeral setting--something far more subterranean, heartbreakingly human, and redemptive.Additionally, though I have been fortunate to publish several poems online, these pieces have never been published, and I know this is due to the fact they might be labelled as too taboo or ""tasteless"" and / or their technique is inferior. I also must be honest in saying I have sold few copies thus far. The writing and publication were a natural high. The marketing phase is where I have crashed into a low, spiritually and emotionally. I did not realize how difficult it is to market your own book and summon the courage to basically sell yourself. But I am hard at work hour after hour with my website, making connections, promotions through social media, joining groups and forums, and doing endless research. I simply cannot relinquish the hope that my odd poetic reflections could be read. In my heart, I believe this book is very necessary. Please help my dream of reaching an audience for it to come true. I am very humble and genuine, desiring to present the truth and eager to receive any type of feedback. Updates will be regular, and I would sincerely appreciate any suggestions. A video will be available shortly. Visit my site for more info.I appreciate your time so very much,Toni Scales______________________An excerpt from In a Candlelight Palace:STILL ROSESThere are no ghosts herefor there is no pain.No delayed reaction to scalpel or caress.Their crises commencedlong ago and elsewhere.They have already foundtheir way, they requireno direction nor musicof bells from me.No smiles or movementshiver among these still roses.There is only a hollow tranquility,a tenuous serenity as when somebody coughsunderwater.VOICESI am worried at myself,for I’ve lost concern for the dead.Once they spoke their messages.Now they’ve lost their voices.Burgundy blood pools from hooks.It all becomes meat and timeand empty containers,the organ donors curled inward upon themselves–fish-gutted angels,lumpy sausages without eyes.","I suppose the most likely risks and challenges would be for production delays.

Teacups and shoes, a hint of collarbone through his shirt. All day, the taste of longing in her mouth. Waiting for him to pass, to giggle hot like a school girl. By midnight, the world's diminished to lights caressing the tollway. Signposts that sing of a desperate paradise, his cologne scraping the car's interior. How she yearns in places her body cannot reach. Desire crackling the dash, slicing the night like a scar. The skyline sutured and frayed, his textbook she drowned at the lake. How every moon on a bracelet corresponds with a bruise.",I believe the only challenge would involve production delays.

I'd like to think I've gotten pretty good at what I do. I'm no master and I still get the occassional disaster but I like what I make. I wouldn't be asking for help if I didn't love everything I have made. So I have decided to get help. I'm basically going to be using the backing I receive (if any) for materials and scents. To make unique and interesting candles with a combination of scents. My long goal is to sell them online, maybe ebay at first before branching out. I want to make candles that people want, with scents that people want. Aslong as I can get the scent asked for, I'll make it. Your own personal scented candle. Any questions please feel free to ask.

My workshop space and the equipment I use.I built my workshop about 8 years ago and it has served me very well. I have also acquired several items of machinery and hand tools.

There are millions of apps available for download with many of them are low quality junk.  With the strong influx of horrible, ads loaded applications the app industry may soon mirror the video game crash of 1983.  I started Philly Boi Entertainment to bring quality back into application just as Nintendo did the game industry in 1985.  I believe better quality can be accomplished by overseeing the development from start to finish and giving each application the development time it needs. ","Challenges• This game requires approval from Apple before its made available for download. Apple has a very strict policy on how they approve apps and once an app is rejected and the corrections are made, the app must start over in the review process. Currently I have seven other apps already approved from apple so I’m very familiar on how to get an app approved. • Free apps  can generate revenue from in game ads and in game purchases to remove ads. This revenue will allow me to afford to develop current and new applications. If the my applications doesn’t receive enough downloads, development can slow down or stop. I believe product awareness will generate the amount of downloads I need.",https://www.kickstarter.com/projects/728564895/taco-heaven-part-2?ref=discovery_category_newest,728564895/taco-heaven-part-2,"Mar 15th, 8:25pmHope BataclanHope Hi Phillip! My name is Hope, and I backed your campaign on Kickstarter. I just cooked some tacos up for dinner and we think they are DELICIOUS! Great flavors and aromas! Thank you again!!  Feb 19 2017 Edward Gold Hi, Philip, Here are my thoughts on your taco seasoning.Packaging: Good even though obviously prototype labels. Directions and Nutrition Facts: Good. Ingredients: These are fine although I expected more natural ingredients and less ""chemically-sounding"" ones. Not a big deal though. I understand why and they were complete. Size: I was a little surprised that you use 2 ounces of seasoning to one pound of beef/turkey. Most other seasonings only use one. Again, not a big deal though. Look: Fine. It looked like taco seasoning. Taste I enjoyed the flavor much more. It seemed to tone down the unusual flavor that I experienced the first day. The third day eating it (a few hours ago actually) the flavor was just as good as the second tasting. Overall: A good taco seasoning with a unique flavor. I would try it again.Thank you so much for sending a sample. I hope you can get it off the ground. Eric  Mix and Match Taco Heaven: 2 Oz of bold flavor, ingredients you can see, premium spices, produced with love. Leading Store Brand: 1 Oz of bland flavors, Include ingredients like: Potassium Chloride, Maltodextrin, Silicon Dioxide, Dextrose, Gum Arabic, produced with genetic engineering. I love tacos, always had, ever since I was a child. The mixture of vegetables, dairy, seasoning and beef, creates the perfect combination that sends my taste buds on a ride. If I had a choice between pizza and tacos, tacos would always be number one in my heart. But with any passion there is always a problem when it comes to the pursuit of that passion. The number one problem, all tacos would taste the same. I’ve tried multiple restaurants from fast food to authentic and I’ve tried multiple store bought seasoning mix, none of them has that keep me coming back flavor. I’m 31 years old and I’ve been creating homemade tacos since I was 19, each batch I would tweet the formula on the type of seasoning used and each time the flavor would come out just that much better. By age 26, I had the perfect beef formulation down, bold flavors that compliments the lettuce, tomatoes, and cheese. I’ve received great feedback from many others including backers from my last failed Taco Heaven kick-starter. So that’s why I’ve started another project with a lower goal to raise the funds to mass-produce my recipe and to receive further feedback.  I love my tacos fully loaded with cheese, tomatoes, lettuce, jalapenos, and onions. ",1. If the project is not fully funded 2. Shipping of product can be delayed base on the amount placed.

Blackbox features Bacti, little pets that rather than die of old age or attacks, will instead mutate. Your pets grow and adapt, getting stronger, weaker, fatter, smaller, evil, sad, happy, etc. Anything is possible with a mutation, it's all dependent on how you take care of your pet and its spirit. They still can leave you from severe neglect, but your pet will always try to be by your side.Inspiration  The idea for Blackbox has always circled my head. However, I never knew what I wanted to do with it, did I want to make it try to talk back? Did I want to make it have full on human conversations? In the end, I saw some stories about how important Tamagotchi was for people with depression, kids, starter pets, how so many talk fondly about how much they used to love their pets. It's then that I realized, I must capture that essence, that feeling of what it felt like to own a Tamagotchi. My goal is to take it to the next level. I want players not to feel nagged, but rather to genuinely want to take care of their pet.

For example, a good Bacti will not be able to mutate with evil features. Mutations will also sway their stats as well, so even if they are gloomy this iteration, they may not be in the next. Your pet is always changing. Old age, invasions, or even items are just some ways they may mutate. Widget   Your pet will not notify you.

I love all painters throughout history but my current and main inspirations are artists like Peter Doig and Daniel Richter. Whose works you can see below. My painting style is quite similar, the rose at the header of this project is an example of my painting ability.I'm offering the reward of paintings only. Your painting will be made in November, left to dry for a few weeks (oil paint takes a little longer to dry) and then delivered to you at a suitable date in December.",If this project gets fully funded there is no reason why I can't produce the paintings.

It has been a goal of ours to use as many recycled materials as possible. So 100% or the wood in our ornaments and decorations is from fallen trees. By taking fallen trees from the surrounding areas we are able to do two things. One is to make some very interesting live edge custom pieces. The other is to save a lot of perfectly usable hardwood from ending up in a landfill.We collect the trees that are being removed from construction sites or have fallen because of storms. After delivery they are immediately milled into lumber and kiln dried stored and eventually turned into... well many things. Floors, tables, turning blanks, rocking chairs, and anything else we can think up. By supporting this Kickstarter you will be helping us clear out room in our shop for more turning blocks and lumber. You will also be getting a one of a kind custome tree or window ornament.

The only risk with this one is that you don’t like the product you receive. Now if this happens you should do something about it. Send me an email and we will try our best to remedy that.

We believe that we can affect peoples lives through music in the most positive way. Right now one of the producers currently goes out to talk to high school seniors about the different options you have in education for music. We have been doing music separately for 4+ years so we have had time to learn how to maneuver through this business. Right now the Loose Gold roster holds 3 rappers/producers/engineers, Young Americano and Jay Sickly. Young Americano does alot of music work with entrepreneurs and businesses such as Gary Vaynerchuk on his show DailyVee, Mind Body- Fusion a company based out of Canada, Durrand Bernarr the backup singer and artist for Erykah Badu, as well as several of his own projects and works. Jay Sickly has put out several of his works and continues to gain fans and support. The 3rd producer is RipKnoxx. He has worked with mainstream artist such as Tech Nine. Jay Sickly is currently working on his 3rd full length project and is growing everyday at becoming a visual producer and filmmaker. With many years under his belt and is a musician we are putting our main focus into him. At the end of the day what we are trying to do is create a career generate jobs for our community as well. We want to inform, educate and empower people everywhere to be able to do music and film and be able to live off of it.","Our biggest struggle right now is getting the resources to finalize our projects and creatives. We have to pay for studio to record, mix and master and we save money by doing everything ourselves as engineers but it still gets to be costly. Also paying for promotion tools, materials to release our products, merchandise to sell and generate steady income, planning our own tour, etc. We have worked with several music labels and bands and are experienced with planning and executing, we would just like to do it for ourselves at this point. What got us to this point is the fact that we just rented a commercial space (not the best) and not even 4 months in the landlord goes bankrupt and has to auction off the building to another buyer which wasted our money but more importantly our time and some 1st time clients.",https://www.kickstarter.com/projects/1017597930/digital-distribution-for-slumped-out-2-instrumenta?ref=discovery_category_newest,1017597930/digital-distribution-for-slumped-out-2-instrumenta,"So I have been studying and working at music production for quite some time now and I'm finally ready to expand with my music internationally.

In layperson terms: this project is a meta exploration that will examine the intertextuality between art, artist, audience, monetary madness, and internet culture, all the while simultaneously unraveling various stigmas and approvals we place on personal connection, online voyeurism, romantic consumption, empathy/compassion, and potentially pathological expressions of desire.I took applications until February 13th viaCraigslist for potential stalkees.Now, for all of Valentine's Day, I've developed a fictional persona (Erik Senton) who will be stalking Lisa B. I will stalk the stalkee using a variety of timeless techniques. I will watch, learn, obsess, ruminate, and project my ideals onto a complete stranger.Erik Senton will enter the Obsessive Phase from February 15th until February 21st. This means that I will allow the stalker's obsession to build into an earthshattering crescendo. I will send gifts, proclamations of adoration, and more. I will present morbid visions of eternal passion in various creative forms. I will share these ideas, feelings, and creations online for your viewing pleasure.After the Obsessive Phase, the Consensual Stalker project will degrade gracefully. For the next few months, I will start working on the DVD. I will gather all the footage of my exploits and begin to edit it. Footage includes the 24 hour stalk-a-thon, the withdrawal week, as well as behind the scenes pre-stalk footage.The stalkee and the audience can follow me live online during Valentine's Day (dubbed ""The Stalk-A-Thon""), as well as from February 15th to February 21st (""The Obsessive Phase""). In the aftermath of the 24 hour stalk-a-thon, I will chronicle online all of my experiences, feelings, thoughts, and perceptions online. I will attempt to win her love by sending her things.The Consensual Stalker is an artistic descent into madness. Thankfully, you can consume it all during the 24 hour Stalk-A-Thon as well as during the Obsessive Phase. There will be short video segments, blog posts, Facebook updates, tweets, and bad tumblr poetry updated daily during the Obsessive Phase. The bulk of the project will be in the online presence of the stalker, available as a Facebook, Twitter, tumblr, YouTube, and blog.All donations will be utilized within the context of this stalker/stalkee adventure.$150 is enough to create, edit, and distribute the final Consensual Stalker DVD by the beginning of summer.Additional funds will be used to purchase materials needed for the Consensual Stalker's expressions of love. This includes: poems, letters, photographs, paintings, videos, notes, baked goods, essays, cards, paper, paints, print-outs, etc.These gifts will be given to the stalkee; some will be reused as Kickstarter Rewards.The funds will also be used for mailing Kickstarter Rewards.A side note: all Consensual Stalker gifts will be handmade by yours truly.There are too many reasons to list here, so I will start with three major ones--I was on Facebook skimming through my newsfeed when a variety of Valentine's Day humblebrag posts flooded my view. I am fascinated by the subtle matrices surrounding social interaction and human connection...I thought it would be an interesting idea to take our notion of this ""Hallmark Holiday"" and test how we react to certain stimuli: warranted vs unwarranted affection, following strangers online vs IRL, limits of harassment, blurring fiction and reality, popularity, consuming personal information, monetary values, ethics of love, the culture surrounding a spectacle, and many other elements which haven't quiet come into view, yet.Creating characters and giving life to said characters is a love of mine. I am usually utilizing this as a writer, but I figured it'd be nice to expand into an area I am not all-together confident in (acting, performing, etc.)I am also a fan of consensual anything. I enjoy turning the tables on over-glorified forms of violent love as my own quiet means of self-empowerment.","Ultimately there will be a two-hour DVD of the entire adventure. The only challenge would be finishing the DVD, as the editing process is entirely dependent on my frame of mind (especially after this strange and taxing ordeal as a stalker).If mental and emotional unbalance does occur, I plan to alleviate the setback by spending a week by myself somewhere no one can find me. Maybe think about my life choices a bit. Touch base with the universe.Upon my return, I can tackle The Consensual Stalker DVD with a fresh and rejuvenated mind/heart/spirit/body.",https://www.kickstarter.com/projects/billimarie/in-which-our-heroine-is-suddenly-a-petit-bourgeois?ref=discovery_category_newest,billimarie/in-which-our-heroine-is-suddenly-a-petit-bourgeois,"This Kickstarter acts as a hub for showcasing the ""...in which our heroine"" compilation.

It is very important to me to share the knowledge of this craft. I will also be allowing students to ""rent"" space in a firing batch to help them get started. Having this kiln would also let me teach more lampwork workshops because I could allow the smaller kiln to be used for annealing lampwork.As a struggling crafter, this is a big next step for my studio, This will help keep this art form alive. We are wanting to grow our studio into a Makers Center for people to be able to come and craft using equipment and space that so many people lack today. The goal to create a equipped space where people without space can come and work and where people can come to learn a new skill. This is one small step toward getting us there.Want to see what I am looking to add? Check out this link for the kiln. Add in some basic set up, upgrades and supplies for the larger kiln and that's where the money will go.","I have worked directly with the manufacturer of the kiln.  Unknowns include no guarantee of the cost of shipping.  They can't predict it this far out.  In addition to the shipping, the cost of glass is also a variable.  I have accounted for both these items in the budget.  As long as the kick-start is successful, these should not be a factor.  Another risk, would cause a delay in delivery of the rewards.  I have allotted 45 days for delivery of the kiln.   Paragon's normal operational turn around is 30 days but because of the winter holidays I have allotted 45.  I will start firing the pieces the day after it arrives.  I will fire in the order they come in.",https://www.kickstarter.com/projects/1084916155/adulting-the-game?ref=discovery_category_newest,1084916155/adulting-the-game,"With over 70 Million people in the USA alone between the ages of 19 and 34 and at least 40% of those video game players, using game structure to help these new adults success seems like a quest worth taking.  That’s what Adulting – The Game is all about.  Adulting – The Game uses a social networking site to encourage information sharing, personal challenges and guild style team work (we call them Orders).  Select quests that fit your personal goals and then earn points for moving your life forward.  Share goals with a friend and then challenge each other a duel to see who can finish the quest first.  This format of support and challenge has a proven track record by company products like FitBit.  Even companies like Progressive Insurance are speaking to this groups desire to make more adulting choices, by challenging them to “Act your age and buy your own insurance instead of using your parents insurance."" This is an idea whose time has come.And by making it fun, easy and social, Adulting – The Game is ready to be the next big social trend.Get your friends involved now, so that you are all ready for the September 1 launch date and Order event.","The biggest risk for us, is not having enough people soon enough.  A social site is only fun if there are people there to be social with.  We will be using every social media platform available to try to get the message out so that on launch day, we have enough people to make it a blast.  We have set a goal of 200 people on launch date and will be allowing Orders to form in August outside of the fully launched site.  That way you and your friends will be able to start exploring quests and earning points from the very beginning. On the technical side of things, we are building on top of a platform that is staple and well supported, so there are not many risks involved on this front.  That leaves us with one other area of risk, the quests themselves.  If the quests don’t excite and challenge our players, we will not be able to sustain membership.  To this end, we have been using a focus group of 6 adults between 18 and 32 from different backgrounds and life styles to help us design our quests.  We are also committed to grow our quests at a rate of at least 3 new quest chains every two weeks.  We will also be adding quests during our ramp up."

She has finished writing and recording material for her upcoming album “Nothing Else Matters”. She will be releasing the album as a CD, digital download and as a limited edition collector’s set. For this project, a series of album artworks are to be designed for the collector’s set. The album artwork will include photography and artwork. As fans flick through the pages of the album artwork, they will get a sense of the story and themes behind that music on the album. The theme, look, feel and concept of this artwork should also continue on with the contents of the set. The contents include a CD, DVD, T-Shirt, 12” Vinyl Record, Deluxe Photo & Lyrics Book, Poster, Website & Signed Photo Cards. Each of these items will be a part of the same theme, look, feel and concept as the main cover artwork (see main project image).The box set will be marketed to a very specific audience. It will be marketed towards males and females aged between 18 and 25 who are die-hard fans of Lisa May and her music and have an Internet connection. The collector’s set will be distributed worldwide and will be sold via her website.The concept, idea and inspiration for this project came about from my love of music and music collectables. I am a massive collector of music memorabilia and I love the feeling of opening up a collector’s box set for the first time and experiencing the music through the limited edition merchandise and immersing yourself in the music experience. I wanted to design something that gave the music collector something special to accommodate the music of Lisa May. The theme behind the artwork is “living in a fantasy land”. The use of black and white photography and colour hand drawn illustrations will represent this theme throughout the artwork. I wanted to create something like this because I believe most pop artists now are bland and boring and what they’re creating today is so overproduced that it is not music anymore. It’s just sound. I wanted this artwork to represent an artist who puts her heart and soul into her music and is pure and not over produced like today’s music. The artwork will be inspired by the songs on the CD.The main areas that will need research include the packaging and presentation of the contents inside, the overall album artwork, themes & concepts, and the deluxe booklet. The rest of the products will be manipulated and altered versions of existing artwork, although every product inside the box set should not be exactly the same as each other. but should be slightly different so that they are different cover artworks but should also be similar so they match with each of the products in the set.ResearchInformation is collected for inspiration, investigation & analysis. Research is analysed and investigated and elements from this research are then manipulated and used to generate initial ideas for the project.Generation of IdeasApplication of research, information and inspiration when creating design ideas. The research is applied into a series of rough, quick sketches which are used to create more sophisticated and developed designs and ideas.Development of ConceptsSelection of ideas and development of 2D and 3D designs and mockups. These developed designs are nearing completion and small but significant changes are made to each of the designs until it is nearing completion.RefinementModifications and changes in response to feedback and evaluation against brief. Minor changes, layout and placement of objects are altered slightly to fit the design better and make it look more professional.ProductionProduce and makeup physical products in preparation for presentation & submission. The final designs are prepared for production and sent off to printers & suppliers for production and are then brought together after completion, into the final product.","Certain production constraints will definitely be a big obstacle if things don't go according to plan. If this happens, a contingency plan has been put together. This plan includes alternative production methods, adapting designs to different production methods, etc. Shipping times and delays may also be a contributing factor. Shipping time has been taken into account when estimating delivery dates fro rewards but delays may occur."

All are processed and manipulated with tape speed, hardware compressors, distortion, eq, old digital mixers and samplers, effects boxes, reamped through marshall stacks and guitar pedals, etc.Side A of the cassette will be single shots and Side B will be loops.The Kickstarter will help me acquire some extra cassette decks and equipment to make a mass duplicating system (using either Nakamichi MR1 or MR2s, or Tascam 234s), purchase NOS tape in bulk, and rent some extra drums, studio spaces, and gear to add to the variety of samples on the library.","The Library is 90% done.

Often Pollock-esque, he however also finds his own style in times of great distress. For his upcoming project he has come to the conclusion that he would like to recreate current artworks and create new artworks in a more dramatic and bold statement using larger canvases and thus more paint. Then upon completion of the series 'Madness & Me' he desires to exhibit these works locally before attempting to gain momentum within certain circles to one day exhibit nationally and or internationally. His artwork is a visit into his mind, a discussion without works and a glimpse of true emotion captured in times of great struggle. Working in a supportive environment to help spur him on with his works he hopes to use this project to get through the winter and to represent the many whom suffer from mental health conditions that quietly suffer alone.

https://www.kickstarter.com/projects/153633466/america-is-at-the-mall-a-post-9-11-military-love-s?ref=discovery_category_newest,153633466/america-is-at-the-mall-a-post-9-11-military-love-s,"This is a story written to the audience of the Iraq conflict - the 99% of America who are disconnected from the war. I wrote this to try and reconnect; to build bridges so those who haven't experienced what it's like to be part of a military family during wartime can understand. It's part of my own healing process - to tell the story.I'm adding this blurb because so many people are advising me on how to contact military groups for support of this project. This is another symptom of the disconnect in our culture. The veterans and their families LIVED it. The last thing they want right now is to watch their nightmare unfold again on stage. They have their own story replaying in a loop within their minds each and every day. They're fighting now to heal; to forget; to rebuild and move on.  Or they are lost to us - either through death, or grief or deep wounds..They do want you to understand why they're disappointed and some, even disgusted, with what continues to happen in the dialogue about our military and its role in our national future. This play is an opportunity for you to be a fly on the wall as one family who had no idea what military service entailed learns, fails, regroups and get knocked down again. War is not something in which you develop better skills and come out stronger. Witness eight characters as their unique sets of strengths and weaknesses are put to the test in true events from the Iraq conflct. Which are you? What would you have done differently? When her daughter falls in love with a soldier, Kathryn is immersed in the reality of life as a combat military family while her safe, rural community turns a blind eye toward the unfolding tragedies in Iraq.Thisis the story of one family’s journey from membership in the 99% of Americanssheltered from their country’s military involvements into the obscurity of the1% who fight our wars.The all-volunteer military system draws strictlines between those who make the decisions about war and those who pay theprice for those decisions. Electedpolicy leaders, amplified by a puppet media, champion the segregation of thegeneral public from the military families - instead proclaimingthat the best way tosupport our troopsis to fly flags and buy more goods. Kathryn believed it would all work out for the good...until it didn't.Kathrynwants only to go back to the way it was; to believe that her bright daughterhas endless possibility ahead of her. Instead, the family is volunteered by wedding vows into this new culturewhich cares only that trained soldiers return to battle over and over. When Kathryn says to her daughter that shewishes it would end, her daughter explodes at her, “Don’t say that. It willonly end for us when he dies.”Kathrynmust accept that the world her daughter has taken them into is different than theone she knew. Her family is an expendable cog in the warmachine whose sacrifice will be tallied on a profit statement somewhere.They are alone.They focus on survival while those aroundthem are oblivious - burying the family in their ignorance.This is what it means to be a veteran in America.The story contains adult subject matter with explicit representation of an improvised explosion device (I.E.D.) and its effect during Iraq, 2005. The story is powerful. It is recommended that arrangements be made with an area veterans group to provide a private space directly outside the theater area for anyone who feels overwhelmed by the play's content. Please consider staffing the private area with retired combat veterans to show maximum respect. I live and write in rural Kansas. My support network will have to come from places outside of here. I trust that Kickstarter will provide a platform to harness the American appetite for ""true fiction"" stories of our involvement in Iraq. This story is unusual, in that, it is written from the home front - the family's struggle. The script is in final editing phases. I am collaborating with an experienced actor and director to smooth out rough places in technical aspects, movement and excess dialogue. I do not have the capability to do the next steps of preproduction work without professional assistance. If you are that link for this story, please contact me soon so we can talk. The script is about 115 pages plus scene descriptions and character descriptions. There are heavy roles for 3 women and 3 men with supporting roles by 2 men and 2 women (one of these is a cameo). One supporting role (young male) uses heavy metal music as his coping mechanism which could be expanded to showcase talent with original scores, if desired.  In addition, there are prerecording opportunities for several voices - most interesting are two radio talk show hosts who could take the dialogue up a notch in authenticity and creativity. The radio in the Kansas kitchen is always on and these two are either reporting breaking news of needing an umbrella in the morning, a surprise concert ticket give away.....or the new tally of dead soldiers.   Technical needs: the plot uses a video chat type platform for communication from the home front to the barracks which is viewed by the audience as if they could see the home's computer screen.  The I.E.D. explosions are experienced in dark theater with radio communication between the soldiers. Photo credit and permission by: Diana Wilhite","The script is complete and could be printed this week.  I plan to submit it through amazon's create space for publication.  But, a long-time friend who has acted and directed for decades in community and university theater productions has offered to comb through it one more time to smooth out any loose ends before I submit it to print.  I plan to print in plenty of time to make shipments of the copies to Kickstarter supporters before Veterans Day 2014. If circumstances beyond my control prevent the publication from happening by then, I will keep my supporters posted of the late delivery schedule.  On a personal level, I feel risk in opening my life and family to the world.  Even though this is a work of fiction, based on several military family stories, there is always the risk that someone will feel hurt by what I've shared.I feel apprehensive about the process of getting to the performance.  How much input will I have on making sure scenes, actors, sounds and characters are held true to the vision?  My intent is for other military families to feel I represented them correctly, even with this one, small story.  And of course, it is a challenge to portray the intense emotions of war and military life without overshadowing the immense costs that others have paid- since 9/11 and also all earlier conflicts in our history.",https://www.kickstarter.com/projects/153633466/america-is-at-the-mall-a-play-in-three-acts?ref=discovery_category_newest,153633466/america-is-at-the-mall-a-play-in-three-acts,"When her daughter brings home a soldier, Kathryn’s small world is ripped inside out as the challenges and deepest fears faced by all military families play out in her own kitchen.   America is at the Mall is a stage play script written by a military family member after the experience of Operation Iraqi Freedom. The story is unique because it is focused on the homefront. How does the experience of war change a family? The script offers a unique opportunity to peek inside the home of one fictional Kansas family as they face the challenges of loving someone who volunteered to fight for his country. Live theater is a way for us to experience life events without risking the event itself. In the theater, we can watch how characters struggle with events and come to a resolution. War is an overwhelming topic. By focusing on the journey of the family's struggles at home, audience members may be able to break down the larger issues of war into bite size pieces that mimic and contrast with their own every day challenges. In the play script, little things spiral out of control. The family adjusts and strengthens to compensate and survive. Audiences will walk away with a better understanding of how military families find themselves isolated from the rest of their culture. They will gain deeper insight into the gap filled with misconceptions and mistrust between those who serve and those who don't.This is a full length play script, written by a female first time playwright. The story passes the Bechdel test. The protagonist is the mother-in-law of the soldier in combat. The story revolves around her attempts to hold some normalcy and safety within her household while accepting the new relationships and risks brought on by her daughter's marriage.  There are nine characters in the script, five females and four males, plus a few voice-only roles. This kickstarter campaign is for immediate funds to do the copy right process, make copies and ship printed copies to several targeted theater and production groups who have expressed interest in the story. By November 15, 2014, I expect to have the copyright process completed and at least ten copies of the script printed and delivered. The script is at 140-150 pages which includes the extra information on costumes, props and technical needs. I am estimating $14 per copy in print/copy costs plus $6 in U.S.P.S. Priority Mail for each. $200 will cover those costs for ten copies. I need an additional $35 to cover the online copyright. And I added about $35 to cover what kickstarter and amazon/paypal will deduct from your pledges to cover their costs of supporting this platform for my project.Additional funds over the $270 will be used to print and ship more copies of the script to possible production partners. If there are funds remaining from this kickstarter campaign when a theater production company accepts the script, I will donate the remaining funds to that theater company to help with their costs in producing the story - such as for marketing, props, costumes and other expenses. If you would like additional copies of the script, please let me know. ","The script is in final editing stages.  I have a few typos to catch, a refrigerator to write out of the script (the family will have big discussions around the cereal cabinet, I suppose?  as my director/mentor says, ""No refrigerators - your technical crews won't agree to moving around a fridge on stage!), and I am doing word smithing (moving the same words back and forth on the same line to get the best effect!) on the last scene of the play.  So, as long as I don't get really sick or have an unexpected life crisis......everything will be ready to copy by November 1.  Then fed ex copy and print or staples.com will get my orders and I'll start shipping out copies.Now - as far as the real risk - will anyone want to accept my script and produce it on stage?  I have no control over that.  All I can do now is put out the most perfect product I am capable of and wait."

Much of our profits go directly to animal shelters in the area so you can feel good about treating yourself to one of our paintings.Whether you go digital or original, we guarantee you will enjoy your artwork as much as we enjoy making it. Have fun! Take life by the horns, or the tail, and help us celebrate the joy of horses and goats!Lucy and ToddNot all goats and horses are of this world. We can safely say that some of our beloved pets are a bit well, different.This happy goat for example is covered in flowers, and is quite delighted!Not all portraits have to be done realistically!Do you ever wonder what a happy goat looks like? They jump, buck, play, and skip! Google it one day, Happy Goat, it will make your heart smile.I met a guy recently who has cancer and must rehome all his pets, including 2 horses, 3 dogs, and 8 puppies. He was overwhelmed and close to tears in frustration.I quickly made a craigslist ad for him and took some pictures of the cuties to post online. Within days the dogs have found good homes, including the puppies. In fact, they were so cute that we kept two of them ourselves! The horses are still being placed, but I have a feeling things are going to work out.This beauty came out quite by accident.

It is not a sad holiday, just the opposite. It is a day to remember family and friends who have passed away by inviting them to come back for 1 day and enjoy the celebration of their life with food, friends, and stories shared.It’s so hard to be positive when a friend has passed away, but it gets easier with a combination of time and positive rituals:Because Friends are Remembered ForeverMy friends were tired of seeing me sad. I could tell that I was lowering the mood of a group just by walking into the room. I had to change that, I didn’t want to be “the gloomy friend"". Especially since I’m sure I always showed a lot of positive energy prior to my friend's death. I tried many ways to try to rid myself of the negative aspect of death by reminding myself that those who have passed can still feel my love. That was motivation enough for me, to think I had the power to make Tony happy from across the chasm made me happy in itself. Now all I had to do was create a visual reminder of those happy times.I pulled out photos, printouts from projects we had worked on together, and a bullet shell from our practice shots at the range… but the bullet told a sad story, so I took it away. Only happiness is allowed around this decorated corner of my shelf where Tony’s picture rests. I put flowers, some candy he liked, a small bottle of tequila (which I am sure was appreciated), and a small dish filled with poems I love.But I still needed a central figure, a current representation of the transition my friend has gone through. Life and death are a part of me, of you, of Tony. Death would have to be represented in a way that showed the happy vibes I was sending out.So why not a doll? A little Day of the Dead doll that represents goodwill, and has been felt through countless generations as a good omen.I made a doll. I hand sewed and put happiness in every stitch. I lovingly painted his little bones and made him as cute as I knew how. The doll captures my attention every time with his bold coloring. And I can’t help smiling when I think of Tony’s reaction of seeing that doll sitting on a shelf next to his favorite things. His laugh! Oh his laugh. There are things I will always remember.Celebration of LifeSometimes it helps to have a physical reminder of happy times with our loved ones when they are no longer with us. A small artifact can mean so much. This little doll can be part of your new ritual, or an addition to an established one, it can help you remember to smile… just a tiny step in the direction of joy. Face it, our loved ones never liked seeing us depressed or sad, we owe it to them to put up a happy front even if at first we have to fake it. And fake it you will, at first. Little by little happiness will creep back into your heart, which is what your loved ones want. You will go through this transformation of sadness to acceptance, from a little smile to joy of life. And just as it takes time to grieve, time will also heal… don't lose hope. Put a smile on your face and one day you will be surprised to feel that it is real, that memories feel good again, that the sun once again shines in your life.","I have been making dolls for the past month, all sewn by hand. If the project blows up I would have to buy a sewing machine, but I believe that I will meet my smaller goal, have plenty of time to prepare each reward and have them ready for shipping."

https://www.kickstarter.com/projects/simeontuitt/copy-my-connected-tuitt-smart-home-automation-diy?ref=discovery_category_newest,simeontuitt/copy-my-connected-tuitt-smart-home-automation-diy,"I am raising money to create an online Home Automation DIY video trainingcourse to show people how to create their very own automated home on a budget controlledwith your mobile phone, tablet or smart watch phone as I do daily.If successfully funded the course will be ready by the end of April 2016 and all access details to it sent to those who ordered it from here.HOME AUTOMATION CAN SAVE YOU MONEY FROM DAY 1Even if you have never considered Home Automation before, you will want to support this cause since Home Automation can protect your home and cut your electric bills through automating power saving.Watch the video above and see how I control my kitchen plugs, lights, kettle and iron all from my smart watch phone.You could set something similar up with what you learn through my course and control your home from your smart phone or a smart watch phone like me.A MUCH SMARTER HOME WITHOUT THE EXPENSE OF A SMART HOMEYou will save more through Home Automation than the cost of the course over a year and if you wanted to learn the same information from me personally it would cost you £300 an hour in consultation time.IMAGINE THE SAVINGS ON YOUR WASHING WITH HOME AUTOMATIONImagine being able to turn your washing machine or dryer on or off from anywhere in the world from your smart phone, tablet or smart watch phone.Rather than having your washing machine be on in the day while you are at work during the most expensive time to use electric and then left on standby for hours you could turn your devices on and off automatically with Home Automation.DEVICES ON STANDBY STILL COST YOU MONEY, CUT YOUR ELECTRIC BILL WITH HOME AUTOMATIONWhether you knew it or not devices on standby still use electricity and it costs you, not only does it cost you it shortens the life span of your electronics.Imagine how much all your devices left on standby cost you each month and year, Washing Machine, Dryer, Dish Washer, Microwave, TVs, DVD Players, Computers, Laptops, Tablets, Phones on charge overcharging (over charged batteries are a potential fire risk).With Home Automation you can have all the power saving for those devices automated to turn things off daily and when you are not at home.NO MORE LIGHT SWITCH PRESSING IS NEEDEDIN MY KITCHENWatch the video above and you will see an example of how I have automated lighting in my kitchen so when I walk into the kitchen the lights turn on automatically.Through my Home Automation video training course you will discover not only how I control my home when I am out, but also the exact cheap hardware I use to do it, then you can do the same.I SAVE ON MY ELECTRIC BILL THROUGH SMART HOME AUTOMATIONEvery room of my home is like this so I never have to touch light switches and this is how your own home and elderly family members homes should be to make things easier and help prevent falls and tripping in the dark.I have a great passion for automating things and got into home automation and home remote security 4 years ago so that I could monitor my home remotely from my mobile phone from anywhere in the world through the home cameras I installed.I didn't have a budget for thousands to be spending on a home CCTV system, especially one that didn't offer the functions I require, so I built my own on a very small budget.For the price of a single camera at a high street shop I discovered where to get 3 cameras for the same price allowing me to kit out my entire house for very little. I'VE HAD CAMERAS IN PLACE SINCE 2012 FOR HOME SECURITYThe video above is of a real thief breaking into the old car back on December 23rd 2012 after it failed to lock, the thief in under 2 minutes stole over £500 worth of items.Although camera's were in place in 2012 and gave me footage to pass onto the police, I always wanted to create a smarter home that would tell me if someone was near the car or at the front door.DO NOT LEAVE THIS PAGE WITHOUT BACKING THIS COURSEThe small course backing cost is cheap when you see just how fast a thief can steel items from a car or home and with no cameras in place the chance of ever identifying those who steel your property are slim.The theft of your smart phone, tablet or computer you are viewing this page on is a lot more than the course cost showing you how to set up your own home automation and security system like mine.While you can never stop thefts happening, being able to have video footage or intervene after getting a motion alert from home helps.Not knowing who invaded your privacy is terrible, it leaves you wondering whether it was someone you knew, was it a neighbour, a friend, someone local you have seen etc.Smart Home Automation Security in place helps provide a way to check what happened and pass the video footage onto the police to try and recover your items.You can see from the video above how I get to see who is at my front door now without having to get up and answer it, I can even answer the door to visitors when I am not at home or see when there has been motion.The home security video doorbell home monitoring system also allows me to now see at door level anyone who approaches the door or front garden, so unlike in 2012 on December 23rd, I now get notified of anyone near the car.The home automation course will tell you which equipment I use for each part of my smart home automation covered in the course so you can use it and implement it in the same way I have.I INSTALLED THE SAME HOME SECURITY FOR MY FAMILYI then did the same for my families homes (cameras been in place since 2012) so that they too can remotely monitor their homes from their mobiles, tablet computers or smart watch phone at any time.HOME AUTOMATION AND A SMARTER HOME TO SAVE MONEYI got into home automation because I love everything to do with gadgets but all the offerings I seen for home automation systems were super expensive and aimed at the USA market ONLY and I am from the UK so needed a UK system (my solution can be used in any country though).So just like with the Home Security Camera monitoring system I came up with a custom home automation system on a budget that anyone can put together and build as their budget allows.I built my smart home automation over 2015, there was lots of testing, tweaking, experimenting with settings, trouble shooting I had to go through which you skip with access to my video course.HERE IS WHAT I HAVE DONE WITH MY SMART HOME SO FARI have heating I can control from ANYWHERE with my mobile phone, when I leave the house my heating switches off automatically and turns on when I am returning home, only after checking the weather to see if heating is actually needed.I also control my heating from my smart watch phone and this is something you could do too if you followed my simple automated home set up process through the online video course I want to create to share this information.HOME I KEEP CONNECTED TUITT WHEN ON MORNING JOGSThe smart home automation security system I have put together allows me to keep an eye on my home, even when I am out on my morning jogs, I can check the front door camera when motion is detected or the doorbell rings.CCTV CAMERAS IN ALL ROOMS LET ME CHECK ANY ROOM WHEN OUTI have CCTV cameras in every room I can monitor from my mobile or smart watch phone which alert me when motion is sensed and these load up on my phone as I pull into the drive, so with my mobile phone in the car dock I can see in and around my home before I enter.It is a cool feature but its also there so I know there isn't an intruder in the property or more to the point that a family member I would rather not be around hasn't visited, so I can just reverse back out the drive or avoid parking in the first place. ;-)I joke but you get how useful the whole seeing inside and around your home could be before entering the property.Then I have my home set to turn my lights and TV off in the front room when I leave the house and reactivate when I return. If you have ever had to pop out to the shop or nip somewhere and left everything powered up it does eat electric and with a smart home system you would save money by it shutting itself down.SMART DOOR MONITORING SYSTEM TO ANSWER CALLS ANYWHEREMy front door records every person who calls to my home, whether it is an annoying leaflet mailer, postman, parcel being delivered and lets me talk to them through the door bell no matter where in the world I am.My doorbell is connected to the internet, so rather than having to stay in home all day waiting for a parcel delivery, when it arrives I can speak to the delivery person and tell them to leave it with a neighbour.The moment someone sets off the motion detection I get a message on my phone or smart watch phone and I can speak through my doorbell to whoever is approaching my door.I'M BUILDING AN ONLINETRAINING COURSE SHOWING HOW TO DO THIS STUFFNow what I have covered above is just a little of what I have done to create my own smart home and I have done it all on a budget and anyone can copy it WITH MY SHORT TO THE POINT instructional videos.So this page is to raise money for me to create the online smart home automation video trainingcourse to make this available to people to learn through video training how I have my system all set up.Creating videos, hosting and streaming videos isn't cheap so I need to hit the goal of this page to bring a Home Automation DIY video training course out so anyone can copy my set up.So anything you can give towards this cause is greatly appreciated, please share the page on Facebook and Twitter to help me get to my target fund goal to make this course a reality for you and others to enjoy.HOW SOON WILL THE ONLINE COURSE BE UP AND ACCESSIBLE?If the funding goal is reached the site will be up by the end of April with the training videos sharing how I have my automated home set up and how you can do the same cheaply.What I have done with my own home is10 years ahead of its time, so if a home that automatically saves energy, cuts your electric and gas bills through smart home automation and can be controlled from anywhere as well as giving you greater security appeals,contribute to this worthy cause and share it.A QUICK RECAP ON WHAT I WILL BE SHARING IN MY COURSEHOW WILL I DELIVER THE COURSE ACCESS TO BACKERS?All backers who order the video course will receive access to the course online training by the end of April, video training course access details will be e-mailed to you.Keep an eye out for two e-mails, one will be an e-mail with your access details in and the second a verification e-mail asking you to confirm your e-mail address so Simeon Tuitt Direct can send you your access details to the online Simeon Tuitt CONNECTED TUITT Home Automation video course.It doesn't matter which e-mail you get your details from, one is simply a backup to make sure you receive your details to access your course at the end of April.CONTRIBUTE NOW AND LETS GET MY HOME AUTOMATION DIY COURSE MADE FOR YOUSo if you want to control your home remotely to make sure everything is turned off or to turn devices on on dark days when you are not in to deter break ins, or simply monitor your home or families homes remotely you will find a short straight to the point video in this course to set it up in the same way I have.Thanks in advance for your support.Sim ","There isn't any challenges for me with creating my video training course since I know my subject matter, I consult on it daily and use smart home automation daily, so creating the course won't give me any issues.I've been publishing information training products since 2006 so I know this course will be ready by the end of April and the speed at which I work, probably a lot sooner.The only problem I really foresee is me over delivering on great easy to follow video content since I am always using home automation and wearable tech daily and finding new uses for integrating them.So you may experience content overload but I will help you there by keeping the videos short, sweet to the point so you can just watch them, know what I do, how I do it, what equipment I use and do it yourself.The only small problem that could potentially happen if this crowdfund gets a MASSIVE response is my e-mail service provider limiting the number of e-mails I can send out daily to my backers with their login details.I have planned around that though so you will receive two e-mails from me, one will be a normal e-mail with your video course training access details, the other will be sent through my auto responder system asking you to verify your e-mail address so Simeon Tuitt Direct can send you your access details to the Simeon Tuitt CONNECTED TUITT Home Automation DIY Course.Once you have VERIFIED your e-mail address your course access details will be sent automatically to your e-mail inbox and you will receive FREE Home Automation updates as well while

A TEXT OR E-MAIL WHEN YOUR SMOKE, CARBON MONOXIDE OR WATER LEAK ALARM ARE GOING OFF KNOW MATTER WHERE YOU ARE IN THE WORLDI want to show you how to create a smoke alarm monitoring system out of an android smart phone like I have, just like in the demo video above.I will be teaching this through a DIY tutorial video I will create if this project reaches its funding goal.NO SPECIAL EQUIPMENT REQUIRED JUST AN ANDROID SMART PHONE WHICH YOU PROBABLY HAVE SPARE FROM UPGRADINGLast year my next door neighbour had a fire, I don't know if you have ever had one or tried to help put one out as it spreads but it is a scary experience.AUTOMATED TEXT ALERTS AND EMERGENCY CONTACTS GET ALERTED WHEN THE SMOKE ALARM SOUNDSTiming and alerting the right people is crucial in a fire situation, if you are in home you need to know the alarms sounding, if you have neighbours they need to know too so they can get out the house and call for help if needed.Trying to use a smart phone in a smoke filled house wouldn't be easy, so having a smoke alert system that texts your emergency contacts and you is why I came up with what you seen on the videos on this page.MY FAMILY IS TO IMPORTANT TO TRUST THEIR SAFETY TO A CLOUD BASED SERVICE FOR ALERTING ME OF SMOKE ALERTSThere are a few internet connected smoke alarm systems on the market, I have tested many of them but there is things with them I do not like personally.The main thing I didn't like was they require the use of their cloud based alert system and when their services crashed and went down, it meant no alerts would be sent to those like myself using the hardware.IMAGINE THIS SITUATION AND IT IS WHY I WANTED A MUCH BETTER SOLUTION TO ALERT ME MY SMOKE ALARM IS GOING OFFYou leave the iron on when rushing to work, you've just got in the car, meanwhile in the kitchen is some tissue roll next to the iron and it starts to burn.At the same time the cloud based service that your internet connected smoke alarm communicates with has crashed and is offline.Your smoke alarm is sending the smoke alert over your wifi to the internet based cloud service which can't be reached.As a result the cloud can't relay a notification to your mobile app to notify you just outside your home that the kitchen is catching fire, so you go to work and your kitchen catches fire.TEXT ALERTS ARE FAR FASTER AND MORE RELIABLE THAN AN INTERNET CLOUD BASED ALERT SYSTEM FOR SOMETHING AS IMPORTANT AS FIRE ALERTSDuring my testing of internet connected smoke alert systems I experienced some with very long server lag and cloud issues.Some delays ranged from 5 minutes to 8 hours from me pressing the test button on my smoke alarm and the app telling me of a smoke alert, this was the same over a week of testing with one service.If those tests had been real fire alert situations they could of been fatal or resulted in the loss of my home, property or family.THEN THERE'S THE ANNOYING LAG IF YOU LIVE IN ANOTHER COUNTRY FROM THE CLOUD BASED SERVICEI live in the UK, the cloud based smoke alert services I tested were based in the USA, the apps offered the function of silencing the fire alarm when it was sounding which was cool.However it ended up being far quicker to climb up and take the smoke alarm down than to wait for the alarm to send the alert to the cloud for the cloud to send the alert to the app, by that time the alarm had been sounding a while.I then had to send the silence alarm message on the app which would send it to the cloud which then sent it back to the smoke alarm to silence.MY SMART PHONE SMOKE ALARM ALERT SYSTEM SKIPS OUT THE CLOUD AND NOTIFIES YOU FAST BY TEXT OR E-MAILI know I showed you it at the start but watch the video above again to see how quick the listening smart phone reacts to the smoke alarm sounding.By the time the personalised message had been spoken the text messages had already been sent to myself and emergency contacts.BACK THIS PROJECT AND I WILL SHOW YOU IN MY DIY TUTORIAL VIDEO HOW I HAVE DONE IT AND HOW YOU CAN DO THE SAMENow if you want to see how I have turned my mobile into a smoke alarm alert system so that you can do the same with a spare mobile, help fully back this campaign and I will reveal the steps in my video tutorial.FAMILY WITH NO INTERNET ACCESS COULD HAVE THIS IN PLACE TO ALERT YOU OF ANY ALARMS SOUNDINGIf you have elderly family without internet access an internet connected fire alarm is no good, but with what I show you in my video tutorial you can use a smart phone to alert you when their alarm sounds.THINGS YOU NEED TO KEEP IN MIND AND WHY YOU NEED TO BACK THIS PROJECT RIGHT NOWOutside this project I charge £300 an hour for an online consultation dealing with home automation and smart home DIY.So if you wanted to learn how I create smoke alarm alert systems out of android mobiles that is what you would pay.The DIY video tutorial once created I will be marketing from my Home Automation website for £100 by itself, so you can save BIG by backing this project here right now.An off the shelf internet connected smoke alarm alert product will cost you £150 - £200 from the shop and it won't be as customisable as the DIY mobile one I show you how to create.You will also need several smoke alarms which at £150 - £200 each won't be cheap and if you have a power surge that cuts the power and causes a fire they won't work at all to notify you through their app.IFTTT INTEGRATION IS POSSIBLE ALLOWING YOU TO LINK IT TO YOUR SMART HOME DEVICESWhile I have shown that my DIY smoke alarm alert system sends alerts by text message, it can still be integrated to IFTTT to connect to smart home devices.So if you have smart lights, you could have them linked to turn on when the smoke alarm sounds to light the home if you need to exit.The extractor fan could turn on to take out the smoke and the gas could turn off if it was a CO leak. Your smart doors could unlock if smoke is detected to allow you to get out or the emergency services to get in.REQUIREMENT:- You will need a smoke alarm/s and android mobile to set up a smoke alarm alert system following my tutorial video, the mobile will listen for your smoke alarm alert system sounding and then text or e-mail you.","There isn't any challenges for me with creating my video training course since I know my subject matter, I consult on it daily and use smart home automation daily, so creating the video tutorial won't give me any issues.I've been publishing information training products since 2006 so I know this video will be ready by the start of June and the speed at which I work, probably a lot sooner.The only problem I really foresee is me over delivering on great easy to follow video content.The only small problem that could potentially happen if this project gets a MASSIVE response is my e-mail service provider limiting the number of e-mails I can send out daily to my backers with their login details.I have planned around that though so you will receive two e-mails from me, one will be a normal e-mail with your video tutorial access details, the other will be sent through my auto responder system asking you to verify your e-mail address so Simeon Tuitt Direct can send you your access details to the Smoke Alarm Alert DIY Video.Once you have VERIFIED your e-mail address your video tutorial access details will be sent automatically to your e-mail inbox and you will receive FREE Home Automation updates as well while subscribed."

So we need all the help we can get to secure the final funding of this movie which would allow VFX artists to be hired and add finishing touches, as well as to show our gratitude to the cast and crew.Now I have already secured  over $1000 of my own investment.

https://www.kickstarter.com/projects/mushroomart/three-legged-rabbit-crochet-and-amigurumi?ref=discovery_category_newest,mushroomart/three-legged-rabbit-crochet-and-amigurumi,"In the BeginningIt all started on maternity leave. I had a month before I was due to meet my son and wanted a project. I bought a load of wool and got started on making what was the beginning of an old passion but with a new direction.A month flew by and at the end I had a completed Sawtooth from Horizon Zero Dawn. Seeing it completed I realised I started on one of the hardest projects I could have picked and if I could do that from the get go, what other patterns could I create?The NowSo here I am, now creating a new patter almost on a weekly basis if not more but with no home to put the patterns out there in one place.That's where this kickstarter and you good people come in! The funds I am hoping to raise will be enough to get the basics of a website started added to the money I have already raised through selling patterns. I hope once up and running to offer more free patterns to spread the love of crochet and pattern creation.Nothing feels better than making custom creations of characters or animals you love but cant buy anywhere and the problem solving which comes with the creation of each new pattern. The FutureI have set the goal to cover the base website creation and hosting cost. Anything above this will help in getting a redesign of the logo to improve branding. From there I can also purchase more wool of different colours to vastly improve the range of creations I can make going forward!If it supersedes even those low level goals I will stretch to a small set up to take cleaner photos of the finished products and how to photos as I go along, giving clearer photos for the pattern write ups and how tos.",RisksAs with everything there are risks and the main one here is keeping up creating more patterns that people want whilst the project runs to keep interest up. I will overcome this if it becomes an issue by enlisting more help on weekends and committing extra time to pattern creation.If the goal is reached then the next risk is website development and ensuring that the final product is user friendly. I have created a website previously for a financial advice firm and will build on that experience to create this new website.,https://www.kickstarter.com/projects/mushroomart/dirty-fun-socks?ref=discovery_category_newest,mushroomart/dirty-fun-socks,"In the beginningI had wanted to do this idea for a while but never found the time.I then sat down one evening creating a long google history researching images - one of the rare times a muddy history like that was actually for research and could be added to a ""homework"" folder.So I printed my first pair of socks and couldn't stop laughing as I walk around. My husband wondered what I was laughing at until he saw my feet and joined in. The way they waggle and move is perfect.Facebook confirmed I was onto something with friends and family both seeing the humour in my project.So I'm bringing these socks to you so everyone can have their own fun with their feet!What I will use the funds forMoney raised will be used to purchase the initial socks, inks and printing paper to cut out new stencils to use. They will help develop a custom box to ship the socks in and if I get enough a website so you can replenish your socks and maybe even anonymously send a pair to someone you think is a real dick.Can I choose my own cut?Yes you can! Dicks come in all shapes and sizes so I am offering a choice of five different cuts for you to select your own upon funding!Type of sock?But I only wear trainer socks do you do those? The final offering will also have an option of trainer or crew style length.That still not enough choice to get the sock of your dreams?Then you can also choose from black or white.That's three quick questions to end up with an awesome pair of dicks for your feet.Colour, Style and dick cut.Why?Never have one of my products made me laugh as much as I have with these and I want to push that fun as far as I can. Bringing different pairs and if this does really well there will be a release of the ball socks. With just as much humour for the heel of the foot as the front of the foot if you get where I'm going.",Not many risks lay in this project. There may be some wastage if a sock doesn't print right as each one is hand printed using a screen. If shipment of bulk socks is held back local socks can be purchased to avoid any time delay.October is a long view to allow for any orders over the expected amount. I aim to have orders out a lot quicker.

This gives children a chance to spend more time with each display, allowing them to glean more information from the items in our collection.The latest exhibit that we will be featuring is called ""Sea Monsters,"" and showcases a collection of aquatic reptiles that ruled the world's oceans during the Mesozoic Era. These include animals such as ichthyosaurs, and mosasaurs. We will be giving kids an opportunity to touch these fossils and fossil replicas that come from animals that are millions and millions of years old.Kids will make origami mosasaurs. They will make giant crayon rubbings from a 60"" swimming reptile. The funds generated from this Kickstarter campaign will cover the cost of these art supplies, as well as help us acquire the fossil replicas necessary to make this exhibit complete.","The risk is that the exhibit won't have enough display items and hands-on activities to bring people in.  Our strength lies within a dedicated team of artists and construction professionals who love to build ""stuff"" and create the hands-on activities for kids.",https://www.kickstarter.com/projects/bison/ptalented-pterodactyls?ref=discovery_category_newest,bison/ptalented-pterodactyls,"Art meets Science at the Colossal Fossils museum in Wausau, WI. Our upcoming exhibit, ""Dragons,"" will debut in May 2018, featuring pterosaurs, the winged reptiles that flew through the skies during the dinosaur era.Our claim to fame circles around the idea that hands-on learning is the best way to learn. This exhibit will include half a dozen fossil replicas of these amazing pterosaurs that are hands-on and tangible for kids of all ages. The best part is that they can make crayon rubbings of these replicas, decorate them, and take them home to further enhance that notion of hands-on learning.The funds raised from this Kickstarter campaign will allow us to purchase these fossil replicas and the paper required to make the scientific masterpieces that kids can take home.","We have now been creating hands-on dinosaur and fossil related experiences for six years.  These types of exhibits are always popular with the kids and appreciated by the parents.  There is very little risk with this exhibit.  If the funds are not acquired, then the kids won't have an opportunity to see these exhibits up close.  We also offer free museum tours for visiting Boys & Girls Clubs, and Big Brothers Big Sisters.  It's simple:  The more funds we acquire, the more hands-on exhibits we can make for kids of all demographics."

I live in Bassano del Grappa, a small town famous for handmade pottery in Italy, one of the most important in my country. I work with pottery since 2010. I’ve been selected and I won different art prizes in Italy and Europe. Also I’ve been selected in group and solo exhibitions in my country. Plus in 2013 I won an art studio for one year in Venice, with Bevilacqua La Masa Foundation (a contemporary art museum in Venice, Italy).I am Italian and I am proud to be it, so I want to bring you inside the Italian style. I grow up in this amazing country, full of history, art, beautiful landscapes, delicious food and traditions. So the best thing I can do is offer the typical Italian style of our pottery. It is colourful and full of typical Italian things, like flowers, fruits and vegetables painted on (grapes, lemons, tomatoes, olives, poppies, sunflowers…). I would love that every backer will receive a piece of my country, a ceramic piece that could explain with the images painted on the pots our deep culture. When you will have in your hand a my mug, a Christmas ball, a plate or something else you will hold a part of Italy, you will breath the air of my country and my people.Why this project?- Because I need to increase my social media profiles with advertisments, cause the most of my online sales come from social media.- Because I love my country, Italy. But since I opened a my ceramic shop in a Us military base in Italy (3 years ago) I fell in love with American people, I understood it is time to push my job and my life to the next level and exports my Italian culture and my skill in another country. My american customers are amazing and they tell me every day that I need to move in the States, because they really appreciate my creations and myself as an artist. So now it is the time to do it. But before to ask a working visa, I need to plan the moving in every single detail, because I don’t wanna fail.So this is my idea about it:I would open a space in the United States, it will be a pottery studio where I will create my handmade ceramic items. A part of it will be a showroom/shop where I will sell pots. Plus I’d like to organize in that space, group exibithions with other local artists and crafters in the way to bring to the city some new cultural and artistic events. Periodically I would love to organize some workshops/classes with kids, so they can understand what means work with the clay and create artistic goods. The state I am planning to move is Texas, probably in Austin or San Antonio.Why Texas? First because the weather, I am Italian, I don’t like so much the cold weather, second these two cities have an university, so for sure they are full of interesting people that pay attention to creativity and arts, third I am already in contact with people from Texas that live there, so could be easier to me. Fourth Texas is one of the state of the south with a big ethnic mix and I am very fascinated to know different cultures and work with them, because to be in contact with different cultures is always a growth about myself as a human and about my ceramic art style.coffee mugs:functional: Not toxic material, dishwasher and microwave safe.handmade: I create every mug by free hands so every piece is one of a kind.

But please remember I am an artisan and every piece to be made needs time and around 24 hours in the kiln (yes 24 hours!), plus the time to make the item, getting dry and paint it. Sometimes the shipping could be slow because the custom could inspect the boxes, but anyway for example to ship in Usa, the shipping takes around 12 days, to ship in Europe is faster.

I create paintings and ceramics. I am graduated with honor at the Academy of Fine Arts in Venice, Italy. I live in Bassano del Grappa (VI), 100 km far from Venice.This is a series of paintings and drawings on paper and canvas I made during an art residency in Venice I won some years ago at the Bevilacqua La Masa Foundation. It was one of the best creative experience I had in my life. In that period I was working with some art galleries but I felt like in a cage, I can't really expressed my feelings in my art and my fears because the ""art system"" and thesaleability that an art gallery needs. In that year I didn't care about the official art system and I created art pieces very strong and raw. I was living a difficult period of my life cause I was pregnant and I felt really scared about a lot of things. So I decided to turn my thoughts, feelings and my soul in images. The result is something of surreal as a dream, colorful but raw, full of anxiety and confusion. It hurts me a lot to paint them, sometimes people can't understand how much efforts, tears and pain an artist could put into a single art piece. It is hard, believe me, also talk about that, because it is like to be naked in front of people. So if you will decide to back my project and my art, you will get a piece of my heart, my soul, my mind.When I worked with art galleries my prices were absolutely more expensive because the official art system but now, after years I understood I don't wanna be part of the official art system, I want to decide the prices by myself, I want that my art can be affordable and I wanna paint what I want, not what the gallerist of the trends want.So with this project you can get original art paintings at cheap prices because I think the world needs art, people needs art, not only rich people but every single person. When I worked with the art galleries a painting could be priced for example 1.000 euro (50x50 cm size) but in this way not everyone could buy it. With this project you can have original art paintings, even big sizes at affordable prices.All my paintings are signed and dated on the back, I use only high quality paper or canvas, high quality paint and they have a certification of authenticity.They are varnished as protection and they are mixed media or oil paintings. I don't use industrial canvas but I use only cotton canvas prepared by myself with the ancient traditional gypsum and glue base.I will ship worldwide. The big paintings will be shipped rolled in a tube without the frame builted because the shipping cost will be cheaper, but anyway i will ship with the canvans even the frame ready to set up.-----------------You can choose your painting among the following pictures!I won several national art prizes, art residencies and I took part to a lot of solo and group exhibitions in Italy and Spain.Awards (selection):2010 , ""The Glocal Rookie of the Year"" , Kunstart , Bolzano, curated di Valerio Dehò.

There she also meets Alex, Morgan's boyfriend, whom Riley doesn't really like or trust.Shortly after she meets her best friend, they take drugs; they have the best time of their lives.The next day Riley wakes up to sounds of screaming and shouting. Due to the after effects of last night's drugs mixed in with new substances and lack of sleep, Alex is now extremely paranoid and aggressive, so he accuses his girlfriend of losing his drug dealing money and decides to keep the girls hostage until he finds it.The girls come up with an idea to escape... THE CHARACTERSRILEY: the protagonist. She has very subtle characteristics because she is the window to the audience. The audience experiences the story through Riley's eyes, she tells us how to feel about certain situations without saying anything. She is very smart and instinctive. She is wary of Alex and his behaviour, especially when he tries to be extra nice and she also is the one to observe him closely and come up with and escape plan. However, she has an almost blinding affection and protective instinct over her best friend and would go to any extent to help her.MORGAN: the deuterogamist. She is the character that balances between the good and the evil. If Riley is suspicious and almost afraid of Alex, Morgan is very supportive and trusting of him. This shows her naivety and carelessness or maybe she's just a free spirit. Either way we see a big change coming from her as a character; at first she seems clueless and gullible, however when she tries to seduce Alex she shows a more cunning and brave side, as well as her willingness to plot against her abusive boyfriend who she loved and trusted thus far.ALEX: the antagonist. Alex is a drug dealer and a fond user of drugs outside of the party scene. If at first he seems friendly and harmless, we see the true colours of his behaviour after the party, when he is no longer sober. He becomes extremely paranoid, agitated and aggressive. His priorities also become more evident when he puts money above his girlfriend's life. WHERE YOUR MONEY IS GOING","There are always risks when undertaking a pilot.

It may start out that way, I've been told by pilgrims, but it rarely ends with the pilgrim unchanged. And a good manycaminos encompass months before and after the actual walk.Hi. I'm Leslie Strom. Thank you for your interest in my Kickstarter campaign!With your backing, I will be walking and painting along the Way of St. Francis, following in the footsteps of pilgrims, in mid-September for four weeks. The Way of St. Francis traces the paths that St. Francis and his followers walked on their missions from Florence to to Rome 800 years ago. As this is my first pilgrimage, my goal is to walk 180 km/112 miles of this 550 km/340 mile long path, from LaVerna to Assisi.I will paint watercolor postcards whenever I find something beautiful, profound or just super-weird. Walking along 800 years of history is bound to present plenty of opportunities for wonderful observations and the immediacy of capturing what I see in small paintings.My friend Marcia and I have planned this trip to travel with 10 pound backpacks and a minimalist ""let it go"" mindset. Letting go includes my artwork, expectations, and possessions. I'll be carrying about a pound of art supplies to do this project, providing that I can restrain myself from also carrying my less-than-minimalist satellite box of half pans. I dearly love color. Restraint on this Cammino starts early...!Along the path, the pilgrim acquires a stamp for the credenziale, or pilgrim's passport, in churches and refugios in villages along the Way, as validation of the journey. I will add a pilgrim credenziale stamp to the postcards when I can.My plan is to paint the postcards, take a good image of each postcard for prints later, then mail the postcard to backers from the trail, for the month it takes us to walk the pilgrimage. Backers of my project will have access to a web page with pilgrimage updates, photographs, and a map showing where we are.Here's the story behind the postcard paintings, which I think is kind of hilarious: Years ago, I started drawing and painting postcards with a very small kit I could take anywhere in a pocket. To say the least, there was a learning curve. One day my friend Marcia stopped me from throwing a few really bad ones away, saying I should put them in the mail. ""Anyone,"" she said, ""would be delighted to receive a hand-painted postcard in the mail."" I tested that assertion by making sure I sent all the really artless and clumsy postcard paintings to HER. Failure after failure, card after card.When they started getting better, it took me five minutes of hovering over the mailbox slot to finally drop them, but I always dropped them. ""Bon Voyage, little postcard,"" I'd say as it disappeared. It's best to not get attached to one's work.Because we are packing ultra-light, I will continue with my usual tiny paintbox which I will use to paint a representation of what I experience every day of our Cammino. I will paint at least 20 5x7 paintings. My background is architectural design, and so many of the drawings and paintings are likely to be buildings and artifacts throughout St. Francis' homelands of Italy.I'm raising funds in order to share the month-long pilgrimage with paintings and messages, and I can't do it without you. Funds will go toward modest pilgrimage travel expenses, printing and postage, and probably a lot of band-aids and tylenol. Reward levels for backers will be: access to online updates which I promise will be interesting, hand-painted postcards mailed from the trail which I almost promise will be meaningful conversation pieces, and when we return, your choice of 5x7 prints from the Path, and a printed booklet of all the paintings with commentary.It would be great to have you along with us on the Way of St. Francis!","As with any travel, there's certainly a risk of something going wrong. The Way of St. Francis is hilly and sometimes rough going. I'm particularly gifted at getting lost, even with GPS. In any case, I'll still be painting and drawing where I am.  As long as I can wield a pencil, I'll be drawing. As long as there's a glass of red wine, I'll have watercolor. Hey. Italy. I'll keep close track of the original postcards to see that they arrive to backers in a timely fashion. There will be an option to send them as postcards, with the authentic scuffs and stamps and inky cancellations that come with being mailed, or to be sent in an envelope to save them from potential damage.  If one goes missing, I'll be sure to create another to replace it. If situations at home force us back to the Northwest, we may reschedule the trip, or shorten it, and we will keep you posted. Weather: Foul weather may drive us indoors. There are plenty of good drawings to be had indoors in Italy. We are from the Northwest, and if we waited for the rain to stop we'd never do anything at all. If I don't start the trip, your money will be refunded.",https://www.kickstarter.com/projects/607687726/hand-painted-postcards-on-the-st-francis-pilgrimag-0?ref=discovery_category_newest,607687726/hand-painted-postcards-on-the-st-francis-pilgrimag-0,"Any pilgrimage is more than a long walk.

I'll be carrying about a pound of art supplies to do this project, providing that I can restrain myself from also carrying my less-than-minimalist satellite box of half pans. I dearly love color and work for a paint manufacturer. Restraint on this Cammino starts early...!Along the path, the pilgrim acquires a stamp for the credenziale, or pilgrim's passport, in churches and refugios in villages along the Way, as validation of the journey. I will add a pilgrim credenziale stamp to the postcards when I can.My tactic is to paint the postcards, take a good image of each postcard for prints later, then mail the postcard to backers from the trail, for the month it takes us to walk the pilgrimage. Backers of my project will have access to a web page with pilgrimage updates, photographs, and a map showing where we are.Here's the story behind the postcard paintings, which I think is kind of hilarious:Years ago, I started drawing and painting postcards with a very small kit I could take anywhere in a pocket. To say the least, there was a learning curve. One day my friend Marcia stopped me from throwing a few really bad ones away, saying I should put them in the mail. ""Anyone,"" she said, ""would be delighted to receive a hand-painted postcard in the mail."" I tested that assertion by making sure I sent all the really artless and clumsy postcard paintings to HER. Failure after failure, card after card.When they started getting better, it took me five minutes of hovering over the mailbox slot to finally drop them, but I always dropped them. ""Bon Voyage, little postcard,"" I'd say as it disappeared. It's best to not get attached to one's work.Because we are packing ultra-light, I will continue with my usual tiny paintbox which I will use to paint a representation of what I experience every day of our Cammino. I will paint at least 20 5x7 paintings, and probably more. My background is architectural design, and so many of the drawings and paintings are likely to be buildings and artifacts throughout St. Francis' homelands of Italy.I'm raising funds in order to share the month-long pilgrimage with paintings and messages, and I can't do it without you. Funds will go toward modest pilgrimage travel expenses, printing and postage, and probably a lot of band-aids and tylenol. Reward levels for backers will be: access to online updates which I promise will be interesting, hand-painted postcards mailed from the Way which I almost promise will be meaningful conversation pieces, and when we return, your choice of 5x7 prints from the Path, and a printed booklet of all the paintings with commentary.It would be great to have you along with us on the Way of St. Francis!","As with any travel, there's certainly a risk of something going wrong. The Way of St. Francis is hilly and sometimes rough going. I'm particularly gifted at getting lost, even with GPS. In any case, I'll still be painting and drawing where I am. As long as I can wield a pencil, I'll be drawing. As long as there's a glass of red wine, I'll have watercolor. Hey. Italy.I'll keep close track of the original postcards to see that they arrive to backers in a timely fashion. There will be an option to send them as postcards, with the authentic scuffs and stamps and inky cancellations that come with being mailed, or to be sent in an envelope to save them from potential damage. If one goes missing, I'll be sure to create another to replace it. If situations at home force us back to the Northwest, we may reschedule the trip, or shorten it, and we will keep you posted.Weather: Foul weather may drive us indoors. There are plenty of good drawings to be had indoors in Italy. We are from the Northwest, and if we waited for the rain to stop we'd never do anything at all.If I don't start the trip, your money will be refunded."

Even with the subsequent axing of Robot Wars again, we have not been deterred we will make the robot so that it falls under FRA (Fighting robots Association) guidelines. One way or another we will get this robot into an arena and watch it get smashed to bits, with onlookers thinking ""I wonder why they thought that was a good idea""After a few brain storming sessions the idea of a sphere robot, Grant was not sold on the idea as he could see more issues than solutions, but after a few drawings and 3d mock ups there was the very much needed eureka moment where we looked at the models and thought ""it. just . might work.""so if you had a look at the images you will have seen images a few things might have stood out to you, but if not let me explain the design.The sphere has two semi spheres which will be connectedto internal wheels which are in turn ran using small motors (type of motor is dependant on weight, RPM and torque needed) at the bottom of the sphere is a counterweight which helps keep the robot upright. on this are the battery which help keep them stable and keeps the center of gravity low to aid the stability of the bot.The weapon system is a circular saw style system where we have a ring bracket which is mounted off center so that the blades extrude out the front, back and top but is safely stored at the bottom so that it does not cut up the floor or interfere with the drive of the bot.Now like most weapon systems if its worth doing, its worth over doing, so if you have looked at the 3d models you may have noticed the big blob of an engine in the middle of the bot, no awards to anyone who guesses what that is for. For anyone who is confused let me explain, that is a 2 stroke engine which will run the weapon system. we wanted to do this mainly for style points rather than any practical reason. that being said there are many pros to using an petrol engine over an electric one, the cons are nonetheless apparent. Mainly weight, having to deal with exhausts and robustness i.e how well can it handle being knocked about.As you may have noticed we are not making this to be the best most deadly robot to ever grace the wars, we want to do this because its different and hard. there are problems we will need to over come but nothing of note was ever discovered by taking the easiest option!You never know we might take the competitions by storm and make it all the way!","As Said above we have many issues to overcome, including;•	Weight Limits,•	Heat Management,•	Fabrication, and•	Many other issues that we cannot begin to foresee.The good news is, we have help!

https://www.kickstarter.com/projects/chunbumpark/i-love-painting-beautiful-women?ref=discovery_category_newest,chunbumpark/i-love-painting-beautiful-women,"My goal is to create art that is original, experimental, uplifting, and beautiful. I want to get my art out there as much as possible beyond my small confinement, and try to become a successful artist. All I need is a small push to find success on a lifelong journey as an artist that I began several years ago. I would like to expose my art to the world and gather many fans, one person at a time.I am primarily occupied with exploring feminine beauty and aesthetics through various media and themes. I want to know what makes something beautiful or ugly, what makes something feminine or masculine, and want to challenge the common notions about beauty in art and illustration.As opposed to the rigidity and lesser qualities of the male figure, the female has harmony, beauty, and an attractive force more powerful than gravity or religious piety. The beauty of the female human figure is proof that our Universe is beautiful, complex, harmonious, and magical.I have developed two main body of works consisting of heavy impasto painting and  cubist-like linear abstraction that I call derivative. Both are highly experimental, and many people might not understand such works. I would like more people to understand such abstract and experimental works, than just appreciate very traditional forms of art.I believe I am part of a battleground for the modern abstract figurative movement that faces many challenges of having people to understand, accept, and recognize the limitless possibilities in experimentation with art, rather than rejecting everything except the very traditional and 20th century works. I hope to spread this understanding, acceptance, and support of experimental, avant-garde art among the public.Part of the donations will be spent to enter my works in exhibitions and competitions that may have been too intimidating to participate in due to entry fees and costs of shipping very large works over long distances.","I can't really think of a possibility that I would not be able to deliver the promises I made with regard to this project.I am an active and creative person, and I am confident that I can deliver on all the promises I made on this project.It is possible that my supporters and fans might become disenchanted with my experimental works in the future, as I keep pushing the boundaries of my styles, techniques, and subject matter. Some might find my works to be grotesque, ugly, silly, pointless, etc. Regardless of such issues that might arise, I will try to do my best to impress everyone involved.",https://www.kickstarter.com/projects/chunbumpark/my-paintings-are-about-female-beauty?ref=discovery_category_newest,chunbumpark/my-paintings-are-about-female-beauty,"I enjoy painting figuratively to express and put down to canvas what I observe about female beauty. I believe it is the female human form that is the pinnacle of creation via evolutionary design. It is existence of such wonderful forms that suggest our universe is beautiful rather than ugly and more filled than empty. I reject the idea of disregarding material satisfaction and worldly desires for one's own good. I believe that while such an endeavor can lead to greater well being and spirituality, the same can be achieved through material pursuit and achievement. Furthermore, I believe that material success, including culture and knowledge, is the only thing that can be passed down the generations to build a better world for the future. It is accumulation of wealth that has brought about, in part, greater equality and living standards in developed and developing countries. Countries and cultures that reject material pursuits have not enjoyed the same level of culture and standards of living as those that embraced it. It is for this same reason why I reject art that cannot be preserved and last generations. Art is meant to last. It is meant to be desired and have a wide impact across many generations.Thus it is my goal to fill this world with material achievement and beautiful objects, including images of beautiful things, including beautiful women. My depiction of the female goddesses is not simply a selfish indulgent objectification of real human beings. It is a celebration of a form that leaves impression of its image in the mind. And the image is ideal, flawless, and, in a way, spiritual, yet also material. It is ephemeral and hard to grasp. It is easily tarnished, delicately balanced, and difficult to discover.My art is a convention on female beauty and an earnest investigation into the beauty of the female human form. I want to embrace and incorporate features that people might consider ugly, and present them as beautiful within a uniquely different environment or personality. In recent times I've been particularly obsessed with aesthetics of Asian women. What makes something uniquely Asian and beautiful at the same time? There is an abundance of Asian artists painting Asian women with white features all the time (In Japanese manga for example). I think it's time to change that.In my art I try to be as unique and colorful as possible. Art is about being free, free from confinement of aesthetics set by others, free from technical standards compared by others, and free from jealousy by others. Art is not about boasting your technical proficiency or reinforcing your weaknesses. It is a free pursuit of subject and methods. It is free. It is madness with method to madness.I try to bring a unique touch in my art that no one else has. It is a statement I try to make that is new to the table and with fresh flavors and stories. Enjoy my art!My BehanceMy BlogMy Deviantart",I can't think of much difficulties to delivering on my promises as long as enough people pledge the amount for the prints so I can cost effectively produce and ship them.

After that I plan to pursue my dream of becoming a Spanish professor at an institute of higher education, specializing in the study of marginalized groups in society, with a strong focus on sexual themes in literature and cinema. While at first this information may seem completely unrelated, I promise it is relative to my Buffy book idea, for it was during the course of my undergraduate studies in Hispanic literature I found a theme I could truly connect to: the human experience. It seems obvious that a human would connect to stories of human experience, but what particularlyinterested me was the experience(s) of the masculine vs. the feminine, and those individuals of varying sexual orientations, found throughout literature of all cultures, during all time periods of history, written in all languages. Gender-based oppression, stereotypes, violence, etc. transcend the human experience, as seen through the meticulous allegorical rhetoric of Joss Whedon's narrative for the series.I'm also interested in the theme of sexual violence, and the media's portrayal of gender-based violence, in general. I took note of this interest when I observed how Latin American female filmmakers portray the female experience, and how this conflicted with Hollywood's mysogynistic perspective. This is why Buffy theVampire Slayer was and is such a profoundly groundbreaking television series. Joss Whedon challenged feminine ideals of sexuality, power, and fragility, in addition to exploring the personification of many different masculinities (i.e. Angel, Spike, Riley, Xander, Giles, Jonathan, Warren, etc). I've been a huge fan of the show for a long time, but it was only after my studies on themes in literature and gender that I began to really dissect, deconstruct, and appreciate so many of the aspects of Joss Whedon's story line for this series.If earned, I would use this money to fund my research and investigation in order to publish a book deconstructing the portrayals of feminine and masculine throughout the series, season by season, with a strong focus on character development. These representations occur in the realm of the ""Buffyverse"", or the allegory created by Joss Whedon to explore themes in reality via the occult. The funds would be utilized to purchase any needed print resource materials, should they not be available for loan at my local library, nor download via pdf. Additionally, funds will support any costs attributed to editing, printing, and publishing fees, as well as the rewards associated with pledged donations, of course. Depending on if I reach my goal or not, I would ideally like to purchase a new, more up-to-date laptop, something small and compact I can take along and write in any location, as well as an external hard drive to save research materials and my writing. I would honestly prefer to write on a typewriter, but alas, I can foresee myself wasting far too many sheets of paper (I edit a lot). Another last main thing the funds will contribute towards is my time to be able to research and write, and truly put as much effort and energy into this project as I want to.Now, you may be thinking, ""How does a book about Buffy apply to the larger masses of society?"" Good question! With all of the various incidents of sexual violence, whether on college campuses, in the military, in our entertainment industry, or right in our local towns, it is clear our society needs to reevaluate the expression of gender roles. I believe Joss Whedon did an excellent job representing human themes in an essentially non-human world. I also believe not enough people were fortunate to understand the series for what it was (I'm referring to non-fans), and if they did, maybe they would see how important the series was in a sociological perspective. This is not only for its strong female roles and well-executed allegories, but also for myriad reasons I plan to further delve into during the course of my research.Thanks for reading :)Alexandra***Sample Chapter Preview***I have always loved Buffy the Vampire Slayer, but I could never truly analyze it as much as it deserves to be until I took a women's/gender studies course during undergraduate. I posted a lengthy thread about Buffy in a discussion topic, and then I thought to myself, ""I could write a book about how groundbreaking that show is for female characters, as well as important societal issues/topics!"" All are addressed via the allegory of ""The Buffy-verse"", or the world of witches, vampires, ghouls, demons, etc. in which Buffy and the rest of the Scooby gang are apart of.  However, when watching the show it is obvious that this world of fantasy is utilized as a vehicle to represent and start a conversation about specific realities. On the surface, Buffy was a revolutionary television show based on the casting; it was one of the first successful TV shows to star multiple lead female roles. Concurrently the show was not lacking in strong male characters.  I believe these male characters were strong due to their encompassing of the 4 masculinities (identified by sociologist, Patricia Connell) at various points in the show.  We see Xander transform from a timid friend into a brave hero.  Giles fits the hegemonic characterization culturally speaking (British, older, white male, intellectual), yet due to his role as a librarian and watcher, the non-physical “slayer”, he is sometimes marginalized, especially by demons like Angel (when he loses his soul…again). Willow was also one of the first openly gay female characters on television.  Joss Whedon had to fight networks to allow him to show same-sex couples embracing or kissing. I'm so glad he did, because it is refreshing and empowering to watch Willow's process of sexual discovery, first being frustrated/jealous with her friendship to Xander, then eventually dating Tara, a girl she bonds with via her magical powers.  Magic is the vehicle for many of Willow’s struggles.There of course is the primary allegory of Buffy and Angel; this is most clear after the first time they have sex.  The humiliation and deceit Buffy feels after Angel completely changes after they make love is similar to how some girls who lose their virginity to older boys/men feel.  Additionally, one of my favorite episodes, albeit it is disturbing, is the episode where two ""nerds"" in the high school create a female robot to do with what they please. Buffy makes a direct comment how that was rape, and this episode is not the only instance alluding to sexual violence.  There is another episode highlighting the prevalence of group sexual violence and misogynyamong college fraternies.  There are too many great examples of groundbreaking gender-related episodes to include in this preview. Buffy is such a strong and inspiring character. She patrols cemeteries alone on a nightly basis, unafraid of  what lingers ahead in the darkness. She knows that having a serious monogamous relationship will be difficult, given her ""line of work"", but that does not stop her from pursuing what she's meant to do, much like many women in the real world.","I guess the only risk would be if someone were to steal my brilliant idea for a book! Haha A potential risk could be not correctly estimating costs of printing/publishing, as I have never written or published a book before! I do love to write, and am passionate and driven to investigate the subject, so I have no fears in being able to finish.

I would like to debut it when I vend at Moving to End Sexual Assault's (M.E.S.A.)'s 15th Annual Canine Classic 5k Walk/Run, coming up in Boulder, CO on Sunday, April 26. My goal is to create a whole new collection of bracelets and accessories made purely with locally-crafted beads from Boulder shoppes. The Canine Classic event is one of many events in April for Sexual Assault Awareness Month.[*Note: None of the vendor booth proceeds are donated to the charity, only the fees walkers pay to enter, vendors pay for booths, and sponsors pay for advertising.*]I'm interested in purchasing beads from local Boulder bead shoppes specifically for this event, i.e. Nomad Bead Shop, & other antique and unique jewelry/bead stores on Pearl Street Mall. Additionally, I would love to purchase some unique, one-of-a-kind glass beads from local glass artists, since there are so many wonderful ones here in Boulder! These high-quality and unique lampwork and glassblown beads are a bit pricier, but very worth it for quality handmade products made with local materials. One of my goals is to promote female glass artists and the beautiful glass beads they are creating. I also would like to purchase some new jewelry display arms, a small printed sign, and of course doggy treats! All of the materials and items I purchase will be locally made or sold. Even if I do not end up debuting this ""Made in Boulder"" collection at the Canine Classic, my funding is primarily for the creation of this new line, and to promote local artists and local businesses! In the end, my ultimate goal is not to generate funds for the vending event, but to generate funds to create a brand-new Spring collection, 100% crafted, created, & designed in Boulder! I would love for my jewelry designs to become a part of the amazing local art community here. :)https://www.facebook.com/AlexandraMillerDesignsInstagram: @AlexandraMillerDesigns /Twitter: @A_MillerDesignsEmail: AlexandraMillerDesigns@gmail.comHere is M.E.S.A.'s 15th Annual Canine Classic Facebook event page for more information!  https://www.facebook.com/events/866751163383585/ Here is M.E.S.A.'s website for more information on their nonprofit organization and the myriad services they offer to sexual assault survivors and friends/family of survivors: http://www.movingtoendsexualassault.org/ You can enter the walk with or without a dog!

You are trapped on a cave, your goal is to escape finding parts of the cave's map. This map has been written by a bunch of philosophers, so it will be more than a map.Riddles, traps and labyrinths based on the Philosophy of the most intelligent people on Earth, will make you learn about them a lot more than ever before.You will have to walk and search on every place on the cave and find the secret codes to unlock the grottoes which contain a different philosopher.

On this dream, I experienced lifes at different ages of history, and the deaths as well. Seeing such despair at that dream, all my psyche had a crisis, a lot of questions came to my mind to perturb my idylls and my hopes forever.When I finally got a way to scape the wild beasts in my mind, and I finally woke up, my insecurities had grown and evolved. Now every thing which had bothered me before was just a big triviality, and death was a common thought, as I realized the existence of anguish like the vertigo of my free will. Million noemas were at my head, but a lot more information was needed to complete them. So I took a book and started reading. My first choice to solve this philosophical questions was “Metaphysics” by Aristotle, and it wasn’t a easy going start. Confusing new words, rhetoric concepts, and messed perspectives, mystified my search for answers. But I wasn’t going to stop on my odyssey for knowledge, so trying to read this books became a habit, then reading them became a necessity for me. Socrates phrases told me how to live, Sigmund Freud explained the fetishes every human has, Aristotle show me what were virtues.After reading and reading, I really was living a life worth living, because reading opened my mind and made me a philosopher. Without those books I’m not quite sure how I would have gone then: raving; the murder of the father; idiocy; drab hopelessness, who knows. There weren’t a lot of people interested in that kind of topics, I’m sure they fear the well-written words that appeared with gentleness and reasonableness in the best and most interesting literature. Before, I also would have feared this ideas, but now, my daily basis is reading and doubting about everything.With Philosophy, we are not only talking about the ways of thinking, but also the ways of being happy, or even the ways to be a better citizen.Just a glimpse on the thoughts of the most intelligent philosphers could help you see others things you've never seen before. It dosen't matter your religion, it is undoubtable how big of an impact Philosophy can have.If we talk more precisely and basing us on the content on the game, we have philosophers as the Presocratics, they are the ones who existed before Socrates and, also, they were the first to reject ideas imposed by the greeks and started doubting. For surprising as it sounds, some of them believed that water was the origin of everything, others believed it was fire and so on.How and why they believed this? Learn it with our game which offers an inmersive experience. Also we have Plato, Aristotle, Socrates, all of them having as focus to know more about how to live, even about the mysteries sorrounding the human ethics and moralities.With all that knowledge, who could stop you?We also know how hard could be to read one of these books, so on this game we are willing to teach about Philosophy on a interactive way.With the funds we colect, we are going to introduce the game to a new level.We' re going to enhance the graphics, develop new levels and always been there to teach Philosophy.

We are nothing if we do not lend a hand and give back. It is a must. It is our duty. I am a big believer in that.",In order to get an event like this together funds need to be raised to purchase the items that we want to give away and provide at the event. The funds raised also allow us the opportunity to not have to charge at the door which allows those who are having hard times to come to the event. The challenge I face is being able to pull these events off without donations from kind souls other than myself.
https://www.kickstarter.com/projects/222948947/wine-inspired-candles?ref=discovery_category_newest,222948947/wine-inspired-candles,"I have three passions: wine, upcycling, and candles. I decided to combine our three passions and create Wicks & Spirits.  Wicks & Spirits is a family-owned business located in Southern Maryland. I hand clean, de-label, cut, and polish bottles that were donated by family, friends, and local businesses. We fill our candles with 100 Eco Soya Wax. I also design and create my own labeling and packaging.Since our inception in November 2017, we participated in over 5 events (Holiday Craft Fairs and Bazaars) and did very well with visibility and sales. I sold out during two events.I seek funds that allow me to move from craft fairs to Wine & Spirit Festivals. The vendors fees are much more. Participating in these festivals will help us reach our target audience. Some of these festivals bring in over 10,000 spectators. If we participate in at least 5 festivals in 2018 it will help us become a more sustainable company. The money will be used for securing our booth space and purchasing a tent for outdoor events and signage. Also allows us to giveaway wax melt samples.We already have at least 10 festivals identified including the National Cherry Blossom Wine Festival in Washington, DC.In addition, we have been selected to sell our products in a local boutique. So we need funds to meet the owner's deadline to get our stuff up and running.Here is a list of our current scents:Apples and Maple Bourbon -A fall favorite that is a twist on the traditional apple fragrance. We start with fresh apples and blend in a touch of vanilla, maple, and a punch of smooth bourbon.Banana Boat -This banana with coconut and mango is as fun scent.Black Cherry Cabernet -You will love our version of this addictive blend of dark cherry, black raspberry and sumptuous Cabernet.

A full-bodied wine with good varietal character and power, it offers rich cherry flavors with excellent balance and a long finish.Cranberry Citrus Swizzle -Sweet orange and zesty lemon peel are perfectly balanced with tangy cranberry in this bright fruity blend. Hints of green enhance the natural sensation as the warmth of wood and spice enriches the texture of the berry accord. A final touch of vanilla musk finishes the fruit creation.

","The challenge is being able to meet deadlines to participate in Wine and Spirit Festivals and to get our products in a local boutique. If we don't get backers we will work very hard to sale products to reach our goals, we will work day and night to promote and sell to raise capital. Another, challenge is that I lost my job over a year ago and have been unsuccessful obtaining employment (35 job interviews later). I decided to create my own opportunity.  So, I don't have the security of using my 9 to 5 to help secure booth space. But I am dedicated to this vision.

My name is Stefanie and I am the owner and founder of Wicks & Spirits. About a year ago, I lost my employment. I had gone on several job interviews (approximately 55) with no luck. My friends and family would bring me bottles of wine to cheer me up. I started to notice uniqueness and details in some bottles that I started to save a few. Trying to keep myself busy and focused while unemployed (began Substitute Teaching), I started to see what I can do with these bottles as a hobby. I have always been an repurposer/upcycler. I have always been a candle lover and anything that made my house smell good.  Months later, Wicks & Spirits was born. When you have a glass of your favorite wine or spirit, add a candle from Maryland-based Wick & Spirits to your home décor. The exclusive collection of scents was crafted to gratify and extend happy hour past an hour. From the nuances of plums, apples, red raspberries and strawberries in Merlot to the wild grapes with strawberries in Cabernet Sauvignon, each 100% soy candle is poured into a repurposed wine bottle that was donated by family, friends, neighbors, and local wineries. Wicks & Spirits has wide range wine and spirit-inspired  candles and other home fragrance products. Wine and spirit lovers everywhere will love lighting these wood wicked candles, with no calories, no hangovers, no guilt. Our motto ""Why Limit Happy to an Hour!""

Most people discard their empty bottles. Hundreds of bottles go unrecycled daily. We partnered with family, friends, and local wineries to ""save"" empty bottles, which we later transform into 100% soy candles. We pride ourselves for being a socially and environmentally conscious company.Most candles contain chemical components that are harmful not only to yourself, but also to the environment. Wicks & Spirits ensures you can enjoy burning your candle safely and cleanly.Our products are:CHARDONNAY WINE A fabulous white wine bouquet with top notes of white grapes, bergamot and pineapple.

Juried events have a selection committee and require that you submit slides or photos of your work or products. The selection committee (the jury) reviews all applications before choosing exhibitors for the event. It is a very rewarding experience when you are selected. With your help we can: 1.	Participate fully in these events, which would allow us to showcase our recycled, repurposed wine and spirit bottles. 2.	Continue to do our part in preserving the environment with our recycle bottle program.","Our products are handcrafted upcycled / repurposed candles. We cut each bottle by hand then we hand polish them to smooth the rim. Although, each piece we produce receives the same amount of love and attention, some bevels, heights and imperfections may exist and cause the bottles to crack during the production process.We are preparing our bottles for display at an upcoming Festival called Made In Maryland.  Made In Maryland Festival celebrates all the unique offerings of our marvelous state while also supporting local entrepreneurship. It is a true honor for us. We are in crunch time to get ready for this event scheduled for May 6th. We need more inventory that is why we seek your support. This is our only challenge at this time."

I directed a short excerpt of Crave for my Final directing assignment and the reception was very good. So we as a company decided that it would be a good idea to put on the whole show.

This is where THE CIRQUE came into being. It will be a night of feasts. Not only for the eyes but also the senses as there will be a dinner course being served during the performance. In addition to the we have created the MAIN EVENT. It is the mysterious show with in the show. There will be a limited number of people who will be allowed into the show that will last approximately 5 to 10 minuets. This is something that has not been tried before. With your help we can blend Immersive Theatre and Dinner Theatre into a new and fantastic art form.We need funding for the show. So that we can bring the spectacle of the circus to the people of Canterbury.The brake down of the money goes like this:Costumes. £20 this may change as this is from our initial figures Marketing: £150Make up: £60Wages: £400Misc: £400This is the basic brake down of the budget we know it is more that we are asking for but we are getting funding from elsewhere.Other Ways You Can HelpWe at LTC understand that not everyone can contribute but you can still help by talking about it with your friends and sharing it on all of the social media that you have. Thank you for getting this far. ,One of the biggest risks we face as a new company is legitimacy in the art world but we feel that this show will help us do that. Other risks that we face are that of time constraints and commitment from performers. I personally (Langdon) have done a number of shows in which I have had people drop out at the last minuet and I have had to adapt to it. The show itself went off really well and was widely accepted by audiences.

A Short, Silent Film To Be Shot Entirely In Albuquerque, New Mexico. I Plan For This Film To Bring Awareness To The Homeless Issues Surrounding Albuquerque, The Stray Pet Population/Kill Shelters As Well As National Concerns Regarding Mexican Immigration And Healthcare Costs. I Also Plan To Film In A Controversial Area Of The City Called ""Tent City,"" Located Near Downtown.There Will Not Be Many Actors Involved, Only A Handful To Be Precise. The Top Billing Will Be My Nephew, Alexander Matthew Lopez. The Supporting Cast Includes My Niece, Mia Helena Rivera And My Dog Guapo, As Well As My Brother As The Dog Catcher And Myself As The Immigration Officer. The Extras Will Consist Of Various Family Members And Friends. The Film Will Be Made Up Of Highly Composed Shots And Documentarian Shots Of Real Homeless And Panhandlers Throughout The City. I Own All Equipment And Will Be In Charge Of All Aspects Of Production With The Assistance Of Others Involved. I Have Plenty Of Free Time And Am Very Eager To Push Myself Past My Limits To Complete A Polished Piece Of Cinema To Submit To The More Well-Known Festivals And Circuits Nationwide. I Want To Reach Academy Award Caliber Filmmaking And Recognition. What I Lack In Initial Experience, I Know I Am More Than Capable Of Accomplishing.If This Reaches Said Festivals And Recognition, I Would Like To Donate Proceeds To Homeless And Animal Shelter Programs In The Greater Albuquerque Area. With The Funds Raised Through Your Generous Assistance, I Will Buy A Variety Of Necessary Lenses, Audio Recording And Lighting Equipment To Complete The Film Amidst The Shooting Schedule. Post Production Will Be Handled In My Office That Is Complete With Final Cut Studio. I Promise You Will Not Regret This Opportunity As The Film Is Aimed For A Greater Cause Than Sheer Entertainment Or Fame, It's To Bring Much Needed Awareness To These Issues In Our Country, And My Home State.

Star Wars: Episode 6.8- Search For Skywalker will follow Kylo Ren as he searches for his former mentor. Kylo himself is making a documentary of his search for the Jedi master. This journey will showcase his inner struggle between the light side and dark side of the force. Kylo possesses a makeshift map that he must piece together to discover the whereabouts of Skywalker. His film will delve into an existential self-discovery and satirize the artistic techniques of the filmmaking process and the rules of the contest itself as well as the foundations of the force. Comedy will be the primary tone of the short production as Kylo Ren is the face behind and in-front of the lens and utilizes his force powers to hijack the film as never seen before.","This film has the potential to simply miss the entry deadline of April 24th at 11:59 P.M. Since the shooting schedule and post production timeline are short and ticking by every second, any hiccup could derail the completion of the film or damage the pacing and tone intended from the start. However, through sharp direction and a concise idea/production, any immediate issues can be solved with improvisation while shooting and editing due to its short running time. I will aim to overshoot the 5 minute window so as to have more footage to edit and peel away for a better product if majority of the video does not fit the overall tone and plot."

My name is Rowan Lake Jr. I'm an average family man with a hobby for tinkering. I've been tinkering for about seven years now and never really thought about turning my hobby into something more. The idea originally came to me when I was a kid. I used to ask myself, while watching Power Rangers, what if the morphers could tell time? As I grew older, that same question would haunt me. Finally, I decided to take action and test out that theory.I started off with a simple modification and it got a lot of positive attention from people. Since then, I continued experimenting and modifying, until Altervice was born. What exactly is Altervice? To put it simply: stylish power banks/wireless chargers combined with another device to create a more useful device. In today's society, almost everyone has some kind of electronic device. To keep these devices from dying out while you are on the go, the power bank was created. However, not all power banks (and wireless chargers) are created equal, whether in size and shape. Let's face it: not everyone likes carrying a power bank in their back pocket. Altervice takes what we love about power banks/wireless chargers and improves upon the overall design, shape, and sturdiness by making them more useful to the everyday person.Imagine having a power bank/wireless charger that could tell time, become an mp3 player, etc. The possibilities are endless!","Let me be honest: I'm not an engineer. I have basic engineering skills and each Altervice I've come up with have at least a year's worth of research and field testing.

Soon after, my parents helped me achieve one of the goals for this project: a ""patent pending"" status, allowing me time to create a better product (please see Altervice Update and Altervice Commercial videoes for further details), hone my skills, and even market the product to customers, who wanted their own copy of it.

Altervice 02: Pretty Sammi, a compact cosmetic case mirror with built-in wireless charger, is also available for sale too (see pictures below).If successfully funded, I will use the money to purchase the materials I need to mass produce Altervice Wingman. I have already sold a few since I patented Altervice last October. Did I mention I also color and design the Altervice too? The pictures below are an example of one I recently did for a customer, as well pictures of Altervice 02: Pretty Sammi.","I'm not an engineer, nor an electrician. Again, I have spent 7+ years honing my skills and spend quality time on each and every design I create, under the Altervice name."

The screenplay is completed and the actors are ready and prepared to make fools of themselves! The only thing missing is a little bit of money to buy some essential items and to fund the actual filming itself.The series idea is based on a group of friends travelling to Switzerland to go climbing. The thing is, they're not very good at it. All they end up doing is annoying the other climbers, drinking far too much Schnapps and taking the mick out of each other! It's all jolly good fun!Filming will need to take place up in Wintery Scotland so the main cost is to get up there along with the actors and equipment. Then it will all need to be edited to look the part.",The main challenge will be making sure that the episode is filmed in one go. Because travel is involved we can not simply go back and do it again.

It's a mountain party all the way! The pilot episode sees our bunch of misfits arrive on the mountain and immediately start to annoy everyone.

Second, after the completed pilot, generate further interest and funding to film further episodes.

For our most recent episodes, we switched from the laptop webcam we were using to a portable video camera to further support the video's quality.We're very excited about the show but still think there's a lot we can do more to make our videos more entertaining - this would include strengthening our video quality by purchasing some key equipment that professional videomakers usually use: a wireless clip-on microphone for Spencer, our host, a tripod for our video camera, a green screen/software package to do fake weather reports, etc. Additionally, we'd really like to purchase a few dress shirts so that we can look somewhat professional on the air.With this project, we hope to shed some light on what it truly means to be a present-day college student by intertwining new campus happenings with topics such as college hygiene, campus food/dining, campus infrastructure, and the sometimes opposing views between students and administrators, jocks and nerds.

My name is Chris Stubenrauch and I'm a 22-year old poet born on Long Island, New York.I started writing poetry in high school and have self-published three poetry anthologies of about 40 poems each with Lulu.com since 2014.Most recently, I have taken my writing to Instagram, joining the likes of other ""Instapoets"" like Rupi Kaur, Tyler Knott Gregson, and ""Atticus"" that hope to share their words with the world.This July 2017, I self-published my third and most recent full poetry book Shades of Blue, and while I enjoyed my best sales to-date as an author (due to constant posting on social media as well as a Goodreads Giveaway), sales stopped in August as I did not have the financial means to support a full advertising campaign.Over the next few months, I looked to use some of the poems I did not work into Shades of Blue to design a new, travel-sized, poetry chapbook (less than 30 pages); an affordable alternative for my friends, family, and fans on Instagram who were hesitant about buying poetry. With the help of Amazon's CreateSpace Independent Publishing Platform, The Poetry of Village Idiots was born, a 28 page, 17-poem chapbook that discusses the human condition in a fairly plain and simple way.I believe that one of the reasons why ""Instapoets"" have risen to fame is because of the share-ability (length) of their work. At the moment, I'm beginning to achieve my first success in reaching my first fairly large audience on Instagram, and I'd like to think that real people would pick up my chapbook if I could deliver something meaningful (but SHORT!) to them for under $7.I am asking for $399 to help fund advertising campaigns for my new poetry book The Poetry of Village Idiots on both the Instagram and Goodreads platforms so that I could advertise my chapbook to prospective reader and grow my page to perhaps reach a larger audience.Depending on the success of this Kickstarter, I am also hoping to be able to participate in a digital Goodreads Giveaway where I will release 100 free copies of the book in Kindle format to readers on Goodreads to help start a word-of-mouth process.Ultimately, I have found that poets' real successes have come from the simple word-of-mouth recommendation, and I believe that my book's affordability could be a reason for anyone to give it a try.Check out more of my poetry on my Hello Poetry page and also on my Instagram page...if you do enough searching, you might find the whole book scattered all over the Internet!","As the book is finalized, published, and already for sale on most of the major publishing platforms, there is little to no risk involved with this project. As is the case with most Kickstarters, the final amount of money raised will be the determining factor in how much advertising can be applied to the book and which advertising campaigns (Instagram Advertising, Goodreads Advertising, Goodreads Giveaway) can or cannot happen.All backers will receive a digital or paperback version of The Poetry of Village Idiots with digital copies being sent to a provided email address and paperback copies being sent to the provided mailing address."

https://www.kickstarter.com/projects/348828721/art-under-pressure?ref=discovery_category_newest,348828721/art-under-pressure,"As Purplecat Creatives, I've been creating sculptures since 2007. It's always an adventure learning new techniques with each project and offering them up for sale to collectors who've been kind enough to support my continued work.Sadly though, I'm at a point where what I can produce is limited by moldmaking and casting equipment.  To get a sculpture through the production process, it is necessary to have casting methods capable of accurately reproducing the work. I sculpt with casting limitations in mind, keeping to detailwork I know can cast although now and then I'd create a sculpture simply for the joy of creating and it would be shelved as nonproduction due to lack of necessary equipment to go further. I'd rather shelve a piece than send out shoddy, low quality copies. When a completed piece gets mailed out to a customer, I know they're receiving the idea as it's meant to be experienced, because I take the sculpture through every step of the process.Any time an art piece is purchased from Purplecat Creatives, the customer knows I sculpted the piece, created the mold, casted it, cleaned each casting of flaws til it matched the original, painted, photoed, sold and shipped it to them.   Casting and cleaning may be just a couple steps in the middle of this process, but they're hugely important ones. Smaller, simpler composition sculptures it can be done with unpressurized sock mold method.  I've used this method for the past several years and it functions well for small scale work. However, larger pieces detailed with feathers, overhangs, fine fur textures or delicate detail lines become a problem. Pressure casting solves this by applying pressure, forcing air bubbles in the casting medium to the pour surface where they disperse, or can be sanded off with a power sander (don't worry, there's a footing overpour added to a sculpture before the mold is made so this isn't sanding away portions of the artwork).Here are a couple of panels showing a few pieces which need the 'Art Under Pressure' project to meet production:As you see, there are several sculptures which I'd truly love to see produced and offered to my customers. Some of which have sadly have been shelved for months or even years. Some were not castable due to fine details catching bubbles in the casting process, leaving sizable areas for recarving, which is impossible to do in a timely manner, and doesn't reproduce the original piece in exact form. Taller pieces were often shelved due to overhangs being unreachable by my current brush method of discouraging detail bubbles.  Sometimes even small pieces get shelved due to their details being so fine that it couldn't be matched with recarving.  I remember the first time I had to shelve a small piece for that reason.  I was sad and angry at the same time.  Sad, because it was my best work at the time and I couldn't produce it to share, and angry....because I had to limit putting more detail into work for fear of shelving.  It felt like I was cutting the quality of my sculpting for the ability to reproduce it.  The equipment we need will make it possible to create larger sculptures, with higher detail and open up the doors to creating even better work in the future, even with my smaller works.  There'll be no limit on scale textures, feathers or fur. For example, I have a teeny tiny snake sculpture which has never been producable in the past because his scalework is notorious for catching any bubbles in the gypsum, and the detail of his scales is so fine it simply can't be recarved to match, so even a single bubble means the casting has to be tossed out.  We tried for months, and out of every ten cast, I would get one viable casting suitable for painting.  To this day, only three of those tiny snakes have been produced.  Pressure casting would make casting this little fellow a breeze.We're hoping for your help to purchase a pressure chamber, accompanying compressor and enough Moldmax silicone rubber to start creating pressure capable molds. Unfortunately pressure chambers are expensive, especially those capable of pressurizing more than one sculpture at a time. The model we're looking at will be able to hold between three and six sculptures at once depending on sculpture size. These would open up an entire new world of things I could create, and allow me more freedom in the sculpting process, thereby offering even better and more exciting art to you.  Part of the joy of sculpting is sharing it with others.  Art is meant to be shared, appreciated and experienced. Please help me get some of my beloved older sculptures finally into production, and open up the doors for making even better things in the years to come! ","As with any project, there are some risks.  Due to this, the first pieces I plan on working with are sculptures which might have been produced successfully in the past via our old pour method, but were discontinued or produced in extremely small quantities due to detail loss, or high waste numbers (meaning large numbers of poor quality castings).   High waste numbers meant we might get one or two good castings, but we'd often have to throw away twice as many which were missing broad swaths of detail work which couldn't be reworked in the casting medium.  These sculptures are in the category our benefactors will be receiving as a special thank you for making this project possible.   I chose them because I have created molds in the past with our old method and I am confident they are likely to survive pressure casting successfully. They are also pieces that have had at least a couple successful castings painted so you can get a better idea of the finished product.  I also know where their tricky bits are and this makes them a safer choice than a totally untried sculpture which  might have unknown tricks up its sleeve.",https://www.kickstarter.com/projects/348828721/clockwork-bird-casting-project?ref=discovery_category_newest,348828721/clockwork-bird-casting-project,"Earlier this year I tried Kickstarter for the very first time, and although my first project failed, it was a wonderful experience.  That experience helped me decide how to move forward, and shortly afterward I partnered with a resin casting studio to continue producing my work (she's awesome by the way, and I'm so glad we're working together).  So, trying not to be overly wordy....this Kickstarter project's focus is to cover the moldmaking fees required to produce the Clockwork Bird sculpture, as well as pay for the initial casting run. Our first run of castings will only be a run of ten, but if this project overshoots our funding goal, I'd love to cast more.Our goal is $400.  The breakdown of how that will be used is as follows:$150 (cost for mold)$150 (10 castings at $15 apiece)$ 50 (shipping to and from resin caster)$ 50 (kickstarter, amazon, and misc fees)---------$400  Total needed for Clockwork Bird Production. A little backstory on this particular sculpture.  The clockwork sparrow/bird is a very special piece for me.  Purplecat Creatives' logo today is a gear surrounded by the outline of a cat, which all started 5 years ago when I sculpted a clockwork sparrow and fell in love with the steampunk genre.  Our logo changed around the same time period, to reflect that enjoyment.  This past month I decided to celebrate 5 years of art with revisiting that concept, and sculpting a new clockwork bird.  I had found the original had broken, and I was curious to see how I'd grown in the past five years artistically.   Check out the side by side pics:The 2014 version is the one this project is focused on.  The old version, as I mentioned before, is broken in places and permanently retired (very few were made of the 2009 version, a dozen at most).OK, on to our thank you rewards. ~~$1~~Every dollar counts.  If you donate a single dollar, I may not be able to send you anything in the mail, but I'm still very very grateful.  A HUGE thank you for supporting my art, it means a TON.~~$25~~An trio of owl magnets delivered in a thank you card, because you're very awesome to help.  Each magnet depicts sketches and paintings that are also my work, and I hope they brighten your office or fridge and remind you how grateful I am.  :)~~$50~~If you donate $50 or more, you'll also be receiving the owl trio pictured above, but I'll also be hand sculpting you a small rose as a special thank you.  Each will also be painted individually, and I'll be asking for your favorite color so I can make it extra special.  Each rose is unique, but here's some images of small roses done in the past by me:","There really isn't much risk with this project.   This is not my first sculpture, nor is it my first transaction with Mountain View Studios.   If the resin casting studio is horribly busy, there might be an extra week or so added to wait time for anyone expecting to purchase a clockwork bird, but that's it in terms of risk."

The company teaches children of all ages and then puts them on stage to act with professional and semi professional actors in a real, choreographed theatrical play primarily done for the parents and guests of the children in a major theater.  Our first production was Pinokio (Pinocchio) also done in Polish and was a huge success. Unfortunately, costs are high to put on performances with children when you incorporate paid actors and major theaters and talented production designers. The small sum won't cover the entire production costs but since we only found out about Kickstarter just yesterday, we're hoping for any amount of small success which couldhelp the children to grow in confidence on stage and in life.Our motto -Move, teach, provoke, and entertainBelow is a short video describing the details of the show in Polish.http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=liuDxHbQXFU&feature=youtu.be","Producing a play in a major setting with paid cast and crew is a costly venture.  Now add the children, their costumes, their classes and the time it takes to direct and coordinate with the actors and the children's parents to put on a major production for all to see!  It's hard to imagine all the sleepless nights one incurs.  Ms. Modjeska has years of experience putting on shows from Pinokio to The Bench and has assisted in many others with a variety of productions.",https://www.kickstarter.com/projects/752490372/the-wedding?ref=discovery_category_newest,752490372/the-wedding,"On behalf of Theater Scene Polonia, I havethe honor of inviting you to participate in the next project of our ensemble!On March 29, 2015, Theater Polonia Stage will present an outstanding work ofpolish literature, The Wedding, by Stanislaw Wyspianski. Due to its various themes, subject matter,rhythm and impact on Polish society The Wedding has gained the title ofThe Polish National Drama. Regardless of time, the work continues to push Polesto reflect on their idea of Polish nationalism, and begs the question; what isthe true essence of a Pole? Audiencemembers will be captivated by both the symbolic/fantastical layers and thesocial/realism themes bring to light the virtues and the vices of our nation. TheWedding will always remain a classic work of Polish literature, and so itis our hope to bring it to the Chicago Polonia.  However,without the financial support of companies and individuals, our hope of puttingon this wonderful piece of theater remains only in the realms of hopes anddreams. And so, we turn to you to help make our dream a reality.Sincerely, Kinga Modjeska","Producing a theater performance is a costly venture. Vehicle rental costs for equipment, insurance, cast and crew salaries, set costs and costumes, etc. In our short two year existence, we have raised the bar for theater excellence in the Polish community. We make no apologies for our passion in the theatrical arts and the public interest in our company proves that. It takes a lot of hard work, otherwise known as blood, sweat, tears and finances to invest in your passion. Sometimes though, a little assistance from like minded venturers goes a long way. Together, we can face this challenge head on and bring our show to fruition. There is no greater joy than to perform for all the smiling faces. Afterall, they are much of the reason for our existence!Ms. Modjeska has years of experience putting on shows from Pinokio and The Bench to her most recent, highly successful performance of Alice In Wonderland and has assisted in many others with a variety of productions."

I usually printed them at home since it was just a few, and my friends always enjoyed them. Receiving a postcard has a special feel to it.The reason I am starting this project is because I want to get more people in the anime community to send postcards to their friends!!!Here are some of the photos I have ready:I will be creating more photos, for a total of 5 Halloween, and 5 Christmas Cards, and I will be including characters from other series!I will be posting the photos as updates during the coming weeks.The postcards that I will be creating will be professionally printed in 6""x4"" format, with blank envelopes included, ready to ship to your friends!!","I have considered and preempted a few situations that could pose a risk to this project.I believe the biggest possible risk would be problems with the company that is doing the printing, if they were to be late with the prints, or any other problems that would make them unable to deliver the prints to me.For this, I have done the research and have different options ready to do the printing, and have allowed enough time to receive the prints in time even if there's problems with the original printing option.Other than that, I feel everything is pretty straight forward and should work out fine as there are not many parties involved in the production and the process is quite simple and everything is scheduled so that backers can have their postcards in their hands by the 2nd week of October or before that date."
