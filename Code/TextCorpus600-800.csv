I'm AntoineMatuttis - A young filmmaker from Germany with the dream of bringing""Alexa Blitz"" to life.The screenplay for the show has been written by me. So far I havewritten and directed four short films. You can find them on my website: „antoinematuttis.com“.I gathered a small passionate team around me. We are allcommitted to making this series!Behind this project there is no financial interest. That´s why noneof us are getting paid to work on this show. Nevertheless we need your help to cover the production costs.Usually a project like this would cost a lot more, but we are trying our best to find creative solutions to the problems ahead of us.At the current state we have organized most of the crew members, actors and locations. We also have a finished screenplay and a clear plan. The remaining details will be taken care of in the following weeks until we start shooting by the end of september and end our shoot in october this year. Post production will take another year or so, as weare trying to unleash the full potential of the story.You can witness our journey in our exclusive Facebook-group that you can join by donating.To make this series happen, we need money to pay for insurance, transportation, shooting permits, accommodation, costume & makeup, equipment, catering, marketing materials and so on...What we need the money for:+ Additional fees for Kickstarter, Credit Card transactions and taxesWITH YOUR HELP WE COULD EVEN TURN THE FIRST EPISODE INTO A WHOLE MOVIE WITH A RUNTIME OF ABOUT 90 MINUTES!THAT'S WHY SOME OF THE ACTORS ARE TALKING ABOUT THE ""ALEXA BLITZ"" MOVIE IN THE FOLLOWING VIDEOS...","With every film/video there are risks and challenges that one has to overcome.In this case our biggest challenge will be to maintain good quality under the time pressure we are going to face on set. Another challenge will be to create an environment where everyone can give his/her best! But those are challenges we have experience with and are willing to deal with.There are of course some risks with certain scenes, because they might not turn out as well as they seem on paper, due to limitations we might be facing on set or errors in the organization of the shoot.

Seitdem haben die Halluzinationen aufgehört.Auch wenn Wendy ihre Medikamente braucht, hasst sie diese über alles, da unter anderem auch schwere Kopfschmerzen bereiten.Nun soll sie aber wieder ins echte Leben zurück finden. Ihr allein erziehender Vater meint, es sei zu Beginn eine gute Idee erst einmal dem Stress und Trubel der Großstadt, in der sie leben, zu entkommen und ein paar ruhige Wochen mit ihren Großeltern auf dem Land zu verbringen.Als Wendy schließlich in dem idyllischen Haus ihrer Großeltern unterkommt, merkt sie aber schnell, dass ihre Großeltern sie unangenehm oft darauf hinweisen, ihre Medizin zu nehmen.Da Wendy diese ohnehin schon hasst, beschließt sie mit der Zeit heimlich ihre Pillen nicht mehr hinunterzuschlucken, sondern unter der Zunge zu verstecken und später auszuspucken.Anfangs läuft auch alles gut, aber mit der Zeit beginnt sie seltsame Dinge zu sehen. Zunächst harmlos, werden ihre Halluzinationen zu schrecklichen Fantasien, die sie ihrer eigenen Familie und vor allem ihren eigenen Großeltern misstrauen lassen.Aber wie sich herausstellt, scheinen einige ihrer Halluzinationen ihr auch neue Wahrheiten über die Dinge im Leben zu zeigen, die sie nie zuvor in Frage gestellt hat…Antoine's letzte deutschsprachige Kurzfilme:","Falls es Probleme mit der vorhandenen Technik oder dem Wetter geben sollte, könnte es sein, dass unser Film kürzer wird als geplant, oder wir einige Szenen nachdrehen müssen."
https://www.kickstarter.com/projects/kaetzel/fallen-5?ref=discovery_category_newest,kaetzel/fallen-5,"The Bible is considered by many to be theauthoritative work of good and evil. From it we can learn the very nature of goodness and of God, yet very few of its verses talk about Lucifer, the name linked with evil. Perceptions of the 'enemy' have pervaded our thinking and mythology from the beginning inalmost every facet of our lives - art and literature being two main ones.What happened to Lucifer, once a great angel called Morningstar? Why was he cast out from the presence of God?Fallen tells that story...Here is just a taste of how Lucifer started his decline into evil.Lucifer (in his own mind): I have had my suspicions for a while. This confirms it. The Almighty has lost touch with reality. A “new” creation, for heaven's sake.(looking around): This is paradise. What more could they want? Whatever the Almighty has planned, it will surely mean the end of our angelic reign. Maybe the enemy was right, maybe the Almighty isn’t interested in peace. A “new” creation will surely create more enemies. The Angels cannot allow the Almighty to create a superior being.Wanting to tackle the storyof Lucifer stems from my desire to locate the starting point of our ideas of 'Satan' and 'the Enemy' - to define where our perceptions of evil have come from throughout our history. The story ofFallen is my approach to the questions posed above. It's a story told through both historical and theological lenses. It's a story that seeks to recover the original nature of Morningstar, because he wasn't always an enemy of the Almighty. He once held a position of authority and prominence as an angel of light.But something happened. Something, along the way, went terribly wrong.Supporting this project won't justhelp tell the story of what happened to Morningstar and why he was cast out from the presence of God, but it will also help make a storyteller and artist's dream come true. Your contribution will help make years of late night writing and scribbles a reality.

We are all the better for her art.DSM69 is a small booklet, a notice of intent, containing a selection of Dolly's art and several manifestos. It is set at a reasonably competitive price and will be commercially available. Eleusinian Press is honoured to be publishing the book, it's directors' having previously worked with Dolly on critical projects and in the activist world.We hope to launch the book in June 2017.","The Eleusinian Press Ltd has been publishing since 2012, this is their twelfth book.",https://www.kickstarter.com/projects/1203601213/fundraiser-for-a-band-biography-of-the-butthole-su?ref=discovery_category_newest,1203601213/fundraiser-for-a-band-biography-of-the-butthole-su,"Eleusinian Press is a small press that specialises in music and madness and is proud to be publishing Scatological Alchemy: A Gnostic Biography of the Butthole Surfers by Ben Graham.About the bandThe Butthole Surfers were one of the most exciting, adventurous and dangerous rock bands to ever exist. Principally active in the 1980s, they emerged from the American post-punk underground but drew on the visceral energy of psychedelia and the intellectual provocation of Dadaism and other 20th century art movements. Their live shows were the stuff of legend, deranged and cathartic multi-media experiences that at times came close to being genuinely life-threatening.Where other bands cultivated a myth of being outlaws and renegades, The Butthole Surfers were the real deal. For years this unhinged Texan collective lived from hand to mouth on the road, existing in and suffering for their art 24/7. The music they made was unhinged and chaotic, but also contained many moments of real beauty and meaning amid the passages of proto-industrial noise, heavy metal parodies, experiments with technology, found sounds and auto-destructive improvisations. Eventually The Butthole Surfers would come to be a major influence on bands like Nirvana and The Flaming Lips and on signing to a major label even had hit singles of their own. But commercial success and The Buttholes were not happy bedfellows, and the pressures of operating within the mainstream music industry tore them apart in a way that the years of poverty, drugs, chaos and madness never could.Scatological Alchemy is an attempt to pull the true significance of The Butthole Surfers' legacy from the wreckage. As well as telling the story of their epic adventures on the fringes of culture it looks in-depth at their recorded body of work, extracting possible meanings and resonances from music often dismissed as disposable and absurd (not least by the band themselves) but which has stood the test of time and still stands head and shoulders above their contemporaries in sound-tracking the dreams and nightmares of a generation.Ben Graham recently interviewed Butthole Surfers' guitarist Paul Leary for an in-depth feature on the 30th anniversary of their classic album, Locust Abortion Technician. http://thequietus.com/articles/22036-butthole-surfers-locust-abortion-technician-paul-leary-interviewAbout the authorBen Graham is an author, music journalist, poet, cultural historian and performer. His books include A Gathering of Promises: The Battle for Texas’s Psychedelic Music, from the 13th Floor Elevators to the Black Angels and Beyond (Zero Books, 2015), an account of the rise of Texan psychedelic rock in the 1960s. Ben Graham writes regularly for the Quietus and Shindig, and previously wrote for the Stool Pigeon music paper and was a contributing regional editor for The Fly magazine. Via his own Bleeding Cheek Press he has published two autobiographical novels, Nowhere to Go (2010) and We Are The Bad Rabbits And We Shall Overcome (2011). In the late nineties his first short story was featured in the notorious ‘chemical generation’ anthology Disco Biscuits, where he was the only previously unpublished author to feature alongside the likes of Irvine Welsh, Martin Millar, Alex Garland, Alan Warner, etc.He is also a director of Notwork 23, the international Discordian co-operative that put on Festival 23 in 2016 and continues to promote events and counter-cultural chaos around the country.About the bookEleusinian Press are running this kickstarter to cover the costs of copy-editing, typesetting, and proofreading. And if we raise enough, hopefully a launch in Brighton, Ben's current long term town of residence. The book has been written we just need to get it out there.The book will be commercially available from the Press website, Amazon and hopefully independent bookshops and record shops throughout the country.The RRP will be £14.50 and will be released in August/September 2017. But backers in the UK can get early copies at £10 (with international backers paying just a bit more for shipping) through this kickstarter.","There are few risks involved in this project.

It is a role playing video/board game hybrid meant to be played with multiple (4+) people, on the same local network: One player acts as the host, and other players join the host game.At $2.99, this app will have all the elements of your favorite board games at a fraction of the price and without all the clutter. This means Divided Pursuit can make gaming more accessible and inclusive, while also being better for the environment. Evidence has demonstrated gaming, and RPGs in particular, can have a positive impact on self-esteem, brain development, and social skills, so you get to have tons of fun while you improve yourself!(please note that these images are just basic wireframes, the finished project will have nice backgrounds and fancy buttons).Each player creates their own character(s) that gain experience points and level up via multiple playthroughs. As I stated in the video too, each class has their own unique ability. Though these are subject to change as the game develops and is play tested, this is where they currently stand:Warrior: Duel - Openly challenge another player to a duel. They get to choose the weapon (stat) and it is a battle of strength + other stat they chose. The Loser is wounded (can't go on quest next round) and the winner gets a “confidence” bonus if they go on the quest next, which will add to whatever task they do. This ability can only be played during the quest selection phase, before the leader finalizes a vote. (4 round cooldown)Wizard: Telepathy - When not on a quest, pick a character who is on a quest and see what actions they take. There is a chance they will be aware that they are being mentally watched (their wisdom and luck add to this chance) (3 round cooldown).Rogue: Backstab - Option to wound(can't go on quest next round) a fellow adventurer when on a quest with them. Causes that player to get wounded on the quest, as if it was a natural occurrence. This also halves the effectiveness of the action they take during the quest. (4 round cooldown).Cleric: Divine Revelation - Choose one player and know what side they are on. (Only usable once, and is only available to use after a certain number of rounds have passed, which is dependent on the number of players).At game start, players are secretly divided into two teams: Heroes and Saboteurs. The primary goal for the Heroes is to successfully complete quests, while the Saboteurs aim to cause quests to fail. Depending on the quest, 1 or 2 points will be awarded to the team that succeeded at their goal: the first team to reach 6 points is victorious! Each round begins with a new player assigned the role of ""Leader"". The Leader can choose between 3 different quests to go on, and each quest requires a number of people to bring with them. The Leader chooses their team, then each player votes on whether or not they agree with the party that is going. This is democracy, not dictatorship: a majority is required to progress. If the vote passes, the team will go on the selected quest. If the vote doesn’t have a majority, it fails, the Leader changes hands, and it is up to the new leader to select a quest and adventuring party. If parties are rejected 3 times in a row, 1 point is awarded to the Saboteurs. If the vote fails a 4th time, the Saboteurs get another point, but the quest board and failed vote tally reset. Each quest has a unique story that will be displayed to all players, and each member of the adventuring team can make a few different choices for how to proceed. Each choice is tied to a stat: the higher your stat, the higher your chance of success. However, depending on the quest, some choices may be worse than others, and some may out-right negate other choices fellow party members may make. In addition to these quest-based choices, players will always have the option to try and sabotage another player, negating that player’s action entirely. This move always runs a risk that a fellow party member may notice you screwing over another adventurer. Keep in mind though, anybody can do this, not just Saboteurs. A hero may attempt to block a player they suspect is a saboteur in order to stop whatever nefarious scheme they may be up to. Keeping an eye on other adventurers and their decisions (in game, don’t peek at their screens!) is integral to trying to figure out what team each player is on. At the end of the quest, more of the story is shared, and points are awarded to whichever team succeeded at their goal. Play then resumes with a new leader and a new quest (the other two previously unpicked quests usually remain), and the suspense heightens. Another important thing to remember to, is that when on a quest, there is sometimes a slight possibility that an adventurer may be wounded (you won't be able to quest next round) while questing - these occurrences are usually only possible if the option you picked was more physical in nature (i.e fighting or sprinting) and/or the quest fails.After one team gains 6 points, the game is over. The true Heroes and Saboteurs will be revealed and experience points will be given out. Characters  on the winning team will get a bit more experience, but adventurers also gain experience for achieving success on any individual quest. The host can then decide to quick re-launch another game, and players can accept to start anew. In addition, if someone received enough exp to level up, they can choose to level up their character before moving on to the new game.As it currently stands, I have laid all of the groundwork, and created basic wireframes for the game screens (as shown above). The game flow process and the algorithms that dictate how the game works are created (though that is subject to change during the beta phase after receiving gameplay feedback). The timeframe for beta release is 10 months, and a full release scheduled 1-2 months later, depending on how the beta goes. A lot of what will be developed depends on how much money this kickstarter raises: if it makes just the minimum goal, aside from doing all of the programming, I will also write a lot of the quests (of which there would initially be around 100), and there will be minimal art assets. If more money is raised, more content will be added, and this will not interfere with the timeframe at all (in fact it may even shorten it), because almost everything beyond that initial amount is going towards paying other content creators who can take the burden off my shoulders and perhaps even add new burdens (which they get to carry!) while I focus on coding and project management.$4,000 project goal With this, the game will get released on schedule with approximately 100 unique quests for your adventurers to go on, 4 classes (Warrior, Wizard, Cleric, Rogue, plus any backer funded classes), 10-12 character portraits to choose from when creating a character, and various backgrounds representing cities, forests, caverns etc.$5,500 100 additional quests will be added to the game, for additional fun and reduced repetition!$10,000 An additional character class will be added to the game. Backers will get to vote on what the class (and their unique ability) should be. The list of potential classes is dependent on any backer created classes that have been funded, but no matter what, there will be at least 3 different options to choose from.$15,000More unique art assets added to the game: more distinct backgrounds for quest locales as opposed to generic areas that would be re-used for numerous locations, and approximately 50+ character portraits to choose from when creating your character.$18,000Release for Windows/Mac/Linux platforms, in case you want to be that person who uses a laptop (or desktop??) instead of a smartphone or tablet.$23,000Ambient music/sounds added to game. Game menus and different quest location types will all have their own light background music and ambient sounds for the location. There will be an option for the game host to enable or disable these sounds in-game.$36,000Additional game mode added for smaller groups of people that supports 2-6 players: instead of a team based game-mode, this will be focused on fast-paced solo questing with an additional “gamble” mechanic and a twist on the bluffing aspect of the original game mode. $50,000Attribute-based abilities added to game: Upon reaching certain stat levels, you can unlock certain stat based abilities (as opposed to the unique class based abilities). e.g when you reach 10 Charisma you unlock the “Natural Leader” ability and can cast a tie-breaking vote if you are the leader of a quest that ties during the vote phase.$80,000Audio narration added to game: quests and other in-game story will be voice-acted$90,000Depending on how many classes there are, either a new class (to be voted on) will be added or approximately 150 more quests to each game mode will be added.$130,000Game development and production will be sped up more than twice as fast. I can become a full-time developer for myself (instead of for THE MAN) by leaving my full-time job, thus enabling me to devote more than 40 hours a week to this project full-time (instead of finding a handful of hours on nights and weekends). The game will be released on a quicker schedule, and with this additional time, I will likely add another class and even more quests for each game mode. Note: these milestones are not hard and fast goals, if funding gets close to certain goal, I will try my best to get as close as possible as I can to it (for example if $12,000 is raised, I will still use the money to fund more art assets, it just won't be quite as many as the goal of $15,000 would provide).Now that you've read about the App itself, if you're still here and interested to hear about the creator: Hi, I’m Justin. I have been a professional programmer and developer for 7 years. My life has been steeped in gaming (video, board, and Dungeons & Dragons) ever since I was a young child. I was the president of the Gaming club at my campus during my time at college, and from this, I have made many friends and networked with people in different gaming communities, from content creators to content critics. I love games and for a long time have had a strong desire to create something of my own. I’ve created many of my own worlds for various D&D campaigns I’ve run over the years and the whole reason I became a programmer in the first place was because, from a young age, I wanted to be a videogame software developer (I love creating my own worlds and bringing my ideas to fruition). Well, that didn’t quite happen - instead I work for companies creating databases, internal software, and web applications - but it has helped me hone my skills at developing and coding projects!My favorite videogames have always been RPGs - the experience grinds, the character development, the journeys, I love it all. And it's not just videogame RPGs that I love - I've been playing Dungeons and Dragons since I was 12, which really expands upon that personal character development and is just a great way to spend time with friends. As such, my favorite board games themselves are ones that have a role-playing element to them: bluff games. Games like Mafia, Werewolf, Avalon, Coup - the kind of game where you lie to your friends and loved ones, so you can trick your way to victory, while subverting your enemies. So, one day, when some friends and I were about to play a game of Avalon on a table far too small to fit the number of people who wanted to play, I thought to myself how much easier this would be if we didn’t need the table. The wheels started spinning in my head that day, and I began coming up with an idea for a mobile App for Avalon that people could use instead of a board and cards, which eventually turned into “I should make my own game! With Experience points, role-playing, intrigue, and plots! And all the game data will fit in the palm of your hand, no need for pieces or clutter!”. I welcome any and all feedback from the community.

The main reason for this is to gauge interest, get people excited, and ensure that I can create enjoyable content to fill the game with - I don't want bland quests or basic art, I want something people will really get into and enjoy looking at (and I would love to add as many as features as possible)! Worst case scenario if this doesn't get funded, I will be back in a few months with a playable prototype to show off, but if you back it now, it let's me know there's some hype, and will help push me to work on creating this as best I can and as fast as I can!","I have a good amount of experience managing people and projects, but there are always risks when it comes to the finding, hiring, and managing of numerous people. Luckily, I know many professional writers, artists, and content creators whom I can count on (as long as I can pay them). You never know what type of emergencies may delay work, but since this work will be remote and the Internet has no shortage of talented people, I'm confident any risks and delays can be easily mitigated. Even in the worst case scenario, I will always be working personally on any and all project issues that arise.",https://www.kickstarter.com/projects/1847563221/divided-pursuit-multiplayer-boardgame-rpg-in-app-f?ref=discovery_category_newest,1847563221/divided-pursuit-multiplayer-boardgame-rpg-in-app-f,"Divided Pursuit will be a mobile app available for Android and iPhone. It is a role playing video/board game hybrid meant to be played with multiple (4-12) people, on the same local network: One player acts as the host, and other players join the host game. Players get to create their own characters that gain experience points and level up over multiple playthroughs - each class has their own unique ability, and there are many hidden abilities waiting to be unlocked as players level up and raise their attributes (finding out what exactly unlocks the ability is part of the fun)! Divided Pursuit is a game about questing, bluffing, intrigue, and teamwork. At game start, each player will secretly be assigned a role: Hero or Saboteur and the goals are simple: if you are a hero, succeed as many quests as possible; if you are a saboteur, fail as many quests as possible. Nobody knows who anybody is, so keep your wits about you! Look for clues and signs that your friends aren't who they say they are, and make sure they don't find out who you are in the process.If you want an in depth look at the game play and mechanics, check out this How to Play PDF I created, filled with screenshots and commentary. Continue reading here for a more summarized version of game play.Each round there will be a different leader who picks a quest and who will be going on it - the quests range from silly to serious and allow adventurers to have some sort of choice in how to proceed in the quest, so you're not just going on some vague, nameless ""quest"", but are actually doing something, and your character's stats have an impact beyond the role you are playing. 2 Points are given to either the heroes or saboteurs based on quest success or failure, and the first team to reach 6 points claims victory! At the end of each game, you will gain experience points that allow you to level up your character, increasing your stats and possibly unlocking those hidden abilities I mentioned earlier.At $2.99, this app will have all the elements of your favorite board games for a fraction of the price and without all the clutter. This means Divided Pursuit can make gaming more accessible and great for both small and large groups of people, in any sort of setting. Evidence has demonstrated gaming, and RPGs in particular, can have a positive impact on self-esteem, brain development, and social skills, so you get to have tons of fun while you improve yourself!Below are some rough alpha screen-shots of the game (same as the ones found in the How To Play PDF), keep in mind much of the imagery isunfinished, placeholder, or non-existent (that's what the kickstarter is for after all!). As it currently stands, I have an alpha version of the game completed, and have run one game play test as of this writing, which went pretty well. There are still some missing features and bugs to work out, but it's coming along nicely. The purpose of raising money for the game is to create content in the form of quests (lots of quests, with fun and intriguing stories!) and artwork in the form of backgrounds (i.e game screens) and character portraits. The time frame for release is early February 2018, with the beta being ready in mid November.$1,374 is a bit of a strange number but it breaks down as follows:$150 for a refurbished Mac mini, which I need to export my code into Xcode in order to create the game for iPhone$99 - to put the game on apple's app store$0 to create the game for Android and put it on the google play store$500 to pay writers to write quests for game (~50 quests)$500 to pay artists to create art assets for game (~15 backgrounds and 15 character portraits)$125 to cover kickstarter feesThis allows for an easy release for android and iPhone, and creates a decent amount of content. I would honestly like hundreds of quests, but with this we should be okay, as I will also be writing quests to make up for any lacking numbers. $2,000 enough to add ~60 additional quests , for additional fun and reduced repetition! plus this puts us at a nice round number now. As an incentive to get people to this point, I will create an additional class for the game, which backers will be able to vote on after the kickstarter is over.$5,000If we make it this far, I will update the character creation process to add a ""race"" category (e.g human, dwarf, elf, halfling, etc) that will provide attribute modifiers to your character.$10,000Audio narration added to game: quests and other in-game story will be professionally voice-acted$15,000This money is all just going to be used towards more quests and artwork, really, but as an incentive to get people to this point, I will create yet another additional class for the game, which backers will be able to vote on after the kickstarter is over.$20,000Again, more quests and more artwork! But if you still need further incentive to give this game great content, I will add not one, but TWO additional game modes: ""Knights of the Round Table"", which will be similar in nature to another Arthurian-inspired bluffing game, and ""Throw of the Dice"", a game mode for smaller groups of people that will be focused on fast-paced solo questing and have an additional “gamble” mechanic, and a twist on the bluffing aspect of the original game mode. (More details to follow if this stretch goal is reached).Basically any extra money at this point will be used to enhance the game in whatever ways I can; there would probably be too many quests at this point, but there's always room for more backgrounds, character portraits, and even NPC visuals to go along with the background. Ambient sounds & background music would also be something I would like to add. I will ask the community for feedback on things they would like to see added or improved upon and basically just continue focusing on this game for a long time to make it as great as possible before moving on to future projects.Help spread the word about Divided Pursuit and be rewarded in the process! Tell people about the kickstarter using a custom link (generate your link here: http://dividedpursuit.com/referral.php) which will track how many backer pledges your referrals make. Every dollar backed by people you referred gives you 1 referral point. You will be rewarded based on the number of referral points you attain at the end of the kickstarter! Unlike backer rewards, you do not get all previous tier's rewards when you reach a goal, though you can exchange your reward in for a reward of a lower tier. Reward list below:100 points - NPC will be named after you or your organization.300 points - landmark will be named after you or your organization.600 points - Create a fully realized NPC that should in some way represent you or your organization1,500 points - Create a quest that should in some way represent your interests or your organization4,000 points - First referral to reach this mark gets to create a new class. Any subsequent referrals that make it this far can both create an NPC and a storyline of quests (up to 3 quests)8,000 points - Get your 4,000 point reward, and I will also throw a Divided Pursuit launch pizza/food party for you and your friends/organization. I probably won't be there or anything, but I'll call and order a reasonable amount of food from some sort of establishment near you.In addition, any referrer that makes over 100 points will also be included as a special thanks in the credits (if they want).Now that you've read about the App itself, if you're still here and interested to hear about the creator: Hi, I’m Justin. I have been a professional programmer/developer for 7+ years. My life has been steeped in gaming (video, board, and Dungeons & Dragons) ever since I was a young child. I was the president of the Gaming club during my time at college, and from this, I have made many friends and networked with people in different gaming communities, from content creators to content critics. I love games and for a long time have had a strong desire to create something of my own. I’ve created many of my own worlds for various D&D campaigns I’ve run over the years and the whole reason I became a programmer in the first place was because I wanted to make video games (I love creating my own worlds and bringing my ideas to fruition). Well, that didn’t quite happen (yet) - instead I work for companies creating databases, internal software, and web applications - but it has helped me hone my skills at developing and coding projects! My favorite video games have always been RPGs - the experience grinds, the character development, the journeys, I love it all. And it's not just video game RPGs that I love - I've been playing Dungeons and Dragons since I was 12, which really expands upon that personal character development and is just a great way to spend time with friends. As such, my favorite board games themselves are ones that have a role-playing element to them: bluff games. Games like Mafia, Werewolf, Avalon, Coup - the kind of game where you lie to your friends and loved ones, so you can trick your way to victory. So, one day, when some friends and I were about to play a game of Avalon on a table far too small to fit the number of people who wanted to play, I thought to myself how much easier this would be if we didn’t need the table. The wheels started spinning in my head that day, and I began coming up with an idea for a mobile App that people could use instead of a board and cards, which eventually turned into “I should make my own game! With Experience points, role-playing, intrigue, and plots! And all the game data will fit in the palm of your hand, no need for pieces or clutter!”. I welcome any and all feedback from the community. Got any ideas about the project or thoughts you want to share? You can use the comments section or send something my way directly at divided.pursuit@gmail.com!See the original kickstarter video, in all of it's cat-transition glory.","I have a good amount of experience managing people and projects, but there are always risks when it comes to the finding, hiring, and managing of numerous people.

You will also not be charged until the project reaches completion.",https://www.kickstarter.com/projects/bleedingedges/dr-plaguin-vinyl-toy?ref=discovery_category_newest,bleedingedges/dr-plaguin-vinyl-toy,"After successfully making my first vinyl toy, Bearrito, I wanted to create a smaller toy, but packed with detail. Meet Dr. Plaguin, a penguin character based on a plague doctor with a heavy steampunk influence. Designed by Bleeding Edges and sculpted by Mecha Zone. Doing lots of local events, I wanted something that I could charge less for in order to appeal to people who don't necessarily collect designer toys. Currently the prototype is on its way to China to have molds made, then this toy will hopefully be made in vinyl, and produced in America by Mile High Sofubi.The first version will be a Kickstarter Exclusive black vinyl. Available in unpainted and painted. I will be doing the paint similar to the Bearrito in the silver and red ""thrash out"" colors. This painted run will be limited to however many people choose that option.I also run BxE Buttons, and will be releasing a Dr. Plaguin soft enamel pin as well as a prism foil sticker similar to our Bearrito ones.We are also hoping to meet some stretch goals to have paint masks made, which will make the eyes and staff easier to paint. These will be made in China with the molds and be made of metal. There are other costs associated with this project that were not a part of the original budget, so anything over the goal will go to improving the overall project. Things like header cards, backers for the pins, bags and packing materials will hopefully be covered.","We are getting this toy produced in America, but the molds have to be made in China. Of course delays can happen, but we are shooting for a late May release. I will do my best to keep everyone updated on the progress.Although we refer to this as a ""toy,"" this is not for children as it is not tested and is likely poisonous for your child to put in their mouth. This is an art toy for adult collectors.Your card will not be charged until the campaign ends, so don't worry if you don't have funds now, but make sure they are there when it ends. This project will only go in to production if we can get people to commit to a pre-order."
https://www.kickstarter.com/projects/1037432997/plasma-frequency-magazine?ref=discovery_category_newest,1037432997/plasma-frequency-magazine,"Anyone who write science fiction and fantasy knows how hard it can be. This is especially true of short fiction. Taking an idea and making it a fulfilling story in such a short word count is a challenge. But things only get hard when it comes time to sell that story to a publication.That's where Plasma Frequency comes in. Since 2012, Plasma Frequency has published quality science fiction and fantasy. To date we have purchased over 130 stories, totaling more than 340,000 words! We have given many writers their first publication credit, as well as welcoming several well-known names. You can check out our full list of issues here.And that is what Plasma Frequency is all about, giving fiction a home for readers to enjoy it.You can count on 10 stories per issue (6 issues a year) of science fiction, fantasy, and even some horror. We publish a range in length from 7000 words to a few hundred. And, we even have a serial fiction story this year that is much longer!Starting with issue 13, we now have our issues free to read online. Free, that's a great deal! You can also purchase print and eReader copies of all our issues. We also publish amazing cover art each issue. And coming in 2015 we will have special theme issues, and an all inclusive 2015 Anthology. But all this is counting on help from the community through funding on Kickstarter.Running a quality magazine takes a lot of time and money. I can make the time, but I am a starving artist myself and can't spare anymore money. Plasma Frequency believes that the hard work authors put into stories deserves a fair pay rate. Each year I put in over $3000 into just the magazine (this doesn't include marketing) but that means I can only pay just 1 cent per word. And you will probably agree that writers deserve more.We want to pay authors a fair, professional wage, of 6 cents per word starting in January 2015. But we simply can't do that with out crowd funding support. And this is what we are using this Kickstarter for. To raise the funds needed for one year of issues at the professional rate of 6 cents per word.$10,200 will go directly to paying authors and artists. This includes a pay increase for Authors (6 cents per word) and an increase for Artists ($200).$1,285 will go to operational costs of the magazine, including the anthology, postage/printing, website hosting, and upgrading our submission system to handle the influx of new submissions we anticipate.$2,110 will go to printing, shipping, and other fees associated with this campaign's rewards.$1,512 will go to the fees associated with running this campaign (Kickstarter fees, Card Processing Fees)Grand Total Needed: $15,107Deadline: November 15th. Why that day? It is my birthday and I would like nothing more for my birthday than to see this funded.So what is in it for you? Well, besides another great professional rate magazine? We also have some great rewards for you.We would be happy just to make our funding goal, but if we are so privileged to go beyond that goal we have a few plans in store. We will announce some of those as we get closer to funding. But some of those include special editions, adding more to the author pay rate, and much more.Obviously making a donation helps tremendously. But sharing this Kickstarter on Facebook, Twitter, your blog, at your writer's groups, and with anyone else wishing to see a great publication rise up to professional payment levels will be a huge benefit as well.You can also follow us on Twitter and Facebook. We'd love for you to join us.","Plasma Frequency has been publishing since 2012. We've come across some tough challenges, most of those are in regards to funding.  But I've kept it going through two job losses and a major out of state move. This Kickstarter would eliminate the biggest hurdle our magazine has. money.

They published 16 issues and received 9 reader based awards, including Best Fiction Magazine two years in a row. They have published more than 150 stories.In June of 2015, I discovered that through some type of payment scam, thousands of dollars had been taken from the Plasma Frequency account. As a non-profit making venture, the loss of years of funding was a devastating blow that resulted in the delay of publication, and eventually the closure of the magazine.We want to come back, and based on the things we've heard, you want us to start publishing again. And we are ready to do just that. We just need a little bit more funding to get started, and that's where we hope you'll come in.The money made will go directly into the payment fund to buy stories from authors. What will Plasma Frequency bring you with this money? The list is endless, here are some examples:Being a new author is tough. One of the toughest challenges is finding a home for your work. Plasma Frequency wants to help new authors out by ensuring that at least one story in each issue is by a new author. This is great for writers because it helps them out. But it is even better for readers because it gives them a fresh voice they might have missed out on otherwise.This Rookie Author Feature is ground breaking in the industry. To our knowledge few other paying publication offers a specific slot for new talent. Plasma Frequency is known for testing the boundaries of ""normal"" and ""traditional"", so this feature will be just another way we shake things up.We are not asking for a lot of money, just $1450 to ensure we have one year of funding.We have set up two stretch goals below. We will add more if we need to.$2,000 - We will add two short stories to each issue. That's 15 stories per issue.$3,000 - We will add a Novelette to each issue. That's 16 stories per issue.We are also considering some stretch goals between those levels above. We are considering creating another author feature program for an underrepresented author group (to be determined). Some other things on the table are: special edition (a 5th issue) that is free for donors, and the creation of a donor's area where donors can get access to stories that are not free to the public. We will announce those as they come!In honor of reaching nearly 50% funding by our first weekend, we've added so great new rewards! Many thanks to the people who have volunteered to provide these rewards! Some of these are one time offers, first one to select it gets it!ART WORK REWARD!For a donation of just $150 or more, one of our regular cover artists, Tais Teng will create a Science Fiction, Horror or Fantasy Portrait of the image you sent him. The file size will be large enough that you can print it as large as a poster!Here are some examples:","There are always challenges in the publishing field. But the main obstacle will be funding after the first year.  We've never been about making money. Our magazine has been about publishing great fiction.  So we will have some advertising on our webpages to cover future costs. We will also have the sales of our magazine and anthologies. This funding will just be the kick start.To protect the money we've earned from future theft, we've ensured that we have adequate fraud protection in place and will not be sharing bank information with any other entity."

It goes back to the Stoughton Music Society which was established in 1786, and its members from surrounding towns. Did you know that Benjamin Franklin composed classical music and played violin among his many talents? We would like to continue this tradition by establishing the only chamber music festival/adult musician workshop in the area of MetroSouth.We are organizing the Easton Chamber Music Festival with the mission to promote lifelong chamber music-making and provide learning and performance opportunities for amateur and professional musicians. We would like to showcase local talent and bring musical events of the highest caliber to our entire community. The ECMF will be presented on July 8-10, 2016 in Easton, MA. We invite adult musicians to participate in an intensive workshop where they will be coached by an internationally renown faculty. Faculty members and guest artists will perform two concerts, and workshop participants will have the opportunity to present their progress at the concerts at the beautiful Immaculate Conception Church and Oakes Ames Memorial Hall in Easton. All concerts are free to the public. In supporting the Festival, we are partnering with the Associated Chamber Music Players, Inc. (“ACMP”), and local organizations.",We hope that all preparations for the festival will go as planned.,https://www.kickstarter.com/projects/144782524/easton-chamber-music-festival-2017?ref=discovery_category_newest,144782524/easton-chamber-music-festival-2017,"2nd Easton Chamber Music Festival takes place on June 23-25, 2017. Our festival brings the highest caliber performers to Easton, we cultivate local talented musicians, and attract sizable audience of all ages and socio-economic background.  We invite amateur and young professional musicians to participate in the only program of this kind in this area of Massachusetts.  Students-participants are put in chamber music ensembles at the festival, however some  may chose to participate as a pre-formed group.  During the festival, they follow intense workshop schedule and learn in masterclasses led by a renowned international faculty.  In addition to the workshop and concerts, musicians observe open faculty rehearsals, join music-reading impromptu sessions at after performances’ soirees, and visit historic Easton. The concerts on June 23-24 are given by the faculty members and guest artists of the festival. The students-participants perform at the showcase concert on June 25. The concerts take place in the beautiful sanctuary of the Immaculate Conception Church and the Oakes Ames Memorial Hall designed by prominent American architect H. H. Richardson.  All concerts are free to the public. Please see our website where you can find more information about the festival and meet our faculty.We expect to serve close to 600 people from Easton and nearby communities. Furthermore, over 50% of the tuition cost is allocated as scholarships to participants in need. Your donations will fund part of the cost associated with faculty stipend and housing,  marketing, concert and practice space rental, piano tuning, and music purchase.  We thank you for your generosity!","The first ECMF 2016 was enthusiastically supported by the audience and strongly encouraged to become a permanent feature of the cultural and musical scene of Easton by the community.  However, we are fully aware of the difficulties in funding classical music and lifelong learning events.  In case of insufficient funds to run the festival we will seek additional donations from individuals and corporations in the area. Furthermore, we may have to decrease the number of faculty members and, as the last resort, to reduce the amount of scholarships."

He built from scratch a huge mobile roaster. The trailer and everything on it was made with his bare hands. After many years of making some of the best Spit BBQ around, he parked the roaster and quit due to his health. All these years later, after culinary school and years of wanting to start something up of my own, my grandfather passed the torch on to me and gave me his roaster. With some touching up and dusting off, I want to resurrect the roaster and make some of the best BBQ in Erie. I take great pride in producing quality food. Swine Dining will be a mobile BBQ Spit that can travel to all over town and the surrounding areas. The Spit is made out of 350-400 gallon tank. It has 2 stainless spits that span the length of the unit. These can hold, and have held, a 200lb pig and more. We can do roasts pretty much anywhere being a mobile unit. The spits will hold anything from pork to beef to turkeys. We also roast whole top rounds, slice them on a slicer, and make beef and BBQ beef sandwiches that we can sell anywhere. I'm working on a removable grill rack so we can grill chicken, ribs, burgers, etc. This will allow us to have a larger menu and accommodate more customers.The spits are spun slowly by an electric 2 speed motor from a wrecker. We only use natural lump charcoal and/or wood for ultimate flavor. Stag ‘n’ drags, graduation parties, weddings, get-togethers, company parties, etc. You name it, there is always a reason to BBQ! We also feel that it is important to give back to the community. If you have a charity or organization that wants to hold a fundraiser, we can set that up and help draw in money. We promise, when possible, we will use locally raised meat to help support our local farmers. We plan to use meats that are locally raised and farmed. We will support local farmers, meat packers, and farmer's markets as a primary source of product. Rubs and SeasoningsAnother aspect of Swine Dining will be our Rubs and Seasoning Blends that we will be creating and selling. As of right now, we have:Sparlicon - An all-purpose seasoning for everything from burgers to chicken. I use it on just about everything.Cheryl's Jamaican Me Hungry Seasoning - A spicy Jamaican Jerk seasoning. Great on grilled chicken wings! Named after a friend of ours that lost her battle with cancer. Dill Dust - An amazing blend of seasonings that includes Dill. Best on salmon and other fish. Can be used on chicken too.Wimpy's BBQ Rub - Your basic, yet extremely flavorful, sweet BBQ rub.Wimpy's BOLD BBQ Rub - Same as Wimpy's but with an added kick from spicy chipotle powder.These are just a few that we have now. We are working on new recipes and will make them available as we perfect them.We have a LOT of support from friends, family, and customers I talk to on a daily basis. I know with YOUR support, we can make this a success. Where will your pledges go? Licensing-We need to get the proper licenses to operate a business. Equipment-Things like knives, roasting pans, slicer, etc. Aesthetics-The roaster needs updated. New paint, which has to be high heat, new coal grates, and our logo put on it. Swag-Have to have swag made for pledges.If we reach our goal, we promise to keep you updated with how the money is spent. We’ll update you with pictures, videos, and make sure you see what it is we’re up to!","With any business there are risks.

My name is Jason Klingensmith, and I'm the chef behind Swine Dining. My wife Nahtanha and I run the business together. I've been in the kitchen since I was a kid in Ohio. I cooked for my family and I would help my grandfather roast pigs in his homemade pig roaster, which he gave to me and which I use in my competitions today. I moved to Erie, PA in the Fall of 2006 for culinary school at Mercyhurst North East. I thought it was finally time to pursue my dream of starting my own business. After school I started a blog about my culinary experiments, which grew into the Swine Dining project. I've won awards in barbecue competitions all around the Erie area with my signature spice rubs, and now it's time to spread the love and give you the opportunity to try it yourself! I love teaching and I love seeing the great ideas people have for using my seasonings.For this Kickstarter only, we've come up with some great variations on some Swine Dining favorites - namely, Spicy Versions!We chose Wimpy's BBQ Rub, a delicious mild, sweet rub, and Jamican Me Hungry Seasoning, a Jamaican Jerk-style seasoning, to showcase our spicier side! Wimpy's is a mild, sweet seasoning, focusing on flavor over heat. Jamaican Me Hungry is a spicier jerk-style seasoning.Try our Original, Spicy, and Inferno varieties of both!Looking for a little something extra?

A period of grace is followed by forced restraint, then a contemplative relinquishing of control, concluding in solitary reflection. Proving that patience and resilience wins many times over.This solo work was a very heartfelt, personal journey, and became a means for me to comprehend being diagnosed with end stage kidney failure at the age of twenty. I'm thrilled to reconstruct the work and as I re-learn the intricacies of each step, am reminded of a time of frustration, sorrow, but also deep understanding. - Peter Cheng""Off the Cuff"" (2014)Improvisation does not a dance make? There is something inherently transitory about dance - especially when improvised - but once these kernels are recreated, have undergone multiple iterations, then molded, shaped, and calibrated, we produce what was once fleeting into something a little more permanent.HistoryAfter a six year hiatus, Peter Cheng launched a solo dance project in February 2014 presenting site specific short improvisations in public spaces - from the Santa Barbara County Courthouse to Cupid’s Span in San Francisco, and as far east as the Cleveland Museum of Art. These improvisations were documented on YouTube as 30-second to 3-minute video clips with some improvisations presented in tandem with Dance Anywhere2014 and Bay Area Dance Week2014.In May 2014, a group of dancers was brought together to create a new work, “Off the Cuff”, combining several improvised site specific phrases previously captured on camera in a studio setting. The new group work is a part of a new choreographic venture -- thus Peter & Co.

Of course there does! So let's get together and make some more.Here's what I'm thinking:There's something or someone in your life that needs to be immortalized in a heavy metal song. Maybe it's your dog. Maybe your Level 37 Cleric needs a theme song. Maybe Me-Maw and Pop-Pop are celebrating their 60th wedding anniversary. Whatever it is, with a little information from you and my 25+ years of playing, writing, and recording heavy metal, we're going to write a custom song you will treasure and want to crank it to 11.After we're funded, I'll reach out to you. We'll discuss the topic of your song, all the important details you want in the lyrics, and we'll talk bands and styles so we can start to zero in on the sound of your song. If you already have lyrics and just need the music to go along with it, we can do that, too!Once I have everything I need, I'll go into my studio to write, record, and produce your song. In the end, you'll have an MP3 of your song, a high-quality AIFF file (in case you need it) and a song inspired by and customized only for you. We'll keep it fun and heavy at the same time.Why do you want to Make Metal with George?Because I LOVE this stuff. Ever since I heard Metallica's ""Ride the Lightning,"" I've been hooked. The power, the precision, the volume. It never gets old. I'm at my happiest when I'm surrounded by fun, talented musicians and the vibe is just right.I'm also very invested in keeping things fun. While I take the music and playing seriously, I don't take myself seriously at all. I want this project to put a smile on everyone's face.Finally, I truly enjoy working and collaborating with people. The best songs or projects I've been a part of have involved creative people kicking ideas around, helping shape the final product. I'm a big believer in communication and listening, and then executing to the best of everyone's abilities.I'll be recording this project at my home studio, lovingly referred to as The Viper Pit. It's named in honor of the first album recorded and produced here, Viper Rash's ""Big Problems,"" a metal-punk hybrid chock full of catchy riffs and tongue-in-cheek lyrics.In this studio, I've recorded several albums, one-offs and custom songs for video game companies and comic book publishers.Garageband is my program of choice and I use Toontrack for drums and production. I also have multiple electric guitars, basses, and acoustic guitars to help create the perfect sound for your song.I have been extremely lucky to play with some great people over the years and four of them are ready to lend their voices to your song:RANDY CARTER - Lead Singer, SWARM OF EYESRandy and I have been friends for many, many years. In 2011, we co-founded SWARM OF EYES and have released two albums, Designing the Dystopia and We Go to War with the Weapons We Have. Check out the song ""Cursed in Blood"" to hear the different styles Randy can bring to the table.TRACY O'CONNOR - Lead Singer, 12:06Tracy is one of my favorite vocalist, bar none... and I'm not just saying that because she's my wife. With the band 12:06, we released two albums, 12:06 A.M. and Compulsion/Control. She has a wonderful ability to be vocally on point while delivering power, character and emotion. You can hear it all on display in our song ""Absence of Light.""LOUIE GREEN - Lead Singer, VIPER RASHLouie is just the latest in a long line of amazing friends who have joined me on one of my creative projects. We're currently working on Viper Rash's second album, tentatively called Burn With Us. Beyond his vocal abilities, I've truly appreciated the energy, good humor and eagerness Louie has brought to the project. In our song ""Project Mayhem,"" you can hear him vocally grip it, rip it, and attack with full conviction.ERIC CARTER - Lead Singer, ROGUERogue was the first ""big boy"" band I was in and I was lucky to have Eric up front for the vast majority of it. We released several EPs and two full length records, On the Outside Looking Within and Devil's Night. In the song ""Point of No Return,"" you can get a taste of his range and power.This is for NON-COMMERCIAL use only. If you have a commercial project in mind, I'd be more than happy to talk to you outside of Kickstarter.Also, I want to keep this fun and enjoyable. If you're looking to put your political manifesto to music or rip into your ex (although you're right, they totally do deserve it), this probably isn't the right match for you. Not sure if your idea fits with the spirit of the project? Please drop me a line before you pledge and let's talk.","I mean, I could run out of riffs. Hard drives could crash. Hands could get mangled. Someone could lose their voice. My intense love of writing metal could suddenly disappear. I could be completely overwhelmed by the number of backers.Life might get lifey but I'm committed to seeing this project through and deliver your song in a timely manner.",https://www.kickstarter.com/projects/charliesspot/baby-destroying-atlantic-city-in-the-most-adorable?ref=discovery_category_newest,charliesspot/baby-destroying-atlantic-city-in-the-most-adorable,"When a baby monster-from-the-deep ends up on the shores of Atlantic City, a cop and a cryptozoologist must each decide, ""How far would you go to capture fame and fortune?""Welcome to BABY!

He’s contributed stories to anthologies from ComixTribe, GreyHaven and Elevator Pitch Press. He’s co-creator (along with Griffin), head writer and editor of the improvisational podcast Phone Hugs & Therapy (available on iTunes). Plus he created the 34-episode digital series 664-The Neighbor of the Beast (available on YouTube) along with over 60 short films. And somehow he also juggles playing guitar in his metal and punk rock bands. GRIFFIN ESSOne part illustrator, one part psychologist, one part entertainer: Griffin Ess lives in a unique cross section of skill sets. He spends most of his time devising ways to help others tap into their creativity. He's made himself a resource to imaginative people who need their imaginations turned into images, and an adviser to creators who find themselves entangled within their own processes. You can see more of what he does at ShadedAreas.com.Baby has been a labor of love for a while now. He means a lot to us and with your support, we can get our little monster story into more hands, both young and young at heart.Once you grab the rewards you like, feel free to share this project with someone else who'd enjoy it.

The book is already done and compiled and we're in talks with printers right now.If there's a risk, it's getting the hand-drawn bonuses done in a timely manner. But we're already putting plans and strategies in place to make sure they're done on time without killing Griffin. Which is good. Because we like him.One of the biggest challenges is people pledging and then backing out.

Someone cuts you off in traffic, the garbage bag breaks, you spill coffee on your junk in the car or someone at work eats your lunch that you clearly labeled before placing in the fridge (that jerk).I have found writing angry haikus to be a great way to deal with these things. Sometimes I even doodle the events. I have collected quite a few of these angry haikus over the past year. I have decided I want to share them with you so I am publishing a book.The book is a 5x7 96 page full color semi-gloss paperback. Every haiku is handwritten and scanned to be digitally placed in the book.EVERYONE GETS FREE SHIPPING!Here is one spread from the book so you know what you are getting.",,https://www.kickstarter.com/projects/dismantle/slumber-society-independent-clothing-co?ref=discovery_category_newest,dismantle/slumber-society-independent-clothing-co,"For more than half my life, I have been a graphic designer specializing in merchandise for musicians and bands. 17 years of creating album art, stickers, buttons, websites and, most of all, shirt designs.I have always been intrigued by small apparel companies and have aspired to create one for quite some time. A lot of my past designs have been sold on RedBubble, but I wanted more options when it comes to the brand and material the designs are printed on.In an effort to launch my own clothing company, I have created this campaign.Without further ado, I present to you the first four shirt designs for Slumber Society.WHAT BRAND ARE THEY PRINTED ON?You're probably wondering what material these are going to be printed on. That was a tough choice. I wanted to have them printed on a quality material with unwavering dimensions (I'm looking at you AA). I want a low price for YOU without sacrificing quality. The color choices available were also a factor. The final decision was to useNEXT LEVEL CVC 6210. This t-shirt is a polyblend of60% combed cotton and 40% polyester jersey. It's 4.3 oz and slightly heathered.Some may want to order a size larger. Here is a chart to help you determine that.If you want to be really precise, you can measure your favorite shirt. You can also use this resource on the Next Level website to determine your fit. Model Specs.WHAT SIZES WILL BE AVAILABLE?This is going to be a first run for Slumber Society. Unfortunately, to preserve the quality of the print size for each design, I will only be printing on Small through 2XL for the first run.ARE YOU PRINTING WOMEN'S STYLES?We will be printing women's styles and sizes if the stretch goals are met. You can vote on which design to print on women's shirts here.WHO IS PRINTING THE SHIRTS?The only guys I trust when it comes to shirts. Terminus Tees in Woodstock, GA. These guys do a fantastic job. Feel free to check out their website. WHO IS PRINTING THE STICKERS?Well, the only guys I trust for that. The guys at Standout Stickers have proven themselves to be extremely reliable when it comes to quality and turnaround.Rewards of three (3) or more shirts ship to US only. I apologize for this. The cost to ship 3 shirts out of the US is pretty hefty.  WHAT DOES THE FUNDING PAY FOR?There are several things that factor into my funding goal. 1. The largest cost is getting the shirts printed. Shirts come with additional costs such as screen charges, taxes and shipping. Printing a smaller volume of shirts increases the cost, but keeps the funding goal low.2. Sticker printing was included in the funding goal.3.A small amount was added to adjust for the fees by Kickstarter.4. Packaging to send stickers and shirts to backers was factored into the goal. The amount of potential backers were estimated to determine this figure.5. Font licenses. A lot of people don't understand that fonts are considered software and you must purchase them for use in commercial work. The font I used on the Brewsky shirt was just too good to pass up. As far as stretch goals are concerned, I would really love to give you guys custom printed tags. So, let's reach for that first stretch goal! Here is what the screened tag will look like.Stretch goal #2 is to offer women's styles as an option. This will be in addition to the four unisex shirt andwill only be possible if we reach $2,150. There is a poll for which design we will print in women's styles. Vote for your favorite design HERE. The popular vote will be printed in women's styles if we reach the goal.If we reach $2,550 we will print the second most popular vote in the POLLin women's styles.---------------------------------------------Thank you for checking out the project. Help me bring this project to life so nobody will be sad they didn't get a shirt. With the successful funding of this project, I will eventually be able to expand Slumber Society to offer other articles, such as hoodies and patches.","The biggest risk and challenge will be acquiring packaging to mail rewards. The orders for one shirt will be easy to package, but more shirts equals bigger boxes. As an experienced eBay seller, I have become pretty inventive on acquiring proper packaging materials. I would like to personalize the shirts with custom, screen printed ""tags"" on the inside, but that will depend on how well the funding goes. Another challenge will be making sure the designs are sized to look good on the shirts since each design has one screen for all sizes. The change in chest dimensions per size aren't big enough to make a huge difference, though."

It was compiled in the mid-17th century, mostly from materials a couple of centuries older. The book reputedly contained magical seals that could be used in the summoning and controlling of seventy-two demons.As a game designer, writer, and movie producer, I have often needed props to bring my stories to life. Unfortunately, the props I really needed had not been made by anyone and I found myself feeling mighty low when I was forced to do without. I read S.L Macgregor Mathers and looked at the wonderful occult art and thought, ""I need something like this for my games."" I have often wondered what those seals would have looked like had Lovecraft designed them for his Cthulhu Mythos. This inspired me to create many different seals for use with my gamers. Games like Call of Cthulhu went so far as to give us much great source material for the would be cultist but it was not enough for my games. As such I scoured the internet for great artists and eventually found one who understood my needs. I commissioned Bryan Reagan to create twelve seals. I then consulted with many different companies that make coins. Finally I settled on one that could produce something of the quality that I was seeking. I sent them the sketches and this kickstarter was born.Here is a list of all of the seals created so far:Seal of AzathothSeal of CthulhuSeal of Yog SothothSeal of Shub Niggurath Seal of Nyarlathotep Seal of Tsathoggua Seal of Ygolonac Sigil of the Yellow King Cult Sigil of the Black BrotherhoodSigil of Alhazred Sigil of the Esoteric Order of DagonSigil of the Church of Starry WisdomI am asking for $15,000 as that is the minimum for me to make production costs. These costs include art design, molds, crafting, etc. Each seal is a piece of art and one of a kind. I have engaged a professional coin mint to make the coins and already have proofs in hand. As the art is complete, the proofs complete, and the concept complete, all I need now is the hard cash to make it all happen. That means I need you and your generosity.

Gaming has inspired me to push my limits in other areas of life. As such I have been involved in more than seventy films in various capacities. On that note, I have been a producer in more than forty films. I also have authored two books, the most well known of which is, Blasphemous Cocktails. Blasphemous Cocktails was also a kickstarter and also inspired by HP Lovecraft. While my ideas do flow like a river, they are often dammed by a lack of funding so I am truly hoping this project will be a huge success. My personal history includes service in the US Army, working as a paramedic and firefighter, a brief run for Sheriff, and many years running a health food store in Baltimore, Maryland. When I truly love something, I give it my all and work like a horse. I truly love this project and am ready to make it a success.Bryan ""MRZARONO"" ReaganBryan is famed in many dark circles for his work to bring to life the Necronomicon.

Let me say this, the hard work is done, we are ready to go forward, proofs have been made and the printer says he can make the coins in under a month from date of order. So all we need is to give him the GO. I am 100% certain that if this project is funded, we will be ready to ship early.

We are Nerd Rage News from the Baltimore, Maryland area, and we just finished post production of our first film, and it's a non budget film.

Each festival has an application fee and they add up fast if you try to get into a bunch of them. So what is the film about? It is a documentary about gamers and what they do and why they do it. By gamer we are referring to tabletop gaming.

https://www.kickstarter.com/projects/leedesignstudio/alice2020?ref=discovery_category_newest,leedesignstudio/alice2020,"Welcome to my Alice in Wonderland Kickstarter Campaign! I'm Chris! Thanks so much for taking the time to visit. If you follow me on my social media, you know that I like to create anime characters in 3D, print them out on my resin printer, paint them by hand and share the 3D models on my online store so that everyone can 3d print their very own anime figure!But after a while, I receive messages from followers who do not have 3D printers. They were interested in ordering a fully painted anime figure. Unfortunately, I would tell them that 3D printing each of the figures and painting by hand takes a bit of time and effort. Usually it takes me a good 3-4 days make just one figure.In good ol’ winter of 2019, I created a series of characters from Alice in Wonderland characters like Alice, the White Rabbit, the Mad Hatter, the Cheshire Cat, and The Queen of Hearts, and a few others. I decided to print Alice and see how she would turn out. I prepped the 3D model, printed her on my resin printer, and prepped her for paint.I carefully painted all the pieces separately. I used an airbrush for larger surfaces and a tiny brush for delicate areas. I have so much respect for people who paint traditionally. Cause painting anime figures isn't easy. There's no cntl-z button!After all the individual pieces were painted, I assembled Alice together with super glue. I was really happy how she turned out! Alice is one of the Disney films I loved watching when I was little, so designing my own version Alice was a ton of fun!There she is! A 3D resin printed and painted version of my Alice in Wonderland!I collected so many anime figures as a kid. I never imagined that one day I would actually be able to design and fabricate my own. But thanks to Blender3D (an awesome free 3D program that I used to model Alice) and affordable 3d printing technology, I'm able to transport Alice from the digital world to our physical world.But I don't want to stop there. While she sits on top my desk, I really would love for her to be professionally made and to share her with fans of Alice in Wonderland and anime figure enthusiasts all over the world.I went online and obtained estimates from various manufacturers and quickly learned that while 3d printing my own model is fairly inexpensive. Producing them professionally on the other hand, cost A LOT more....a LOT, LOT more! It's like having the ability to swim in the kiddie pool, then all of a sudden getting dunked in the middle of the Pacific Ocean! I received a few estimates that made my jaw drop and my heart sink.But after going thru many estimates, I found one that was reasonably affordable. And when I say reasonably, to me, it's still freakin' expensive. Essentially the production, fulfillment cost including fees and taxes will require me to raise at least $70,800. While that is lot of money, I'm thinking to myself why not just give it a shot and see if the Alice in Wonderland fan community are interested and willing to help fund my kickstarter campaign. One of my favorite quotes is from Wayne Gretzky, the great one, who said ""you miss 100 percent of the shots you never take."" This is me taking a shot!If you’re interested in getting your own Alice in Wonderland anime figure, please help fund my kickstarter campaign. This is a super exciting journey for me! Your support is definitely welcomed, needed, and very much appreciated. I will keep you updated every step of the way and I will make sure Alice finds her way safely to you.If you have any friends or family that might be interested in getting the Alice in Wonderland figure, please share this kickstarter campaign with them too! If you’re unable to fund my campaign, no worries at all! By sharing my kickstarter campaign, you are helping to get the word out to anime figure enthusiast and Alice in Wonderland fans. Any exposure helps and is very much appreciated!You are definitely helping me to make one of my dreams come true! With that said, Thank you so much for taking the time visit my Alice in Wonderland Kickstarter Campaign! I hope everything you see here interests you and brings you happiness! Have a wonderful day and please stay safe and healthy!Ever since I was little, I always loved watching anime. The first two anime that I remember watching was Doraemon and Ranma ½. My cousin introduced me to Dragon Ball Z. My dad introduced me to The Fist of the North Star and The Peacock King II when I was about 5 or 6 (which was definitely not the most age-appropriate anime movies for kids, lol). My mom told me that around that same time, she brought me to a toy store and let me pick out anything I wanted. I choose a Barbie doll. What can I tell you? I love girly things. Being a cool mom, she bought it for me and I apparently I really liked braiding her hair. That part I don't remember. I still have her somewhere in the storage in the garage.As I got older, I started drawing anime for fun. While all the boys picked Dragon Ball Z, I choose Sailormoon. Needless to say I was picked on and was laughed at by kids around me. (I still remember the name of the specific girl who literally lol-ed right in front of my face when I picked up the Sailor Mars coloring page. Looking at you K****).But I didn’t let anyone’s opinion stop what I love doing. I kept drawing anime girls, then animals, then abstract shapes, then architecture, and ended up at Art Center College of Design in Pasadena. I met some amazing friends, artists, and teachers there. One of which helped me get an internship at Walt Disney Imagineering. Little did I know that a few years later, I would become an Imagineer working alongside with some of the MOST talented people in the theme park industry. I was blessed to design the new Buzz Lightyear Planet Rescue attraction in Shanghai Disneyland as well as develop early concepts for Star Wars: Galaxy’s Edge. Now I started my own design company traveling all over the world doing what I love. All of this would have never happened if I stopped drawing.So, don’t stop what you love doing!","Challenge #1: This is my first kickstarter campaign, but I will do my best to make it a successful one!Challenge #2:  This is my first time dealing with a manufacturer, but everything seems to be going smoothly. The contact at my manufacturer communicates very well and is cooperative. And Nice!Challenge #3: There is a world-wise Covid-19 Pandemic going on at the moment.

Thanks so much for checking out my AstroGals Pins & Stickers Kickstarter Campaign! My name is Chris Lee and It's my pleasure to introduce you to my AstroGals! I came up with this idea a few years ago when I was doodling and thought it'd be cool to draw chibi anime style astrology girls. After years of putting it off, I finally found the time to design all of them and launch a kickstarter campaign to make them into pins/stickers so that they can be shared with everyone!Each of the AstroGals will......Aries Gal (born on March 21 - April 20) is adventurous and energetic.

I'm super happy with the polished finished of the gold plated metal. All the lines are super clean and the colors came out really well! As you can see I designed a round backing card for the pin. Each pin will have its own unique backing card! The attachment for all the pins will have a strong magnetic button in the back so that it can be attached to multiple surfaces without ruining or poking holes into your fabric/clothes.I've also order a set of Aquarius Gal Die-Cut Vinyl Stickers. The colors came out beautifully and they are very durable. The size is of the round sticker is 3in x 3in!I've also was able to manufacture the Libra Gal Pin with her backing card.Kickstarter is a cool platform that helps designers like myself to find funding for projects. Backers, like yourself, can support the campaign by making pledges to fund the project. It's an all-or-nothing platform. Meaning that your pledge will not be charged unless we reach our campaign goal. In my case it's $1,500. Once we reach this goal, we will have enough funding to make all the AstroGals into cute and awesome pins/stickers.It's simple. By making pledges you will be able to receive rewards when the campaign goal is reached. The rewards are listed in the rewards section (if you're on a mobile device) or on the right hand section of the this page (if you're on a computer browser). When the campaign is over, I will send you a survey and see which pins/stickers rewards you would like to receive that corresponds with your generous pledge.If you like to take home an AstroGal for yourself, friends, or family, please help support my campaign by making a pledge. =) Your support is most appreciated!

https://www.kickstarter.com/projects/alkurwi/scandi-poster-art?ref=discovery_category_newest,alkurwi/scandi-poster-art,"Welcome to my first project on Kickstarter.I am an aspiring multiemedia designer with an exploring mind and an urge to try out various ways to express myself. I have a strong interest in graphic design. I design logos, websites, flyers, basically everything on layout. Through Kickstarter, I want to experiment more with the artistic world. I find it interesting to explore more of what can be expressed through layout & design. Therefore, I now want to create posters that hopefully other people might find interesting and are able to see hanging in their living rooms and such.I want to get into the details of how I created these posters. I have painted these posters digitally, with the use of Adobe programmes, more specifically InDesign, Procreate and Photoshop because I really appreciate the tools that are within these programmes. I have tried to keep the theme abstract & full of details at the same time, which gives the posters a sense of depth and also a touch of mixed media.I've used different kinds of elements when creating the posters, such as lines, paint stains, boxes & a tint of charcoals. I really think experimenting with these kinds of patterns & lines give the posters a unique & interesting look, while keeping the look of original looking paintings.The posters","As I have some experience with graphic design, there shouldn't be many challenges in this project.",https://www.kickstarter.com/projects/alkurwi/make-100?ref=discovery_category_newest,alkurwi/make-100,"I am an aspiring multimedia designer with an exploring mind and an urge to endeavour various ways of expression. In the times of escalating modernity and technology, graphic design has become a great source of art creation and has the full potential to enrich the aesthetics in every home, the outdoors or numerous workspaces. I let myself inspire by the simplicity of Scandinavian style and the complexity of abstract art, and I find it interesting to explore more of what can be expressed through layout & design.In this project I have tried to experiment with elements, objects and colors. I have tried to keep the red thread in the project, by focusing on the round element in most of the posters. This represents the sun. I have tried to simplify the sun and capture it in these posters.","I don't believe there will be any risks with this project, as I have some experience with it."

We are individuals and express ourselves in many different, unique, and creative ways. Fashion is the most visual aspect of our personality and we should embrace it! Fashion is and should always be fun, an extension of our personality and not defined by gender!!My brand will make its own rules, tearing up the fashion book and turning it on its head. I will be releasing new pieces throughout the year, all being produced in the midlands using local businesses and suppliers whilst offering opportunities for work placements for fashion students. I believe fashion shouldn't be throw away and will always try to ensure I include pieces that will be wardrobe staples that come out of the wardrobe year in, year out!One of the main values rooted in the brand is about giving back something that I believe is important in all areas of the business from work related opportunities to charity!!The money raised will go towards ensuring the business is in the best position of being a success following the launch in April. The money will be spent on fabrics to continue to build the brands collection, updating the online store to ensure it provides a great shopping experience and creating a better studio space to work from that will allow for more productivity!Thanks for getting this far!!

I hope you find it worth funding, and I really think you will enjoy it. Thanks for your support!","Really, the only possible setback after successful funding could be issues with printing or shipping. I have a wonderful relationship with SGX Printing in Garden Grove, California, which works with a number of high profile and independent comic creators, and I do not foresee any issues with printing that cannot be easy resolved. I have seen the quality of their work, and the books are absolutely gorgeous to hold in your hand.In addition, their print turn around is expedient, and so I do not expect print delays - the only caveat to this is if things are held up by receiving the funding after a successful campaign. But I do intend to complete the coloring and lettering, and then start the printing process soon after the campaign ends. And just in case, I do have a backup printer.All the pages of the book are already inked. Lettering is ready to go as soon as coloring is completed. I had an initial run of the book previously printed in black and white, and it is absolutely gorgeous.Shipping is never 100% safe or timely, though I have plenty of experience shipping important documents on a daily basis through my work. I will ship out all copies bagged, boarded, and snug between heavy cardboard in bubble mailers. I'm confident that 99% of the outgoing copies will arrive in pristine condition to all customers, and I would make it right for any that didn't.I can't really think of any other major setbacks that could arise. All copyrights and contracts are secured, artists are happy and excited, and I know exactly what the final product will look like from the test print. We just need your help us cross over the finish line!"

AN ANCESTRAL CULTURE. THE PENINSULAR JUNGLE THAT LEAD TO THE CARIBBEAN SEA… “The rebirth of the sacred Mayan bee”, We call upon  humanity to collaborate in safeguarding and assisting the repopulation of the melipona bee in the mayan communities of Tulum, Mexico.En las zonas tropicales y subtropicales del mundo habitan abejas del género meliponini, cuya característica principal es que tienen un aguijón muy reducido, atrofiado, razón por las que son conocidas como ""sin aguijón"". Existen alrededor de 500 especies en el mundo.En la península de Yucatán, los mayas tuvieron una relación muy importante con una abeja de este género: la Melipona Beecheii.Xunan Cab, ""dama real"" en lengua maya, es la abeja melipona que ha ocupado un lugar muy importante en la religión, la cosmogonía, el comercio, la alimentación y la medicina de los mayas ancestrales y del presente.Cumple un rol fundamental para el equilibrio de los ecosistemas. Son polinizadoras de flora silvestre y cultivos agrícolas. Su trabajo es vital para muchas especies.Sin embargo, las meliponas están en peligro de extinción.La tala masiva de selvas,las prácticas de la agricultura industrial como el monocultivo o el uso de pesticidas, el abandono del campo por el trabajo en zonas turísticas y, la introducción de abejas africanizadas en la Península de Yucatán, reducen drásticamente las poblaciones de meliponas.In the tropical and subtropical areas of the world lives bees from the meliponini genre.Their main characteristic is that they have a tiny stinger, atrophied, reason why they are known as ""stingless bees"". In the world there are 500 species of this kind of bees.In the Yucatan Peninsule, the mayan civilization had, and still have, a very important relationship with one of these bees: the Melipona Beecheii.Xunan Cab, ""the royal lady"" in mayan language, is the melipona bee that holds a very important place in the religion, cosmogony, commerce, food and medicine from the ancestral and current mayan people.This bees carries out a fundamental work to mantain the ecosystems balance. They are wild flora and agricultural crops pollinators. Their work it's vital for so many species. Nevertheless the Melipona bees are in danger of extinction.Themassive jungle devastation, the industrialagriculturalpractices, the countryside migration, -people leaving their communities to work in turistic zones-, and the changing beekeeping practices with the arrival of the africanized honey bee, which produces much greater honey crops, left the melipona bees almost disappeared and forgotten...Trabajamos en un plan de repoblación de meliponas en la Península de Yucatán.

With your help we want this year to cover expenses to establish another 150 hives more in mayan communities! The amount required will cover the following expenses:  The price per hive goes for an average of $1500 mxn ($75 usd)We distribute and donate the new colonies in nine Mayan nearby communities that we have a collaboration agreement with. Since 2013 we get involved with them in their organization process. In november 2016 they achieved their legal guarantee as Agricultural Cooperatives. We are working together to achieve an Agricultral Cooperatives Union, that allows them to get more autonomy in the management, marketing and distribution of their products.Somos un equipo intercultural que tiene en común el amor por la naturaleza, la cultura Maya, la meliponicultura y la agroecología. Nuestra historia inicia en 2010 con la adquisición de las primeras colonias de meliponas.Por años, nos dedicamos a investigar sobre abejas nativas, en especial la Melipona Beecheii. También sobre la importancia de estas abejas para los mayas, y las razones por las que casi han abandonado la crianza de meliponas.Teniendo como principio la interculturalidad, que entendemos como una plataforma de respeto para el diálogo entre dos o más culturas, la Fundación trabaja los aspectos económicos, pedagógicos, y sociales de la meliponicultura en las comunidades mayas de Tulum.Desde 2013 trabajamos en conjunto con nueve grupos organizados de la Zona Maya de Tulum. Hemos trabajando en conjunto unPlan de Repoblación de Meliponas.Investigamos y promovemos la crianza de estas abejas desde sus aspectos tradicionales en confluencia con la investigación científica. También valoramos los saberes del huerto tradicional en sinergia con la agroecología.Con el Renacimiento de la abeja sagrada de los Mayas, buscamos polinizar la importancia de la meliponicultura con una visión integral, para lograr prosperidad para la melipona, para la selva y para la gente que cuida de la abeja sagrada.We are an intercultural team that shares in common a deep love for nature, mayan culture, agroecology and meliponiculture. Our quest in learning about native stingless bees of the mayan lands began at 2010 with the acquisition of the first melipona colonies. For years now, we have done research about melipona bees, their biology and ecology. There is also a very important reason for us to integrate and awaken a team of local mayan experts as by tradition; bees and everything about them was considered as very sacred and still plays a very important role in their civilization.The tradition of beekeeping in modern mayan communities has progressively been dying out.  We make special efforts to bring this back and make it available to as many communities as we can.Through the intercultural approach, that we understand as a respect and understanding platform for 2 or more cultures, our “Fundacion Melipona Maya” seeks to continue to grow and expand its reach into the economic, pedagogic and social aspects of meliponiculture. Ever since 2012 we have worked with mayan dignitaries that have inspired us to keep the melipona sacred legacy. Together, we promote the knowledge of traditional agriculture, in relation with innovative agroecology principles and techniques. We have made an alliance between traditional and modern aspects of meliponiculture to find the best suited solutions for our challenges. We consider it possible, inside this knowledge-wisdom paradigm, to propose organic production options for self-supply and sustainable businesses models.With the “rebirthing” of the sacred mayan bee culture, we seek to pollinate the importance of meliponiculture and accomplish thriving communities of bees, their keepers and the protection of the jungle that houses these anciently linked communities.En 2016 hicimos un recuento de los avances que hemos tenido en la repoblación de Meliponas.

Highly nutritions and incredibly sustainable these foods have a long history that we want to share. They are making waves in culinary circles in Australia of late and soon in the rest of the world.Australia’s long isolation and vast area has created an ideal setting for nature to express its incredible diversity. More than 90 percent of the 30,000 different plant species found in Australia are found only in Australia! These unique plants, herbs and spices have provided sustenance to indigenous Australians for millenia. Our aim at NativeRepublica is to bring these truly unique fragrances, aromas and tastes to the rest of the world. We've ben working hard over the past year sourcing the best native spices from across Australia. from the desert to the rainforest. We've selected 4 of the best we call The Fundamentals; Quandong, Lemon myrtle, Wattleseed and Old man saltbush. Our Fundamentals gift pack is a great way to start your native food journey.              .    .     .     .   .   .    .    .   .   .   .   .   .One of the best ways to gain an essence of native bush food is via the herbs and spices. We've selected some of the most unique and distinctive spices for our collection; Quandong, Lemon Myrtle, Old Man Saltbush and Wattleseed...(and the new addition Mountain pepperberry). Each have their own unique aroma and taste and offer amazing nutritional properties that have nourished Aboriginal Australians for thousands of years. Don't worry we have recipes to help you get started.QuandongFunny name, delicious flavour! Quandong, or Guwandhang as it is known by indigenous Australians, is a fruit that has been a vital source of nutrients for indigenous Australians for thousands of years. So much so it features heavily in Aboriginal mythology across all the desert regions of Australia. Grown in the depths of the Simpson desert, South Australia, Quandong is unique to Australia. These sweet, glossy fruits, commonly also known as ‘wild peaches’, are packed with vitamin C, protein, complex oils, iron and zinc. While you can eat them straight off the tree, our dried ground quandong powder is just as packed full of nutrients. The unique sweet sour flavour of Quandong has made waves in culinary circles of late. Everyone wants a piece of this amazing fruit.                       .    .    .    .    .    .    .    .Lemon MyrtleLemon Myrtle is without a doubt the most popular of Australia’s native bush herbs. It has a fresh fragrance of creamy lemon and lime. Grown in the rainforest of northern Australia, indigenous Australians have long used Lemon Myrtle, both in cuisine and as a healing plant. With a similar smell and taste to lemongrass, Lemon Myrtle dried milled leafs have been used in a wide range of dishes such as shortbread; flavouring in pasta; with baked fish; infused in macadamia or vegetable oils; and made into tea, including tea blends. It can also be used as a lemon flavour replacement in milk-based foods, such as cheesecake, lemon flavoured ice-cream and sorbet without the curdling problem associated with lemon fruit acidity. This one is not to be missed!                        .    .    .    .    .    .    .    .    .    .WattleseedWattleseed, known to indigenous Australians as Myall or  Mulga, is an iconic central Australian bush food. It has been a staple food source for Aboriginal Australians for over 40,000 years and is now gaining the iconic recognition it deserves in culinary and nutritional circles around the world. Wattleseeds' high protein content, hardiness, low toxicity and low glycemic index makes it suitable for incorporation into many health conscious dishes including diabetic foods. Our Wattleseeds (sourced from across Australia) are roasted, much like coffee beans, and ground resulting in a nutty, earthy flavour with an aroma similar to that of coffee. Ideal for baking and roast dishes.                      .       .      .     .     .     .     .  .    .Old Man SaltbushOld Man Saltbush as the name suggests is salty! Known by Aboriginal Australians as Purngep or Binga.Many different varieties exist across arid regions of Australia. Traditionally used by indigenous Australians in dampers, and as a flour. This spice is great as a general spice and amazing with roasted potatoes, meat and vegetables.                        .     .    .    .    .    .    .    .   .    .NEW !!!!!!!Pepperberry (mountain pepper)Mountain pepper or Tasmanian native pepperberry (Tasmannia Lanceolata) is a shrub that grows in the alpine regions of Tasmania and south-east mainland Australia. It thrives in the type of cool, wet habitats that can be found in mountain gullies. The native plant produces aromatic leaves, and during the autumn months, the female species develops small fleshy black berries on its distinctive reddish stems. Both the leaves and berries can be dried and used as a cooking spice, and when milled, the hardened berries make for a terrific substitute for conventional pepper.

https://www.kickstarter.com/projects/1394870737/ligiin-ukhaa-artisan-style-cheese-in-mongolia?ref=discovery_category_newest,1394870737/ligiin-ukhaa-artisan-style-cheese-in-mongolia,"Ligiin Ukhaa is a small farm located about 60 kilometers southwest of Ulaanbaatar, the capital city of Mongolia. Urtnasan Tumurkhuyag was born on this land, and has lived here with his family ever since. Tumurkhuyag learned to make cheese from a Dutch cheesemaker about 20 years ago, and he has persevered through many hardships to continue in this craft.In August 2014, Tumurkhuyag was facing foreclosure and as a result, lost the majority of his herd of over 100 cows. At that time, he met Mike Morrow, the owner of a small business in Mongolia called Steppe Learning, which is involved in English language training. Mike helped to rescue the business and has been partnering with Tumurkhuyag to help this little cheese farm become viable again.At full capacity, this small farm should be able to produce 10 metric tons of cheese each year. This would require 100-150 cows, but unfortunately, Tumurkhuyag has only seven cows at present. He has no choice but to purchase milk from his neighbors, which is not only twice as expensive but also means paying cash upfront for a product that will require six months or more before it can be sold for a return.Our goal for this fundraising project is to raise enough funds to purchase 10 additional dairy cows (approx. $1200 each) which, along with the current 7 cows and the 5 calves born this spring, should be able to produce about 25% of the necessary milk needed to produce at full capacity.Obviously, we'd be thrilled just to reach our goal of $15,000, but if we could hit the $28,000 mark, we'd love to be able to purchase a total of20 cows.If we can raise an additional $10,000 beyond that, it will be enough to build a new underground cheese cellar, allowing for better climate control in the extreme temperatures of the Mongolian environment, which can reach as low as -40 degrees Celsius during the winter.After this, every additional $1200 would mean one more cowto help us move closer to the ultimate goal of a herd of at least 100.Although Mongolia is not traditionally known for European-style cheeses, it is actually an ideal place due to the high quality of milk. Not only is the environment still relatively natural and untouched, but the range-fed cows produce extremely nutritious milk as would be needed by calves in a harsh environment. This results in a cheese that is rich and delicious, and it's not so far-fetched to imagine that Mongolia may eventually become well-known as a place where high-quality Western cheeses are made. We are hoping that Ligiin Ukhaa will not only thrive as a business but quite possibly become a model that can be replicated in other rural areas in Mongolia.More than anything, we would love to offer a sample of our delicious cheese as a reward for all our backers, but unfortunately, we are not able to do so because we don't have a process established for importing cheese into various countries, including the U.S.Our supporters at every level will receive our deepest gratitude in a personal email and the knowledge that you are taking part in a venture all the way in Mongolia, PLUS updates on the farm's progress.In addition, we hope these little ""rewards"" will provide incentive to back us at higher levels. All backers at the $100 level and above will be acknowledged on a thank you board, which will be posted on the wall of our cheese plant. (No sample yet, as we will need to figure this out depending on the number of backers.)All backers at the $250 level and above will have an open invitation to visit the Ligiin Ukhaa farm for a day. Transportation to Ulan Bator will not be provided, of course, but we will happily drive you to and from the city so you can see the cows and taste our delicious cheese for yourself. Depending on timing, you might even be able to see the cheese making process as well.Backers at the $500 level will have the opportunity to NAME YOUR OWN COW! Obviously, we are limited by the number of actual cows we have, so we are limiting this to 15 for now.(We will definitely add more if we raise enough to buy additional cows!)","The biggest challenge for us will be the distance.  While we will do our best to make sure to update our backers, we'd also appreciate your patience and understanding if we can't be as consistent as we'd like to be.  Also, doing business in a foreign land is going to mean different challenges and unpredictable setbacks.  Fortunately, Mike has done business in Asia for decades, so we are confident that he has the resources and network to work through issues that may arise.",https://www.kickstarter.com/projects/1394870737/ligiin-ukhaa-artisan-cheese-in-mongolia?ref=discovery_category_newest,1394870737/ligiin-ukhaa-artisan-cheese-in-mongolia,"Ligiin Ukhaa is a small farm located about 60 kilometers southwest of Ulaanbaatar, the capital city of Mongolia. Urtnasan Tumurkhuyag was born on this land, and has lived here with his family ever since. Tumurkhuyag learned to make cheese from a Dutch cheesemaker about 20 years ago, and he has persevered through many hardships to continue in this craft.In August 2014, Tumurkhuyag was facing foreclosure and as a result, lost the majority of his herd of over 100 cows. At that time, he met Mike Morrow, the owner of a small business in Mongolia called Steppe Learning, which is involved in English language training.  Mike helped to rescue the business and has been partnering with Tumurkhuyag to help this little cheese farm become viable again.At full capacity, this small farm should be able to produce 10 metric tons of cheese each year.  This would require 100-150 cows, but unfortunately, Tumurkhuyag has only seven cows at present.  He has no choice but to purchase milk from his neighbors, which is not only twice as expensive but also means paying cash upfront for a product that will require six months or more before it can be sold for a return.Our goal for this fundraising project is to raise enough funds to purchase just one dairy cow (approx. $1200-1300 each). If we are able to reach our goal of $1500 for this project, then every additional $1500 will allow us to buy one more cow. It would be great if we could purchase up to 10 cows which, along with the current 7 cows and the 5 calves born this spring, should be able to produce about 25% of the necessary milk needed to produce at full capacity. But for now, we'll focus on getting ONE COW AT A TIME!Although Mongolia is not traditionally known for European-style cheeses, it is actually an ideal place due to the high quality of milk.  Not only is the environment still relatively natural and untouched, but the range-fed cows produce extremely nutritious milk as would be needed by calves in a harsh environment. This results in a cheese that is rich and delicious, and it's not so far-fetched to imagine that Mongolia may eventually become well-known as a place where high-quality Western cheeses are made.  We are hoping that Ligiin Ukhaa will not only thrive as a business but quite possibly become a model that can be replicated in other rural areas in Mongolia.More than anything, we would love to offer a sample of our delicious cheese as a reward for all our backers, but unfortunately, we are not able to do so because we don't have a process established for importing cheese into various countries, including the U.S.Our supporters at $5 and above will receive our deepest gratitude in a personal email and the knowledge that you are taking part in a venture all the way in Mongolia, PLUS updates on the farm's progress.In addition, we hope these little ""rewards"" will provide incentive to back us at higher levels:All backers at the $25 level and above will be acknowledged on a thank you board, which will be posted on the wall of our cheese plant. (No sample yet, as we will need to figure this out depending on the number of backers.)All backers at the $250 level and above will have an open invitation to visit the Ligiin Ukhaa farm for a day.  Transportation to Ulan Bator will not be provided, of course, but we will happily drive you to and from the city so you can see the cows and taste our delicious cheese for yourself.  Depending on timing, you might even be able to see the cheese making process as well.","Our biggest challenge will be to get the word out to potential sponsors and provide attractive incentives.  Unlike projects based in the U.S., we can't offer cheese as a reward, nor can most of our backers easily visit the farm.  We hope that the knowledge that you are helping a worthy cause and even contributing to the future economy of Mongolia will be sufficient incentive for now, and we'd love for you to visit the farm if you ever visit Mongolia.  Please help us to spread the word to others who might be interested!Another big challenge for us will be the distance itself. While we will do our best to make sure to update our backers, we'd also appreciate your patience and understanding if we can't be as consistent as we'd like to be. Also, doing business in a foreign land is going to mean different challenges and unpredictable setbacks. Fortunately, Mike has done business in Asia for decades, so we are confident that he has the resources and network to work through issues that may arise."

I'm here asking for your support to help me create a book that I believe can be so much more.This is a story of the rise, fall and vengeance of Shawn-Michael Grimm (aka Grimmjow).At an early age Shawn learns that the world is not made forthe righteous, despite the bonds he has made throughout his youth on the street and into the criminal underworld, this dark forsaken city is hopeless.After joining a criminal organization and rising to a prominent status he is betrayed by some of the people closest to him. With nothing left to lose Grimm swears on his life to avenge the loss of his new found family and childhood friend.I've built upon the aspects of modern era cities around the world to create Kingdom City. A city divided into districts of many vices and little consequence that come together to create original stories for each character, illuminatingtheir epic or infamous life.In his quest for payback Grimm will face new challenges and reunite with old acquaintances to claim what he so desperately wants...vengeance.The central figures of this book are the people Grimm encounters in the early stages of this tale of betrayal, vengeance and redemption. From his cyber punked-out companion, Fitz, to the heart of his hatred, Vincent Grey.THE BOOK - WHAT YOU WILL BE GETTINGGRIMMJOW'S REVENGE is a 10""x10"" narrative driven art book that features 110+ pages of character art, short stories and designs that encompass the back stories behind the characters, the details of Kingdom City and move the timeline of the story.Every page will be crafted with a mixture of Digital Illustration, Graphic Design and Typography.Tiers -There are two editions of the book to choose from along with some added extras with each tier.Standard Edition: softcover, perfect bound.Armored Edition: hardcover, dust jacket. (stretch goals will add options for book features )WHAT THE MONEY WILL BE GOING TO - I am asking for 15,000 as my Kickstarter goal. The publishing is where the majority of the funding will go to.Publishing will cost an estimated 11,000 to get the hard cover and soft cover books printed and sent to me. I also want to create additional items for the book such as slip covers and embossing.Collectables will be another large portion of the funding. Making prints pins and posters for my backers will take the second largest portion of the funding.STRETCH GOALS - Stretch Goal 1 = $15,000: Book funded, lets rejoiceStretch Goal 1 = $30,000: add 2 pages to the book Stretch Goal 3 = $50,000: add 4 pages to the book Stretch Goal 5 = $75,000: add 4 pages to the bookSHIPPING - I plan to charge for shipping after the Kickstarter ends via our pledge manager. The amount charged will be determined by the actual costs to ship your items to your location.For International Shipping: Please be forewarned that shipping costs could be substantial due to international shipping rates. I will do my best to get you the lowest, fairest shipping rate possible and not charge any more than it costs to ship your package. Once the product is finalized and I know the exact shipping dimensions and weight (sometime after the campaign ends), I will publish shipping prices for international orders on the Kickstarter page.","Sometimes unforeseen delays creep in. As delays unfold, I promise to keep backers informed as to their cause and what the revised schedule looks like. One of the team members or I will be addressing customer service issues throughout the process.While it's possible that the books themselves will see delays of weeks or months beyond the estimated delivery date, most of the other items from the collection are comparatively easy for me to produce and shouldn't contribute to any additional delays.It must be noted that many of the delays that I've experienced with other campaigns involve blizzards, flooding, Chinese holidays, convention schedules and other events outside my control. If everything goes completely without incident, I would be surprised. So, the best I can do is make estimates and a promise to do my best to make this go as smoothly as possible.",https://www.kickstarter.com/projects/bankshimself/grimmjows-revenge?ref=discovery_category_newest,bankshimself/grimmjows-revenge,"Hi, my name is Jovan BanksI've been working as a freelance illustrator since 2009 and now want to create a narrative based art book formed from a collection of characters I have created over the past few years.

After five amazing yearsand thirty two stunning issues, we are ready to take Auxiliary Magazine to the next level! We have out-grown our current format of free digital editions paired with print-on-demand editions. We want to create more ambitious content and we need to better support the creatives we work with and feature.We have chosen crowd funding to get us to the next level because you, our readers and fans, are our number one priority. You have shown us so much support over the years and we hope you will support us as we finally launch Auxiliary Magazine subscriptions!Over the years we have had the pleasure of featuring many new and iconic artists, musicians, influencers, and celebrities. We have packed every issue with quality content between exclusive interviews, fashion and beauty editorials, lifestyle articles, and music and media reviews.Our most popular issue has had over 56,000 readers! Through 2013, our average issue readership was 29,000 readers per issue spread out through 165 countries.Your support has been amazing and we can not thank you enough!We have never allowed outside forces to dictate content, believing in creating unique and honest content for you, our readers, so it seems only natural for us to shift our main monetary support from advertisers to readers. We have grown so much that our advertisers can no longer support us alone.Crowd funding allows independent artists to thrive in a world with fewer and fewer music labels, art galleries, publishers, and large institutions with the ability to financially support artists.We already have a printer lined up in our homebase city of Buffalo, NY to print our first run and we have already produced most of the content for our next issue. The only obstacle is funding!Subculture, dark culture, and alternative culture are more popular than ever. The influence and inspiration of darker subcultures can be seen in street and high fashion, mainstream and popular music, television and film, and society as a whole. But despite all this appropriation, actual subculture and underground scenes are suffering and struggling to survive. Auxiliary has embraced both unique underground fashion, music, and media as well as the mainstream manifestations inspired by it, believing that both together allow for the most creativity and the most possibilities. There has long been a great dialog between subculture and the mainstream, one influencing the other and back and forth. But if one is suffering this dialog falls apart and things begin to feel unauthentic. It is time to reclaim.We have always had the highly ambitious goal of being the ultimate alternative and subculture magazine to truly support the darker genres and scenes. As we take Auxiliary to the next level, we are putting out a call to action to reclaim goth, punk, industrial, steampunk, cybergoth, and grave wave for yourself. Make it what you want it to be and don’t be afraid of the terms, own them.We hope you will support this Kickstarter and be a part of the next chapter of Auxiliary Magazine!Please read carefully and make sure you select a package that offers shipping to your country.

We love our readers, you guys are the best!","We have been working very hard for several months to prepare this Kickstarter crowd funding campaign and to plan out the best way to switch the format of our issues from print-on-demand to a print run. We have been producing and publishing Auxiliary Magazine for over five years and have released thirty two issues with a high level of quality, consistency, and creativity. We have also been releasing additional weekly content on our website for over five years. To produce our content, we have made many contacts to pull the clothing from designers we want to showcase, to get early access to the music we want to cover, and to set up interviews and photoshoots with the people we want to feature. We have also pulled together an excellent group of contributors. There are many challenges to producing a magazine but we have had over five years to learn how to overcome them.A lot of planning and preparation has gone into this funding campaign. Almost all of the content for our next issue is already complete. We gathered quotes from several printers and have toured the printing and mailing facilities of the printer who have chosen to work with. We have decided on a printer in our home base city of Buffalo, NY to allow for on-the-spot proofing and to have a more hands on involvement in the printing and distribution process. Our quote is locked in for the next three issues so we know we will be able to fulfill subscriptions. We have calculated mailing and shipping expenses and most of our subscriptions will be fulfilled by our printer. Lastly, we have laid solid plans for the next chapter of Auxiliary Magazine and are prepared to execute them so that as we launch subscriptions and grow, we will be more than ready!",https://www.kickstarter.com/projects/jenniferlink/auxiliary-magazine-print-and-digital-subscriptions?ref=discovery_category_newest,jenniferlink/auxiliary-magazine-print-and-digital-subscriptions,"Dear Auxiliary Readers, Fans, and Supporters,Auxiliary Editor in Chief Jennifer Link here with editors Tasha Farrington, Mike Kieffer, and Dylan Madeley. After five amazing years and thirty two stunning issues, we are ready to take Auxiliary Magazine to the next level! We have outgrown our current format and want to launch digital and print subscriptions. Our new format of digital and print subscriptions will allow us to create more ambitious content and will allow us to better support the creatives we work with and feature.We have chosen crowd funding to get us to the next level because you, our readers and fans, are our number one priority. You have shown us so much support over the years and we hope you will support us as we finally launch Auxiliary Magazine subscriptions!Over the years we have had the pleasure of featuring many new and iconic artists, musicians, influencers, and celebrities. We have packed every issue with quality content between exclusive interviews, fashion and beauty editorials, lifestyle articles, and music and media reviews.Our most popular issue has had over 56,000 readers! Through 2013, our average issue readership was 29,000 readers per issue spread out through 165 countries.Your support has been amazing and we cannot thank you enough!We have never allowed outside forces to dictate content, believing in creating unique and honest content for you, our readers, so it seems only natural for us to shift our main monetary support from advertisers to readers. We have grown so much that our advertisers can no longer support us alone.Crowd funding allows independent artists to thrive in a world with fewer and fewer music labels, art galleries, publishers, and large institutions with the ability to financially support artists.We havealreadyplanned a system for offering print and digital subscriptions and we have already produced most of the contentfor our next issue. The only obstacle is funding!Subculture, dark culture, and alternative culture are more popular than ever. The influence and inspiration of darker subcultures can be seen in street and high fashion, mainstream and popular music, television and film, and society as a whole. But despite all this appropriation, actual subculture and underground scenes are suffering and struggling to survive. Auxiliary has embraced both unique underground fashion, music, and media as well as the mainstream manifestations inspired by it, believing that both together allow for the most creativity and the most possibilities. There has long been a great dialog between subculture and the mainstream, one influencing the other and back and forth. But if one is suffering this dialog falls apart and things begin to feel unauthentic. It is time to reclaim.We have always had the highly ambitious goal of being the ultimate alternative and subculture magazine to truly support the darker genres and scenes. As we take Auxiliary to the next level, we are putting out a call to action to reclaim goth, punk, industrial, steampunk, cybergoth, and grave wave for yourself. Make it what you want it to be and don’t be afraid of the terms, own them.6 different Reclaim T-Shirt designs with an oversize graphic on the front and Reclaim Goth, Punk, Industrial, Cybergoth, Steampunk, or Grave Wave on the back with Auxiliary Magazine andwww.auxiliarymagazine.combelow.

https://www.kickstarter.com/projects/martinpaulbrablec/thank-you-stella-a-live-concert-reading?ref=discovery_category_newest,martinpaulbrablec/thank-you-stella-a-live-concert-reading,"Since meeting two-and-a-half years ago in the first-ever Writing for Musical Theatre Class at Columbia College Chicago, we have been writing and re-writing the musical story of disgruntled, underemployed secretary/receptionist Stella Malone and her incompetent band of coworkers. Under the guidance of Grammy-nominated composer Ilya Levinson, we have nurtured Thank You, Stella from a three-song short to a full-length musical production. We will be putting on a live concert reading exclusive to donors, friends, and the movers and shakers of Chicago theatre in an attempt to get the show sold.While simply undertaking the process of production is enough of a capstone to our college careers, actually selling the show would be the cherry on top (only this cherry can potentially pay off our student loans).$2,000 is an insanely low amount needed to put on a live concert reading of a musical. In order to achieve that price tag, we have worn many hats and called in countless favors earned over the years, on top of getting a space (Columbia's brand-new theatre centre) and tech supplied to us for free through the college. The majority of the funds will go towards paying and feeding the talent-- Chicago's emerging theatre stars from Northwestern, DePaul, and Columbia College-- as well as an experienced and talented pit orchestra featuring professional musicians. The rest will go to production aspects: videographers, the director, the stage manager, and artwork. In order to keep costs low, we have agreed to not make any money from this concert reading despite spending years on the development; we just want to get this put on.Over the past two-odd years, we have fallen in love with the characters we brought into existence and the story they tell. Our main goal is to make you all fall in love with them in the two-odd hours of the show.","The biggest risk will be whether or not we raise enough money. In order for the production to go as smoothly as possible, we need the entirety of the budget we allotted to ensure we get the appropriate talent on and off the stage.While undertaking a live concert reading is a challenge in of its own, the staff we will have on board and the onstage talent (which we will thoroughly vet with auditions) will make this undertaking completely doable.This production will be entirely run and performed by college students including the best and brightest upcoming talents from Northwestern, Columbia College Chicago, and DePaul. There will be challenges popping up due to lack of experience, but the professionalism and eagerness to learn instilled in all those involved will allow us to overcome them.",https://www.kickstarter.com/projects/martinpaulbrablec/heat-a-rocking-new-comedy?ref=discovery_category_newest,martinpaulbrablec/heat-a-rocking-new-comedy,"From the day Martin and Corbin met in college, they knew they were destined to forge their legacy by creating a rock-and-roll musical that explores the two forces which govern the fabric of the human condition: firefighting and stripping. Thus, Heat was born.Heat follows a squad of firefighters who, in a search for self discovery, take up stripping on the side. However, they must contend with their hard-ass/hard-abbed fire chief, Marisol Briggs, as well as a mysterious serial arsonist hell-bent on rekindling old fires. As these muscled men shed their clothes—and their former selves—they must come together as one to defy the odds. Will they make it out on top? Or will their dreams go up in flames?",There are many moving parts to contend with when producing a piece of musical theatre. We will need to wrangle the creative staff and a cast of actors and help everyone reach a common goal.

This project will be performed by a professional Ballet and Contemporary dancer (see updates).My concept in creating art is to touch the sensibilities on topics that are often taboo, misunderstood and concealed from the mainstream culture. I am planning to film a painful process and show the experience of mental illness through dance. I want to make a beautiful dance video bringing a powerful and meaningful message surrounding a topic I am personally invested in, with the hope to potentially help raise awareness and honoured people suffering from mental disorder.Synopsis of the project:The project will portray a young female, suffering from a psychological disorder akin to bipolar. The piece will depict her opposing mental states, polarising them through their respective extreme characteristics. The illness is not to be explicitly referenced, but implied subtlety through various subliminal cinematographic techniques. This is to explore the hidden aspect of mental illness that is not always apparent but rather lies beneath concealed under a mask that we can only glimpse behind. In order to showcase the mood swings, manifesting symptoms of her mental disorder, she would successively perform both mental states by going from a graceful and peaceful behaviour to a creepy and disturbing one reflecting her bad-being, through dance and physical movements.The shoot will take place in very old and historical building or monument aged naturally by the passing of time having suffered ravages of nature and time; (different from a building which has been broken down, damaged by humans or subjected to vandalism). Ideally with high columns and arches are desirable (Roman, Renaissance or gothic architecture) with the possibility of playing with the reflection of the water and natural light.This is a link on my Pinterest where  I have the eventual location to film:https://www.pinterest.com/jujuandrea/likes/  orhttps://www.pinterest.com/jujuandrea/the-scream-of-the-butterfly/Previous Project :My last project 'I am the Innocent 'was a short film following by a life dance performance created towards my final module at uni and got selected to be part of a Dance Festival in London. The film explores the sexual politics surrounding four extreme examples found in contemporary society: Sex trafficking, arranged marriage, female genital mutilation and lapidation are the topics to be addressed and are all still practiced today. I wanted to create a powerful and meaningful message surrounding a topic I am personally invested in, with the hope to potentially help raise awareness. The video introduces the personal stories of four women each told through the mise en scene of the scenarios outlined above. It is purposely explicit but also seeks to juxtapose these realistic depictions with more ambiguous and metaphorical associations.See link for the video part:https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=efJB0PTM8bU","I am seeking about 1.000 euros to help me produce this dance film on a high quality so I can premiere at festivals and bring the film to audiences around the world.

They brought me and my friends together for many a sleepover.I want to take the music from these games and re-imagine them for the modern dance floor.Here's the kicker: I need input from all you guys on which songs to remix! When you pledge, you automatically get the ability to vote on what tracks you want to hear.*Note: all backer levels have a vote in what songs get remixed. For every 10 dollars pledged you'll get an extra vote.*---So here's the deal: I want to plunge myself into this project for the next 2-3 months. In order to do this, I'm going to need the means to focus my time and energy, as well as the means to make sure that the final product is as awesome and polished as I can possibly make it.This is where kickstarter comes in.What is the pledge going towards?If the pledge amount is exceeded, I'll use the money to do primarily one thing: make more music.(Have an idea for a cool reward? Let me know and we can try and set it up!)---","I'm scared. I'm excited.I'm scared because there's always the fear that I'll take some magical piece of artwork (like an original piece of music) and make a remix that doesn't stand up to it. Creative failure :(.I'm excited for the same reason.I'm excited because this is a chance to bring these classic and nostalgic video game tunes to a modern audience through a familiar sound. My aim is to make the tracks completely recognizable as video game tunes to the gaming fans while having the music sound like a great dance track for those who aren't familiar with the original source material.As far as risks go, the primary concerns are going to be related to the physical production process (mostly because I've never gone through it before) and the promotion (as with all musical endeavors, getting my voice heard will be a challenge).",https://www.kickstarter.com/projects/1499110495/shinshu-in-bloom-an-okami-remix-album?ref=discovery_category_newest,1499110495/shinshu-in-bloom-an-okami-remix-album,"The limited edition version of Shinshu In Bloom will have two bonus tracks on it (15 and 16) as well as night-time themed art.---Click here to check out the tumblrfor Shinshu In Bloom.*Quick Note: I've added two international options -- one for the $25 tier and one for the $50 tier. If you're interested in any of the higher tiers and you're international, please message me*Last note: All reward tiers will have the digital version available to them.Shinshu in Bloom is a Jazz-Hop inspired Okami remix album with 14 tracks,inspired by artists such as Nujabes and Marcus D, as well as Okami itself (of course!)The music is almost ready to go and we really want to release this album as a physical copy so you guys can get it in your hands. I think Elie's artwork is beautiful (see below) and I am stoked to have you physically hold this in your hands.There's an awesomeness to holding a heartfelt product that we hope to capture with this.Both Elie and I are fans of Okami (and Okamiden!), so I hope you will feel the care we put into this album :).Okami is quite literally in my top three favorite games (next to Braid and another game I won't mention). I played the original PS2 version on launch before it was even cool. In other words, I'm an Okami hipster (and there's nothing wrong with that).Furthermore, anyone who plays this game will tell you that the soundtrack is absolutely amazing.It's awe-inspiring how well done and immersive it is.I want to, potentially, bring this amazing soundtrack to someone who wouldn't have heard it otherwise (by making it more accessible).Most of all, I did it because I love music and Okami and it's awesome and I'm so happy with how it's coming out and aaaahhhwhekwlekaj.The funds for this project go to:Extra funds will simply be used to make more albums so more people can get a copy of Shinshu In Bloom. Depending on the interest we may end up doing a part two... just sayin' ;).By backing and sharing the word!Our rewards include Physical Copies of the album, a limited edition artwork Physical Copy, Posters of Elie's artwork (pictured above), and even some bonus Art or Music if you're really feeling it.Actually, if anyone has a cool idea for a reward let us know and we'll definitely consider it (does anyone want a t-shirt?)---I'm not intending on doing a second run, so this is probably the only time you can get these physical copies.If you want to support us, Okami, and starving artists like Elie, please purchase a reward and share this with your Okami loving pals.If you can't purchase it, that's fine too. I humbly ask you spread the word to help support Okami fan art and help us reach our goal :).My name is Zac and my artist name is Zencha. I produce all kinds of music, but lately I've found myself in this underground/Jazzy hip-hop phase. I also teach creative-process focused music production over at www.zenchamusic.com and my accompanying YouTube/zenchamusic channel.I'm currently wasting way too much time with Animal Crossing: New Leaf and League of Legends. I drink too much tea and I wish I could speak Japanese. One day!Elie is off fighting evil villains alongside Captain Blue (if you get that reference, you're awesome), so I'll write a bit for him.He's an awesome artist and you can find some of his hobby work over athttp://jarofoj.tumblr.com/. Art includes pictures of Tacos, Robots, and custom Teemo skins for League of Legends. Pretty sure he really likes Thai food... actually, I'm pretty sure he likes all food.Both of us dig Okami. Figure I'd mention that :).","I have not printed physical CD's or art before, so there may be some bumps in the road along the process. I'm pretty confident I can handle it though (I know many people who've done it so I can ask for guidance).Creating custom art is always a drag if it's uninspiring. I foresee that not being a big issue either but it's worth pointing out.Finally, creating a product that people like. Anyone who says that's easy is mad X).Reaching the funding goal. Okami fans are awesome, so I think we're set here too...Not much risk, really. We'll see..."

Your food will certainly think so! Fluffy, flavorful and so freakin’ good!

Every jar is made by hand and fresh to order. This way you can rest assured that your jar of Grlk is one of the most delicious things in your fridge. And take comfort in knowing it just may be the healthiest thing in there too! Every ingredient is consciously chosen for its freshness, quality, purity, and with your health in mind.There are endless possibilities to delight your taste buds with Grlk. It makes a healthy substitute for any condiment, salad dressing and marinade. It takes your chicken, meat and seafood from good to great.

Take Grlk and add a little more oil to it, then whisk and you have a healthy alternative to Ranch, Caesar or Italian dressing. The uses are really limitless.Q: How long does it last?A: Grlk is best used by 6-8 weeks.

Last year we were just testing the water so to speak but had a few well known buddies in Motez, Uv Boi, Luen & Tyson Koh hear about our little rave and dropped by. The party kicked all the way through the night till sunrise, a huge rarity in NSW these days thanks to Mike Bad. This year we're planning a much bigger, improved rave with the addition of a Funktion One sound system & a better lighting rig. Confirmed starters so far are Jagwar Ma DJs, MVC & Safari DJs. If we end up with a bigger budget than 4k, we will be securing someimpromptu sets from our buddies playing Splendour In The Grass.

Game development is about 1/3 complete, and we are raising funds for the students to continue working over the summer while school is out. The game is an un-timed casual game that users of all skill levels can play single handed. We're using Unity, and have so far completed the basic game mechanic. Here is some video of actual game play during development (keep in mind this is a test/demo build--we're still refining game play to make it more fluid and dynamic): Help That Frog eat some bugs, but be careful, you have to get the timing just right to catch those wiry critters. Bug size will vary, with different sorts of critters to try and catch, so be patient and wait for your opportunity. How many bugs can you eat in a row?One miss and That Frog is all wet! Catch the special firefly to give the frog a glowing halo and a free life.Like what you see?  Help us finish That Frog.Our initial funding goal of $5,000 will allow us to complete development of the Android version of the game, with 3 difficulty levels.Our first extension goal of $7,500 will allow us to port the game to iOS in addition to our initial launch on Android, as well as add a speed mode of play, in addition to the regular game mode. We may still eventually launch on iOS, but this would guarantee our ability to do that. Yes, we realize that Unity ports to iOS relatively easily, but there are some semantic and logistical issues that require additional efforts.Our second extension goal of $10,000 will allow us to really have some fun with the game (yes, we admit it). With these funds we can include a second type of powerup firefly, and we are going to create a That Frog action figure/figurine. We don't know what he'll do yet (if anything), but he'll exist IRL. Here is a prototype:Why is he orange? 'Cuz it ain't easy being green!(just kidding: we're making prototypes in random colors based on what we have lying around. The final version will either be green, or you will get a color choice.)We're making them with our handy-dandy Mod-T printer, another crowd-funded favorite.","The video game industry is a crowded market, with lowering barriers to entry at the mobile level.

After a fateful encounter one distant Halloween night, Future Girl discovers there's more to being a hero than a flashy costume or billowy cape. Aided by her faithful sidekick – the ever anxious Steadfast – and guided by The Horologist – an ancient and mysterious clock maker – Future Girl stops evil in its tracks no matter where or when it may strike. She is a warrior for truth, a beacon for justice, and defender of the human spirit. These are the adventures of Future Girl! Future Girl speaks to all of us. She is all of us. Future Girl reminds us that our future doesn’t belong to us alone, and that it is incumbent on each of us to remember that the choices we make, good and bad, affect more than just our own lives.  Suitable for ages 4 to 400 (no, really, the story jumps through time, so it's possible), Future Girl really is an all-ages comic. If you grew up watching Teen Titans or Captain Planet, or if you binge watch Where in the World is Carmen San Diego? with your kids, this comic is sure to please. Future Girl has depth, humor, and is action packed all at the same time, with life lessons people will take to heart.Isaac Asimov's three rules of robotics form an ethical foundation for AI robot development - they are, in effect, AI law in the Future Girl universe. But what if those laws were never written? What would happen if someone went back in time and erased those rules? That's what Future Girl volume 1 is all about.Can Future Girl and Steadfast right the timeline when it goes awry? Or will her arch-nemesis, Singularity, alter it forever? Will The Horologist give our heroes the guidance they need, or will he watch from afar as they forge their own path?Future Girl #1 is done. That campaign's rewards were fulfilled in 2018.Future Girl #2 is also done. That's right. It's in the can. Rewards will go out as soon as humanly possible when this campaign is done.Future Girl #3 is in development now!FUTURE GIRL (the comic) is the brain child of Ross Dannenberg and Jenn Arledge. The first arc is slated to be six issues, with each issue ranging between 28 and 32 full color pages.Issue one was successfully Kickstarted in 2017, and we're back to raise funds for issue two! (sorry it took us so long)The Future Girl TeamOn January 20, 2016, the US inaugurated a president unlike any other. On January 21, 2016, the Women's March in Washington, DC, was bigger than his inauguration (much to his chagrin). During that march, a friend took this photo (©Stephen Laico2016):As I looked at that picture, I thought to myself, wow, that girl is a superhero, standing up for what she believes in, for what she believes is right, reminding us not only that history will be our judge, but also that our children have to live with the consequences of our choices. Then it hit me... what if she really was a superhero from our future, watching us, judging us, maybe even trying to help us?And thus, Future Girl was born.Standard Edition - An issue listed as standard edition will be the comic book store version of the issue, with a standard front cover and an advertisement on the back cover. Unless you buy the Kickstarter or Variant edition(s) now, this will be only version you can buy from comic book stores.Kickstarter Edition - An issue listed as a Kickstarter edition will have a wraparound cover extending the standard front cover around and onto the back cover as well. Kickstarter editions can only be purchased via a Kickstarter campaign, whether it be this one or a future campaign.Variant Edition - An issue listed as a variant cover or variant edition will have a variant wraparound cover. Variant editions are Kickstarter exclusives, and can only be purchased during THIS Kickstarter. We only do one print run of these.This issue's variant cover is illustrated by Missy Pena (Steven Universe).Art Print - Add $5 to any physical reward level and we'll add a Future Girl art print exclusive to Issue 2!","Future Girl has already seen one successfully funded and fulfilled Kickstarter campaign. We're partnered with Arledge Comics, who has a 10 for 10 track record on Kickstarter. We have a small, yet dedicated crew ready to make this campaign another success. Issue two is done.

We're looking to raise £20,000 to shoot our feature film ""Sara, Exponential"" later this year. Below you will find some questions that you may wanted answering yourself. If you think of more, please contact me, and I will reply to you and update this page, too!Excerpt From SymbioteBelow is an excerpt of our latest film (currently in the final stages of post-production) so you can see the sort of stuff we create!So what is Sara, Exponential?It's a film; a full length 90+ minute horror/thriller/noir film which follows a series of grisly murders, the only clue linking each one is the crumpled note left in the victims hands, reading ""Sorry, Sara"".Why £20,000?Not only have we done our maths, but we've also had experience of making great films on tighter than normal budgets! Our film ""Symbiote"" was filmed in 2014, and will be being sent to festivals later this year. That was actually made for slightly less than £20,000, but there are things you obviously learn from doing such things, and this time round we don't want to have to skimp on anything!The Reward StrategyOur strategy is to offer you rewards that do not seriously eat into the money we're raising. It's simple; we want to spend the £20,000 we hope to raise on the actual movie - that's kind of the point. So, we haven't overburdened ourselves with costly perks that need producing; let's face it, the film IS the perk! Should we raise over the £20,000, then we will start introducing some rewards like t-shirts, but only when we have the whole amount. Of course, we also want to use any extra money to raise the production value of the film! More money means an even better looking movie!Why Kickstarter?Because it's all or nothing. That's the approach we wanted to take. If our pitch isn't strong enough to raise the £20,000 we need, than we haven't pitched it right to begin with! We know there are certainly the backers out there which regularly back movie Kickstarters asking for far more money than we are, so it's our job to get it right. And if we don't, no one has lost any money. That seems extremely fair!Why 40 days?We wanted to give us the greatest opportunity to raise the money possible, and felt that 40 days would give us more time to raise funds, without making the fundraising window too long.Who are we?We are Thoroughly Professional Productions Limited. A proper UK company set up by husband and wife team Simon & Marielle Birks to create great films. How do we do this? By using the best people to their full creative potentials.What else have you done?","Making a film is difficult and complicated. Logistics are always... interesting, and then, of course, there are cast and crew to manage. Locations can be problematic, as can equipment. And you mustn't forget access to toilets!How do we know all this? Because we've done it before. We've met these challenges. Overcome them. Achieved excellent results because of them.I could list out a few issues we've dealt with in our previous productions, but, looking at the end result, you'd never know. That's the point.We will get the best actors, ones we've worked with before. Same with the crew. We consider these people to be our friends as well as  our colleagues. We know their strengths.We're giving ourselves more time on this film than we have on any other. We'll be aiming to shoot five pages of script a day - roughly the equivalent of five minutes of the film. This is a sensible amount (for Last Contact we shot about fifteen pages a day, and still lived to tell the tale!)We have our main locations scouted. We will continue to look for more, but having the key locations known takes a little of the stress away.",https://www.kickstarter.com/projects/simonbirks/gone-an-atmospheric-sci-fi-mystery-graphic-novel?ref=discovery_category_newest,simonbirks/gone-an-atmospheric-sci-fi-mystery-graphic-novel,"Gone is our popular sci-fi mystery comic, about the AssistA robot, who wakes on board a vessel that should be home to thousands of crew, but is, in fact, desolate.Confused and alone, the AssistA sets off to find out where everyone has gone to.

It is a self-contained story, so you won't have to wait till the next issue!Gone started out a few years ago as a collaboration between Simon Birks and artist Tom Eddy. When Tom was unable to continue with the series, Simon chose to redo the art.After a good search, Simon chose artist Juan Fleites to redraw the comic, and because we'd already printed Tom's issue 1 and 2, we created digital only campaigns for the new issue 1 and 2.This helped cover the costs of redeveloping, and also create a following for the story.Anyone who backed the commissions in the previous digital only campaigns, will have their commissions in the printed version.We have two options for commissions:Gone is set on board a spacecraft called the Tantallon, after all the crew has disappeared.We're giving backers the chance to have their image drawn as one of the crew members in 'The Big Picture', a special double page spread depicting a scene on board the ship.It's kind of like a Where's Wally/Waldo image, but with backers as the crew.This picture will be part of the final printed graphic novel, and will also be sent out digitally to all the people who backed at this level.The £75 pin-up submission tier sold out in a few days, so we've introduced anew £85 reward tier that gets you a pin-up of you as one of the Tantallon crew!Drawn by Gone artist, Juan Fleites, choose to be a pilot, scientist, mechanic, navigator or gardener (or any other role you can think of!).See below for an example image.These images, will appear in the final printed book!£2500 - A Pair of Tantallon Beer Mats!Fresh from the ship itself!

You guys come first, so your rewards should too! *The Kickstarter track explained in the video above will be available for all kickstarter backers of 10$ and above. This track will be exclusively produced for backers only, and will be a fifth additional track separate from the EP. The track will never again be sold or available for download.Below we will list a few of the direct things we will be purchasing with your backing funds. However, as the music progresses between now and the end of the campaign, different needs may arise.The main concept for this EP is directly reflected in its name, ""The Collections EP"". We have broken the EP down into four of our favorite sub-genres within the Electronic/EDM musical genre, thus making a collection of genres. The four genres will then each be assigned to a song within the EP. After setting a base genre for each song, the fun and creativity truly begins. We will then use the gear that our backers have helped us purchase, and add a truly original akreacha spin to each genre/song. Also, we are aiming to blur the lines between these four genres and ultimately create new and inspiring genres in the process. The end result will be a completely innovative sound to stimulate the ears of all listeners. The four base genres will be derived from the list of genres below: Akreacha is a tag team producer duo based out of Austin, TX. The duo originally met in the spring of 2011. The two elements of the duo are comprised of Jeremy Gastrock (Kreacha) and Andrew Knoy (AK). The combination of these two births what you now know as akreacha. Since then, akreacha has been hard at work on their debut EP, ""The Collections EP"". The heart and soul of akreacha has always been none other than to change the world with music. After almost two years of pre-production, the duo is finally ready to put the finishing touches on the EP and share it with the world. Quality and community have never been anything but priorities for akreacha and thus two of the main reasons akreacha has turned to Kickstarter to complete their debut EP. Vowing to create quality, awesome music, akreacha has come to the Kickstarter world to finish this thing they call ""The Collections EP"" and show the world just what they have been waiting for.Below we have listed two short clips of two tracks that will be included on the EP. Keep in mind, these are UNFINISHED pre-production tracks, some of which will have vocals and other elements not shown here.

https://www.kickstarter.com/projects/583756379/west-coast-biltong?ref=discovery_category_newest,583756379/west-coast-biltong,"Having lived in Bakersfield for nearly 6 years, I have always struggled to find my favorite snack. Biltong has long been the favorite meat snack in South Africa, parts of Europe, Australia, and New Zealand.It's a natural, protein-rich, cured meat snack that has no added preservatives or colorants, MSG or nitrates. After making a few home batches and sharing with friends, I have discovered that Biltong has a place in the U.S., where South African ex-pats can enjoy a taste of home and all others can discover a tasty new snack to enjoy for years to come!The reason for vinegar is twofold. Our malt vinegar imparts it's rich flavors to the Biltong. Secondly, it inhibits the growth of mold and bacteria, prolonging the shelf life.All our ingredients are as natural as can be found, no hidden stuff !!The secret to any Biltong is the time it is marinated or brined. Too long, and all you will taste is vinegar and spice. Too short, and the curing process will take too long and not work correctly. We believe, and all our sample testers have told us, that our recipe hits the sweet spot between the eyes!As is a favorite saying in America ... when you can't find something, do it yourself!We will be establishing a manufacturing facility in Bakersfield to cater to the local as well as the California snack market. With your help, we will be able to fast track this plan to be up and running within 3 months of this project's close. In order to do this, we need a USDA inspected facility and to import specialized Biltong curing machinery from South Africa.The key to yummy, consistent Biltong, as with any food, is reliable, proven machinery. As South Africa has been commercially producing Biltong for longer than anywhere else, it was a logical step to source our machinery from my former home town of Cape Town.What you see below are arguably the best drying cabinets available at the price. The cabinets are modular, which enable us to produce small artisanal batches of high quality Biltong using many different flavors.""As a South African who came over to the States for a college tuition, my hardest goodbye was going to be to my wonderful little meaty snack of biltong I had almost on the daily! I am an avid biltong lover, who can vouch for this absolutely home away from home quality biltong made by Reg. Thank you to both Melissa and Reg for allowing me to have access to my little delicious reminder of home! I am one happy South African girl ❤️ ""Nicola Barrett, Women's Water Polo CSUB, Bakersfield""This place is amazing!! Better than any beef jerky and my friend Reg Woolston, the founder, has brought this delicious South African tradition to Bako."" Jennifer, Bakersfield""OMG!!! That biltong is amazing!Shewill eat it all up if I don't watch herNow I know what I'm giving to family for xmas! Thank you!"" Jodi, BakersfieldAs Vincent van Gogh once said, ""Great things are done by a series of small things brought together"".","As with any new manufacturing plant, there may be delays in acquiring the machinery and/or obtaining the required USDA as well as other regulatory approval and licences.My past work experience includes 20 years of setting up and running plastics manufacturing plants, from injection molding and extrusion, all the way to food container design and manufacture.While nobody can claim to be able to anticipate and resolve any unforeseen issue, my experience will enable me to react with a best practice solution in a timely fashion.",https://www.kickstarter.com/projects/583756379/west-coast-biltong-20?ref=discovery_category_newest,583756379/west-coast-biltong-20,"Usually made from beef, Biltong is a tasty & healthy snack, carefully marinated after a sea-salt soak, then slowly cured in strips to bring out the richness and flavor of the meat.Unlike jerky, Biltong needs no slow cooking, heavy flavoring, or harmful additives. Biltong is cut to deliver a soft, moist, cross section of the beef that is easy to chew and nearly melts in your mouth.Instead of tough, Biltong is tender; instead of dry and overpowering, Biltong is savory and flavorful. The process creates a taste that is mouthwatering and delicious like a fine prosciutto.The natural drying process concentrates the protein, so that Biltong is an ideal snack for active or busy individuals.After living in the Central Valley for 6 years after relocating from South Africa, I quickly realized how Kern County is California's heartland and a perfect place to build a business that will eventually create jobs for the underrepresented communities of this great city with its rich and diverse cultural history.No longer able to keep up with the demand of friends and family, we need an upgrade!A commercial drying cabinet and meat slicer imported from South Africa will allow us to dry and cut our popular Biltong at a much higher rate. This cabinet will be housed in our USDA approved commercial facility in Bakersfield, where we will be able to provide Biltong to Farmer's Markets throughout the state and online consumers throughout the country.My name is Reginald (Reg) Woolston, & I am originally from the West Coast of Cape Town, South Africa. Before I became a stay-at-home dad 6 years ago, I used my qualification as a Chartered Accountant to act as CFO and owner of several successful plastics manufacturers in South Africa.Now that my sons are getting older, I found the need to create something new, and after many sample batches, inspired by my mother's 100 plus year old recipe, I stumbled onto a new passion … bringing my Biltong to the U.S.""Thank you for allowing me to have access to my little delicious reminder of home!

The Story Station Skulls will premierat Open Books, a Chicago nonprofit working with school groups to encourage creative writingand literacy. If sufficient funding issecured, a second Story Station will be installed in the children’s section atthe Oak Park Public Library later in the summer. With additionalfunding, more locations can be sought for more installations.The beaded skulls created willinclude chickens, mink, muskrat, rabbit, raccoons, fox and other small creaturespresented in numbered plexiglass boxes. Eachinstallation will have 8-10 beaded skulls.Children (and the young at heart!) will be encouraged to write a shortstory about their favorite beaded head. Notepaperand a bulletin board or collection box for people to leave their stories willbe provided. The installation will lastat least a month, with the potential for it to be extended by mutualconsent of the location and the artist.The stories will be collected weeklyand reviewed for inclusion in a small, 12-page booklet which will be sent to donors who funded the project and also made available at the host site.The skulls for the installationswill be produced first (2-3 weeks), and postcard photos taken then. Reward skulls will be made next—while theinstallation is in place (3-4 weeks), then the booklet with collected stories(1-2 weeks) will be produced, and premiums mailed out.

Any additional funds raised will help with the costs of an artists' residency in Flagstaff, where I am working for three weeks to make this piece.The piece will comprise more than 40 animal skulls and bones with a vein of copper running through them, adorned with pearls, stone and wooden beads evoking the colors of rocks and the Western desert landscape.

In my high School i was very good in Mathematics and loved solving Puzzles even until today. I have been in retail industry for over ten years and have business experience in retail industry for over 5 years. I always wanted to create something and when i heard about the crowd funding from one of my friend i was always very curious that how it works? Then i did research and wanted to start on this platform. I want you guys to support this project, and if this project will be successful project we be coming out with more projects very interesting ones in near future. You guys will get updates as we will be moving ahead.With the support of our backers, we will have a very successful kick starter project.This Puzzle is very interesting, the level of difficulty for solving this puzzle is 4.8/5. you will be provided with guide which will help you in building up this puzzle.","With your support we will enter into massive manufacturing. This is our first project on kick starter, we will be learning a lot from it. I wanted to create more interesting puzzles after the successful finish of this project. Hopefully we will meet our backers expectations. we will try our best to keep our backers Happy. Thank you",https://www.kickstarter.com/projects/rab786/simple-credit-card-holder?ref=discovery_category_newest,rab786/simple-credit-card-holder,"In November 2019, I had a lot of problems with the chip of my credit cards. They were getting damaged. I had difficulty paying at a lot of the store credit card terminals. Some of the Credit Card Companies will replace your card for free but some will charge a fee to replace them. In February 2020, what I noticed is that I have a Bi-fold wallet and all the cards in my wallet get scratched with each other making the chips of the cards get damaged.So I started doing research, if there was something out there which is simple just how i have it but it will protect my cards too? The answer was ""No"". I thought of starting to design this Simple Credit Card Holder, which will be simple yet it will protect all my credit cards by keeping them in each individual separate slots. First, I started looking for good quality leather which will be durable and long lasting. Then I chose this Full Grain High Quality Leather.We have chose the perfect thread for the stitching to be durable and long lasting. Our manufacturer has carefully stitched it with hands and machinery. It has been stitched to remain strong during the life span of the holder.We have made it in a perfect size that can fit perfectly in men's front and back pocket as well as it can be used by ladies in their purses or handbags for keeping their cards safe.We have made this holder RFID safe, so it can protect your identity and valuable information of your credit cards by keeping your cards protected and safe.We have designed this holder in a way that it is simple and it is easy to use, that's why we have added a strong magnet on both sides. Unlike those other button holders if you forget to close it, it will close itself with the strong magnets on both sides. That way you will never drop or lose your cards.If you ever had chip malfunction on your credit cards then this is the solution to your problem. This will keep your credit card chips safe by keeping all your credit cards in each individual separate slots.We are introducing this Simple Credit Card Holder in two colors which is Black and Brown the most popular ones. We are planning that with your support if we will be successful in this project we will be coming out with many more colors and we will keep you updated.In this holder, we have designed it in a way that offers you a large capacity which can hold up to 9 credit cards as well as 2 slots for cash or coins.We have designed this holder in a size that can fit into almost every pocket comfortably whether it is your front or back pocket. It can also easily fit into ladies handbags pockets.","It was very hard for us to keep it a very low price but we managed to keep the prices reasonable for our backers so they can get the most for their buck. If our backers will be satisfied and happy I am sure we can grow and do more innovations for the society which will solve more problems and help more people.At this point, we need your support so that we can go into our mass production and make every one satisfied who will believe in us. Change is not always easy somebody has to do it for the betterment of the society, so we took a step please help us so we can all move ahead. Thanks!!!"

First, let my give you some general information about myself. I am an 18 year old high school student attending Mainland Regional High School in New Jersey. I have taken woodworking and engineering classes since the start of freshman year and have developed a passion and obsession with creating things out of whatever I can find. I always wanted to help my community and family with my crafts but I never knew how I could, that's when I started Aureus Crafts.Now before you go and say this is an attempt to form some sort of crack pot business, let me explain my idea. I only gave my crafts a name to sound more official that way my local towns and family could take me seriously when I say that my woodworking and crafting is my passion. I wanted to expand my talents to my town to help with restorations and new building projects. Besides carving and handcrafting small items, I have also been working on larger restoration projects on older buildings. Most of these have been volunteer work. I have grown accustomed to using hand tools but in order to expand my work, I need to upgrade my hardware a bit.This project is to raise funds to get myself a lathe and several other tools for a new workshop. So far, I have only been able to use my High School's tools but now that my high school career is over, I need a way to continue this passion of mine for as long as I can. I do not only work and dabble with small crafts, I take on larger community projects like restoration of old buildings and parks. This hobby of mine is truly a passion. I ask, please help me expand my field of woodworking further and save a dying practice that I wish to continue.","Well, like every other project, there is a risk. I had reached and advanced class level in my woodworking classes at high school, and work very long hours when I can before and after class. I have received much education through my classes in high school about woodworking and carving, however, there are always bound to be mistakes.     At times, some project may take longer as I do not stop until each one is perfectly shaped and sized. However, this, of course, leads to more time being taken. Each project will take time, and will be completed in a very quick manner. Everything I create will be finished by the time period that is specified in the timeline or I will personally contact the donor with new information about their item and donation.      If my projects fail to reach their time deadlines, I will add items in as consolation for time. I do not doubt my own skills and will finish every project in a timely manner and I sure hope that everyone can help me continue my hobby and passion. The items added will all be hand crafted. As long as others have faith in my craftsmanship, I will continue to create my version of art.",https://www.kickstarter.com/projects/1774031231/veterans-hall-in-dire-need-of-help?ref=discovery_category_newest,1774031231/veterans-hall-in-dire-need-of-help,"The American Legion building was first constructed in the early 1920's and served as a dance hall and community center. It was purchased by the  Progressive League hall in 1926 and then served as the church for St. Bernadette in Northfield, NJ before being converted into this post on Friday March 23, 1945. After being converted, it served as a meeting location for all veterans and as a community center for our small town. The American Legion Ladies Aux and Sons of Legion meet here and provide outreach programs to the community. These program have evolved into various types of public events school dances and socials. The building used to be surrounded by nothing by farmland but slowly through time, a town seemed to have grown around the building.I have volunteered a large part of my last summer in my town in restoring this building. As I had graduated from High School, I decided to enlist into the military and will be leaving very soon and decided that I want to give back to my community in a big way.My one option is that I needed to clear out the inside and outside of the building and give it a brand new start. The building is largely being kept original but any parts that need to be replaced will be. However, the parts taken out, I will use my carpentry skills and other skill sets to re-purpose them in the best ways that I can.My idea has included giving the Legion building a brand new flooring that is more durable, replacing its inner kitchen, and rebuilding the upper entertainment room that had stood since 1945. I also had plans to build a backyard social area complete with a fire pit, eating area, additional shading, and possibly a dance floor. This is to create a relaxing and comfortable area for these veterans to socialize and even share stories of their service.On top of creating this social area, I want to create a free ""Victory"" garden in the back of the property that my community can use to plant things such as fruit and vegetables and flowers. Anyone wanting to take a sample of these plants can carry them home may do such, however, I would ask that they continue to pass the torch until my community is filled with beautiful plant life as well as food which would either be given to each family that planted it. or even donated as a possibility. I want to bring back the old fashioned experiences that the family's of these veterans must have gone through during times such as World War II.Now you may be asking ""why I am only asking for such a small amount to do so?"" and it is because we have very few volunteers but a will to complete this project under any circumstances. The members to the Legion, as well as a few volunteers than can be seen in the picture. Dennis Mahon (Right), Marissa Mahon (Center), and Tim Phelan (Left) as well as myself behind the camera. We worked for around 3 months now and we still have much more to do. The money is to purchase more equipment to remove large portions of dead trees and branches that had chocked up the backyard.Up to this point, we have been using handsaws, push mowers, and even a machete to cut through the outside. The members of the Legion have been kind enough to donate their own tools to see this idea through. I currently have a sprained wrist from hitting a 6 inch tree truck for about 30 minutes to chop it down. I cut down the tree with a machete. We need any support we can get, even if it means putting much of my and our own money into achieving this for our town.While many others do not seem to realize is that this building houses many memories from our veterans and fellow soldiers that had returned from combat. They have dedicated much of the inside building to their fallen brothers and sisters that made an ultimate sacrifice. All these men and woman know what they were signing on for, and yet, still continued to fight and honor our country. All I am asking is that we do the same in return, in any way possible. I am not looking for fame, I just want to help those that came before me before I join their ranks. I know that military life will be a big change but I want to follow in the footsteps of my friends and family. I was always taught to give back in any way that I can and this would be my bestopportunityto do that.I will upload images as time presses on, and everyone can see how we made our progress with only hand tools.If you wish to donate tools, stone, dirt, or anything besides a monetary commitment, please contact us at mahonj21@yahoo.com or call the Vice Commander of our Legion at 609-204-2511.UPDATE 1:After being on my face trying to scrub everything, we are still trying to wipe down the upper floor facilities in order for them to be safe to use.UPDATE 2:So we have begun the clean out of the outside of the building and this work had been done with just a machete, hedge clippers, a push mower, and my bare hands.UPDATE 3:Progress has been going on with the project. It has been a long road that is both painful and enjoyable. I will not back down from this challenge but I am becoming desperate for help. More trees have been brought down via a machete.UPDATE 4:We have met our $1500 goal with a fundraiser that was held at the Legion Post itself. Thank you all so much for the the support and we have reached exactly $1500.00. To all the people that came out for the pancake breakfast fundraiser and donated, you were all a tremendous help and your aid will not be forgotten as you will still receive the same rewards.Thank you all! :)","Oddly, the risk of this project is that people may not see the pressing need that I do for this project. Any donation will be helpful. We are only asking for a minimum of a $5.00 USD donation to fund this project. I would hate to watch as this building is town away, ridding another piece of history from our world today. Thank you so much if you donate and the reward for donating will be shown soon."

It is not known how many of these were made but there are only about 15 of them known to still exist. This statue in Mortons Gap is an example of this model. However, it is in very poor condition.You can help preserve this unique piece of Americana by supporting this Kickstarter campaign. Your contributions will raise the money needed to reproduce the statue’s original head, arms and axe. The statue will also be refurbished and repainted. This restoration project will be documented in an American Giants’ video episode.In 2011, I visited the Mortons Gap Muffler Man for the first time. I had seen a photo of it on RoadsideAmerica.com. This was early on in my documenting of these statues and I had not yet started my blog, usagiants.com. The couple that owned the statue told me the story behind it. In 1995, they acquired the statue in Fort Campbell, KY. It was already missing its arms and head at that point. The statue had previously been installed at Pistol Pete’s Pawn Shop in Fort Campbell. No one knows where it was located originally. Today, it stands in the couple’s donkey pasture on a hillside overlooking Edward T Breathitt Pennyrile Parkway. At some point, a handmade head was made for the statue and a normal-sized axe was hung from the statue’s arm socket. For more see the complete story here.I have returned a few times after that to see the Muffler Man and visit with its owners. They always asked where they could get arms and a head for the statue. Since International Fiberglass went out of business in 1972, there are no spare parts anywhere. However, a few people are making molds for replacement parts. In the 1990s, Mark Cline made a mold of a 14 foot tall Muffler Man. He has created a few other statues with it including a cowboy and a handful of soda jerks holding ice cream cones. After explaining the situation to him, he agreed to recreate the parts and make a new axe for the Mortons Gap statue. At that point I realized that the statue’s owners did not have the money to pay for the restoration – and neither did I!As part of our American Giants video episode, we will include footage of Cline producing the parts at his studio in Natural Bridge, VA. We will also cover the statue’s refurbishing and repainting. Finally, after more than 25 years, this statue will look as good as new.The money for this blog, the video episodes, and our travel expenses have all come from our own pockets. We are now asking for your support for this special project. We are also offering rewards (see the column on the right) for your Kickstarter contributions. This project has also prompted us to finally produce American Giants t-shirts! Right now, they are only available with your contributions. Of course, the greatest reward is knowing that you helped preserve one of these rare statuesSadly, one of the owners passed away while we were getting this campaign organized. This project will be carried out in his memory. Since this statue is located on private property, it is only visible from a distance. However, thousands of people will see it each day from the highway. I really appreciate all your support and help in completing this project. If you have any questions, please e-mail me at joel@usagiants.com","In 2013, the American Giants team began laying the groundwork for this Kickstarter campaign. This project is already well on its way. Mark Cline has already begun recreating the Morton Gap Muffler Man’s head and arms. We also have the enthusiastic, full support from the statue’s owners.  Once the funds have been raised, we will install the new head and arms.  The statue will then be refurbished and repainted. We will then deliver the statue to Mortons Gap. Our film crew will be on hand to document the event. The footage will be featured in an upcoming episode of American Giants.Since so much of the work has already begun, there is no risk to your contribution. We are fully committed to this project  and, with your donations, we hope to deliver the restored statue by this summer.

On to Stretch Goals.Thanks to everyone who made pledges to our Kickstarter campaign, we were able to reach our goal on Friday 26, 2014. A few days ago we reached our first stretch goal of $1,875 which cover our fiberglass costs, thanks so much! We are very excited to have reached these goals and are fully committed to restoring the Mortons Gap Muffler Man. We could not have done this without your support.We would like to announce two more fundraising goals. We are hoping to raise the total to $2,300 to help cover the cost of soda blasting the statue before proceeding with the new paint job. We have been told it will cost us $700 to soda blast but we are searching for cheaper options. This will result in a smoother surface than sanding the statue by hand. These additional contributions will also be used to reproduce the lettering on Luke’s chest. If we reach $2,500, that money will be used to reproduce the statue’s hard hat, that we believe he once had.Last week, we made some exciting discoveries about this statue’s history. While we were removing about six layers of paint, we noticed some faint lettering underneath. When we reached the first layer of paint from the early 1960s, we found the name “Implement Specialty Co Inc.” printed on the statue’s right chest.  Soon thereafter, we uncovered the name “Luke Lombard” on the statue’s left chest.We assumed that Luke Lombard was probably the owner of the Implement Specialty Co.  However, after a few days of searching through 1960s newspapers, I found that not to be the case and unraveled the mystery.  Lombard was a popular brand of chain saws in the 1960s and Luke Lombard was apparently the company’s mascot.  In the mid-1960s, illustrations of Luke as a square jawed worker in a hard hat appeared in chain saw dealership advertisements nationwide.With this new information, we will be restoring both names on the statue’s chest.  In addition to replacing the missing arms and head, we are hoping to have Mark Cline make a new hard hat for the statue.We are very excited about piecing together this statue’s history. Without your pledges which have made this restoration possible, it’s unlikely that anyone would have discovered the statue’s old lettering. The American Giants team and Big Luke really appreciate your support!The Statue's OriginsIn 1962, Prewitt Fiberglass Animals produced the very first “Muffler Man” statue.  Around 1963, the company was purchased and renamed International Fiberglass.  By using and modifying the original Paul Bunyan mold, hundreds of these giant statues were produced in the 1960s and 1970s.  Today, less than 200 of them are scattered around the country.In addition to cowboys, Indians, pirates, astronauts, and other variations, International Fiberglass also produced a 14 foot tall Paul Bunyan statue.  It is not known how many of these were made but there are only about 15 of them known to still exist.  The statue in Mortons Gap is an example of thismodel.  However, it is in very poor condition.The Mortons Gap Muffler ManI saw a photo of the statue posted atRoadsideAmerica.com. Later that year, I was able to see it myself. This was early on in my documenting of these statues and I had not yet started my blog, usagiants.com.  The couple that owned the statue told me the story behind it.  In 1995, they acquired the statue from Pistol Pete's Pawn Shop near Clarksville, TN.  It was already missing its arms and head at that point. No one knows where it was located originally.Today, it stands in the couple’s donkey pasture on a hillside overlooking Edward T Breathitt Pennyrile Parkway.  At some point, a handmade head was made for the statue and a normal-sized axe was hung from the statue’s arm socket. For more, see the complete story here. I have returned a few times after that to see the Muffler Man and visit with its owners.  They always asked where they could get arms and a head for the statue.

After explaining the situation to him, he agreed to recreate the parts and make a new axe for the Mortons Gap statue. I realized that we did not have the money to pay for the restoration, but I went ahead and committed to the project.The Restoration ProjectIn April 2014, I launched a Kickstarter campaign to raise funds for the statue's restoration. Although there was a lot of enthusiasm, we fell short of the $4,500 goal. The greatest challenge has been to get the word out to those who are interested in being a part of restoring these icons of Americana. This time we are spending more time on publicity. We have also lowered our funding goal to $1,575. Our focus will be on installing the statue's new head and arms.We will also repaint the statue. If we exceed our goal, we can use that money for more extensive fiberglass repairs.We have already obtained the new head, arms and axe for the restoration. Although we paid for the new parts, we are hoping some or all of this will be reimbursed with this Kickstarter campaign. We also need financial help with transporting the statue to our workshop for assembly and painting. Some of the funds raised will also go towards producing a video documentary about this project.New Kickstarter RewardsWhile we have lowered our fundraising goal, the actual cost of this project remains the same. However, we want to make sure that you have some nice incentives for your contributions. With some generous donations from the RoadsideAmerica.com, Gabriel Aldaz, and others, we are offering some great rewards.Closing NotesWhile we were organizing this Kickstarter campaign, one of the statue's owners passed away. It is even more important to us now that we follow through to complete this project in his memory. This statue is located on private property and is only visible from a distance.  However, thousands of people will see it each day from the highway.  I really appreciate all your support and help in completing this project.

https://www.kickstarter.com/projects/blanqpage/retro-design-board-game?ref=discovery_category_newest,blanqpage/retro-design-board-game,"Unique design and gameplay.This project is all about making a retro game design game that shows the love of retro arcade gaming, but brings it home in a board game that anyone can enjoy.The game should be a statement for the great founders of gaming, but also celebrate real life fun and games with friends and family at home.And, you even have the chance to be a part of the designing yourself...Here is a picture of the first sketch. The end product will be much slicker and with nice materials and additional board pieces. But this give you an idea of the concept.The goal is to make a killer crossover from designing apects to a really great gaming experience that is easy to learn, but hard to master.There are some really cool features to this game. The end score for example is the 64 bit picture that will be created at the end of the game. It should be a unique outcome every singel game you play! It's not like a standard board game you have ever seen. It's magnetic, its fresh, and it is easy to startup, use and stow away. You might even be able to use it as art on your wall!The board is based on a retro 64 bit. The score card is 64 bit (8 x 8 bits) but also the icon's that are used to play the game are made up of 8 x 8 bit designs. I'm working on making the rules as infographic as possible to avoid tons of reading before the game.It's a 1-4 player game. And plays multiple rounds to get to the end. Every round the board changes by the input of the players.There are also some online sharing possibilities that i'd like to try out. And... the game has a secret way to create and easily memorize real life passwords in a visual way that only you can decipher!This game is just a hidden gem, waiting to be found!I have experience in board-game development, but to get a game on the market is very difficult when you have to deal with ivestments and big company's that control the market.The goal is to make this game happen for real because of you and with your input.There have been some rough designing, just to get the basics right. And there has been some testing already of the game, the flow and the rules.The thought in the game have been done, so now it's time to bring it all toghether.The plan at this point is as folows:It will follow a project plan to get to the desired result and to counter any risks that may occour.Why it would workBenefits of the doubtWhen you are still in doubt of being a part of this project. Please know that i will do everything to make this project unique, to make you own a product that is worth the investment, has status and value and the connection to all others who believe in the benefits.I will inform you about the process as much as i can, and find a way to interact where it is possible.The included video is the closest i could find at the moment to show how much i care for retro design...The lego robot is inspiration for the first sketch of the pawns i'd like to make for the game:I just wanted to show you something peronal to show i am cincere.I hope you believe in this going to be something special.","Starting this with the knoledge of decent project management and phasing we should be able to control all risks.The risk and challenges are to make the design up to the greatest standard. I do not want to make something that doesn't stand out.Another challenge is to put together the production, packaging and distribution and be smart about that part. But when we commit to this project we will see it through and make it happen. An opportunity is to make a crossover to internet where new alternative game-rules, your game results, even new designs, etc can be shared.And at last, another opportunity rises when i get shipping costs down. it would be great if that can be invested in quality or other perks of being a retro game owner.And, with you all backing the project and the kickstarter infomation that is given publicly here, we even decrease the risk that a big company might steal the concept and put there good name in danger.Te biggest risk... not to give it a go right away!",https://www.kickstarter.com/projects/blanqpage/play-design-the-american-football-card-game?ref=discovery_category_newest,blanqpage/play-design-the-american-football-card-game,"The 12th of November in 1892 is the date of a never to be forgotten moment in sports history.

It's within your reach as the final cut of PLAY DESIGN is here!PLAY DESIGN is a great game, based on the American Football formations we all know and see today. But it is more than that.More than just a gameAs said, there are 2 sets of rules for you to play the game with. Each with it's own characteristics, depth and challenges. We like to give a little peak.The full version of the rules come with the game and will also be published after succesful funding. There are some additional rules that might be added later, as this is work in progress.If you like a fresh new idea of a good card game, with different stand alone ways to play, and appreciatie fine designing, this is a must have!What do you get?We are working on this project for a while now. We kept pushing on quality and we now finished the designing process. Parts of the game and the idea is shaped and sharpened in co-creation between America and Amsterdam. A part of the goal we have is to keep and make American Football one of the biggest sports in the World.Thank you for taking the time to look at our work. We hope you like to back this project so we can take the final step in producing American Football history on professional scale.The product should be ready way before the superball, and we will try to get it to you as soon as possible! We will keep you updated.All samples used in the movie clip and this page are of the first sample production. End product will be of better quality card than shown.","The hours, dedication and production put into this is all for the love of the game and card game designing. Making this a non profit venture for us, we would really just like to get it produced in somewhat larger numbers. We already have a print-ready design. There is a sample print, and we are finalizing production details. The challenge is that production printing is really only done well in somewhat larger amounts, so we need a little leverage to really make this happen (and keep it as affordable as possible). The challenge is really to have enough backers so together we can get the printing engines running! (way before the superbowl)."

The Montagues' are in San Francisco when their son, Romeo, is dragged to his first Ren Faire by Cousin Benny and first sees Julien dressed as a girl.

Characters Tom, Mother Amanda and Sister Laura live day to day with the absence of Tom’s father hanging over their every decision. Tom dreams of a life more exciting than working on the docks to support his family while Laura, sweet and shy, finds solace in her menagerie. Their once southern belle mother, Amanda, fights to hold on to the glory and promise of her youth, now starkly contrasted to their cramped city apartment. Tom, desperate to find an out to their stagnant existence invites Jim for dinner in what quickly becomes a pivotal moment that can make or break this desperate family forever.Tennessee Williams’ play has been an American favorite since it’s Chicago premier 67 years ago. Long thought to be his most autobiographical play, the visceral emotions and predicaments of the Wingfield family still grab sharp relevance today. Without being socio-political, The Glass Menagerie asks a simple question that we all face in our lives: “Did I make the right choice?” Fury Theater Company is excited to bring this production to life at Indian Boundary Park. This West Rogers Park Tudor-style field house has seen theater in the past but now stands ready to revive exciting productions of both classics and modern works. We want to give The Glass Menagerie, our inaugural production, its full artistic due diligence.

He has risen to a level of prestige that few writers have achieved and his works deserve it.Oleanna is no exception and some of the themes in Oleanna have always interested me - political correctness, the concept of ""tyranny by the weak"", the role of a liberal education and feminism.I am really excited about putting this well known play together.  I love the cast we have - they are perfect for the roles.  The production team is awesome.  And I really want you to see and experience what David Mamet wrote!""

Production costs can make or break not only the production but the production company as well!  Your help will allow us to front load a large part of our expense, let us keep ticket prices low, and keep our company solvent and ready to tackle the next production.

We've met with some success doing this, but there are a few major problems with doing a POD magazine:What we want to do is take the magazine to a traditional offset press. This will allow us to do a LOT of very, very exciting things with the magazine. Imagine if you will a traditional Victorian magazine, one that readers in New York City or London of the 1890s would enjoy off the newsstand. Now take that same magazine and have it covering a subculture which seeks to emulate the optimism of that period.Suffice to say, we want to create the new Doctor Fantastique's Show of Wonders magazine as a Victorian magazine using the same or similar types of paper, similar typeface, and be able to offer things like subscriptions, single issues for sale at US$6.99/CD$8.99 as opposed to $17.63, and be able to sell these to you at conventions as well as other Steampunk events.We want to take the magazine to offset in order to make a better product for you, the fans of Steampunk. In order to do that though, we need your financial support. We're running on a shoestring budget as it is, and though we're offering subscriptions on our website right now, we want to offer another way for you to support our mission. So if you want to see Doctor Fantastique's become the best magazine possible, and believe me we're going to knock your socks off, please donate whatever you can.Your donation is meant to help with the first 3 issues of 2012 -- January/February, March, and April.

It's a much smaller amount than our last fundraiser -- $1,700 as opposed to $12,000 -- because after some thought it was determined that the most important thing was to have the first 2012 issue printed as an offset magazine in the way that we choose.Imagine if you will a traditional Victorian magazine, one that readers in New York City or London of the 1890s would enjoy off the newsstand.

The book will include over 120 full colour pages perfect bound into a trade paperback format.Sliced Quarterly is a playground for creators to experiment with the comic book narrative. We aim to showcase simple, authentic, literary stories told in extraordinary ways. Creators are invited to test the traditional norms of the medium, and in so doing, elevate how they connect and communicate with the reader. Each issue displays the value of sequential narrative art in it’s ability to be insightful, emotive and provocative.HOW the story is told is as important as WHAT it’s about.All four issues can be read and downloaded for free on our website, so you really can try before you buy, however the book will also include bonus material not available in the website editions.

https://www.kickstarter.com/projects/samandoliver/sam-and-olivers-stoke-chipotle-pepper-sauce?ref=discovery_category_newest,samandoliver/sam-and-olivers-stoke-chipotle-pepper-sauce,"Like most start-up food businesses, I enjoy my discoveries and new creations. I love tinkering and coming up with something delicious. I share my creations with my friends and family and often give it away to co-workers and in its early stages, hoping to solicit some critical feedback and suggestions. Everything started off as a hobby in the kitchen, but then...Eventually word spreads, people start requesting food and sauces for parties, at home or for their lunch. Then that small little hobby becomes a mini production. Volumes grow. Recipes become variants of each other and the next thing you know, you have 70 different ways to make barbecue or hot sauce.Then comes the day when a good friend casually makes a comment like ""Wow, this is incredible... you should sell it! I would buy this if it were at the store."" And then, you start to believe in yourself, put some samples out there and people start agreeing.Sam & Oliver, LLC was started mid 2014 with the intention of bringing a healthy, quality and delicious alternative to commercially available hot sauce, barbecue sauce, spices or marinades to the market for others to enjoy.From early on my older dog, Oliver, taught me a lot about focus. We are always on the go. One day I was in a rush and Oliver refused to come into the house, so I went out to fetch him from the yard. As I got closer, Oliver laid down and refused to comply with my request. Out of frustration, I stood over him and exclaimed ""Fine, if you aren't moving neither am I"" And there I sat in the grass.The warm sun and sounds of the day slowly washed over me and the sounds of cars, thoughts of tasks and work faded away and the songs of birds filled my ears.What Oliver had done was teach me to be still. To remain resolute and to relax. Oliver had helped merealizethat I needed to stop worrying andfocuson nature and all the good things around me.Many of life's greatest discoveries and changes happened because someone dared to question why, or why not. Dared to color outside the lines or take a stand for an idea or belief.Sam is a chaotically good-spirited companion with a combination of heart and free spirit; a pathfinder... benevolent and a complete disregard for my regulations.Sam has been picked up by the police for breaking out of the yard, stung by bees for wandering into the bushes, stepped on for getting underfoot and even trapped himself in a closet. If it happens, it happens to Sam. That's not to say he doesn't go looking for trouble, but trouble always seems to find Sam, somehow.One particular day, Sam had managed to wiggle himself between the fence and a large shrub and ran off into the woods. I gave chase, and it was a cat-and-mouse game of tag for about 15 minutes. Every time I thought I had caught up, Sam ducked under a tree or through a bush. My own small dog was outsmarting me.When I finally managed to catch up to Sam, he had already made his way back to the yard. I shook my head and admired his tenacity to find adventure and fun in the world so full of boundaries and rules. I turned and locked the gate behind me, then started to head back into the house when I heard a rustling in the bushes behind me. As I turned and looked, Sam was on the other side of the fence again, watching me for a brief moment before dashing back into the woods.Sam taught me to let my guard down, to take chances and always enjoy a level of excitement in everything I do. To sometimes go against the grain and to sometimes take the road less traveled.How can something so apparently opposite actually create a complementary relationship?By themselves, Sam or Oliver are fun loving, free spirited companions that will bring cheer and warmth to my day. when they are together, their complementary methods of interaction form a dynamic relationship that cannot be broken. They are an indivisible whole; a team and an inspiration for my company. Sam & Oliver is something to model myself around; to stay resolute, passionate and confident. To take chances, focus on the good and enjoy the adventure.Sam & Oliver currently has produced a product called Cinder Habanero hot sauce. This hot sauce is a healthy choice for a food sauce that focuses on all-natural ingredients with an emphasis on spice, flavor and flexibility without overpowering your food or ruining your day.I insisted on only top-shelf wholesome ingredients like red habanero chilies, butternut squash and diced red tomatoes in this Gluten Free hot sauce. Cinder Habanero is also Paleo diet friendly, so it won't ruin your diet either.Last year, I produced Cinder Habanero hot sauce from my own pocket. It has been selling slowly on Amazon.comand from my own website, http://www.SamandOliver.comCinder Habanero is available directly in single 5oz, 3-Pack Gift Boxes and wholesale by the Case of 12.Using the Hot Sauce Box, I also created a great gift box that uses minimal shipping materials, fits into flat rate envelopes and protects the bottles during shipment anywhere in the world.Sam & Oliver's Cinder Habanero is currently priced at $5.99 USD for a 5oz bottle, 15.99 for a 3-Pack Gift Box and 59.99 for a Case of 12. Wholesale prices are $48 per case.Sam & Oliver's Cinder Habanero is available world-wide directly from http://samandoliver.com. Because the single bottle or gift box fits into a flat rate envelope, I can ship it overseas for a low rate that still keeps consumers engaged without having to absorb over-the-top shipping and handling costs or sacrifice quantity for what they want to order. About $600 in sales have been invoiced or sold directly from the website since August, 2014.Sam & Oliver's products are also registered onhttp://amazon.comfor free shipping when the consumer uses their Prime account. While the prices are adjusted to include Amazon's fulfillment fees, the overall price includes an added value to the customer and helps expose the product to a broader market. Over $250 in sales have been achieved from Amazon alone since I listed it late November, 2014.In person, from events or direct marketing to specialty stores, I have managed to sell about $300 in sales in the month of November, 2014 alone. I have plans to expand my sales region in 2015 to include Connecticut, Massachusetts, New Jersey and Rhode Island.Sam & Oliver's Stoke Chipotle pepper sauceIn the last 6 months I have been developing and refining my Chipotle pepper sauce after realizing that not everyone wants hot sauce on every piece of food they consume. Some people can't handle the heat, when others want something more smokey or mellow to spice up their rice, marinade their chicken or dip their steak into.Chipotle peppers are red jalapeno chilies that are dehydrated, smoked and reconstituted in oil for a rich, smokey flavor that's unlike any other combination of chilies around. The taste is not very pungent, but it is certainly distinct. The heat of the chilies remains intact while the peppers are reconstituted to a pulpy texture.Adding a delicious Adobo Sauce to the blend helps bolster this smokey flavor with a mouth-watering flavor of tomato sauce, salt and spices.I also bring in my signature butternut squash to the recipe, adding some healthy volume and mouth feel while introducing a subtle sweetness the winter squash provides without extra sugar. Diced Tomatoes, cracked black pepper and ground chipotle powder help bring up the rear with a smooth end note of heat and richness that the sauce deserves.I have a great artist who designs my labels for me. His work is incredible and I chose him out of about 25 different candidates who I screened for ideas. Below is just a prototype/mock label proposed for the new line, and may change slightly before production. It was designed similar to the Cinder Habanero line to create a consistent brand theme.Sam & Oliver's Stoke Chipotle pepper sauce will be marketed directly to consumers, restaurants and specialty shops. The product and the packaging are designed to be bold, clean and memorable, without being over-the-top and can be proudly displayed on a table or bar counter.Sam & Oliver's Stoke Chipotle pepper sauce will be produced in the same 5oz glass woozy bottles that the previous Cinder line was produced with. In addition, about 10% of the production run will be bottled in 1 gallon PET Food Grade plastic containers for restaurants.Yes, the price break will be the same for single, 3-Pack Gift Boxes and wholesale Case of 12, with the addition of the 1 gallon bottle for about $24.99 wholesale, initially available to Restaurants only.Proudly. I insist on it. Manufacturing will be handled in a great facility in St. Augustine, Florida called Endorphin Farms. Endorphin Farms is a licensed co-packer and previous manufacturer to fulfill my Cinder Habanero hot sauce line. Their website and information can be found athttp://www.bottle-my-sauce.com/.Due to end-of-year schedules and holidays, a tentative date of production as early asJanuary 15th, 2015.In 2015 I plan on selling the product at special agriculture and community events such as:Yes! We are fully licensed and fully insured through the State of Connecticut's Department of Consumer Protection and the Federal Government's FDA industry systems. We also hold a full coverage, current product and business liability insurance policy through The Hartford.Amazingly in 2014, I entered both my Cinder Habanero hot sauce hand-made recipe, along with one of my future product BBQ 'Carolina Gold' style sauce to the Durham Agricultural Fair (one of the biggest shows in the New England area) and took 1st place overall in both categories out of hundreds of entrants.I am seeking funding to pay for the complete production of 1800 bottles of Sam & Oliver's Stoke Chipotle pepper sauce.Professional production is costly and requires a minimum order quantity commitment. Adding multiple products, albeit better to have a selection on hand to cover a spectrum of consumer desires, will exhaust my start-up capital personally invested thus far.Funding will cover:Thank you to everyone who has shown interest and backed my project. I have big plans to grow in 2015 and through the future.Jeff MaginnissChief Spice OfficerSam & Oliver, LLCTo Express my gratitude for backing my project, the following rewards will be made available and ship to backers no later than mid-to-late February, 2015:Two (2) Bottles of Sam & Oliver's food sauce products, including:One (1) 3-Pack Gift Box of Sam & Oliver's food sauce products,and memorabilia including:Two (2) 3-Pack Gift Boxes of Sam & Oliver's food sauce products,and memorabilia including:Two (2)3-Pack Gift Boxes of Sam & Oliver's food sauce products, Sam & Oliver apparel and memorabilia including:","Some things to consider, setbacks may exist in the manufacturer's production schedule including maintenance, ingredient sources and packaging.Some logistical delays are always a possibility, however the last product line that used Endorphin Farms went through without a hitch and within a few weeks I was the proud owner of 1800 bottles of Cinder Habanero hot sauce!",https://www.kickstarter.com/projects/samandoliver/sam-and-olivers-new-sparks-seasoning?ref=discovery_category_newest,samandoliver/sam-and-olivers-new-sparks-seasoning,"Sam & Oliver's vision is to create and provide healthy alternatives to mass-produced, commercially manufactured condiments.Sparks seasoning is no exception, and will be a delicious blend of smoked habanero, fiery cayenne pepper, roasted garlic and onion, and other tasty ingredients. The product is designed to be used as a rub, as a seasoning, in chef's butter, as a component for dredging food and more.The recipe is finalized. The manufacturing is locked in, and the ingredients are already sourced. All we need to do on our end is finalize the labels, get the FDA approval and register with the Process Authority. This gives us the green light to schedule production. Once on the schedule, manufacturing takes anywhere from 2-3 weeks. Sparks will become available immediately after production is completed.Sparks will be available in two sizes: 4oz individual glass shaker containers (Retail packaging) or in 7 pound containers for food service applications. Other sizes may be used depending on demand.Funds will be directly used for:Paying for the ingredients, the containers, labels and graphical design of the label, the registration with the FDA and PA, the manufacturing expenses and labor, and transportation of the product post manufacturing.","Backlogs with the FDA and Process Authority could push the production date back until both integral approvals are met.  Sometimes the red tape can push back, even when all sides are in agreement.Container availability is also a factor that can put a damper on the process, but that's rarely the case, and we won't be using a non-standard retail container."

Highly toxic synthetic colors and fixators are used because they are cheap. Organic cotton alone is not enough, the true danger lies in synthetic colors.All these toxins are absorbed by the skin of our children! The healthy alternative is here, actually natural indigo dyeing is known to humankind since 3000 b.c. but today more expensive to produce.Mario MARGA Clothing is also hand-dyed with old indian tradition, fair and sustainable in the production. One can even smell the genuine indigo and feel the love behind this product!The first Mario MARGA Kids Clothing Collection will feature two styles. One is the Sweatshirt and the other one of course the basic T-Shirt, which looks both super cool on your kids! The Sweatshirt is made of 100% GOTS certificated organic cotton and hand-dyed with natural herbs like Indigo or Rubia. It is available in all 4 colors which are discussed in more detail under ""The Colors"". The style is very basic and timeless though unique and a highlight. The labels are organic based and are sewed at the sides (easy to remove if wanted). The main logo is stitched extravagant and every sew is made with the focus on quality and durability.The inside fleece is super soft and feels very comfortable on the skin.The T-Shirt is also available in all 4 colors as described in ""The Colors"".Natural colors are very unique due to their natural origin. Mario MARGA uses only natural dyes and washes with indian soap nuts. No harmful chemicals, all natural. For the dark blue tones we use 12 dips in genuine indigo dye and for light blue 2 dips. The bright red color is dyed with Rubia, the rosa or light red is Rubia with fewer dips.Natural colors vanish approximately 10% after the first few washes, which is a sign of authenticity. No toxic color fixators are used!Indigo-Blue: Color obtained in old tradition from the Indigofera Plant and dipped 12 times. Hand-dyed.Rubia-Red: Color obtained from Rubia Plant and dipped up to 12 times to achieve the deep red color. Hand-dyed.Light-Rose: Same as Rubia-Red but fewer dips. Hand-dyed.Light-Blue: Same as Indigo-Blue but fewer dips. Hand-dyed.Material is 100% GOTS certificated organic cotton from India. Super soft and without pesticides or herbicides.Colors are 100% natural from Indigo and Rubia. Washed with indian soap nuts. No synthetics, no harmful chemicals.","Because this is a natural product the production time can vary and be longer if the weather changes. Also the color of the products may not last as commercial products which are dyed with synthetics. The product lives and changes with time, it gets never boring.

The story follows our two lead characters, Emme and Mason, as they navigate the secrets of their past. There are some very talented people behind the play. We are raising funds to be able to provide for costumes, lighting, sound, rehearsal space, props, original music, dramaturgy services, programs, marketing materials, professional services, theatre deposits, and advertising for the show. If we get fully funded we will be able to present a quality work of theatre on the Manhattan stage July 29-August 01.It would be an honor to present this work and to tell their story. The original music of 3 Days is enchanting. The play is full of humor and heartache. We have an amazing cast that is ready to share this story with the audience. We are all teaching artists, working actors, small business owners, and friends who love to create! This is New York City, so production costs are astronomical.

So our major challenge is being able to afford rehearsal space, pay for professional services, and create major buzz in the form of marketing the show.  We want to create a quality presentation.  The story is one that deals with universal issues. We believe that it will be well received but in order to tell this story in a way that makes the most impact we need to use lights, sound cues, costumes, and props.  All of which cost money.  There are some brilliant minds behind the creation of this work.  The playwright, Miranda Childers, enlisted the help of professional choreographers, dramaturgs, and costume designers to create the overall aesthetic of the play.

There are so many wonderful young actors ready to present this work and getting chosen for the Summer New Work Series at Manhattan Repertory Theatre was such an honor we had to try this Kickstarter one more time. We broke our budget down to the bare minimum of what it will take to get this work put up here in Manhattan.  We have removed set pieces, changed certain elements of the show, and called in favors.  Your help in backing this new effort will get us up on the stage.  Our previous efforts were for both the Manhattan show and the Atlanta Show.  We decided to start where we are and if you back us today we can make it to the Manhattan StageHOW FAR WOULD YOU GO TO REVISIT THE PAST?In ""3 Days In Savannah,"" we find out. The play has been selected to appear in the Summer  2014 New Works Series at Manhattan Repertory Theatre on 42nd Street in New York City! Manhattan Repertory Theatre is a forum for playwrights, directors, and actors to share their work.  I am so honored and excited that I can barely think.  As a young playwright this is such a wonderful surprise but our creative team needs your help to make it to 42nd street. The goal of this kickstarter is to fund the workshop presentation of the show in New York City at Manhattan Repertory and to ultimately bring a World Premiere of this work to Atlanta, Georgia.The story follows our two lead characters, Emme and Mason, as they navigate the secrets of their past.  There are some very talented people behind the play. We are raising funds to be able to provide for costumes, lighting, sound, rehearsal space, props, original music, dramaturgy services, programs, marketing materials, professional services, theatre deposits, and advertising for the show.  If we get fully funded we will be able to present a quality work of theatre on the Manhattan stage July 29-August 01. It would be an honor to present this work and to tell their story.  The original music of 3 Days is enchanting.  The play is full of humor and heartache.  We have an amazing cast that is ready to share this story with the audience. We are all teaching artists, working actors, small business owners, and friends who love to create! This is New York City, so production costs are astronomical. We want to create a quality presentation. The story is one that deals with issues of love, racism, colorism, betrayal, and heartbreak. We believe that it is a universal story ","Our major challenge is time. The show is set to open at the end of July and we need to utilize all the time we have to rehearse.  Rehearsal space in New York is very expensive. It can range from $30 per hour to $150.  This is New York City, so production costs are astronomical.

The support collected in this campaign will go to purchasing bulk material, assembly and final testing costs.",https://www.kickstarter.com/projects/201461162/unoprologic2-ultra-low-cost-open-source-oscillosco?ref=discovery_category_newest,201461162/unoprologic2-ultra-low-cost-open-source-oscillosco,"So, enter the UnoProLogic2 Ultra Low Cost Open Source Oscilloscope. It is used along with the UnoProLyzer application software running on a PC. Together these two provide a simple yet powerful oscilloscope tool to allow you to examine four analog channels running up to 300 KSamples/second. The hardware has been simplified to remove extra cost. The input signals are limited to 0 to +5Volts and the sample rate is shared across all four channels. If you run one channel only, it will take advantage of the 300KSamples/second. If you run four channels, each channel will have a maximum sample rate of 75 KSamples/second.The Arduino Inputs/Outputs are usually operating at a much slower rate than the sampling rate of the UnoProLogic2. About half the time you are debugging your Arduino, this is more than enough speed for troubleshooting purposes. Plus, you get four channels to probe and look for bugs. This makes the UnoProLogic2 a superior test tool to more expensive devices.The UnoProLogic2 cost is well below the other test tools on the market because everything possible has been done to keep the cost low. This means the hardware is essentially an “ADC on a USB Stick”.  The ADC samples the analog input channels, then the samples are sent to the appropriate channel buffer in the PC. This allows the UnoProLyzer application to do all of the heavy lifting. All of the other test tools out there attempt to do as much as possible on the USB hardware, from collecting samples, triggering, and memory storage to post processing FFTs. The CPU/Operating System on your laptop is a far more powerful device capable of doing all the work of an oscilloscope. So why not use it instead of making it a dumb display device like all the other USB scopes on the market. The UnoProLogic2 leverages the power of your PC/CPU and keeps the expensive hardware to a minimum. This makes it low cost. It is true that the low cost of the UnoProLogic2 comes at the cost of a high sample rate and large bandwidth. However, about 60% of all debugging of the Arduino signals can be accomplished at the lower sampling rates.None of the above Arduino functions require a USB scope with 1 MHz bandwidth let alone a 40 MHz bandwidth. So you really have no need to spend upwards of $199.00 for a USB scope.And if you need a higher sampling rate for that other 40% of the time, we got you covered. The CPLD has a 66MHz oscillator, so with the click of a button you can turn the UnoProLogic2 into a 24 input digital Logic Analyzer. This analyzer will operate at 33MHz. All of the digital Logic Analyzer code is open source and comes with tutorials with the UnoProLogic2. Can the other USB scope guys deliver this?The UnoProLogic2 is Open Source Hardware based on a CPLD, High Speed USB and an on board 4 Channel ADC. The CPLD is a Complex Programmable Logic Device that allows user code to configure the chip to perform any digital logic function, synchronous or non-synchronous. The UnoProLogic2 provides a high speed path for data to and from the PC over USB 2.0. This high speed data path, up to 8MBytes/second, allows the UnoProLyzer application to run on the PC and perform the function of an oscilloscope. The CPLD commands the ADC to sample the selected channels. It then reads the ADC data and sends it to the UnoProLyzer application. You can view the schematic here:www.earthpeopletechnology.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/04/ept_5m57_ap_u2_v3_20150424.pdfThe UnoProLogic2 uses a 66MHz oscillator to provide the timing for SPI bus, USB data transfers and user code. This high speed oscillator allows the CPLD to transfer the ADC samples to the internal USB FIFO at 10MHz. This high speed transfer rate allows a continuous stream of samples to be sent to the UnoProLyzer for storage. The UnoProLyzer can then perform triggering and other operations on the raw data samples. By performing the oscilloscope processing in the PC application, the UnoProLogic2 hardware can be kept simple and cheap.The UnoProLyzer is an Open Source Oscilloscope Application created by Earth People Technology. This application runs on a Windows 7/8 PC. It sends commands to and receives the data from the UnoProLogic2 and stores each channel data in its own separate buffer in memory. The UnoProLyzer collects all samples from each channel by streaming across up to four dedicated communication “pipes”. The traditional USB oscilloscope performs all of its functions down at the hardware level. This includes These scopes will then send the selected data to be displayed on a laptop. Effectively using the laptop as a dumb terminal. However, the modern laptop is extremely powerful with multi-core processors and multi-threaded operating systems. So, why not take advantage of the processing power on the laptop. This is what the UnoProLogic2 and UnoProLyzer do so well.The UnoProLogic2 commands the ADC to start a conversion on the channels selected by the user. It then waits for the ADC to complete the conversion on all channels. It transfers the data for each channel across its own dedicated communication pipe. Then starts the process over again. The UnoProLyzer application will accept each data word and decode the pipe number it came across. It stores each word into a separate buffer for each channel. The UnoProLyzer then performs post processing on each data word. It performs trigger detection, smoothing, sorting, scaling and searching. It then displays the data set in 500 data point segments.The UnoProLogic2 is powered completely over the USB cable. Just plug the cable into an open USB port on your laptop or desktop PC and into the Micro-B connector of the UnoProLogic2 and click on the software icon. The software locates the UnoProLogic2 via the registry and loads the application. Use your breadboard jumper wires to connect between the Arduino connectors and the six pin inline connector that provides a path to the ADC inputs.The Open Source Software of the UnoProLoyzer uses the Active Host API in the PC and the Active Transfer Library on the CPLD. The Active Host API and the Active Transfer Library provide the “pipe” mechanism that allows commands to be sent and ADC data received from the UnoProLogic2. The pipe mechanism is provided by “EndTerms”. The user code connects to “Endterms” in the Active Host dll. These Host “Endterms” have complementary HDL “Endterms” in the Active Transfer Library which reside in the CPLD code. Users have seamless bi-directional communications at their disposal in the form of:User code writes to the Endterms as function calls. Just include the address of the individual module (there are eight individually addressable modules of each Endterm). Immediately after writing to the selected Endterm, the value is received at the HDL Endterm in the CPLD.  The Trigger Endterms send single bits to the CPLD. The Transfer Endterm sends a single byte. And, the Block Endterm sends a block of bytes. By using one of the Active Host Endterms, the user can create a dynamic, bi-directional, and configurable data transfer design. The Active Host API is designed to seamlessly transfer data from the CPLD when it becomes available. It is a transparent receive transfer path made possible by using a callback mechanism. The data seamlessly appears in Host PC memory from the Arduino.While the UnoProLogic2 cannot match the performance of other more expensive USB scopes, it can contribute more in the aide of debugging your Arduino code than they can.With the plug in connections to the Arduino, the UnoProLogic2 goes a step further in debugging your applications. You can set the trigger to monitor the level or duration of a signal on the analog inputs. When the trigger detects this condition, the UnoProLyzer can send a command to the Arduino to pause the execution of the loop function. When the loop pauses, you can send a command from the UnoProLyzer to read out the contents of your memory or the state in a state machine. This can provide an enormous benefit when debugging hard to find problems. And the other USB scopes cannot deliver this level of performance. Earth People will provide sample applications, tutorials, and all source code for the Arduino Debugging.In order to sweeten the deal, Earth People Technology is offering the Oscilloscope Interface board. Choose this as your reward for supporting the UnoProLogic2 campaign drive. It will turn the UnoProLogic2 into a true Oscilloscope with +/- 40 Volt input and the ability to accept off the shelf Oscilloscope probes.The Oscilloscope Interface board plugs directly into the UnoProLogic2 connectors. It interfaces the signals to be measured to the on board 4 Channel ADC. The interface board uses four standard sized BNC connectors that allow you to install most off the shelf oscilloscope probes. The Oscilloscope Interface Board also allows advanced triggering techniques. It does this by including a 4 to 1 multiplexor which is used to select one of the input channels to apply to the analog comparator. An MSP430 MCU used to provide the analog comparator and digital storage memory. Adding the Oscilloscope Interface board to the UnoProLogic2 and using the UnoProLyzer application gives you a powerful four channel 300 Kilo Sample per second oscilloscope.In order to sweeten the deal, Earth People Technology is offering the Voltmeter Interface board. Choose this as your reward for supporting the UnoProLogic2 campaign drive. It will turn the UnoProLogic2 into a true Voltmeter with the ability to measure AC or DC voltages.The Voltmeter Interface board plugs directly into the UnoProLogic2 connectors. It turns the  UnoProLogic2 into a true voltmeter. It allows the on board 4 Channel ADC to measure analog voltages from minus 200 Volts to positive 200 Volts AC or DC.  The interface board uses four standard sized Banana Connector Pairs that allow you to install most off the shelf Voltmeter probes. Adding the Voltmeter Interface board to the UnoProLogic2 and using the Voltmeter application gives you a Digital Voltmeter.","The UnoProLogic2 is the evolution of the successful UnoProLogic CPLD Development System. The hardware has gone through multiple revisions and verification. The Active Host API and Active Transfer Library has gone through two years of verification.

Every part of production has been of the highest quality and we are proud to be working with local suppliers..THE DESIGNSThe V60 pour over is an elegant extraction brewing method that offers complete control over your brew. It's personally our favourite way to get started for the day ahead..The Stove Pot (or whatever name you call it) is a simple and easy way to produce an espresso with minimal tools. The water pressure pushes the steam coffee through to the top chamber and then ready to serve. We're also quite fond of it's bubbling gurgles sounds..The French Press is such a classic in coffee brewing and in only 4 minutes it serves up a heavy bodied cuppa. It's reliable, consistent and we love the timeless, well engineered design. .The Chemex is such an iconic design within coffee. It's sophisticated, charming and looks great whether in use or not. It's easy to use pour over method gives you a clean and balanced cup..The best way to brew coffee on the go, especially when camping out in the middle of the mountains. The AeroPress is an incredibly designed device that is portable, lightweight and easy to clean. .This is a very theatrical method and definitely the one you want to bring out with an audience. It's full immersion brewing technique gives you a delicate tea-like coffee and dependent on your filter can offer either a full bodied or clean cup. It can be a bit fiddly but it's sure worth it..SHIPPINGIf funded, we will be producing these prints in February ready to be shipped to you in March. Each poster will be rolled and carefully wrapped before being packaged in a large poster tube and the postcards will be packaged and sent in a flat envelope. ","Risks and challengesLike all crowdfunded projects there are always risks. We are using our experience as graphic designers to create designs that not only look great but are based on actual product designs and tested brewing methods. Everyone of course has their own way to brew a perfect coffee and so we've used our own techniques and tools as a base point for these designs.We've also teamed up with a local screen printer who print custom design posters by hand using the highest quality materials. It was important for us that all the way through the design and production process, the prints were being handled by creators and craftsman who are experts in their trade. These posters are not your every day commercial run and are designed to be as carefully crafted as each cup of coffee is brewed in homes across the world."

https://www.kickstarter.com/projects/robo-tank/robo-tank-diy-all-in-one-aquarium-controller?ref=discovery_category_newest,robo-tank/robo-tank-diy-all-in-one-aquarium-controller,"Robo-Tank is the fastest and easiest to use all-in-one DIY aquarium controller available for freshwater, saltwater or reef tanks. Powered by an Arduino based 8-bit microcontroller and two Arduino 32-bit microcontrollers gives it lots of speed and power. The controller has an intuitive design and packed with many features including parameter graphs, customized AC outlet icons, custom rules and much more, allowing you to have a fully automated aquarium or manual control over any size tank.Robo-Tank comes with a full color 7"" touch screen which can be located up to 100 feet away from the controller. The display connects to the power bar using a standard Ethernet patch cable, power and signals are sent through the same cable allowing a single cable clean installation.Robo-Tank has been a one man project, I started thinking about and developing Robo-Tank back in October of 2014. When I started this project it was going to be for personal use only, as things progressed I was getting positive feedback so I decided to create a DIY kit so there's a full featured alternative to the expensive commercially available controllers. My goal was, and still, is, to keep the cost as low as possible and give as much as possible which includes excellent service. I take customer service seriously and back my product.I started selling basic kits in September 2015 and have sold about 70 in 23 different countries. The kits have slowly evolved and now I would like to offer full kits so assembly is easy. Anyone who bought a kit previously had to cut out custom cases to package everything which is a difficult and daunting task along with tracking down extra parts.Here's where you come in. After many software revisions, Robo-Tank is ready to reach its full potential but I can't do it alone.To reach a new level I need to get a 3D printer, have a PH, Conductivity/Salinity and ORP circuit developed and complete the kits with all the remaining accessories required to build one. The 3D printer and completing the kits are critical to have a kit anyone can easily assemble.With custom 3D printed cases you simply place the circuit boards and accessories in the different cases, screw in place, connect some patch cables and you'll have a fully functional controller ready to go. With a quality 3D printer, I'll also be able to offer a variety of brackets for different equipment and accessories at affordable prices and be able to offer custom solutions.The PH, Conductivity/Salinity, and ORP circuit are required to keep the cost of the controller down and a viable solution. To read those parameters today the user's required to buy expensive aftermarket circuits which increase the cost to a point where it's less feasible. The cost to produce the circuits is much lower so this would bring the overall cost down considerably.I'm committed to continuing work on the hardware and software improving the controller and adding more feature. The different revisions of the circuit boards are all compatible with future upgrades. Some hardware features have been added to the circuit boards that still require the software to go with it. So if it can't be done today you likely will only need a software update when it's available.When you order a kit you'll receive all the parts with full instructions to build the controller. The circuit boards come assembled, programmed and fully tested. You only need to mount the PCB's in the custom cases and secure a few connectors. The AC outlets all connect using the supplied jumpers, no soldering required and connections are color coded for safety. All rewards on Kickstarter will be sent as a ""solder free kit"". Basic soldering may still be required to connect other equipment to the controller as you need to add a connector to plug it in.The custom printed cases will be black in color bydefault, if you would like a different color for your cases send me a message and I'll do my best to accommodate you.The heart of Robo-Tank is the power bar and touch screen. The power bar has 13 ports for controlling the different hardware and reading the various sensors. Connect up to 16 channels of LED's running at 12-bit resolution giving you six smooth fades throughout the day between the four light modes or use a converter board to run digital accessories. You can also control up to 16 AC power outlets, 4 dosing pumps, and an automatic fish feederusing daily schedules.Robo-Tank can monitor up to six temperature sensors and one sensor for room temperature and humidity. The controller also has the ability to monitor PH, ORP, Dissolved Oxygen, Saturation, Conductivity, TDS, Salinity and Specific Gravity.Extend the features of Robo-Tank by adding the 15 port expansion hub. Many of the ports can be configured for different equipment or sensors using onboard jumpers, this allows you to control almost anything. With the expansion hub connected Robo-Tank's power is reviled, all the sensors and equipment work together giving you the ability to cover almost any scenario. You'll be able to control any of the equipment using any sensor data mixing and matching any combination by adding custom rules to the controller.For example, if your salinity went above or below a set value you can turn on/off any or all of the AC outlets, turn on/off any or all the water pumps/DC accessories and startup any or all of the dosing pumps connected. Turn a water pump on using one sensor and off using a different sensor or maybe water temperature, you decide! Rules are easy to configure and require no complicated programming.With the expansion hub connected you can control the AC outlets, feed your fish and view all your sensor parameters over the Internet from any location. You can also configure instant email alerts for sensor parameters and different equipment. The controller is always monitoring your external IP address, if your Internet provider changes it the controller will see this and send you an email with the new IP address so you can still connect to Robo-Tank when you're out of town.The video below is an example showing Robo-Tank controlling different LED's.The video below shows the ATO (automatic top off) system in action.The circuit boards are high quality, fully assembled and tested for any defects before shipment. The PCB's have been created using components larger than required so they aren't working hard and run at low temperatures. For example, the six high-quality DC power regulators are all good for 3amps and run cold.The PCB's have beendesigned with the future in mind and can be easily customized. In most cases, you can add more equipment without having to buy additional hardware and incorporate your own custom features to the controller. If you're handy with programming Arduinos you can customize the software for your own personal use.The Arduino microcontrollers plug directly into the PCB's, and can be programmed on board using the external jacks on the cases. The controller uses the w5100 Ethernet Shield for connecting to the internet which also plugs directly into the expansion hub PCB. Because it's setup like this you can easily replace any of the Arduinos if one of them go bad.Main Controller PCB FeaturesExpansion Hub PCB FeaturesRobo-Tank is loaded with features, below is a list of all the current features, more will be coming. If you're viewing this on your phone and can't read the list, click the list and you'll be taken to my website with a list you can view.Here's an estimated timeline showing how I imagine things will progress. I expect to start shipping rewards mid-September 2016 and have all rewards shipped by mid to late October. Rewards will be shipped in ordered received.Pledge $5 CAD or morePledge $5 and have your name show up on the Wall of Fame. This is a list that can be viewed from the settings screen in the controller.Pledge $89 CAD or more This is a hardware upgrade for monitoring PH, Conductivity and ORP. It includes a custom 3D printed ABS case with labels and the circuits. No probes included.Pledge $119 CAD or moreReceive custom 3D printed ABS cases for your Robo-Tank Controller. Three cases are included with labels, one for the 7"" touch screen, the main controller and 8 AC outlets.Pledge $119 CAD or more If you already have Robo-Tank and only running 8 AC outlets add 8 more using this module. Pledge $139 CAD or morePledge $189 CAD or moreThis is a hardware upgrade for monitoring PH and conductivity. It includes a custom 3D printed ABS case with labels and standard grade PH and conductivity/salinity probes. ORP probe is NOT included.Pledge $189 CAD or moreThis is the bare bones controller, only the circuit boards and software for the main controller are included. You still need a display, Arduinos, cases and all the accessories to make it work. The expansion hub is not included. This is good if you already have a 5"" or 7"" touch screen and the Arduinos etc...Pledge $429 CAD or more - Level 1This is a complete Robo-Tank Kit without the Expansion Hub and includes the following.Pledge $559 CAD or more - Level 2This kit includes everything in Level 1 and the following. The difference is this kit has the Expansion Hub included.Pledge $629 CAD or more - Level 3This reward has everything in Level 1 and Level 2 Rewards and includes a PH circuit and standard grade PH Probe.Pledge $779 CAD or more - Level 4This reward has everything in Level 1, Level 2 and Level 3 Rewards and includes a conductivity and ORP circuit with standard grade probes.Pledge $869 CAD or more - Level 5This reward has everything in Level 1, Level 2, Level 3 and Level 4 Rewards and includes an additional 8 outlet AC Power Bar.","The risks are low because the software and main board design are already finished and working. The only risk would be a delay on the PH, EC, and ORP circuits as they're still being developed. Printing cases is a slow process so it's possible delays arise because of this. The printer I'm getting has a good reliability record so I don't expect many problems.Rewards with the circuits and probes included will be shipped last, if you want your reward shipped before the circuits are ready, add an extra $20 to your pledge amount and those will be shipped when available. All rewards will be shipping in the order received and shipments are via Canada Post Airmail worldwide which typically takes 6-10 business days to most urban areas.",https://www.kickstarter.com/projects/robo-tank/robo-tank-diy-aquarium-controller?ref=discovery_category_newest,robo-tank/robo-tank-diy-aquarium-controller,"Free upgrade available on the deluxe controller board, click here to read the update.New options available for the AC power bar board, click here to read the update.Robo-Tank is your road to a reliable, affordable and flexible aquarium controller. Now you can keep your kidney and still have a fully automated system on your freshwater or reef tank.This is an open source hardware solution for the open source Reef-pi aquarium controller software that runs on a Raspberry Pi.Whether you're a DIY fanatic or want something almost ready to go, Robo-Tank is for you. My mission is to provide a wide range of high quality, affordable hardware for Reef-pi and with your help this is just a preview of what's to come. You can visit my website at https://www.robo-tank.ca where you can also find a support forum so feel free to sign up.It can control all the equipment for your reef tank or freshwater aquarium with flexibility, you can use any sensor to control any equipment.Examples of what you can connect to the speed controllable DC powered ports.Here’s an example of sensors you can connect.Factory Controllable Aquarium Devices Here's some examples of factory equipment that have a port to connect directly to external controllers, these use the 0-10v analog / PWM ports and some Meanwell LED drivers use 0-5v PWM ports.Aqua MedicAquatic LifeAbyzzIcecapLET LightingJebaoKessilRoyal ExclusivReef OctopusMiscellaneousA lot of thought was put into the controller, I wanted it loaded with features but in a compact form, after many revisions I’ve come up with two versions that can be expanded.Both boards have a heavy duty design and are populated with components that are over rated for their job, there’s also various levels of protection built in to keep everything running for many years to come.Standard ControllerThe standard controller is the entry level model that allows you to run all the systems an aquarium requires and beyond. You can see in the image what I have allocated the ports for but these are just labels, the comparison table below reflects what can actually be connected.Deluxe ControllerThe deluxe controller takes automation to the next level, it has extra DC powered ports, sensor ports, a place holder for an optional pH circuit and 0-10v analog / PWM ports to control factory equipment without an additional signal converter.This board has a USB port that extends the connection to a miniature adapter for two optical sensors and one emergency float switch. Optical sensors come with 18"" cables, this allows you to extend them using a standard USB cable without cutting off the factory connector, this is great for the automatic top off or an automatic water change system.You can see in the image below what I have allocated the ports for but these are just labels, the comparison table below reflects what can actually be connected.Version ComparisonThe standard controller has 37 ports overall vs 40 on the deluxe. As the board comes you can connect any combination of the following up to the total number of ports on the respected version.If you're comfortable with cutting traces and adding resistors you can add more sensor ports or DC ports.Both controllers have what I call an emergency backup float switch port that will cut the power to DC port 3. The float switch will bypass the Raspberry Pi and most electronics so it’s great for your ATO or any other pump that needs a fail safe backup.The standard controller doesn't have any 0-10v ports needed to control a lot of factory equipment but I do have a small converter can be added at anytime.Controller SpecificationsNote: If you look close you'll notice the controller boards don't have a DC power connector that can handle the current rating for the boards, this was something I overlooked, the board you receive will have the 2.1x5.5mm connector that is sufficient for most and an optional pluggable connector like the green ports for higher power needs.Pluggable Screw Terminal ConnectorsThe green sockets on top of the controllers use the included 2-4 pluggable screw terminal connectors, with these you'll be able to connect your equipment and sensors without requiring a soldering iron. Some sensors require an extra sensor or two and most can be added to the plug easily.8 Outlet Power BarThis is basically the Arduino based relay module on steroids. It actually has traces that can handle 10 Amps and a heavy duty snubber protecting each relay from inductive loads such as motors. There's an AC/DC power module for the relays so no load is put on the controller and a fuse holder with a 10 Amp fuse.The board operates on 120v – 240v AC so it's compatible with any country. For the campaign I'm only offering US (Type B) outlets in the plug and play kits due to availability of the other types. You can solder wires to the circuit board and run them to your outlets as a DIY project.The power bar was designed to be wireless internally and can be housed securely in a strong 3D printed case or you can build your own. It has a DB9 serial socket so you have an easy connection to the controller and it powers up using a standard IEC power cable like your desktop computer.Isolated pH CircuitMonitoring pH can be expensive so this is an option to the standard and deluxe controller. This board can be mounted directly on the deluxe controller board and to connect to the standard controller you would use the included 12"" jumpers.The pH circuit is fully isolated on the data and power lines. This means other equipment such as pumps won't interfere and you can run multiple probes in the same aquarium without interference.The circuit is powered with its own microcontroller and puts out a very stable reading down to the thousands and it's precision is about +/- 0.005 on the pH value.DIY KitsThese are the circuit boards in DIY form, all the surface mount components are mounted, the board is powered and some tests are run. All the parts that require soldering are through hole and none of them are polarity sensitive.The images below show how the boards will come and the parts that require soldering. You will also receive a PCB face plate to match the controller. You can glue this on the 3D printed case if you print it yourself.Plug and play kits come with sturdy 3D printed cases and a nice PCB face plate for the controller. Everything is fully assembled, you only need to install Reef-pi on your Raspberry Pi, plug it into the controller, connector your cables and your ready to reef.Although these are referred to plug and play it's likely at some point you will need to cut and trim wire to connect your equipment. You also might need to add a resistor or two for different water sensors as they all have different requirements. In the near future I'll have a variety of adapter cables so you don't need to cut factory connectors on sensors.Standard ControllerDeluxe ControllerDeluxe Controller Face Plate (standard controller has one similar)Optical Sensors Extension included with Deluxe Controller8 Outlet 10 Amp 120v - 240v AC Power BarReef-pi is an open source program designed for the Raspberry Pi. It's fairly easy to install, I will have a detailed manual, and runs in the background on your Pi. It's been under development beyond 3 years and continues to be. It can control all aspects of your aquarium, sends email alerts, doesn't rely on 3rd parties and can be accessed on any device that has a web browser and much more.The prices for the rewards are shown in the Canadian dollar, if you click a reward on the right it will show you the shipping shipping cost and an estimate in your local currency. I ship worldwide with full tracking at reasonable rates.DIY and Plug and Play controllers require the following parts to be completed.I didn't include these accessories because it'll be cheaper for you to purchase from a 3rd party as they are heavy and shipping increases quite a bit. All these can typically be located at your local computer store or online, I can provide links if required.Note: DIY kits with an AC power bar board doesn't include AC outlets, you will need to solder wires to the board to connect your own.I like to see what makes things tick, at a young age I opened everything I could get my hands on. When I was 15 I got a part time job at small a two-way radio shop, this was my spring board into electronics and have been doing related project my whole life. Five years ago I had some spare time so I started developing a controller for my own use, some people saw it and wanted to purchase one and this journey began.Long story short, my controller was pretty cool but not what most want due to a few factors so after discussing it with the main developer of Reef-pi I decided to offer open source hardware that's compatible with Reef-pi. Reef-pi is open source software and as it continues to improves more hardware options are becoming available and this is another option.Some people are hesitant to support a Kickstarter campaign because they're unsure what will happen when it's over, will this person be around in the future if I need help. I can say yes to that, I love doing this and do everything I can to help if you need it, I also have a support forum I've been running for over four years on my website for transparency. You can contact me at info@robo-tank.caMy goal for the Kickstarter campaign is to raise funds to develop more open source hardware that's compatible with Reef-pi and working towards buying some manufacturing equipment such as a re-flow oven and pick and place machine. With this equipment I can bring prices down even more and focus on development so there's a larger variety of boards available. Over time I plan to create a full plug and play system at a fraction of the cost of what's available now and this is the first step. I can't discuss the future here but I have plenty of ideas and open to more.This is my expected timeline, some of these steps might not take this long but better safe than sorry.The stretch goals below are now available. Note the standard controller will not receive the external 8 channel converter board unless that goal is actually reached, only the deluxe controller will be upgraded now. You can read the Kickstarter updates by clicking here.With your support more is possible so be sure to share the campaign on your local forum and social media so we can reach some exciting stretch goals. If the total pledged is above the levels set below everyone benefits. These upgrades won't affect the time line, I've used these techniques before and they're easy to implement but to be safe I'm working on them now and will be placing an order for a prototype board soon so I can fully test it before ordering the Kickstarter boards.Connecting sensors can be troublesome sometimes because a lot of them have different resistor requirements, for example the popular optical sensor requires a 390 ohm resistor or it will be damaged but this resistor will prevent other sensors from working and some sensors require a pull-up resistor while others require a pull down.Both controllers do have a SMD resistor pad for a pull-up or pull-down resistor but this requires soldering which can be difficult for some and you still need to add the resistor for the optical sensor.This Stretch Goal goes a long way to solving the problem on the deluxe controller. I will update it with pluggable jumpers so you can set each sensor port to the sensor you'll be using without without having to solder the board and add resistors. This will work for the common water sensors and for 95% of users but it's possible you may still need to add/remove a resistor for other less common sensors.As you can see the AC power bar board was designed to have North American outlets soldered directly to it, if you want to use your own outlets you have to solder wires to the AC power bar board which can get a little messy.If this Stretch Goal is reached I will make another version of the power bar. This will be the same but in a smaller form with screw terminal connectors like the standard Arduino relay module. With this you can connect your own outlets easily.If the goal is reached you'll be able to choose which AC module you want.With the current design the deluxe controller has four ports that can be configured to output 0-10v PWM or Analog signal to control factory equipment. The standard controller doesn't have any and requires an external converter board that I offer.If this Stretch Goal is reached I will update the four 0-5v ports and four 0-10v ports to be selectable on the deluxe controller to be selectable as well. This will give a total of 8 ports that you can set the signal type and each channel is independent, choose from 0-5v PWM, 0-10v PWM, 0-5v Analog and 0-10v Analog so you can connect lots of factory equipment without requiring additional converter boards, simply set the dip switches for each port and you'll get the signals needed.The standard controller board is full so I will include a free 8 channel converter board that connects easily. This will unlock 8 selectable outputs for the standard controller.","I've been creating hardware over the last 5 years and have reliable suppliers for all the parts needed. Assembly and testing is all done in house so there is no reliance on a 3rd party.I have working prototypes for everything and print all the 3D cases, to ensure printing goes smooth I have backup parts available for my printer and plan to start printing some if and when the campaign is successful. Everything has been designed to be assembled as quick as possible, no messy wires, but it's still all assembled manually so the quicker you get in line the quicker you'll get the controller. I plan to ship twice a week until finished."

If each of you could spare one five dollar bill it will not only save the ""Stage Door"" theatre troupe, but permit it to grow.This one year old theatre group has had acting lessons, written, staged and received accolades for two productions. This group is lead by a local professional actress, who encourages people of all ages to take part. In a small village there is limited opportunity for varied activities. ""The Stage Door"" troupe provides an opportunity to develop self worth, responsibility, accountability, team work and loads and loads of fun. By writing and producing their own plays, it encourages research, reading, costume design, scenery creation and enhances a variety of skills of the participants.There are two locations for the staging. One is in the historic hall. It has not been used for live performances for some time and needs a great deal of stage equipment. The other is outdoors, (for summer productions) in the garden attached to the gallery.The idea is to raise enough funds to at a minimum, purchase portable lighting, backdrops and hopefully the materials to build a modular stage. This will permit productions to be held in either place and allow this group to grow in stature. Your help would be appreciated.

If you support it you help us in our vision. You become part of the change.We are London Denim. A British streetwear label produced by a couple of London designer-makers. At the moment 80% of our product is produced to order. Becuase we are dedicated to using only the best materials and creating the majority of our products in our studio and workshop our product can become quitean artisan and expensive.Our vision is to create a slow fashion design T and sell it at fast fashion prices. (Without sacrificing material quality)To achieve this vision we released that we needed two things:1. A more ergonomic production process2. VolumeTo achieve our vision we've created an ergonomic manufacturing process called 'One Stitch' and then designed Eden T around it. We hope if this campaign is a success to introduce more product using similar processes.The Eden T is the first product to come from this one stitch process. It's the simplest, most ergonomic design to come out of our design studio. It's two pieces of organic cotton jersey sewn together with our one stitch process.The second part of the vision is harder. In order to sell at Fast Fashion Prices, we need a volume of orders. We have a few London Denim regular customers but not as many as we will need to make this work.  This is where we hope Kickstarter is going to help us get that ball rolling.We’ve designed two versions: The Eden T and the Pocket Eden T which has a breast pocket sewn in with the same stitch. It’s made from certified organic cotton which is knitted in British Midlands; the heartland of our textile industry.If you want to see more pics check it out on the Eden T section of our website here: www.londondenim.comThe production process for this T is as short as we can make it.  This enables us to pay ourselves and any staff we need to take on a good wage to sew up the T's. The Jersey we use to make the T's is Knitted for us by a UK knitter. The cotton is GOT's certified which is the gold standard for the sustainable processing of textiles.We're working with a leading carbon offset consultancy to make Eden as carbon neutral as possible. Our plan is to offet the carbon on the product from the Cotton Field through the textile processors to your door. We don't understand the full cot of this yet but it could be as much as 5% of the total garment price. When we know the final numbers for production we will be able to report back to you on how that carbon will be completely off-set.The Inside Brand Stamp.Every T we produce will be brand stamped by either myself (Simon) or Janet. It will be a black ink stamp for the white and grey and a white stamp for the Navy and Black. We've sourced a non-toxic water-soluble block printing ink which does the job nicely.Included on the final products with the brand stamp will be a web address with the care instructions in a host of different languages.CORPORATE BACKERSHIGH STREET RETAILERS ARE NOT INTERESTED IN THE PRODUCTION OF ETHICAL, SUSTAINABLE, MADE LOCAL PRODUCT.

Because of this Evan frequents his local cinema where he meets someone who makes him want to connect again after years of isolation.One thing I love about science fiction I how it's able to present very human stories in unique ways and that's what I'm trying to do with my film. Though it is mainly a drama about isolation and loneliness one thing I always try to do in my films is have sense of hope in them; even though things may seem dour at times there is always Glimmer of hope to light up the darkness.We are also planning to submit this short film into festivals.Facebook Page -https://www.facebook.com/GlimmerShortThe Team:For the moment the team is just me (the director) and my frequent producing partner Daniel Taylor with a possible Director of Photography lined up. I am currently in the process of preparing auditions and will give you update when I get the cast and crew together.Why we need the money:Now films cost money and though I will be putting in some of my own money it will not be enough to get the film made. That is why I'm asking for $4000 which is the minimum amount of money we need to get this film made.  The money will be going to the following:                      Visual Effects - Visual effects will be essential to fully realising the force fields and will be where most of the money is going. If we get enough money we may also be able to hire a professional Colorist to grade the film.Catering -Even though it would be pretty cool the people making the film will not be robots and will be needing sustenance on set (also because we won't be paying the cast and crew food is important to make sure they're all happy). Also water...lots of water.Rental Equipment -Though we do have a fair bit of equipment available to us (For you camera nerds, we will mostly likely be shooting on an Alexa) there is still some specialised equipment we will need to hire; a dolly, jib and if we get beyond our goal there is thepossibilityof using anamorphic lenses!!!Locations -Though we will most likely be getting our locations for free there may be one or two that will require some compensation.Props and Costuming -There will be some specific props and costuming that we'll have to purchase along with large sheets of plastic that we'll be using for the practical effects of the force fields.Make Up Artist -For our actors to be camera ready they will need some make up (not just to make them pretty but also to reduce skin shine).Music -We will be needing a composer to score the music for the film and it is a lot of hard work so I'd like to be able to reward them for their effort. I will hopefully be able to collaborate with the composer who scored my last short film.Filmmaking Basics - There are many little essentials for all film sets which include things like Gaffer tape, batteries, clamps etc.Why you should pledge:As a storyteller I want to both entertain but also connect with an audience and if you pledge you'll be helping us make what I hope will be a moving film. Not only that but you'll be supporting an independent production and it's important to keep independent cinema alive!What you get when you pledge:Depending on how much you pledge will decide what combination of rewards you'll receive.The rewards are:Online Screener - You will be able to watch the short film by a private link along with the latest short film I've made 'Soul' which is about two clones and their life in an oppressive world.Digital Copy - A digital download of the film and my latest short film 'Soul'. Soul trailer: Watch Here!Home Video - You will get a physical copy of the film on either DVD or Blu-ray with bonus features; if you pledge enough you will also get a personalised thank you video unique to your disc. You'll also get to see the online screener as that will be ready before the discs will reach you.Credits - You can also get you name in the credits as a thank you, extra thank you, extra extra thank you, Associate Producer or Executive Producer depending on how much you pledge.Thank You Card - A hand-crafted thank you card.Online Thanks - Depending on how much you pledge you'll get a shout out on our website - TBA , our youtube channel - JOProductions77 and a special thank you email.Script - A copy of the shooting script signed by the lead actors and myself.Poster - A copy of the film's poster signed by the lead actors and myself. Idea for the poster image below.Your Own Force Field - You'll get a square piece of plastic representing the force field signed by the lead actors and myself.Special Artwork - A specialised A4 artwork based on a image from the film.Be An Extra - If you live around Brisbane, Australia (or are willing to travel at your own expense) we invite to be an extra in the film. Unfortunately we can't promise that shoot will fit into your schedule or that you'll make it into the final cut of the film (if you do get cut out of the film we'll give you an extra thanks in the credits).Set Visit -If you live around Brisbane, Australia (or are willing to travel at your own expense) we invite to to come on set and experience what it's like to make a film, If you record a video diary and give us a copy we'll put it on the bonus features of the DVD or Blu-ray.Speaking role -If you live around Brisbane, Australia (or are willing to travel at your own expense) we invite to have small speaking role in the film. Unfortunately we can't promise that shoot will fit into your schedule or that you'll make it into the final cut of the film but we'll do our best to make sure you do get into the film (if you do get cut out of the film we'll give you an extra thanks in the credits).Skype/Google Hang out - A chat with the Director, Lead Actors and Producer/s; ask us whatever you want (in good taste of course).Festival Guest - We are planning to get this film into festivals and if we do we invite you to come with us (at your own expense) to represent the film.Last Words:I would like to thank you for looking at our Kickstarter Project and hope that you can pledge and help us make a wonderful short film. If we have reached our goal and our campaign is still going please continue to pledge because $4000 is the minimum amount of money we need to get this film made.

I'm planning to use a steadicam operator for a couple of scenes and we'll need to pay them for their time and equipment.Ps- if we're able to significantly exceed our fundraising goal we could also have the option of using anamorphic lenses which we would be delighted to use.Locations - Though we will most likely be getting our locations for free there may be one or two that will require some compensation.Props and Costuming - There will be some specific props and costuming that we'll have to purchase for the film, some easy to get while other's could be rather challenging..Filmmaking Basics - There are many little essentials for all film sets which include things like Gaffer tape, batteries, clampsetc.and we'll also need toprovide catering for out awesome cast and crew.Why you should pledge:As a storyteller I want to both entertain but also connect with people and if you pledge you'll be helping us make what I hope will be a fun but also moving film. Not only that but you'll be supporting an independent production and it's important to keep independent cinema alive!What you get when you pledge:Depending on how much you pledge will decide what combination of rewards you'll receive.The rewards are:Online Screener -  You will be able to watch the short film by a private link.Digital Copy - A digital download of the filmHome Video - You will get a physical copy of the film on either DVD or Blu-ray with bonus features; if you pledge enough you will also get a personalised thank you video unique to your disc.You'll also get to see the online screener as that will be ready before the discs will reach you. Credits - You can also get your name in the credits as a thank you, extra thank you, extra extra thank you, Associate Producer or Executive Producer depending on how much you pledge.Post Card - A hand-crafted post card just for you.Online Thanks - Depending on how much you pledge you'll get a shout out on our website - TBA , our youtube channel - JOProductions77 and a special thank you email.Script - A copy of the shooting script signed by the lead actors and myself.Poster - A copy of the film's poster signed by the lead actors and myself.Props - There are several props that are unique in the film and you could get your hands on one of them!Be An Extra -  If you live around Brisbane, Australia (or are willing to travel at your own expense) we invite you to be an extra in the film. Unfortunately we can't promise that shoot will fit into your schedule or that you'll make it into the final cut of the film (if you do get cut out of the film we'll give you an extra thanks in the credits).Set Visit - If you live around Brisbane, Australia (or are willing to travel at your own expense) we invite to to come on set and experience what it's like to make a film, if you record a video diary and give us a copy we'll put it on the bonus features of the DVD and Blu-rays. Festival Guest - We are planning to get this film into festivals and if we do we invite you to come with us (at your own expense) to represent the film.Last Words:I would like to thank you for looking at our Kickstarter Project and hope that you can pledge and help us make a wonderful short film. If we have reached our goal and our campaign is still going please continue to pledge because $2000 is the minimum amount of money we need to get this film made. If you can help us get more money than our goal we can put it towards making the project the best it can be.Once again I'd like to thank you for your time and I really hope you can help us make this short film happen!","Making a film can be very unpredictable and no matter how much you prepare there are many things that can go wrong (or if we're lucky, go right!). Problems will most likely cause delays but we will do our best to keep you informed of all the going ons with updates of the production.Fortunately, we have a team of quick thinking problem solvers and will take each problem head on and get it resolved. It is always helpful to have an extra cushion of money to help with this so please help us exceed our goal and get this film made."

The devastation wrought was unlike anything seen before. What was once a lush, green land has been denuded by high winds. Flooding, especially in the areas near the Guajataca Dam, has made entire neighborhoods uninhabitable. Electricity is only available via generator, and fuel for those generators is scarce. Food and potable water is in short supply. Compounding these challenges with a decade-long recession means that recovery efforts on the island will take years.It is with these circumstances in mind that the comics community comes together, as it has in the past, to help. Borinquen will be an anthology about Puerto Rico, its people, its history, and the perseverance shown in the face of such destruction. The goal of this anthology is to raise funds to help the people of Puerto Rico. Net proceeds will be donated to United for Puerto Rico.Borinquen features 12 short stories by some of the best creators in the business, as well as names you've not heard of...yet. Our proud team includes:Check it out - for every day we make 10% of our goal, we'll put more artwork up!Glad you asked. Of the $2200 we are asking for, $250 will be spent on ISBNs for the print and digital versions of Borinquen. This way, we can put the book in shops everywhere without too much hassle. The rest will go towards printing copies for you, our wonderful donors, as well as copies into as many stores as are willing to take it! For every book you donate towards, we'll be able to print an additional copy to sell. All profit goes to charity.","Our creators have been kind enough to donate their time and skills to create Borinquen. Consequently, the only costs we have are the costs of ISBNs and printing/shipping costs. The more we raise, the more copies of Borinquen we can put into peoples' hands, and the more we are able to contribute to the rebuilding of Puerto Rico!",https://www.kickstarter.com/projects/921709127/illegal-alien?ref=discovery_category_newest,921709127/illegal-alien,"Illegal Alien is a new, twelve-issue miniseries created and written by Paul Axel and illustrated by Megan Fitts. Currently, five scripts are completed, and art for issue one is currently in production. This Kickstarter campaign is to raise the funds to produce and publish the first issue, both digitally and in print. Illegal Alien is a hard science fiction miniseries that speaks to the human drive to test oneself and discover new frontiers. Add in a commentary on modern society and our potential future, and you've got the makings of a story that's out of this world!Illegal Alien takes place in the early 23rd century, long after humanity has weathered the ravages of climate change. Juan Bruni is a young man from Caracas, Venezuela. Juan, like the rest of the world, lives without want in an urban paradise. However, Juan earns for more - he wants to emigrate to the furthest reaches of the human frontier: Mars. But access to Mars is strictly limited by the world governments, and Juan may not be their ""ideal"" candidate. When you don't quite fit the mold, how can you achieve your dreams? That's what Juan is going to find out, as he vows to reach the Red Planet by any means necessary!Paul Axel is the creator and writer of Illegal Alien. When not writing comics, he is a high school history teacher in Chicago. You might have read his previous work, such as the historical crime drama Rotten Roots, or one of his short stories in Alterna's IF Anthology, or Bad Kids Press' Fractured Continuum, which is where he first worked with...Megan Fitts, an illustrator and writer of all things fantastical, as well as the creator of comics I Am Nora and My Roommate the Dungeon Master. When not creating the next epic fantasy, Megan is seen around the Kansas City area drinking coffee and getting lost in YA fiction.We believe in transparency, especially when it comes to crowdfunding. All the money we raise will go towards production, printing, rewards, and fees. Issue One of Illegal Alien will be 20 pages long.Here's a breakdown of our budget:What is ""contingency""? Well, those funds are to be used for any unforeseen costs - say, if the price of shipping or printing suddenly increases. Any extra funds we raise will go back into printing. Of course, there will be some awesome stretch goals if we surpass our initial $2,000 goal, but let's cross those bridges when we come to them.","We are fully committed to this project, and have spent months refining the story and getting it ready for all you fine folks. This project WILL happen, but your donations will make our dream a reality faster - and isn't that what Kickstarter is really all about?As far as any potential challenges, there is always the risk of missing production deadlines. However, we have already begun the process of drawing and lettering our pages (as you can see), and at our current rate of production, we hope to have the first issue available digitally by late June, 2018."

One day we found out that the hops, at least for now, we import from other countries, grows wild along our rivers. We have no doubt that some of the hops' varieties that we love so much,and we use to flavor and characterize our beers,could take root in the lands surrounding these rivers. Our dream is to be able to use a hop from our region ""Lucania"", but first of all an Italian hop.The plan: We would like to grow hop gardens that could become a reference point for all those homebrewers wishing to go in our own direction. We're planning to collect the first flowers in two year, and to have the opportunity to use fresh hops during the third year. We dream to use the hot and clean air of our land to dry our flowers the natural way.What will the Kickstarter money be used for? With your help we're establishing a hop farm to source fresh hops to homebrewers in Italy. In particular we plan to:Collaborations: We do not want to trow ourselves into something greater than us without the knowledge of facts.

Un giorno abbiamo scoperto che quel luppolo che, almeno per ora, siamo costretti ad importare dall'estero, cresce selvatico e rigoglioso lungo i nostri corsi d'acqua. Non abbiamo alcun dubbio sul fatto che qualcuna delle varietà di luppolo che noi tanto amiamo ed usiamo per profumare e caratterizzare le nostre birre, possa attecchire nei terreni circostanti quei fiumi. Il nostro sogno è quello di poter finalmente usare un luppolo lucano e brigante, ma prima di tutto un luppolo italiano.L'obiettivo: Un luppoleto che diventi punto di riferimento per tutti quegli homebrewers che intendano andare nella nostra stessa direzione. Immaginiamo di raccogliere già fra due anni i primi fiori, e dal terzo di avere la possibilità di usare luppolo fresco. Sognamo di sfruttare l'aria calda e pulita della nostra terra per essiccare in maniera quanto più naturale possibile i nostri fiori.Come verrano utilizzate le risorse economiche raccolte tramite Kickstarter? Con il vostro aiuto vogliamo investire nella realizzazione di un luppoleto con lo scopo di fornire luppolo locale agli homebrewers.

Anche se la campagna non ebbe esito positivo, ringrazio tutti quelli che avevano creduto nel loro progetto. Io li conosco da una vita e grazie a loro ho scoperto il mondo della birra artigianale.Dopo quell'esperienza li ho seguiti nel sogno di fare davvero quel luppoleto. Così, io e la mia famiglia, abbiamo messo a disposizione la nostra fattoria e messo in campo tutta la nostra esperienza, tirando su un piccolo campo sperimentale con 48 piante di 12 varietà diverse, allo scopo di ricercare quelle che meglio si adattavano al nostro terreno. I risultati sono stati sorprendentemente positivi e, già al primo raccolto, abbiamo avuto modo di provare i coni in numerose cotte casalinghe.Se prima era un sogno, adesso è un sogno realizzabile: luppolo vero, coltivato qui, da usare fresco o appena essiccato, che dona alla birra un aroma particolarmente piacevole. Ora che ci siamo dentro, ora che quelle piante le abbiamo davvero messe, ora che le abbiamo viste nascere, crescere e regalare soddisfazioni, ora che abbiamo assaggiato le birre fatte con il nostro luppolo… ora quel sogno lo vogliamo inseguire.Con il vostro contributo (che come potete ben capire rappresenta solo una parte dell'investimento complessivo)vorremmo ampliare quel campo, o meglio, metterne su uno vero con le varietà che meglio hanno attecchito; per tutti voi che vorrete credere nel nostro progetto, abbiamo riservato dei premi: quando verrà il tempo del raccolto vi porteremo a vedere il campo, ci aiuterete nella raccolta e potrete portarvi a casa tutto il luppolo che riuscite a mettere nella vostra maglietta (si attendono felpe giganti!); inoltre potrete pranzare nella nostra azienda agricola.Chi vorrà venire da lontano e non ha mai avuto il piacere di visitare la nostra bellissima regione, oltre ad avere la possibilità di partecipare al raccolto, verrà accompagnato a visitare le bellezze del Parco.Questo è il prossimo passo che vogliamo compiere con la vostra partecipazione:Collaborazioni: Non vogliamo lanciarci in qualcosa di più grande di noi senza cognizione di causa.

Perhaps someone remembers about some friends of mine who had started a crowdfunding campaign here on Kickstarter in order to set up a hop field in our marvellous Pollino Park.Although the campaign didn't have a positive outcome, I'd like to thank everyone who has believed in their project. I have known them for a lifetime and thanks to them I've found out about the world of craft beer.After that experience, I followed them through their dream of actually setting up that hop field. Therefore, my family and I have made our farm available and gave out all our experience, nurturing a small, experimental hop field with 48 plants of 12 different types; our aim was to investigate those types that best adapted to our plot of land. The results have been surprisingly positive, and we have had the chance to try the homebrew already on the first harvest.If it was a dream before, now this is a feasible dream: true hop, farmed here to be used either fresh or just dried out, which gives a particularly pleasant flavour to the beer. Now that we’re right into it, now that we have actually put those plants there, now that we’ve seen them born, grown and rewarding us with satisfaction, now that we have tasted the beers done with our hop… Now we want to pursue that dream.With your contribution (that, as you well know, represents only a part of the overall investment), we’d like to expand that land, or better, to set up one with the types that had taken root in the best way, and we've also saved some rewards to all of you who are going to to believe in our project: when harvest time comes, during the month of August, we’ll show you the plot of land, you’re going to help us out with harvesting, and you will bring home all the hop you’ll manage to fill your t-shirt with (we are expecting to see some giant sweatshirts!), then you could have lunch in our farm. Whoever wants to come here from afar and has never had the pleasure to visi tour beautiful region, not only will have the chance to participate in the harvest, but also to be accompanied to visit the beauties of the Park.Here's the next step that we want to pursue with your participation:Collaborations: We don't want to throw ourselves towards something bigger than us without awareness. We will use the help of other hop producers, with whom we mainly share a friendship, and the support of experts and research centers. We want to do everything in the best way, without risking anything, pondering over every choice.Thank you!MariateresaMusic: http://www.bensound.com","Our challenges are the ones typically present in any agricultural activity (bad weather, plant diseases, etc..), but we are seriously interested in controlling of every stage of the process.

https://www.kickstarter.com/projects/slantrobotics/jerry-an-affordable-jetsons-style-personal-robot?ref=discovery_category_newest,slantrobotics/jerry-an-affordable-jetsons-style-personal-robot,"There are a lot of robots in the world. But most only have the capability to do one thing. Those that can do more cost tens of thousands of dollars.Jerry is the first personal robot that is affordable as well as capable enough to be used for any number of different tasks and applications.What does Jerry do? You might as well ask what did the original Apple II do?""The reason it has taken so long for the robotics industry to move forward is because people keep trying to make something that is cool but difficult to achieve rather than trying to find solutions to actual human problems."" ~Colin Angle, CEO of iRobotThe Hardware is ExpensiveUnlike computers, robots have physical parts that don't follow Moore's Law. And if you have a robot with an arm, then all those motors and gears really start to add to the cost sheet.Simple Mechanisms Instead of MotorsJerry has been made affordable by simplifying many of the mechanisms as far as possible while remaining functional. Two motors were never used where one would do. Any other approach is just lazy design.If this had not been the approach then Jerry would have cost tens of thousands of dollars, like all the rest, and not have been any more useful.Jerry is made of wood. Every structural and visible piece came from a tree. We essentially put motors in a cabinet.Look at your house. Is it made of glass? Are there white lights and curved white furniture sitting everywhere? Probably not.Designed to Look Like FurnitureJerry is meant to look like  a piece of furniture. He makes his statement when people see that he is a robot bringing a soda. When he is just waiting around or sweeping the floor it is better if he is not gaudy.Wood has also let us keep costs down in manufacturing as well as create a platform that can be easily modified and hacked by adventurous hobbyists that might like to add something to Jerry.Simplified MechanicsTake a moment to imagine that you don't have a wrist. Add in that your shoulder can't swing your arm sideways. Now try to open a door or grab a soda. You can probably still do it, right. Its a bit awkward but it is by no means impossible.Many robots have endless points of articulation in an emulation of a human arm. This is nice for a research group or for a person, but is it really necessary?Then there is the matter of cost. A robot with an arm is often very expensive because of the complexity of the parts in the arm.So Jerry's arm was stripped to its bare essentials.The design maximizes the utility of every moving part of the machine so expensive components could be kept to a minimum.RetractableWhen not in use Jerry's arm is stowed to maintain his neutral exterior and ensure that the arm will not be damaged. It is also just cool to have a robot with a retractable arm.Driven by Linear ActuatorsIn order to maximize the weight that Jerry could lift, he uses a cable system driven by linear actuators in his base. This not only eliminates extraneous weight on the arm, but moves it low on Jerry so that it is more difficult for him to fall over.Large WorkspaceJerry has a large workspace letting him work in human environments. He can reach over counters, into a fridge, and down to the floor.When you create a robot to be put to use in many different applications, and torn apart by hackers, there is no reason to create a gripper that is supposed to be the ""end all be all."" It will always be wrong.3-D PrintedThe gripper on Jerry is 3-D printed. Hobbyists and researchers can change the design as needed and have it created quickly. This way a task-specific gripper can be built for any situation.RemovableTo remove the gripper all a person has to do is pull it off and undo the clip to the actuator cable.The modular design makes switching grippers quick and simple. Its like changing the nozzle on a vacuum cleaner.Software is easy to upgrade but, in robotics, hardware also needs to be modifiable. The gripper allows Jerry to be customized to varying circumstances as few other robots have ever made possible for the user.Jerry is propelled by two 24V gear motors. No, he does not balance on those two wheels like a Segway. He simply sits on his two drive wheels and casters. Any other method introduces an unnecessary point of failure and complication, with little benefit.24V Drive Motors and Power SupplyThe motors are powered by a rechargable battery pack which can power Jerry for 2-4 hours under continuous operation.Look in the mirror. How many eyes do you have? Hopefully two. Do you feel your way along with your hands when you walk down a hall. Do you send out a sound and listen to the response to find an object? Do you memorize your house so that you know the exact number of steps to take from one door to another. Not unless you're blind! Stereo-VisionThere is no reason to make robots blind when they have the capability to see the way what we see.Jerry has two 5 megapixel cameras to attain that goal.So that those cameras can ""look around"" they are on an articulated face which enables Jerry to see what he is grasping or about to roll over. The movement of the face also helps with interaction and communication.The great part about vision is that it gets better with computing. All the information needed to interact with the world is in a picture if you know how to get it. It is not just viable in a particular case, it is universally applicable. Other sensors are dead weight when vision is used correctly.Other SensorsJerry relies primarily on his cameras for perception. But for redundancy, Jerry's arm actuators contain potentiometers in order to read their location, and his drive motors are mounted with magnetic quadrature encoders.Used in Self-Driving CarsIn order to support the amount of data analysis required for a fully vision-based robot we needed a computer that was smarts. The Nvidia JetsonTK1 was chosen to be the main CPU.The Jetson was designed for use in vision and deep-learning applications. Tesla and Google use them in their self-driving car and deep-learning programs. With a computational rateof up to 326 Gigaflops the Jetson is a beast.LinuxThe Jetson runs a version of Ubuntu and can accept and run software such as ROS and TensorFlow. This makes Jerry an ideal platform for machine learning and artificial intelligence research. And now that research can be done on a robot that will actually be used in the real world by real people.Expandable Sensor CapacityThe microcontroller that takes the commands from the Jetson is the Arduino Mega. The Mega was far more I/O capabilities than many other open source microcontrollers. This capability again makes Jerry a good hobby or research platform.For detailed specs visit the webpage.See what went into making the Jerry prototype.""Your living room is the final frontier for robots.""                     ~Cynthia Breazeal, CEO of Jibo IncHobby then HomeJerry is ready to be released as a hobby and development platform. But he is meant for so much more than that. With a personal robot that is truly multiuse the obvious extension is to put him into homes. Jerry has the physical capabilities to operate in a house now. But the software needs to catch upThis campaign is to get Jerrys out into the hands of developers and educators who can begin to give us feedback on the design and capabilities and help us grow the software base.SDK and App StoreThe money from this campaign will allow Slant to build the first run of Jerry's and hire several dedicated developers to create the software infrastructure that is needed to start putting Jerry into homes, including an SDK and App Store.Jerry is going to become the world's first true personal robot butler.$5 - Honorary FounderEveryone that contributes $5 or more will be placed on our list of honorary founders displayed proudly on our website.$15 - 3-D printed Walter RobotWalter was the result of a long weekend programming and working on Jerry. This little guy basically became a mascot for Slant Robotics even over Jerry. You may have noticed him opening a few of our videos.This prize is a 2.5 inch tall 3-D printed version of that mascot.$25 - ""Build the Uprising"" T-ShirtSome people are afraid of technology. We are all the visionaries that embrace it. This T-shirt matches that mentality.$50 - Pre-order of Jerry Home Robot and T-shirtJerry is starting life as a development platform with a lot of applications. But the goal is to put him into homes. He will be the robot butler that everyone has imagined. This reward puts you at the top of the waiting-list to purchase the home version of Jerry, at a reduced price, when it is ready to do your laundry and play with your kids.To tide you over until then you will also receive a ""Build the Uprising"" T-Shirt.$1199 - Headless JerryJerry is going out to developers and hobbyists first. We have given him a tremendous brain. But it is not the only option. Jerry can run on a Raspberry Pi. This prize is the entire body of Jerry minus the main CPU. you can insert your own machine and start programming Jerry your way. All the microcontroller code will be available for your reference and customization.$1599 - Development Jerry Early BirdBe the first to get a Jerry at a discount of nearly $1000 dollars. This Jerry is a great development platform and will be able to accept all software that is created for the home version. In the meantime you can enjoy Jerry with the basic functionality that he will come with, or just start adding your own when the SDK is released.$1799 - Development JerryLate to the party. No worries. This reward is a full Jerry with basic functionality that you can begin to hack or teach with. And, of course, it will be ready to receive all of our home software when that portion of the project is complete.Basic prizes like T-shirts and Walter's will be delivered within a month of the campaign ending.The headless Jerry will be shipping much sooner than the other versions since it will not be reliant on any software.The Jerry's with the basic beta OS in place and ready for development will be ready in January. From there we will be working with folks to make final tweaks to the SDK which will be released so that people can easily build their own apps.The home version will have the OS fully completed with several tasks pre-programmed, such as clearing a room of random items and monitoring the house. Backers on the waiting list will have first dibs to purchase these units as a reduced price.When the App Store is completed customers will be able to upgrade their software and download new abilities.Gabe Bentz - Founder of SlantI've been building robots since I could walk. My first machine was a cardboard box with motors from tape players.Before Jerry I had worked as a consultant, freelance engineer, and product designer for several years while going to school. I took one year off to grow that business which I had started it in my dorm room.I have worked on projects ranging from tour guide robots to spherical robots, and everything learned in those projects is going into Jerry.Jerry has been built at the Idaho SBDC Business Accelerator, in Nampa Idaho. The facility is an incubator for small businesses. Its team is dedicated to the success of the companies here. I have been working with the SBDC Accelerator for several months and they have been instrumental in getting Jerry to this point and they can help Slant to take him even further.","Slant is working to create a physical product. With that comes all the challenges of manufacturing. But already Slant has the partners and equipment in place to deliver these first version robots.The design of Jerry has been finalized. The prototype has exposed all the errors. These are now corrected and the design ready for the assembly line.Slant is located in Nampa, ID which has many shops in the area. We have already made the connections with these manufacturers to create the pieces for Jerry.Any piece that can't be manufactured locally has already been sourced from multiple locations so that we will get the parts that we need when we need them.Final assembly and delivery will take place from the Slant office which is located within the Boise State TECenter. This incubator not only provides all the space required but also the help and resources needed to ensure the product is delivered.Hiring is also a challenge. Currently Gabe Bentz heads the project with help from freelancers and friends. This campaign will allow the hire of more people to work on Jerry, particularly in software development. The challenge is finding the correct people. But that has already been done. Several developers and friends have been selected who would be able to help bring Jerry to fruition. They will be hired at the successful conclusion of this campaign.But none of this can happen without your help. Please share or contribute to this campaign and help us to bring a true personal robot into the home.",https://www.kickstarter.com/projects/slantrobotics/littlearm-a-3-d-printed-arduino-robot-arm?ref=discovery_category_newest,slantrobotics/littlearm-a-3-d-printed-arduino-robot-arm,"The LittleArm was a weekend project that has grown into a full-time project and business. This campaign is to get the ball rolling.I wanted a robot arm. But even the kits are expensive, for what they deliver. So one weekend I grabbed a few high strength microservos and went to work designing the parts to have printed.At the end of the weekend I had a couple of different versions of the robot. I took it to work and everyone loved to play with it and I soon had a couple of people ask me to print them one.Later, I was doing some demonstrations for STEM teachers. They also loved the idea, and they asked me to make them some for their classes.So I decided to turn my little maker project into an actual product at Slant Robotics.This campaign is to raise funds for building software and tutorials on using the arm and to purchase several 3-D printers and other supplies in order to produce the arms in greater quantities.The LittleArm is a completely open source project. I made it 3-D printed so that anyone can download the parts and start using it. It also ensures that the arm can be rapidly changed and developed for different applications, without being constrained by molds.The arm is controlled entirely by an Arduino Uno. The Uno provides a decent amount of support and is very versatile. These qualities allow almost anyone to start programming the arm and add other features like sensors.Arduino is also supported on platforms such as Blockly, so beginners can write programs graphically.The arm is designed to have a modular gripper. While there is a servo to actuate a gripper I have also designed several rigid end-effectors for different tasks.If you want to use the GUI or create some other complex program, you need more than the Arduino. All other software, is entirely based in Python. Python is a simple language to learn and has a large amount of support.Most of the foundational programs have been created. Kinematics are done. We have a basic GUI. And best of all we have a ""record"" function so you can train the robot to perform a task and then watch it go.That is the start, but honestly the number of programs that can be created for an arm like this is big.We could set-up a webcam and add vision. We could have some basic sensors so that it follows a laser pointer. We could make it play with a ball. (Oh wait, we did that)But in order to create all of those programs we need a little money and a bit of help. We would love it if anyone who is interested in the project shares their code with us on our website.We have already created a basic website to support the arm. It started as a project blog, so it is a bit rough. But we are working on getting it upgraded.In the future the website will contain all resources needed to build, work with, and teach with the LittleArm.STEMSo many of the programming kits out there are just too complicated and quickly become boring. How many times does it take to make a robot follow a line before the kids decide the idea is stupid? Plus many of those ""build"" kits just have a bunch of pieces waiting to be lost.This arm is a great kit that doesn't have many pieces to lose, can take a kid through every part of engineering, from design to programming, and always has something else to add.Imagine a class project where kids have to create an assembly line with their robot arms. Or they create a small group of synchronized dancing robots. Maybe they train the robot to feed the science class lizard. While this arm is simple it can do a ton of stuff.HobbyThere are a lot of hobby arms out there. But they are all expensive, and they are really not very helpful because they depend on a 'community' to make it interesting.This arm is so basic that anyone with a any kind of experience can easily create programs from scratch. And while we like and want a community, it is not a necessity to use this arm.ResearchYes, that is what was just said. This arm can be used for a number of different research purposes. In fact I am working on a small project in deep learning right now with the arm. It is a whole lot easier to test software on this arm than on a large industrial robot. And since deep learning requires data, it is a lot cheaper to get 100 of these arms to provide data than a single industrial arm.But that is all nerd stuff. No one really cares about that.Actual Home UseHave you ever forgotten to feed the fish. This arm could be programmed to do it. Maybe someone at the table needs a mint. This arm could broach the subject. Maybe it could scratch your cat's belly. Maybe it could put the sugar in your coffee. Maybe you need a Rube Goldberg method of turning on a light.We don't expect anyone to make these an official part of their home. This section is just an excuse to present some other ideas.Build the Uprising T-Shirt","I have been working in robotics for nearly ten years. This project is basic.I have already sourced all the materials and resources and am ready to upload the files to the printer to start making preorders. Additionally since it is being supported by Slant Robotics there are a lot of resources and talent to draw from within the business.The largest challenge will be creating enough tutorials and software to make this robot easy and fun to learn on. That will be an ongoing process but the architecture has been laid out and a lot of those resources have already been created. Right now an eighth grade kid could learn to use what we have available. We're trying to get it down to a 3rd grade kid, or lower.We have detailed how to use  Blockly for the robot and are creating web interfaces to eliminate the need for configuring python on the computer. And there is a small online video class in the works to walk anyone through the entire robot.The largest challenge on the hardware side is printing the arms in quantity. Printing can be unreliable. But we have designed several new methodologies for ensuring quality prints most of the time. This ensures that we can use printing at a greater scale."
https://www.kickstarter.com/projects/the-black-deck/suicide-prevention-choose-to-stay?ref=discovery_category_newest,the-black-deck/suicide-prevention-choose-to-stay,"Millions of people deal with depression, mental illness and thoughts of suicide every year in the United States. According to the CDC, 47,000 people died from suicide in 2017. One person dies from suicide every 11 minutes. The suicide rate has risen 33% from 1999 - 2017 and the pace of this rise has been increasing since 2006, coincidentally around the same time as the rise of social media usage. Suicide is the second leading cause of death in youth under the age of 35. The CDC also reports that in 2017, 10.6 million adults in the United States seriously thought about suicide, 3.2 million people made a plan to commit suicide, and 1.4 million actually attempted suicide. These statistics are absolutely horrifying. In my personal experience, I had a dear friend commit suicide a year ago. She reached out to close family but her calls went unanswered and unreturned. She reached out to friends, some of which attempted to help but were not professionals nor were they properly equipped to handle something as delicate as mental illness and depression. Her last resort was to reach out to her social media following in which she was met with bullying, laughter, taunts, threats and encouragement to take her life. Well, she fulfilled their wishes. She left behind a 9 year old daughter. One of our employees lost his sister to suicide. She was an Army Vet who had a very serious case of PTSD and deep depression. One night, the flashbacks that she would frequently have became too much and she put a gun to her head and took her life.We at Spark Technology Group, LLC founded in 2020 and based out of Austin, TX understand that in today's climate and the ever increasing use of the internet and mobile applications, millions of people feel more comfortable seeking assistance for their issues online and we want to create an app that will provide the proper help that they need. There are 69 mobile applications available in the Apple and Google Play stores that target individuals with depression and suicidal ideologies which have been downloaded over one million times. Good right? No. Actually quite the opposite. These apps have caused more harm than good. Why? Because they have been found to contain inaccurate and nonfunctional contact information to suicide crisis prevention lines. This causes very problematic outcomes. Another vital function that these apps dont provide are direct connections to healthcare providers, physicians or counselors, the most important sources who are trained and prepared to help deal with these very issues! How could so many app developers miss this??Due to personal losses as well as the loss of thousands of others,from civilians to active military, we have teamed up with 6 medical professionals who have agreed to oversee the development of our app simply called, ""Help."" ""Help"" will track suicidal thoughts, the ability to build a plan for users who have suicidal thoughts, will recommend activities to deter those thoughts, will provide educational materials about the risk factors for suicide and will include emergency contact information for users support network. Not only this but ""Help"" will provide access to emergency assistance with the push of a button. If a user has reached their breaking point and can no longer keep it together, ""Help"" will have an emergency button that users can push that will call their designated emergency contact for them immediately, but when that function is triggered, we will simultaneously alert local police and EMS to report to the users location and transport them to the nearest medical facility. Suicide is literally life or death and we want to be certain that we are providing USEFUL solutions and access to help that will help to save a life.","Help is still in its early stages. We are meeting with our volunteer medical professionals as well as our developers on a weekly basis to ensure we are on the same page and that development is going as scheduled. Forecasting RiskWe’ve done our very best to create a solid development, testing and launch plan. We’ve learned a lot over the last few months, but sometimes forecasts don’t always hit the mark. Should we miss projections, we’ll let you know why and make it right as quickly as possible. As with any mobile app, we are mindful of the common risks that we may face in this industry. Those risks include:- Building an app that is not useful for the end users. To avoid this mistake, we are planning and developing from the end-user perspective. We are also consulting with individuals who have attempted suicide or deal with depression or anxiety and are noting some features that they would find useful within an app and working to incorporate those features. - Adding too many features. We are careful to develop  a feature-rich application that is not confusing or clumsy to use. We only want to add the features that will be used as to avoid making the app too heavy, thus slowing down speed and reliability.- Assuming our Application is Perfect - We will rely on end user feedback to make necessary modifications and updates so that end-users have an optimal experience utilizing the app at all times. - Developing for Multiple Platforms at Once. We are a small company and are aware of our limitations therefore we are focusing on launching our app on one platform at a time.",https://www.kickstarter.com/projects/the-black-deck/the-black-deck?ref=discovery_category_newest,the-black-deck/the-black-deck,"The Black Deck – Playing CardsWe are STG and this is our first Kickstarter playing card project. We are very happy to present our Black Deck custom playing cards. We got tired of the standard deck of playing cards and wanted to spice things up by giving them a facelift so we combined our favorite thing to do, play cards, with colorful images and pop culture references (and YES, they are licensed) to make game night fun again. This will be an ongoing series of ""Themed"" poker playing card decks. We plan on releasing several decks (or series) a year and each of these decks will have a different theme. We took the traditional design for playing cards which is in the public domain, and redesigned the card faces completely making the design unique to the STG brand. Each deck is inspired by everything from our favorite T.V. Shows both past and present, Iconic movies and much more.And much more............Printed by: MPCLinen Air Light Playing Cards - The card stock is nothing like you’ve ever handled before. It’s highly responsive, thinner, lighter, softer and possesses the perfect level of stiffness needed for amplifying your cardistry.Impressions & Impressions Foil Playing Cards - A mix of traditional manufacturing methods plus state-of-the-art secondary process industrial machinery. In short, an embossed gloss UV is applied to certain areas of the playing cards using pinpoint accuracy, onto a layer of thin foil on the complex card back design to produce a sleek raised gloss embossed effect called virko. This produces the outstandingly attractive and shiny metallic card back look and provides a whole new experience on touching and feeling the artwork.The Invisible Playing Cards – A premium transparent plastic card stock, with any of our custom themed designs, with a high-gloss transparent print applied to certain areas of the playing cards to produce a sleek raised gloss embossed effect. The cards are then completed with a finishing that enables the cards to glide seamlessly for fans and springs and perform as you'd expect a high-quality deck of playing cards to perform.You can order our custom deck on premium card stock or on premium quality plastic card material. Plastic playing cards are the best materials used in the gaming industry for their high quality, durability and smooth handling. You can bend them, they are completely waterproof and last much longer than an ordinary deck of paper made playing cards. They are also perfect for collectors.Each of our custom decks also have matching tuck boxes, tin boxes and poker chips to complement their beautiful and unique designs.",There are no real risks for this project.

In 2008 he moved to Anchorage, AK and noticed thatthe local apple selection was both expensive and limited. He has been yearningfor quality fruit ever since. This summer he is planting an acre of apple treesas well as a variety of other fruits and vegetables with the hopes of kickingoff his long term goal of building an Alaskan Apple Empire. Alaska Bug Bites isthe first step in bringing delicious fruits and vegetables to Anchorage and keeping them available year-round.Alaska Bug Bites is a local Alaskan company with the hopes of dehydrating fruitand vegetable chips starting this summer. We have already started samplingideas with our friends and neighbors, running them past everyone we know. Theresults have been outstanding! So far we have tested numerous batches includingblueberries, tomatoes, pineapples, bell peppers, apples, strawberries, and muchmore. The apple chips disappear before everyone in the room even gets a chanceto taste them, and the other fruits and veggies vanish right after!From our simplysweet apple, pear, orange, and chocolate drizzled strawberry, to the savorysamplings of lightly salted cucumber, carrot, and tomato; everyone seems tolove the crisp and light textures.What is our long-term goal?The goal is to be able to produce these delicious dehydrated fruit andvegetable chips on a large scale. Unfortunately, Alaska has a very limitedresource of locally grown produce. Almost everything needed tostart production needs to be shipped from elsewhere. We are locally harvesting blueberries, apples, currants, tomatoes, strawberries, raspberries, and some vegetables to keep shipping costs down and to support agriculture within our community. These local resources will provide a portion of our produce supply, but there is not enough to operate for the entire year.How can you help?In order to keep up with demands while being able to sell these tasty treats at a competitive price, we need to be able to produce larger batches than rentable time and space in a commercial kitchen will allow. The best solution we have found is to create a mobile kitchen. Ben has already gathered the necessary materials to turn an eight-foot delicase into a dehydrator capable of processing 400 square feet of chips at atime. What we need now is the kitchen to fill it! With your help, we wouldlike to buy a 24-foot long cargo trailer that we can convert into a commercialkitchen capable of being permitted. This means that we need a triple sink,vents, water tanks, 100 lb propane tanks, flooring, food prep surfaces, stove,hand washing sink, food prep sink, plumbing, sanitizers, lights, fans, and tohave it all installed.How will this money be spent?Nearly half of the budget is needed in order to purchase the trailer itself,the rest is to finish permitting and to install the various necessary kitchenequipment. We have spent the last several months calculating out exactly whatis needed and what is not. This budget allows for constructing the commercialkitchen trailer, preparing the first batches of chips, and covering major risksfor the first few months. Ben has several years of experience with basic construction, but will be leaning on several friends in the construction industry for help with building the kitchen. We have already started work on the dehydrator and are gathering materials to build solar air-heater panels. These will reduce our demand for propane and potentially heat the dehydrator for most of the year at no additional cost. This kitchen will be entirely off-grid using a solar panel for all electrical needs and a solar air heater and propane for all dehydrating and food preparation. Our packaging will be provided by Green Alaska Solutions in order to sustainably source as much as possible and reduce waste. This means we can produce healthy snack alternatives without impacting the world we are relying on for ingredients (and life!).Once we are producing, where can you find us?We are planning to have a booth at the Anchorage Downtown Market and Festival every weekend, providing samples and sales to the more than 600,000 visitors that stop in each summer. That is more than 30,000 people each weekend!During the week we will be delivering orders to restaurants, bars, gift shops, bakeries, cafes, groceries stores, and anywhere else interested in delicious local products.","Dehydrating is one of the least energy-intensive means of preserving food. It simply takes heat and airflow. Even with such simple requirements, heat isn't always easy to find this far North. Our plan is to power the dehydrator using a large solar air heater built onto the side of the trailer. This heater should be able to keep us going for most of the year, but it doesn't work for winter or at night. To continue meeting demand during these cold, dark times, we are including a secondary stand-alone heating system using a propane burner. This means that we can keep up with everyone's hunger year-round and produce our special holiday batches even when the sun has fallen below the horizon.",https://www.kickstarter.com/projects/1369449745/alaska-bug-bites-llc-farmers-markets-launch?ref=discovery_category_newest,1369449745/alaska-bug-bites-llc-farmers-markets-launch,"Why are we doing this?Ever since Ben was a kid,apples have been his life.

They are very rewarding.How will this money be spent?In order to sell our chips at the numerous markets and fairs within the state, we will need over $200 worth of business licenses for the various cities and boroughs, nearly $10,000 worth of market and fair booth fees, enough gas money for over 10,000 miles, a few pallets of packaging, labels, and the last few layers of permit fees. We are hoping to raise $2000 in order to pay for the remainder of our permitting, the first few weekend market fees, fair application fees, and enough fruit and vegetables to start production.Once we are producing, where can you find us?We are planning to have multiple booths operating each week at nearly all of the farmers markets, fairs, and holiday shows within South Central Alaska.

We've designed a lot of cool rewards and since we've done this film thing before we figured we were a better gamble than say, Vegas. :)Screenwriter: Brad Koberg director: jianna s maarten - Mercy Nurse will be maarten's 3rd film.

The photographs will allow you to see Wrigley Field in a way you've never seen before: with an artistic view of all its beauty and not a single person in any photograph. About the Photographer: I was born and raised in Illinois. That is where my passion for sports and art began at a very early age. In 2009, I moved across the country via train with just a backpack, suitcase, and camera to pursue a degree in Sports and Documentary Photography at the Academy of Art University in San Francisco, California.     Since that time, I have photographed products for numerous companies, high school and college sporting events, live shows for bands, and much more. I am always looking for the unorthodox but interesting perspectives in my work, and I think that shows in this project.My Story: Being a Cubs fan has been embedded in me since the day that I was born. It's in my genes. I can almost guarantee that the blood that runs through my veins is Cubbie Blue. My first Cubs game was when I was six years old; they were playing the Montreal Expos. I still remember sitting in the bleachers with my dad and wearing my glove, hoping to catch a ball. The feeling that came over me when I saw the ballpark for the first time is still the exact feeling that I get to this very day, more than 20 years later. Throughout the years, even when the Cubs were losing 100 games a year, I never failed to visit the ""friendly confines"" to catch a game. A summer in Chicago has never been complete without a visit to 1060 West Addison Street.  After living in San Francisco for six years, I moved back to Chicago in 2015. Having witnessed all three of the Giant's World Series titles, I was hoping to bring some of that ""even year magic"" to the Cubs.  When I found out about a photography position at Wrigley Field, I jumped at the opportunity. I became a lead sales photographer for Fan Photo in the spring of 2015 and soon took on the role of manager of the photo department for the Wrigley Field tours. Although it wasn't my dream job, being at my favorite place in the world every day was captivating.  While working at Wrigley Field, I would show up hours before my shift began. It became a routine to just sit and observe the beauty and tranquility of the ballpark. This is exactly what I imagined my heaven to look like. After doing this for a few weeks, I thought I need to photograph this. I had been to Wrigley Field more times than I could even count, however, I had never seen it like this: quiet, peaceful... and empty.  Most of the time, I felt like I was the only person in the ballpark, and sometimes that was the case. I began taking photographs of the intricate details that I had never noticed throughout the years. Continuing to do this throughout the 2015 and 2016 baseball seasons, I now have enough photos to comprise a photography book. I would like to share my riveting photos with you and show you a perspective of Wrigley Field that you have never experienced before.  Thank you for your support, and I hope you enjoy the magnetism of Wrigley Field!Video Subtitles:Hello Kickstarter,  My name is Matthew Schumacher, and I am a Sports and Documentary Photographer. The project that I am launching is a Photo Book called ""Clark & Addison"". The concept of the project is to show the intricate details of Wrigley Field that make it a one-of-a-kind ballpark. Wrigley Field is the second oldest ballpark in Major League Baseball. It was built in 1914, and for over 100 years, it has given countless fans endless unforgettable moments. It's the place where Babe Ruth hit his famous ""Called Shot"" in the 1932 World Series. It was home to the Chicago Bears for nearly 50 years, and has held numerous performances by famous artists including AC/DC, Pearl Jam, and Luke Bryan.  The Photo Book will contain images of the distinguishing features of Wrigley Field, beyond the bricks and ivy. My photos will give you the experience of being the ONLY one in the ballpark. Pictures of the longest foul poles in baseball, the lights that were installed in 1988, the infamous wall from the 2003 NLCS and the seating layout of the home bowl area will all be featured, among other things. The funding for the project is exclusively to cover the cost of making the books here in America and the rewards for pledges over $10 (including shipping within USA). Please help fund my project and allow me to share with you, the magnetism of Wrigley Field.  Thank you... Let's Go Cubs!","The only real challenge will be getting the project funded.  All of the photos have already been taken throughout the 2015 and 2016 baseball seasons, and I've been working on finalizing the layout of the Photo Book.  Upon receiving funding, the project will be complete.

I am always looking for the unorthodox but interesting perspectives in my work, and I think that shows in this project.My Story:          Being a Cubs fan has been embedded in me since the day that I was born.  It's in my genes.  I can almost guarantee that the blood that runs through my veins is Cubbie Blue.          My first Cubs game was when I was six years old; they were playing the Montreal Expos.  I still remember sitting in the bleachers with my dad and wearing my glove, hoping to catch a ball.  The feeling that came over me when I saw the ballpark for the first time is still the exact feeling that I get to this very day, more than 20 years later.          Throughout the years, even when the Cubs were losing 100 games a year, I never failed to visit the ""friendly confines"" to catch a game.  A summer in Chicago has never been complete without a visit to 1060 West Addison Street.           After living in San Francisco for six years, I moved back to Chicago in 2015.  Having witnessed all three of the Giant's World Series titles, I was hoping to bring some of that ""even year magic"" to the Cubs.          When I found out about a photography position at Wrigley Field, I jumped at the opportunity.  I became a lead sales photographer for Fan Photo in the spring of 2015 and soon took on the role of manager of the photo department for the Wrigley Field tours.  Although it wasn't my dream job, being at my favorite place in the world every day was captivating.           While working at Wrigley Field, I would show up hours before my shift began.  It became a routine to just sit and observe the beauty and tranquility of the ballpark.  This is exactly what I imagined my heaven to look like.          After doing this for a few weeks, I thought I need to photograph this.  I had been to Wrigley Field more times than I could even count, however, I had never seen it like this: quiet, peaceful... and empty.          Most of the time, I felt like I was the only person in the ballpark, and sometimes that was the case.  I began taking photographs of the intricate details that I had never noticed throughout the years.          Continuing to do this throughout the 2015 and 2016 baseball seasons, I now have enough photos to comprise a photography book.  I would like to share my riveting photos with you and show you a perspective of Wrigley Field that you have never experienced before.           Thank you for your support, and I hope you enjoy the magnetism of Wrigley Field!Video Subtitles:Hello Kickstarter,          My name is Matthew Schumacher, and I am a Sports and Documentary Photographer.  The project that I am launching is a Photo Book called ""Clark & Addison"".  The concept of the project is to show the intricate details of Wrigley Field that make it a one-of-a-kind ballpark.          Wrigley Field is the second oldest ballpark in Major League Baseball.  It was built in 1914, and for over 100 years, it has given countless fans endless unforgettable moments.  It's the place where Babe Ruth hit his famous ""Called Shot"" in the 1932 World Series.  It was home to the Chicago Bears for nearly 50 years, and has held numerous performances by famous artists including AC/DC, Pearl Jam, and Luke Bryan.            The Photo Book will contain images of the distinguishing features of Wrigley Field, beyond the bricks and ivy.  My photos will give you the experience of being the ONLY one in the ballpark.  Pictures of the longest foul poles in baseball, the lights that were installed in 1988, the infamous wall from the 2003 NLCS and the seating layout of the home bowl area will all be featured, among other things.          The funding for the project is exclusively to cover the cost of making the books here in America and the rewards for pledges over $10 (including shipping within USA).           Please help fund my project and allow me to share with you, the magnetism of Wrigley Field.           Thank you...  Let's Go Cubs!","The only real challenge will be getting the project funded. All of the photos have already been taken throughout the 2015 and 2016 baseball seasons, and I've been working on finalizing the layout of the Photo Book. Upon receiving funding, the project will be complete.Thank you in advance to everyone who helps fund my project!"

Through a series of interfaces and controls the user is transported and able to see what mimic sees, do what mimic does, feel what mimic feels, and go where mimic goes.The key to bringing mimic to life is the mimic arm controller with patent pending Posi-Feel grip controllers. The user wears a device that allows the seamless control of mimic’s arms and grippers by moving his or her own hands and arms in natural ways while holding two simple handles with trigger style grip controllers. Mimic can also move around on its own power, controlled by the user with an IRS based foot controller. The user places both feet on the controller and tilts the device forward, back, left, or right to command mimic's movements in natural, hands free ways. To complete the user’s sense of immersion, immersion goggles receive 3d video from a pair of cameras in mimic's eyes. Not only does the user see what mimic sees in vibrant 3D, but using a series of sensors and motors the user’s head motion is duplicated by mimic's head, allowing the user to change view by simply moving his or her head.This assemblage of new technologies allows the user to see the world from a fresh, new point of view- that of a 12 inch tall, wide-eyed, rotund little robot. In the words of our founder ""mimic represents a technological breakthrough in think about human interfaces by adapting the robot to the user, rather than the other way around.""The mimic control system consists of three components: 3d immersion goggles, mimic arm controller with Posi-Feel Grippers, and the mimic foot controller. The mimic arm controller is the key to all our mimic robots, while mimic:play, mimic:social, and mimic:3d also incorporate the foot controller. video is included in mimic:social (2d TV receiver) and mimic:3d (3d immersion goggles).mimic:maker - Do what mimic does, feel what mimic feelsIncludes:mimic robot kit without cosmetic coversmimic arm controller kitAll electronics, servos, and motorsThe mimic:maker version comes in kit form for the user to assemble. The kit includes a robot with two arms and grippers, as well as a mimic arm controller. The kit does not include a body, however, so the user can tailor the robot to their needs or to make something new.  For even more flexibility, all the electronic inputs and outputs are exposed to be manipulated or utilized by the user, including recording and playback through an on board SD card. ""The future is being invented in basements, garages, and maker spaces all over the world. That's where mimic was born, and mimic:maker is a chance for other tinkerers to use and improve it,"" says Pipitone.mimic:play - do what mimic does, feel what mimic feels, go where mimic goesincludes:Assembled mimic robot with cosmetic coversAssembled mimic arm controllermimic foot controllerAll electronics, servos, and motorsThe mimic:play comes as a fully assembled robot, including the 12 degree of freedom arm controller. While mimic:play doesn't have as many features as some offerings, it's just as adorable and its simplicity makes it more accessible for some users.  Fun features like the mimic arm controller, Posi-Feeel grippers, and on-board SD card are included. ""Mimic:play is simpler than the other versions, but still offers intuitive control and a sense of feel.

With this full suite of features the user can completely lose themselves in mimic’s world.  ""This robot really transports you to an immersive reality. Everyday things seem huge, and you can interact from an entirely new point of view,"" describes Pipitone. ""I can interact with my baby daughter on her level as an equal, while it’s simple enough that my 6-year-old son can pick it up and use it.

Our Kickstarter goal, combined with the willingness of the founders to shoulder some financial risk, ensure that these risks will not jeopardize the project beyond a potential delay of a few weeks.Our mimic prototype is almost fully functional, but production quality circuit boards have not been implemented.  There is a small chance of delay if the first batch encounters any issues, but lead times are generally under 6 weeks if changes are required.  Our experience with the Doorbell Phone and Cortex: Robot Arm Controller give us a solid idea of these risks and how to design around them, and our circuit board house has been great about preventing potential bad boards.",https://www.kickstarter.com/projects/713401305/mimicarm-learn-to-code-your-own-ai-robot?ref=discovery_category_newest,713401305/mimicarm-learn-to-code-your-own-ai-robot,"Twitter - Facebook - InstagrammimicArm is a programmable collaborative A.I. robot. Using a building block approach to teaching, users will learn complex robotics programming in a gradual frustration-free way. As soon as it's constructed mimicArm works in manual mode and can execute pre-programmed example programs. Thanks to the intuitive nature of mimicArm, children as young as five can start using mimicArm right away. When the user is ready to start programming on their own mimicBlock offers a simple drag-and-drop programming environment. More complex programs can be written in C to perform more complex robotic tasks. Learn more about mimicArm here. There are plenty of educational robots out there, but mimicArm is the only true k-12+ robot available. No other educational robot combines the simplicity required for young students with the capability required for more experienced users.As a programmable A.I. collaborative robot (or cobot), mimicArm is a fun way to learn robotics and the foundations of programming robot/human interactions, robot decision making, and machine learning. mimicArm is fun and engaging from the very start. As soon as mimicArm is assembled the user can start using mimicArm in manual mode. Adding the scribbleBot attachment is even more fun. Users can post their projects and get advice in our forum at fabric8r.com.When the user is ready to start programming, pre-programmed examples ensure that users are able to start fast. The mimicBlock graphical programming language makes it easy for kids to load and alter programs from our websiteor write programs of their own. (You can download mimicBlock BETA now to see how it works). mimicBlock is similar to other programming curricula commonly used in classrooms and STEAM camps across the world, so it makes a great complement to other tools the user might be using. After learning the basics in mimicBlock more advanced programs can be written in C. These examples get pretty sophisticated, and you can learn more about them here.In manual mode mimicArm uses our patent pending Posi-Feel(tm) technology (learn more), which gives the user intuitive haptic feedback and allows sophisticated delicate manipulation not possible on other servo based robots.  This not only provides intuitive feel, reducing operator frustration, but also allows the user to manipulate a variety of objects, from strong and heavy to very fragile. The inputBox (included in our Deluxe kit) comes pre-programmed to allow the user to use different inputs to interact with mimicArm right away.  As the user learns to program mimicArm to perform ever more complex tasks they can develop a unique personality for their mimicArm based on the programming choices they make. There are other robots designed to teach programming, but only mimicArm is uniquely designed to teach interaction between robot and human. Through its unique design and combinations of sensors mimicArm is able to sense it's environment in such a way as to understand what a human is asking it to do. At the simplest, mimicArm can tell if it has grabbed a block it's been offered, while at it's most complex mimicArm is able to detect and reach for blocks, sort by size, communicate it's status, and receive instructions through a microphone or button.  It's a great choice for everyone from robot novice to veteran programmer. Never programmed before? No problem! When you're ready, our simple yet powerful programming software gradually eases you into programming concepts and our downloadable experiments start simple to guide you every step of the way. The mimicArm circuit board takes care of the tough control system tasks so the user can program with simple intuitive commands like robotMove or robotGrab. The experiments incrementally increase in complexity until you're able to program using genuine C code just like the professionals, and your mimicArm becomes a genuine collaborative robot, capable of making decisions and learning. Want to pick up delicate objects without breaking them? mimicArm can do that. Want to record and playback a dance? mimicArm can do that. Need a shop assistant to hold your soldering iron? mimicArm can do that too. Add our available accessories and even more possibilities emerge. mimicArm is the only k-12 educational robot available. mimicArm leverages the popular Arduino microcontrollers and programming environment for nearly infinite expandability as the user’s abilities grow. Want to make mimicArm remote controlled? Use the remote included in our inputBox! Want to record and playback your motions? Use the inputBox microSD card! Want mimicArm to detect and move blocks? Use our IR Distance Sensor! Check out our Experiments Page for examples. Using these capabilities you can take mimicArm from a simple manually controlled robot all the way to an artificial intelligence machine capable of decision making and human interaction.All of our mimicArm kits allow the user to get started in manual mode as soon as they’re assembled, come pre-programmed with simple A.I. examples, and are programmable. mimicArm kits are designed for easy assembly. Using the included wrench, screwdriver, and hex key you can fully assembl your mimicArm in a couple of hours. (Younger users will need an adult’s help).

After a few months of programming and figuring out the programming logic to turn my card game into an App, I was finally able to get it released on the Apple App Store.https://itunes.apple.com/us/app/kings-assassin/id718278373?ls=1&mt=8ThedilemmaI do not program for Android or Windows 8 platform. I researched maybe giving the task to a freelancer, but, you guessed it, that can be a pretty hefty cost. I turned to companies that will convert my iOS project to Android or Windows 8, but that also cost money. Hence the reason I am turning to you. The other issue is, in order to make Kings Assassin a household name. Which is the over all goal. I will need to spend some advertisment dollars, no surprise there.So, I have one word, HELP.Why I need Your HELPI am an indie app developer. What that really means is, I do not have the backing of a huge corporation to create and promote my apps. The real truth is, you can create the most intriguing and fun Apps, but without commercialization and capital, your App will get lost with all the other hopeful Apps that are created daily. This is why I need your help. I currently develop Apps for the iOS platform which are iPhone and iPad devices. I need to team with a company or Android developer, as well as a Windows 8 developer, so I can expand my App, Kings Assassin, to other platforms. Also, I need to fund and develop an advertisement plan to spread the word about Kings Assassin.I want to go all inI picture myself going from city to city holding card parties, handing out special prizes. Prizes like t-shirts, bumper stickers, coffee mugs, a specially designed card deck, and other novelties. Ok none of this will be easy without your help. I believe after the initial start, Kings Assassin will gain traction, and pay for itself, it is the getting started that takes some work.Below is the rules of play with a standard deck of cards. Also I have included Youtube links to tutorial videos of actual game play in the App.RewardsThe rewards, I have chosen correspond with the level of advertisements, I can afford if you choose to fund this project.Kings Assassin the RulesKing  Queen  Jack  AssassinKing can save himself with 4 kings or 4 aces or five spades.Queen can save the King with 4 queens or 5 diamondsQueen can take the King out with 5 clubsJack can save the King with 4 jacks or 5 clubsJack can take the King out with 5 heartsAssassin can take the King out with 4 aces or 5 kings or 5 spadesPlayers can play blind or straight.BlindTo play blind take a King, Queen, Jack, and Ace, mixed them up and each player take a card. Hand the cards back to the dealer, remember who you are, and what hand you need to build to win.Someone then will deal 7 cards to each player and then the dealer will pass the remainder of the deck; one card at a time. If you get five cards of one suit, you win and receive 25 points. If you get 4 of a kind, you will receive 50 points.To make the game more competitive, who ever reaches 500 first, will win.Jokers can be used as wild cards only to make 4 of a kind.StraightTo play straight each player picks a card from the deck; the player with the highest card chooses who will be the King, Queen, Joker, and Assassin. The king deals the cards and passes the remainder of the deck; one card at a time.If the King is saved the person that saves the King gets 25 points. If the King saves himself, he gets 50 points. The King will remain on his throne. If someone takes the King out, he gets 25 points, and then becomes the King. Only the King and the person, who takes the king out will trades positions.

Some of us have multiple stories in our head. We Are gods! is one of those stories in my head. Really, it is pictures and images like a dream you have while you are awake.To tell the truth, We Are gods! started off as a movie idea I had in 1999. At that time, the movie had no title. I would just imagine, what if you had a main character in a movie that you never saw, but the movie could not be a success, it could not happen, without him or her? What if this character could change people's lives and the majority of those people he helped never really met him? One more what if... what if he, and those who joined him, started something and the end result changed the world?Ok, back to reality. But really, this movie never left my head and gradually it grew into a world inside my head. I never had the money, nor the courage, to share this movie with anyone. For that matter, I never wrote it down.A Story inside a StoryIn 2006, I started planning to build a house. Being the general contractor, I was responsible for bringing all of the pieces and people together to build a house. Most of my friends and family had said that such a task would be very difficult, especially since the most a lender would loan me was a $136,000 dollars. In 2006, you could never build a house with those limited funds. I asked for support from family and friends and no one was willing to get sucked into one of my crazy ideas. Yes, I had plenty of crazy ideas and some of them would blow up in my face when I tried to institute them. That never stopped me though.Why did i tell you that story? Because despite everything, I built that house, in 2007, it was completed, just as the real estate market exploded. Yep, right in my face, as well as in so many other faces. It was desperate times for the rich, the middle class, and I do not even know how the poor survived. Big companies were falling apart. Banks were filing for bankruptcies or just closing their doors. You remember. Prices for food, gas and the basic necessities was on the rise.Even with all of that going on, my family and I moved into that house in October of 2007. This was at great cost to my savings account, my checking account, and my 401k, not to mention to my mental health. You can say I give up, but I did not. I am happy to say, today, I am still living in my house.The prologue!When Government and Big Business assume their positions to lord it over mankind.These entities need to remember that all humans have an inherent god complex. In fact these words were spoken by a very influential person “you are gods.” Those who choose to lord it over others need to remember mankind's inherent right to their own godship.As mankind realizes that their godship has slowly been stripped away from them, there will be consequences. The restless part of society, the part that speaks out for those less fortunate, wether as an individual or as a group will lash out. Sometimes their anger may not be exposed as violent, it may even be disguised, cloaked, or take the form of a covert operation, or corporate espionage, and other times it will be very chaotic and violent.The governments of the world’s that have past saw firsthand such outbreaks. Ask yourself where is mighty Egypt, do you recall the influential Babylonian Dynasty, how about the stealthy and merciless Media Persia, does anybody even remember the long standing Dominance of Assyria, or the great and powerful domination of Greece, how about the All Conquering Roman Empire and even today the Dual World Powers of modern times are shaken and made unstable, by the human spirit that yearns to be free, to exercise their own godship over their own private domain?With each passing world, man and women alike have achieved more supposed freedom than those who have come before them. However they will discover that they have lost their true inheritance.Though the story being fictitious, and the events therein are not based on any reality, that I am aware of, it will move you, it will cause you to stand up and exclaim, “I am free and it is my God Given right to choose my own designation.” You will be motivated to do something about the injustice’s that are all around you.You will wake up tomorrow to the dawn of a new era. Perhaps you will exclaim We Are gods.There is more to that story, but I will stop here and just say, I learned a lot about myself and the starting of a big project. After that, I swore to myself that I would write down all my dreams that are in my head and start completing them. It does not matter if they become well known. The only thing that matters is that I complete them. This is where We Are gods! and all the other creative ideas in my head start.In 2008, I sat down and started writing a movie script for We Are gods! but, I must remind you, I still did not have a title. It took me half a day, at a bed and breakfast on my wedding anniversary, to write two paragraphs. Then, I took my wife to dinner and never returned to the story.In July 2014, I ruptured my L5 disk. It was a complete blowout. For a few weeks, I had paralysis in my left leg from my buttocks to my big toe. I walked with a limp and sometimes dragging my left leg. I had to have surgery and could not go to work for 16 weeks. I was prohibited, by my surgeon, to not even lift five pounds.It was at this point, We Are gods! became a reality. Yes, I finally had a title for my movie. I wrote everyday, for 12 weeks. I decided to write it just as if I was watching my own personal movie.Though the story is complete, I feel like I need real critics to tell me if it is ready for prime time. This is where you come in. Every backer of this project will get a full preview of this novel/movie script. From $1.00 and up, everyone will either get a Ebook or PDF copy of the book.Here is the really special part of this project, only those who support this Kickstarter.com project will get this full preview. You will also have an opportunity to critique the novel/movie script.After all is said and done, I will release the book to the market as a novel, with the hope that the story is popular enough to be turned into a movie.Some may want to know more about the book. All I will say is if the project reach certain milestones, I will do a reveal via an update. The first milestone is listed below.If this project is fortunate enough to reach 100 backers, I will reveal some information about one of the characters as well as a line or two from that character.Stay tuned in for the updates.T-ShirtsGotta get me one of these Tee's, I know thats what you're thinking.","I have offered you a opportunity, that most authors do not get to do. I have promised you a product before it is released to the market. However if I do not meet the funding goal, I will have to break my promise.The other risk, and it is one that all creative people fear. What is that? After you have read the story, you absolutely do not like it."

What is Resolution?Every year The Place welcomes over 70 UK artists to create original work for one of the most exciting and established London performance festivals. Artists learn from industry professionals through supportive and practical workshops, and present their work at The Place theatre to an audience of up to 300, including industry critics.Resolution exists to support and celebrate UK emerging artists and continues to attract choreographers and performance innovators of all different back grounds, styles and experiences; from contemporary, to Hip-hop, to Immersive dance theatre and circus, all with one thing in common - an idea.The festival runs over January and February 2018 and we will be performing on Saturday 13th of January.Episodic86...This new work is going to be a digital and visual representation of memory formation, focusing mainly on episodic memory. This type of memory is also described as autobiographical as it is the emotions felt during a certain event that will cause someone to remember it so vividly. Episodic memories are often recalled during a time of heightened emotion, for example, if you are feeling happy you may recall other times in your life when you have felt extreme happiness. I am going to try and emulate the performers own episodic memories through dance and live electronic music.Why are we asking for funding?As a choreographer it is of upmost importance to me that I can pay my dancers for their work. I successfully ran a Kickstarter campaign in the summer for my other company TobyLikesMilk where we successfully raised £2000 with all the proceeds going to our 11 company members. From doing this I have realised that as performers we should not become comfortable with not getting paid for our work. It will always be in my top priorities to provide my dancers with fair working conditions.","Creating new works is always a challenge but I have worked with these dancers previously and am confident in their ability to create movements that will ensure a successful piece of new work.There is always the risk of not selling enough tickets for the show but I am making sure that I am vocal on social media about our upcoming show as well as being sure to inform suitable people of the show,",https://www.kickstarter.com/projects/tobylikesmilk/the-alternative-dairy-selection?ref=discovery_category_newest,tobylikesmilk/the-alternative-dairy-selection,"We are curatinga unique show that explores the confines of our heteronormative society via a stylistic fusion of vogue, drag and contemporary dance companies. We will invite four emerging, London based dance companies to collaborate with us on this project who are either LGBTQ+ focused or create work that challenges the gender status quo. This work is aimed at increasing opportunity for those already engaged with the arts, especially those who do not adhere to or identify with binary gender constructs.We are fundraising for this show as we want to be able to pay the performers involved a fair wage for all their hard work and commitment throughout this project.This will take place at The Cockpit Theatre in London on the 24th and 25th of August at 9pm.As the LGBTQ+ community has played such a vital role in allowing everyone to embrace their identity we will be matching every £1 raised in our Kickstarter with 5p from our tickets sales to donate to Mermaidsuk a UK based LGBTQ+ charity - find out more about the charity here https://www.mermaidsuk.org.ukIf we reach our target that is £100 to donate and if we go over it will be even more!About us - -TobyLikesMILK is a London based dance company run by London Studio Centre alumnis, Katy Higgins and Phoenix Chase-Meares. We aim to create queer normative spaces by challenging status quo concepts of gender and identity. Past work by TobyLikesMILK:In 2017 produced and choreographed ‘Gone Off’ for The Cockpit Theatre in August for a 3 night run, making profits. Provided with funding by “Paradigm” to go to Groningen, Netherlands for an NYE performance at The Sugar Factory.Built a strong working relationship with The Cockpit and since 2018 have been running weekly company classes at The Cockpit Theatre - with proceeds from class payments going towards their next production.As well as their longtime collaboration through TobyLikesMILK, Phoenix and Katy have rich independent careers detailed below:Katy Higgins:Runs TOBY, a contemporary dance company, that debuted at Resolution'18 with ‘Episodic86’. Project consisted of a 5 day R&D, a 1 night showing at The Place theatre in Euston - making profits.‘Episodic86’ was performed at The Courtyard Theatre in Hereford as part of IDnight hosted by 2faceddance.‘Episodic86’ was shown at an open rehearsal with Kaleidoscopic arts in Hackney.Most recently Katy choreographed for the London Studio Centre Dance Overture in July 2018 with their first year students. Phoenix Chase-MearesIdentifies as LGBTQ+ and recently appeared on ‘Genderquake’ on channel 4, a reality show that highlighted the gender debate in Britain.Has worked extensively throughout London as a drag queen, hosting nights at Metropolis.Member of the company Poetic Disasters Club in Groningen, Netherlands which just finished it's nationwide tour of the Netherlands.Part of the Vogue company Haus of Decay, performing throughout Manchester and internationally as part of RuPaul’s Drag Race Tour.What we want to achieve - -Once complete, our project will be a unique fusion of vogue, drag and contemporary dance styles -- breaking stylistic boundaries in a new and exciting way.Our ultimate aim is to create an unbridled celebration of our differences and fluidity -- while simultaneously inviting discussion and reflection on the claustrophobic, often harmful binary of our heteronormative society and how that hurts everyone, not just those who identify as LGBTQ+.In the long term we want to achieve a far reaching movement, taking our show to areas outside of London to audiences who may be struggling to embrace/understand their own identity and who may not have access to a community that is representative of them.TobyLikesMILK has always strived to represent and welcome all identities and we believe that the anarchistic nature of gender fluidity discussions and performance styles/art forms can be adopted into the contemporary dance community in an effective and thought provoking way, whilst also creating a new genre of performance that could ultimately bring together generally separate audiences.We want this show to include multiple perspectives, so we have invitedthree  dance companies that explore similar issues to perform alongside us (1 contemporary, 1 drag and 1 vogue). The four companies are Haus of Anxiety, Faye Revlon & Hannah Milan and The Yonis.How project will help us to develop as a company - -With this work we are taking on the monumental, but fiercely exciting task of blending three boldly different but intrinsically linked dance styles -- vogue, drag and contemporary. This will be an intensive creative development and a huge learning experience that will develop our organisational skills in a myriad of ways.This project will help our professional development with new experiences in the form of project management as we take on a new approach to our creative practice by collaborating with 4 other dance companies to bring our core idea to fruition. Other areas strengthened by this project:Cultivate new audiences: Develop our professional network by introducing diverse audiences from the LGBTQ+ performance scene who don’t watch contemporary dance and vica versa. Build on existing relationships: Expand on our established working relationship with The Cockpit Theatre.Creating paid work for performers will establish ourselves as a company that cares about fairly representing performers.Build our artistic profile:As an emerging company, we will have the opportunity to share our work with audiences who may not have experienced LGBTQ+ art forms and contemporary dance together.Producing a show that will gain attraction due to its subject matter being heavily discussed in the current social climate.Build portfolio of work and create new working relationships:Adding a new show to our repertoire and working with new companies will develop our creative network.Who will participate with this project?All 30 participating performers make work challenging the status quo of our heteronormative society.They will all fit into at least one of the below categories:Aged 21-30LGBTQ+ identifying Emerging contemporary dancersBy creating a unique fusion of dance styles (vogue, drag and contemporary) we are aiming to bring together two generally separate audiences.Our target demographics are listed below, based on past performances at The Cockpit Theatre we aim to engage 240 audience members during the project’s run:Aged 16+Contemporary dance crowds from Sadlers Wells/The Place/Laban who have an interest in new and innovative work but haven’t experienced LGBTQ+ performance.Participants/audiences from the drag and vogue ballroom scenes around London and queer-arts audiences interested in works shown at Royal Vauxhall Tavern who appreciate the creativity involved in a performer’s individual character and the intention behind their idea of showcasing an alter ego/alternative identity.How people will engage with this project - -AUDIENCE: We want to bring together contemporary dance and drag/vogue audiences to experience a unique fusion of styles -- hopefully broadening their own creative horizons and encouraging them to seek out new and exciting work in the future. Every audience member who sees our work will leave feeling different, depending on their own place on the identity spectrum. We want all audience members to feel challenged, to reassess their own paradigms, labels and biases.PERFORMERS: We have invited four other dance companies that explore similar issues to perform alongside us. By combining LGBTQ+ and contemporary dance we have created a concept that our participants can really get their teeth into, providing a ‘meaty’ creative process for them to engage with. All performers will be provided with fair pay for their work and an opportunity to create new and lasting working relationships with other companies.",As with all projects like this there are risks involved but we believe we have a good team behind us who will help us to avoid any downfalls.We have agreed everything with the venue and the hire fee has been paid. All performers have agreed to take part and are already working on the pieces for the final shows.We are confident that we will be able to sell a good amount of tickets as we have a strong social media campaign that we are running everyday. We also produced a show at the same venue last year and made a substantial profit from the tickets sales.

That's why I came up with the idea to develop the Grape-Express Mini. I wanted to have a board with a sleek design and a lot of power. It should be independent and equipped with the latest technology on the market.The board has to be user-friendly so beginners can easily start a project.So you can use also Arduino IDE to program the Grape-Express Mini.The Grape Express mini is a powerful ultimate developer and prototyping board. It can be used for any application. On the board is a powerful ATMEGA2560 at 16MHz. This can be programmed via JTAG, ISP or via the micro USB with the help of a PC. The simple design makes it possible to complete a project as quickly as possible. In addition to the processor, the Grape-Express Mini offers many more features. So all sorts of I/Os are available from the processor on the headers. With the help of the RN171, a connection can be established with the Internet for example data can be inserted into the Internet into a table and many more cool things that the module offers. There is also an external connection for the antenna for a lot more power. On the Board is a RN4871 Bluetooth 4.2 Module (BLE). With this module, smart devices or smartphones can communicate with each other and you can do smart home accessoires. These two modules can be controlled externally as well as with the microcontroller. To display texts, graphics and numbers, there is an integrated 1.3"" OLED display. With the connector system it is possible to connect things like sensors or additional modules on both sides. Cables always get in the way, that's why the board has a lithium-ion battery with power up to six hours. This is automatically charged if an external power supply is connected and automatically switches to the battery when it is removed. This process works without interruption in the program. All these features are there for a project or prototype to finish as soon as possible. And these are not all features where the board offers.Software is very important. The most important, for a microcontroller project, is the software that brings the hardware to life. In order for the Grape-Express Mini to be ready for your project without too much code, software modules are made. With these software modules you can customize your project individually. Adjust parameters and other things to match your project. The software is optimized for the board, so this board is special too. It is also possible to create a project with the Arduino studio.The Grape-Express Mini is perfect for developing prototypes or projects. The board has a lot of features that make it easier to develop. So the board is a combination of different main elements and not a board where all basic components have to be put together first. In addition, the board is independent of a power source, so for example, while traveling the board can be programmed without a cabling effort. The project that you create can range from something as simple as atimer to blink an LED to something as complex as a mini computer with a user interface.This is an example of a small project withe two CO2 sensors to compare, a LED matrix and a simple counter that shows on the small LEDs.This is a project created in 5 minutes. By simply plugging in additional electronics, a small software can be created within minutes, making the module an element of the Grape-Express Mini. With this example I would like to show you how simple the Grape-Express Mini Board is and how fast you get to a result.Grape-express Mini offers a selection of communication tools such as WiFi and Bluetooth. These modules have been specially selected as their properties lead to an effective work. Both modules can receive updates from manufacturers. Both can be programmed with ASCII commands and presets. So no big program code has to be written. The modules have standards that do not even exist with certain modules. So these are perfect for working with the microcontroller. For this board, the modules RN171 for WiFi and the RN4871 for Bluetooth were used. The WiFi module has status LEDs with which it indicates in which mode it works and if the modules are connected.WiFiMost important features:Bluetooth 4.2 (BLE)Most important features:The Grape-Express Mini has a lithium-ion battery.

That is me, six years ago when I was 17 years old. Do you see that boy beside me? His name was Bryan, he was my best friend. WAS being the keyword, I loved him, but he could only see his own pain. I lost Bryan two months after this photo was taken, and this book explores the ways that suicide and depression affects everyone involved.I am raising funds to traditionally publish my first novel, Falling Star. Query letters and good writing just isn't enough in a world where publishing companies rarely take risks on young and emerging new authors with no platform or background. They need solid evidence that your book will sell, which I will have when I raise the funds needed.I plan on using the funds raised to promote my novel, and to create a platform and fan base for Falling Star. I will use the funds to hire an artist to create the cover for my book (convert it to eBook format, as well as paperback), hire promotional agencies that will help to circulate the book to a larger audience, and to market the final product.This heartfelt novel is a way for me to bring awareness to depression and suicide in teenagers, as well asgiving the main character, Ella, chances and choices that I never had...This fictional novel is based upon true events, events that shaped the person I am today and changed my life.Falling Star is about a teenage girl, named Ella. She is from a small town where nothing new ever happens, and things rarely change. Her little world revolves around her best friend, Byron. He is the star of the school, until his path begins to darken. He begins distancing himself from Ella, while she tries to ignore his changing personality. Soon, Ella discovers that Byron has become depressed, but is it too late to save him? Or herself?Please feel free to like my page for Falling Star on Facebook so that I can continue to grow my fan base.Facebook.com/FallingStar2015.Sometimes, life can be hard. That seems to be the general consensus anyways. Life is not always picking flowers, carefree worries, and sappy love stories. Life is sometimes hard; it can be tragic; and it can be confusing. But, through all that, isn't it worth it? This crazy thing called life?I suppose I should start this off, by telling you that my name is Ella Cane. The majority of my friends call me El, or Ellie. That seems to be the norm nowadays, shortening names that are already rather short. It seems a bit silly to me, but I don't really mind. I suppose I tried to get them to stop, they wouldn't anyway. It just seems to slip from their tongues.Lets see, I am, I guess, what is considered a ""normal"" teenager. I have that shaggy brown hair that looks similar to mud, but my mother is always trying to tell me that ""is as golden as the sun.""  I decided to cut it all off last year. I think it broke her heart a little bit- I did feel quite badly for that. I am 18 years old now though, she should understand that I need to do things for me. It is my senior year of high school, who hasn't done something a bit crazy?  But I digress; I also have mud brown eyes (still normally referred to as ""golden"") that matches my hair. I am average height, and average build. I play sports, and I get good grades. I am friends with most everyone, and I do what is expected of me most of the time. I know you must be thinking how average I seem and you are right. In the craziness that is the world today I am pretty average. But, here in this little town where I live, I am an original; a one of a kind.Everyone knows my name, my family, my history. This little farm town in nowhere Michigan is the only place that I have ever known, the place I call home. Nothing new happens, and life goes on just fine. I can't wait to get out of this place as soon as I graduate. I am not sure where to yet. But as many things that I love about this town, I can't stay here.How else should I start this, oh, perhaps the most important thing about my story, is, that it is not about me at all. I mean, I am aware that I am quite an intriguing individual, but no, this story is about my best friend. His name is Byron Rood. He is the boy that my life revolves around. In this little town, he gives me hope, and he makes me believe that anything is possible.Byron is the boy that was never meant to be here in the first place, he is like an oddity put here by mistake.  In a place full of normality, he radiates eccentricity. Take his looks for example. His hair is the black that shines so bright it seems almost blue.  He grows it long, and every girl gazes in his direction as he walks past.  His eyes are the darkest brown you've ever seen.  Their hint of sparkle like pieces of Smoky Quartz.  He is beautiful, almost ethereal.Now, you may thinking, he must be conceited, a beauty like this. But, that is another thing about him- he is humble and kind. He is that person who excels at everything he ever attempts. The kind of person most people can't help but like, as much as they want to hate him. For example, I have been competing with him for valedictorian since we hit freshman year. He seems to have a much easier time achieving A's than I do; a natural intelligence It infuriates me! But how can you hate someone who will stop at the drop of a hat to help you out, no questions asked, just because that same someone kicked your ass on the last Calculus test?Yes, this is a story about a boy who was dumped on this earth, full of the life in a way that some of us never find.

He is that person who excels at everything he ever attempts. The kind of person most people can't help but like, as much as they want to hate him. For example, I have been competing with him for valedictorian since we hit freshman year. He seems to have a much easier time achieving A's than I do; a natural intelligence It infuriates me! But how can you hate someone who will stop at the drop of a hat to help you out, no questions asked, just because that same someone kicked your ass on the last Calculus test?Yes, this is a story about a boy who was dumped on this earth, full of the life in a way that some of us never find. ""Just another story about a boy?"" you might ask. But this is not just a story about any boy. This tale is of my boy.Want to read the rest of chapter one? Check out my blog listed below!

https://www.kickstarter.com/projects/1295842701/extremely-accurate-nixie-tube-clock?ref=discovery_category_newest,1295842701/extremely-accurate-nixie-tube-clock,"The goal of this project is to revive nearly extincttechnology of Nixie Tubes dating from50-ties all the way to early90-ties. Despite being called ""cold"" discharge tubes Nixies cast amagical warm glow that is very different from 7-segment LED displays ubiquitousin our day and age. It is much easier (and cheaper)to build LED display,hence the new technology hasprevailed. Then why bother, one could ask.Few reasons: It is truly an educational experience to get involved in projectlike this. It is also a challenge that requires knowledge, engineeringskills, perseverance- I'm up to it. It is a venue allowing me to expressmyself artistically, as each of my design is unique (even when inspired byothers). Finally it is a lot of fun, and the task gives me a thrill of tryingsomething new and unproven, a design with some risk of ""unchartedterritory"".I have been making clocks for as long as I remember, LEDclocks, dot matrix, propeller clocks, small clocks, large clocks, car clocks,desk and wall clocks, what have you, but also Nixie Clocks – well over 10 yearsby now. I have made my 1st Nixie Clock based on Mike’s ElectricStuff (you can google that great website). As I was building these clocks, I learnedhow they can be improved, so I started implementing my improvements. Mike’sNixie Clock was great, but wasn’t very accurate as it relied upon the mainsfrequency of 60Hz. Also, it was not too safe, since it used just a “voltagedoubler” (no galvanic isolation from mains). I started using a crystal toderive a time tick, but then I learned that RTC (real time clock) integratedcircuits do even better job. I used DS1302 and DS1307. DS1687 from Maxim Integrated(former Dallas) sports encapsulated crystal that is properly loaded, 10-yrbattery backup, and algorithms calculating leap year, and more. The IC that mycurrent design uses is best in my opinion a state of art DS3231 ExtremelyAccurate RTC from Maxim yielding at room temperature accuracy of ±2ppm (parts per million) -so much about the time engine.Power Supply for running Nixie Tubes has to bring the Rail Voltageto about 230VDC. I power my clock unit from 12V wall wart. The Nixies railvoltage is converted by a step-up DC-DC switching regulator of my own design. Ihave made a variety of DC-DC converters using pot core transformers that Iwound myself. They were driven by NE555 at 100 kHz. Those were further improvedby monitoring HV (high voltage) feedback and adjusting the PWM (pulse widthmodulation) by microcontroller. Best solution yet that I have adopted - astep-up IC designed to bring voltage typically to 12V. I used MAX1771CPA with anexternal N-Mosfet and Schottky Diode (both rated for high voltage). Thissolution is isolated from mains, so it is much safer. I tested my DC-DCConverter even with Dekatron Tubes that require much higher voltage (450 VDC).One of the most important aspects of the way of driving NixieTubes is how it affects their longevity. Yes, these tubes are burning out overtime. Can something be done to extend their lifetime beyond several thousandhours? Well, yes, but it is not a straight forward process. Nixie Tube operationdoesn’t depend on thermionic emission despite looking like vacuum tube. Thestriking voltage has to be high enough for the Nixie to ignite the colddischarge glow. And although Nixie Tube exhibits “negative resistance” (glowremains at anode working voltage 10V to 20V below ignition voltage), dimmingNixies by lowering the Rail Voltage proves to be inadequate due to relativelynarrow range of regulation. Typical working voltage of IN-8-2 is in the rangeof 170V. Alternatively, chopping Nixie’s current (continuously ON/OFF)allows the tube to be glowing with average intensity as low as 5% of itsnominal intensity (at 100% of current). Persistence of vision causes naked eyeto ignore fast intensity changes (fusion flicker rate threshold above 16Hz). Ina nutshell: it is acceptable for human eye and it is very beneficial for NixieTube to be switched on and off with certain frequency. This phenomenon allows tomultiplex tubes (MUX i.e. sequentially switch on one tube at a time). Insteadof running all of the 6 tubes all the time some tubes can be on while theothers wait for their turn. At first I havereasoned that grouping 6 tubes in 3 sections of 2 tubes will result in 50% of theiraverage intensity loss. Surprisingly, the 3x2 tubes clock appeared as bright as6 tubes running at 100%. This propelled me to building 2 sections of 3 tubes MUX-ed– still without significant loss of illumination. Finally I have built 6x1 tubeMUX-ed clock, where each one Nixie is be turned on 1/6 of the total time. Thisis only 1/6th of the transistors used in my 1st clock,and the clock works great – see the introductory video. Human perception oflight, sound, etc. is really measured in logarithmic scale (one has to increaseradio volume 10-fold for us to feel as if it’s twice as loud! -same with light).Actually, the ON time for the single Nixie during its 1/6thtime slot can be much shorter and it depends upon the ambient light level. Yes,I have LDR (light dependent resistor) onboard and microcontroller measures theambient light level. I use so called “rolling average” (calculate average lightlevel of last 10 seconds) to avoid sudden intensity regulations. If the lightlevel is low (room is dark), then each Nixie is barely pulsed, just enough to maintainits faint glow at night. It not only extends greatly your valuable Nixie Tubes,but has added benefit of reducing the glare projected by the clock.Lastly – the clock enclosure. On one hand I wanted toencapsulate the clock and protect the fragile glass Nixies. On the other hand Iwanted to display same Nixies like a precious trophy along with modern,efficient electronic design). Hence see-through enclosure made out of ¼-inchthick, cast acrylic tube (not the cheapest stuff, but well worth it consideringunmatched optical clarity).Please, help me execute this project. Provided it is fully funded,we all can enjoy a timeless piece of nearly forgotten technology. I have chosenthe Russian IN-8-2 tubes for their viability and reasonable price (around $15 apiece + shipment from Russia, Moldovia, Ukraine, wherever I can find them).Some 15 years ago I have acquired 4 pc of German Z568M – needless to say thoseNixies are extinct, and the price of single tube exceeds $500! There are someIN-18 in my collection, but these 40mm-digit are also cost prohibitive for mostcollectors (around $65/pc). I would like to make perhaps 30 clocks for loversof Nixies around the world. Assembly kits can be made available, however TQFP, SOIC, SOD, SMA,etc. are quite small footprint components. One has to have necessary equipmentand skills to solder surface mount small parts. Also, due to very close proximityof all traces and rather high density of 2-layer FR4 board, there has to besome conformal coating done to ensure proper clock operation (sealing off the moisture).Voltage as high as 250V is dangerous, so only knowledgeable and cautious do-it-yourselfersare encouraged to undertake the stuffing/assembly process.","The supply of IN-8-2 is limited. No one really knows how many are out there. I will leave no stone unturned in pursuit of as many sets as we will need to fulfill the project. The prototype on the photograph is a little bit tight inside. I plan to purchase a tad bit larger diameter cast acrylic tube i.e 3.25-inch OD (outside diameter) rather than 3.00-inch OD to better accommodate the Nixies. Some of the tubes are a taller than other, so it is not exact science, but my enclosure ought to fit all of them.Right now the acrylic sides are just fitted on onto the tube. I will have to come up with some idea how to secure the sides. I could glue it together, but I think it would be nice to be able to take clock apart if need be. Perhaps small 4-40 screws (a couple at each end)? I’ll think of something.Small detail like transparent rubber bumpons (feet) to protect your desk surface…Another detail – adjustments of time; for the time being I have tactile switches as well as the reed switches. I think reed switch actuated by a small magnet would be best (no contact with electrical parts, so superb safety)…",https://www.kickstarter.com/projects/1295842701/extremely-accurate-dimmable-nixie-clock?ref=discovery_category_newest,1295842701/extremely-accurate-dimmable-nixie-clock,"This is a re-launch of my previously posted project “ExtremelyAccurate Dimmable Nixie Tube Clock”. Obviously, I have overestimated the demand/popularityof the project (whether the goal set too high, lack of wide campaigning, or costof parts – probably a little bit of everything). Anyway, I want to thank againall people who backed the project and try to restart. This time around it oughtto fare better, as I plan to make,realistically, only few clocks.Changes/Improvements over the previous design:The Nixie Tubes will be pluggable to pin sockets on main board; IN-8 not IN-8-2 will be used in this clockSince the Nixies are to be pluggable, I can assembly and test the wholeclock PCB, and then remove the Nixie Tubes. Ready-made clock will be offer asan option – just functional, fully debugged PCB +wall wart PSFor those who prefer to obtain their own Nixie Tubes, I will make 2 colonlamps (pluggable) as an option, too.ThePM neon indicator lamp will be added for optional 12-hr modeThe 3V lithium backup battery won’t be soldered like it used to be, butinstead it will be in the battery holder for easy replacementI am changing the 12V 500mA wall wart transformer with a 12VDC switchingpower supply. Transformer based PS gives around 18VDC when unloaded. Switcheris more efficient and draws much less quiescent current.The initial 9V regulator then is no longer needed as HV boost DC-DC will befed with stabile 12V from switcher. I will add a protective diode to preventwrong polarity Power Supply plug-ins. The switching dc-dc 5V regulator can be replaced with LDO (low drop out)regulator. As I tested it the whole clock consumes less than 1.5W of energySince the enclosure glass tube diameter is increased now to 3.25”OD the PCBinside can be a bit wider. With the sockets for Nixies at 0.1” raster - thespacing between the traces can be increased. All vias will be covered now, soperhaps no conformal coating needed (will check that before the release)Due to low demand I will no longer offer a shorter 4-tube version (also no4-tube PCB).

On this, the 200th anniversary of its publication, the narrative is more relevant than ever. We live in an age where we need to ask critical questions about the limits of science. How do scientific pursuits relate to the body? Attention to issues of disability leads us to consider how identity relates to the body, and how the body can shift and change over time. Shelley's bodily assemblage - a collective of parts given life - still shapes our ideas about ourselves, and about what we create to be our monsters. This anthology will gather together tales inspired by Shelley's strange alchemy, lightning strikes of inspiration from Frankenstein.We Shall Be Monsters: Mary Shelley’s Frankenstein Two Centuries On will feature a broad range of fiction stories, from direct interactions with Shelley's texts to explorations of the stitched, assembled body and narrative experiments in monstrous creations. We Shall Be Monsters is a fiction collection that will feature explorations of disability through Frankenstein, queer and trans identity, ideas of race and colonialism. Shelley’s story provides a space for exploring a multitude of identities through the figure of the sympathetic outsider. Frankenstein’s “monster” is a figure of Otherness, and one that can tell stories of exclusion and social oppression.Although this anthology will feature some established authors, we also hope to add a good mix of emerging and underrepresented voices to the anthology. For that purpose, we are running a call for submissions to which you can participate right here:https://weshallbemonsters.wordpress.comAbout the EditorsDerek Newman-Stille is a 7-time winner of the Prix Aurora Award, the highest award in Canadian Science Fiction and Fantasy.

This story helped to shape the genres of science fiction and horror and helped to articulate new forms for women’s writing. It also helped us to think about the figure of the outsider, to question medical power, to question ideas of normal, and to think about what we mean by the word “monster”. Her book inspired adaptations into stage, into film, into new books, poetry, television, and all manner of art. I’m 7 time Aurora Award-winning editor and critic Derek Newman-Stille and I have teamed up with Gatineau-based publisher Renaissance Press to celebrate Frankenstein’s 200th birthday by creating a book that explores Frankenstein stories from new and exciting angles and perspectives. We have gathered authors from around the world who have new takes on an old monster and brought them together into an anthology of exciting fiction.We Shall Be Monsters: Mary Shelley’s Frankenstein Two Centuries On will feature a broad range of fiction stories, from direct interactions with Shelley's texts to explorations of the stitched, assembled body and narrative experiments in monstrous creations. We Shall Be Monsters is a fiction collection that will feature explorations of disability through Frankenstein, queer and trans identity, ideas of race and colonialism. Shelley’s story provides a space for exploring a multitude of identities through the figure of the sympathetic outsider. Frankenstein’s “monster” is a figure of Otherness, and one that can tell stories of exclusion and social oppression.Your contribution to our campaign will help usAbout the Editor Derek Newman-Stille is a 7-time winner of the Prix Aurora Award, the highest award in Canadian Science Fiction and Fantasy. He is currently also editing Over the Rainbow: Folk and Fairy Tales from the Margins (Exile, 2018), and has written for publications like Quill & Quire, Accessing the Future and The Playground of Lost Toys. He has published academic works in works like The Canadian Fantastic in Focus, Mosaic: A Journal for the Interdisciplinary Study of Literature, and Misfit Children: An Inquiry into Childhood Belongings.

Something like that. I'm shooting initially for six pages.Again, thank you all for your support! Thank you all for backing and sharing this project!  We're not halfway funded yet, but anything can happen in seven days, right?Thanks to a group of local backers I can hand-deliver their rewards to, If this book gets it's $3500 funding goal, I'm going to include one of the stretch goals right away.Whichever gets the most votes by January 11th will be included as part of the initial funding goal while the remaining two will remain as stretch goals in the first two landmarks. Backers can vote by commenting on the update, potentials can send me a message.You guys have a great week!  Thank you!Highly Experimental (or HiEx in short) is a character-driven sci-fi webcomic about a group of weirdos spending their daily lives at a small academy. You can read the comic right now at www.highlyexperimental.net! It's beginning its fifth chapter right now and the comic usually updates once a weekend. uuuuuuusualllyyyyyyy.The purpose of this kickstarter is to make some of these comic pages into a nice, tangible graphic novel and make some character keychains so I can sell at conventions and set up an online shop (i love acrylic keychains, you have no idea).Canadian backers need to add in $15 for shipping and other international backers need to add in $20. I don't want to cut corners with shipping and will use flat-rate mailers with tracking to make sure you get your items. Thanks for understanding!The book itself will contain the prologue and first three chapters where Geno meets two newcomers for the first time: Terrie, who he befriends very quickly, and Mary, who seems obsessed with him for what he is more than who.  Also included in the book will be the 4-page Otakon 2013 exclusive Mopbot Riley and Audrie comic, and a newly-made Geno and Terrie comic that will only be seen in the publication.The book as it stands is at 95% ready for print (wrapping up the bonus story right now and have to correct spelling errors) and will be an A5-sized graphic novel with 120 high resolution pages. It will undergo full-color printing to preserve the blue/grey monochrome and the occasional colored panels. The acrylic charms that will be included on some tiers are also on templates ready to be ordered upon receiving the funds.I've chosen PrintNinja for printing the books. I've seen what they did for Tripping Over You #2 when I received their book and it was amazing!Eugene (Geno) Genova, silent by choice, has lived in a middle-of-nowhere mansion turned resarch institution for the entire nineteen years of his life. What started off as a usual faculty drinking night before the school year starts (in which he had to tag along but was only allowed to drink water) turned into an awkward meetup with a new student, a short woman named Terrie Daiquiri, who tries to make friendly gestures with him and it goes kind of wrong.As their paths keep crossing, they soon become friends, but then Terrie realizes that her reclusive new friend is the center of attention a lot of reasons BEYOND being the child made by science.Other notable characters include Mary, the other newcomer and probably the only one fascinated by the scientific technicalities of Geno, Gary, the eccentric socialite with three identically arrogant siblings, Audrie, the resident herbologist and Terrie's mentor, and Riley... the grumpy janitor just trying to do his job.The concepts of this project began in 2004. I had several ideas for the story over the years, but mostly I just had fun creating characters, giving them personalities, seeing how they'd interact and dressing them up.  Eventually, some solid ideas were assembled into a webcomic idea that launched in 2011. You could say the title of this project has also been a fitting description of it.As someone who was heavy into fanart for the many years I've had an online presence, working on this original project has been a fun and amazing experience, and to start publishing this will make the experience even cooler!The book itself, as described earlier.A bonus 4x6"" print will be added to all book orders as an added thank you.And then we have:Sketched Bookplates. Many physical tiers will have this.Acrylic Keychain charms! When I go to anime conventions, I love collecting acrylic charms of my favorite characters (sometimes it's hard to come by for SOME characters), so I really look forward to getting these made and shared with backers. I have stretch goals that add more characters to the set!Because Terrie should be kept short in comparison to other characters, her charm is 1.5 inches instead of 2.And we have artwork. I love drawing characters with markers! Take a look at my artwork on Tumblr to get an idea of what my drawings are like outside of comic panels. I'll up the limit if there's high demand for it, but this may delay shipping.We also have two all-digital tiers for the digi-savvy backer that still wants to help fund the book printing in a freaky ironic but awesome way! The higher one will include the PDF, a digital version of the original drawing, and bookplate sketch and signature in a separate PNG file.","I’ve planned this kickstarter for a long time, but I know not every plan is fool proof.  All physical reward tiers should be able to fit in a flat-rate mailer (or internationally similar) for each backer and I’ve accounted the price of getting the books and charms made, prints, and estimated fees and shipping (supplies and postage).   The shipment to backers is set to June because while I anticipate the items to arrive before may, I will be preparing for my appearance at Puerto Rico Comic Con later that May and will need to prepare for that.  Full-color artwork-tiered backers will estimately get their rewards shipped between late july and early august.The total number of bookplate sketches and original art pieces I wind up doing is probably the most deciding factor of how soon or late fulfillment is completed even with my assistants helping to prepare shipments.If anything happens that delays fulfillment, I promise to stay in contact with you guys via updates and twitter as often as I possibly can, and you are more than welcome to message me.",https://www.kickstarter.com/projects/cammiluna/highly-experimental-why-are-we-even-here?ref=discovery_category_newest,cammiluna/highly-experimental-why-are-we-even-here,"We still have a couple of days left to go, but thank you for helping fund this project!

If you've pledged $30 or more for a printed book, you'll get one- along with the Pluto Cam pin!You can choose the charater you'd like- both for the keychain and the bookplate sketch in the surveys that will be handed out when I can get started on fulfilling rewards, and you'll be able to update your address information if it changes closer to the ship date, or change your choices of convention prints as I complete more of them for PR Comic Con.Highly Experimental (or HiEx in short)  is a character-driven sci-fi webcomic about a group of weirdos spending their daily lives at a small academy while getting pulled into mysteries about one boy's very existence.

Our mission here at AKA Snacks is to create boldly flavored, healthy snacks that deliver people the nutrients their bodies crave. We like to snack and believe we shouldn't have to sacrifice nutrition and taste to do so! NO PRESERVATIVES, OILS, OR ROASTING!I have found a commercial kitchen and will soon be able to sell to the whole country! I need help from my supporters to make this possible. I will be using the money to fund the NSF approved dehydrators that the health department requires, as well as to cover permit costs, rent, and raw materials. I will also purchase packaging, which will be made from 100% compostable materials. This money will also help to open up a position at AKA Snacks and create a part time job for anyone interested. Essentially, I want to use this money to make my snacks available to people all across the nation. Healthy snacks should be accessible and affordable for all!My dehydration process allows my company to create long lasting, shelf-stable, healthy snacks without using any preservatives, oils or roasting! I want to expand my snack line past almonds, and create a line of healthy, preservative free, shelve-stable snacks.I love to snack. I have always been a huge snacker!

It involves placing number pieces into a grid using various clues.Soup is a food that is mostly liquid and usually comes in a bowl or a cup. If made properly, it is delicious.  What?  I want to make a book called Number Soup and Other Recipes. If it comes to fruition, the book will be a hybrid puzzle book and cookbook featuring more than 50 new Number Soup puzzles not posted on The Griddle, full answer keys, and several recipes for soup, stew, and/or chili. I may also throw random cooking and soup-making ideas and tips throughout the book between puzzles.The target is at least 100 pages, but this number could go up depending on the amount of contributions received.Contributors to this project will get the book first, but I will most likely make it available for purchase after the project is complete.  How?  The book will most likely be published using a self-publishing service, using black ink only and at U.S. Trade size. I'm not entirely certain if it will be Perfect Bound (cheaper) or Spiral Bound (nicer for puzzle books) and I'm open to hearing feedback from contributors on which is preferred.  Why?  I love making puzzles, and I give away a ton of one-off puzzle sheets on The Griddle. This book project will give me the chance to provide a good chunk of puzzles all of the same type and in a nice tangible form. The recipe component will allow me to pursue my other passion a little bit - making tasty food (soup).  Funds  Funds from the project will mostly go toward the print edition of the book. The cost of the rewards that include print edition of the book will cover the printing/binding and shipping costs. Additional funds will go various aspects of the book-making process: Additional leftover funds will help me with living expenses while working on the book and making more puzzles to give out for free later.  Sound like fun?  I hope so, and I hope you're interested enough to support this book project!",,https://www.kickstarter.com/projects/davmillar/paranormal-puzzle-pack-book?ref=discovery_category_newest,davmillar/paranormal-puzzle-pack-book,"I've always loved puzzles ever since I was a kid. I started out making puzzles myself when I was a wee lad, doodling mazes on the backs of Michigan lottery betting forms in the back room of the 7-Eleven where my mother worked. Around the end of high school, inspired and cheered on by my computer programming teacher, I took it to a new level and started blogging my logic story problems and numerical logic puzzles at http://thegriddle.net and share them with the world. Now I want to take my puzzle work a step further.Some popular puzzle types I've posted to my blog include fence-building mashup ""Area 51"" and character-deducing ""Haunted Mirror Mazes"". I want to combine my love of all things weird and paranormal with my love of puzzles and make a book featuring these two types as well as other paranormal-themed puzzles.Stats: I'd like to do a 5.5x8.5 inch book that's about 100 pages in length, with a few tutorials to jumpstart newbies, a whole mess of puzzles, and a few pages of answer keys at the end. I think wire binding would be a nice touch too, since as a puzzle fan myself, I also know the horrors of trying to crush a puzzle book's spine into submission for easier access.Costs: The minimum run for this project is 500 books, and comes in at about $1500 to produce and ship to me. From that point, there are some added costs related to shipping the books and other rewards to all of the backers. I've tried to keep the prices easy to handle since the economy isn't great, but every little bit does help. The book will be available to backers at the $5 as a PDF, so you can help fund the print edition and try the puzzles, even on a tight budget.Donating Books: Some of my friends through the math and puzzle community work with younger students. If you pledge at a high enough level to get 2+ books but don't want the extra copy for yourself, let me know and I'll find them a good home.Why? It's partially an ego thing - I love seeing my puzzles in print! But I also want to do this project for a combination of other reasons. It's some mish-mosh of living the American dream, getting something besides sudoku out to a wider audience, and realizing my own potential as a creative person... not to mention the extra income from selling the leftover copies from the first print run will help me buy more puzzle creation supplies like grid paper and pens.The Puzzles: You can check out previously posted puzzles of the types I plan to include at The Griddle by following these links:$2250: At this amount, I should be able to purchase an ISBN number to include on the book. It adds a sense of legitimacy to it and enables it to have a wider reach.$3750: At this amount, I may be able to make a larger edition of the book on glorious 8.5x11 inch paper, effectively doubling the room for content.",

With this exclusive Kickstarter launch we are making a limited number of retail packs available to the public.The goal of MaryJane Cards is to help educate and inform the public on safe and alternative medication options. The artist, Rhonda Chase, has been helped by the benefits of medicinal cannabis for nearly ten years. She is an Iraqi war veteran and suffers from what many of our combat veterans deal with every day.  Considering the possible ending of cannabis prohibition within our generation what better time than now to educate people on the beauty and benefits of cannabis in a fun and collectable way. Each pack in this edition will have the same ten cards in it. We want everyone to have the same opportunity at the information. Should this edition be successful we hope to create more cards containing new and exciting strains. With so many strains in existence it's hard to know exactly how each variety may effect an individual. We hope to make that decision a little less difficult.The backs of the cards will feature a close up of the front image, accentuating all the delicious crystals and hairs. We will include information about the strain to include the flavor, breeder, medicinal benefits and more. The cards will be laid out in the style of Rhonda Chase's Creature Trading Cards.

Using her painting ""Omnicia"" from the Creature card creation project 2012, Rhonda has been working with a toy company to make this creature come to life. The toy company Shenzhen SRX technology Co., Ltd was used by SUPER! Comics to make their ""Blitz"" toy and soon upcoming ""Fire Ant"" toy. Shenzhen SRX tech also brought you other such fabulous toys like Kid Robot Munny's. The toy company is a professional manufacturer for any kind of Roto-casting vinyl toy and Injection plastic toys based on OEM & ODM business model standards. Basically they use a complex series of process to create kid safe vinyl toys. Since the shape of Omnicia was complex the injection molding method was the most likely to handle the form. Master sculptors used the Creature Card painting to create a three dimensional version of Rhonda's creation. The translation produced a lovely result. At each stage there is an expense. As you can see Rhonda has already funded much of this toy creation herself. It is now time to create a first edition. Since Chase's Creatures has been quietly working on a few different projects (including the next arrival, a coloring book?!) she wanted to share her creation with fans first at the lowest possible prices and offer some special rewards to help pay for the first production run.PLEASE NOTE THIS KICKSTARTER FEATURES only BLANK WHITE BIRDS.(Unless you choose the pledge to receive a toy painted by the artist Rhonda Chase.)Omnicia the toy is about 3 x 4 x 5 inches.These first blank customizable toys will be individually wrapped in plastic bags.

Our goal is to ensure that the experience of the festival is powerful, and meaningful for participating students who submit films for consideration, and for those who come to the screening to celebrate the work.For its 21 year existence, the Northwest High School Film Festival has been made possible by the financial contributions of college programs, industry vendors, and grants as the prestige and costs of the growing festival have increased.Now it's time to add to that mix with donations from the families and supporters of the students themselves who benefit most from the experience of the festival, as they consider media as a viable field for post-high-school study, and career paths.Here is what your money will directly go towards:Procurement of Professional Industry Judges: $1350Trophies: $650Join us in helping to support the success of this year's festival by donating today! Consider donating at the Production Assistant ($25), Director ($50), Producer ($100), or Executive Producer ($150) level. There are many excellent incentives for donating at each level.No matter what level you are donating at, you can be assured that there are hundreds of aspiring filmmakers from the Puget Sound region who will benefit directly from, and will appreciate your support.Thank you for your generous contribution!","Risks and challengesIf we don't achieve our goal, this could be the last year we are able to organize this festival."

It's easy enough for an 8 year old to use, and versatile enough for prototyping many of the technology projects that you see here on Kickstarter.For the latest information, please visit us at:The support from SocketCircuits' fans has been absolutely inspirational, and SocketCircuits will definitely be relaunching and moving forward to production! The new campaign will be focused on in-house manufacturing. This lowers the funding goal significantly by eliminating the excessive costs of outsourced mold design and minimum production orders. It also means that future design improvements, as well as new sockets, can go from prototype to production in a matter of days! How is this possible?The parts will be manufactured using a plastic injection molding machine that I've been designing from scratch. The first prototype machine has already produced a working injection molded socket (circled in green) using a proof-of-concept socket mold (circled in blue).The difference in clarity, compared to the CNC machined socket, is due to trapped bubbles. Bubbles are caused by an insufficient injection pressure. I'm in the process of retrofitting the injector with electric powered hydraulics that are capable of 10 to 15 tons of injection pressure, and I'll be machining a metal version of the mold as well. The final machine will be completely automated and scalable to meet future production demand. Please bookmark www.socketcircuits.com and check us out after the campaign ends! We'll be launching a new campaign shortly after this one, and I'll post a link for the new campaign on the socketcircuits website. Again, thank you all for your support! -Cory RussekSocketCircuits is for Makers, STEM Educators, kids, artists, professional engineers and anyone with an idea and a desire to invent their own electronic device.I’ve collaborated with world renowned papercraft artist and engineer Rob Ives (www.robives.com) to bring you:“BarriBot” – A papercraft animated robot, with a unique LED-lit barrier grid animation.There is a simple coin-cell battery and LED circuit under BarriBot’s head. Under the body is a changeable animation image. The grid allows you to cycle through four distinct images and there is an opensource program available for creating your own barrier grid animations for BarriBot.Kit's like BarriBot are just the beginning. Development is continuing for ""SocketBot"", a papercraft programmable and swarm capable robot. A proof-of-concept magnetic coupling was developed to allow low-cost motors to directly drive paper wheels:The next step is frame design and double layered wheels to hold the weight of the robot. The final motor socket will also incorporate optical sensors for precise servo-motor movement. Stay tuned as this exciting real-world product is developed using SocketCircuits. We never have to cut a potentially awesome circuit or kit based on projected sales, because all kits are in digital form as downloadable diagrams. They all share the same basic sockets too, which lowers manufacturing costs.One of the exciting features of SocketCircuits' kits is that they can go in 3 dimensions, like this folded papercraft clock tower: We don't use any custom modules, connectors, wires, or parts. No soldering, expensive inks, or glues are required. SocketCircuits' sockets are compatible with millions of low-cost commonly available components, including components with unique pin layouts like potentiometers, motors, and switches that won't fit into breadboards. This means that nearly any circuit can be built with them! Note to Engineers: It's truly liberating to be able to build circuits with the layout that you want, instead of losing time translating your circuits to breadboards. Plus, full-sized POTs that don't fall out! You can finally focus on the circuit, instead of breaking concentration with complicated directions. The puzzle-like construction makes even this college level circuit possible for kids 8 and up.Take the challenge! On the left is a SocketCircuits strobe light circuit. On the right is the same circuit on a traditional breadboard. Chose any part or pin and see how long it takes to figure out what it is connected to in each image.SocketCircuits are assembled on a diagram, so the layout is intuitive, unlike with breadboards. This makes it easier to see the role of each part in the circuit, how the electricity is flowing, and how to modify, troubleshoot, or add to a circuit. Mistakes are easy to find!The wires are color coded to match the diagram, so mistakes really stand out and are easy to fix.From the start it was important that the learned skills could be applied to all electronics, while beingbeginner-friendly, and still staying true to conventional industry diagrams. I wanted it to be entirely visual too, so I created color code bars and symbols that match the colors and number coding of actual parts. I kept the part values there as well, to encourage natural association and memorization without any conscious effort!Hi, I'm Cory Russek, the creator of SocketCircuits. After 2+ years of research and development, I'm very excited to bring this project to Kickstarter! We're about to open up a whole new world of possibilities, for kids and adults alike, to explore electronic circuits, invent, and design real products! The “maker movement”... can it be entrepreneurship too?Products like Arduino are bringing logic, sensors, programming, and robotics within reach for kids and hobbyists. The stage is set, for easy low-cost prototyping of just about any idea you can think of... but there's a catch; You can't sell prototypes. They are simply too expensive. For every $1 in parts cost, a typical product price goes up by $5 to $10. That goes for modules like Arduino as well. If you include these premium modules in your design, then you could end up pricing yourself out of market... and that's why I'm stepping in. For some ideas, an Arduino may be the electronics equivalent of putting a Ferrari engine into your lawn mower. Did you know that there are programmable processors available for under 50 cents? That's a processor capable of driving a basic roaming robot too... in fact, let's do it!! The world's first papercraft programmable robot!Bringing the vision to life... SocketCircuits as a product incubatorOver the course of this campaign, you'll get to see ""Socketbot” take shape. From the initial goal you just read, to rough outlines of features, and prototypes of the robot's cardstock/papercraft frame, we'll take this journey together and start a “technology product” from scratch using SocketCircuits. By the end of the campaign, we should have a clear idea of what the robot will look like and what it should do. As a backer, you'll get to see what happens after the campaign, as the circuits are prototyped and motors and sensors are installed into the frame. In a series of video's and guides, I'll explain each part of the circuit and design, in easy to follow terms, along with thought processes for overcoming design challenges. Once the robot is complete, I'll launch it as its own kickstarter technology product, with the goal of funding an affordable process for transitioning a SocketCircuits prototype circuit into a mass produced printed circuit that goes into a retail product. My long term goal is to help people bring their electronics ideas to market, through the amazing revolution of crowd funding (Thank you Kickstarter!!), without needing the resources of a company or university.But this is a kit... How does it help me invent?I'm glad you asked... After the company is up and funded, and all rewards have been delivered, I'll be regularly adding circuit diagrams for connecting to, interacting with, and automating just about anything. If someone wants to re-create the wall-hanging singing fish (please don't!) they would search on the socketcircuits website for a motion sensing circuit, a voice chip circuit, and a motor driver circuit. Then simply cut and paste them onto one page, print it out, wire it up, and attach it to the fish. Long term, I'm also envisioning dozens of Arduino like ""printable"" modules and accessories, created and maintained by the online community, which will cover the entire spectrum of capabilities and costs.  As that grows, I'll move into developing affordable sockets for surface mount components (to bring costs even lower!), and some other awesome technologies in the works, that will bring many of our ideas within reach of retail success. The sockets you have seen so far, were all created on a CNC mill. The design is solid and ready to go into mass production through plastic injection molding. The funds will pay for an injection mold to be made, and production of the sockets needed for backer rewards.All kits, except for the ornament kits, come with an AAA battery case to power the circuit. Batteries are not included. The ornament is powered by a coin cell battery, so it comes with a coin cell socket and includes the coin cell battery as well. $200,000 Purchase an industrial CNC wire cutter / stripperThis will save me from having to adapt my CNC mill for wire production, and speed up delivery time for the pre-assembled parts kits.$350,000 Purchase an industrial injection molding machineThis would give me enough money to buy an entry-level industrial injection molding machine. In-house production would lower costs and free up funds to include bonus sockets and parts in every kit.$500,000 Hire a partner to start the community siteI'll bring a partner on-board to start work on the interactive website for hosting community developed circuit diagrams, and eventually include web-based circuit design and layout as well.$1,000,000 Hire a team to start work on Phase 2: ""Backlit Interactive""Backlit Interactive is the next step, where circuits will be constructed on transparent sheets over the screens of cell phones and tablets. The sockets will illuminate with colors and patterns to visually show how the part affects signals and the flow of electricity. Wire traces will animate to show voltage and current traveling through them. Sockets can be selected to learn about the part and it's role in the circuit. ""Virtual Instruments"" can be attached to any socket to see what the signal would look like on an oscilloscope or volt meter. The background diagram can change from SocketCircuits to conventional and back. The picture below is a very rough simulation of what Backlit Interactive might look like:The clear sockets act as ideal light pipes, and the optical clarity also makes it possible to read information through the socket, such as voltage levels, frequencies, etc. As with the diagrams, backlit interactive will evolve through several variations before landing on the ideal way to represent useful information, and give users an entertaining and educational experience.","Socket Assembly:Each socket will need 2 to 16 clips inserted into it. I should be able to automate that using my CNC machine as a ""pick and place"" machine. Wire Length & Shape:The CNC machine can be adapted for wire production as well. Most of the wires in the diagrams are standard lengths, but cutting non-standard wires, and pre-bending wires, can be accomplished through CNC processes.Fallback / concurrent plans:I have several people who are ready and eager to have assembly parties to insert clips by hand. It's easy to create assembly jigs for manually loading entire rows of contacts at a time, so it may even turn out that ""manual assembly"" is faster than machine assembly. I'll be pursuing both methods and get rewards out to everyone with whichever method turns out to be the fastest.If you would like to get your kit sooner, you will have the option for ""self-assembly"" to assemble the sockets and bend the wires yourself, with step-by-step directions. If the clips are inserted incorrectly, they can get bent out of shape, so this option is only recommended for adult assembly. Extra clips will be included. A backer survey will be sent out, after the campaign, that will give you the option to request self-assembly.Work left to do:• Change the strobe diagram to invert the triggering of the transistor (Did you notice the wire change in the video? :) In order to make an object appear to stop, you want a brief “light on” time and a long “light off” time. The original diagram wiring causes a long “light on” time, which makes the spinner visible too long and results in a blur effect.• Add part values and color code symbols to the Strobe diagram.• Create a simple “Cheat Sheet” to help beginners identify parts by their symbols, and help with troubleshooting common mistakes, like inserting a part backwards, or putting a part into the wrong holes.• Collaborate with a science teacher to create lesson plans for the Grade 4-12 classroom kit. • Create downloadable papercraft ornament patterns for the ornament kits• Create a papercraft frame for ""SocketBot"" and add manually controlled motors for a basic proof-of-concept demo by the end of the campaign.",https://www.kickstarter.com/projects/799570197/socketcircuits?ref=discovery_category_newest,799570197/socketcircuits,"SocketCircuits are easy enough for an 8 year old to make, and versatile enough for prototyping many of the technology projects that you see here on Kickstarter.It’s a great product for STEM educators, homeschoolers, hobbyists and makers. Simply print a diagram to cardstock paper, stick the adhesive backed sockets to placeholder shapes, and insert color coded parts and wires for a complete circuit.Thank you all for supporting SocketCircuits! If you missed the KickStarter campaign, don't worry, SocketCircuits' kits will be available for pre-order on our home page:Keep a look-out for other great SocketCircuits campaigns in the future too. On the road-map ahead we'll be adding mechanical design, embedded programming & robotics, circuit design software, a web circuit database and more! I collaborated with world renowned papercraft artist Rob Ives (www.robives.com) to create this irresistible “BarriBot” kit. It uses a simple coin cell battery and LED circuit to backlight a “Barrier Grid Animation”. As the grill is moved up and down, it hides different parts of the animation image, which results in the animation effect that you see on the left.

After 2+ years of research and development, I’m very excited to bring this project to Kickstarter! We’re about to open up a whole new world of possibilities, for kids and adults alike, to explore and invent with electronic circuits!Challenge #1: Break the “kit barrier”Most electronics learning products on the market have a major limitation: Once you build the kit, that’s all there is! You could try to go beyond their kit, but if it’s a module based system, you are limited to the handful of modules that they offer. If you try to go beyond the kit with a breadboard or spring based system, you spend most of your time hopelessly trying to translate an intuitive circuit diagram to a mess of criss-crossed wires and a part layout that looks nothing like the diagram.Solution: Make the parts conform to the diagramNot just SocketCircuit diagrams, but any diagram you find online or in a book. You can finally build what you see, with little or no changes to the wiring and part layout. As the SocketCircuits offering expands, you will be able to reuse and expand your socket set to build countless circuits and projects.Challenge #2: Make it affordableCompetitors pay a lot to make their modules! Only a tiny percentage of the price actually goes towards paying for electronic parts. The majority of the cost is for over-seas injection molded cases and labor for soldering and assembling each module. Breadboards are a more flexible option, but the board is always too big or too small, so you end up paying for multiple boards or paying for dozens of unused conductor slots.Solution: A minimalist design and in-house manufacturingSocketCircuits sockets will be manufactured in-house on a custom designed injection molding machine. Third party overhead costs, minimum orders, and engineering fees are eliminated. All of the equipment has already been purchased. The campaign funds will go towards the cost of machining socket molds and completing a hydraulic retrofit on the injection molding machine.Challenge #3: Make it fun!As a kid, I loved electronics kits, but I rarely built more than a few of the projects from the manual. It just took too long to get through the cumbersome directions and to find all of the part and wire locations.  The assembly process isn't really where the learning is at. The truly valuable knowledge comes from observation and experimentation with an assembled circuit.Solution: Get to the fun learning part faster, with easy assemblySocketCircuits go together very quickly because there’s very little searching, reading, or mystery in how they’re built. The wires are color coded and pre-bent so that their matching location in the diagram is unmistakable. The clear sockets allow you to see through to the diagram which leads you right to the correct holes. It’s actually pretty hard to make a mistake on a SocketCircuits kit. In fact, there are only a few things that need instruction, such as polarity on some of the parts. Polarity could be demonstrated with a simple picture like this:With fewer assembly instructions, the lesson plans are able to focus on learning through experimentation. You’ll be guided through swapping out certain parts with parts of a different value, so that you can observe how the circuit reacts and learn each part’s function through empirical observation. For example, you can watch LED’s get brighter or dimmer by changing out resistor values, and control the adjustment range of the clock’s timer circuit by swapping out one capacitor for another. Each kit will include selected extra parts for these learning exercises.Challenge #4: Get kids into inventingAs soon as manufacturing is in place, and backer rewards are delivered, I’ll be focusing on creating kits that are geared specifically for young inventors. The circuits will cover many common input needs such as sensors for light, motion, magnetism, pressure, temperature, sound, and more. Outputs will cover DC motors, stepper motors, servo motors, lights, sound, relays, and all sorts of unique kits such as a laser show kit with electronically addressable X and Y “galvanometer” mirrors. I’ll also be jumping right into programmable microcontroller CPU kits so that your inventions can include logic, algorithms, and robotic motion.Sounds great! What’s the next step?The sockets you have seen so far were all created on a CNC mill. The design is solid and ready to go into production through plastic injection molding. The parts will be manufactured using a plastic injection molding machine that I’ve been designing from scratch. The first prototype machine has already produced a working injection molded socket (circled in green) using a proof-of-concept socket mold (circled in blue).I’m in the process of retrofitting the injector with electric powered hydraulics to handle production on a large scale. The campaign funds will pay for that upgrade and for materials needed to make molds for each of the socket designs. You can add the BarriBot kit to any reward level by adding $10 to your pledge amount. As an add-on item, it will be shipped together with your other reward in a single package and delivery will be in 2015.The SocketCircuits roadmap includes development of a “Backlit Interactive” series of kits. Circuits will be constructed on transparent sheets over the screens of smartphones and tablets. A special app will illuminate the sockets with colors and patterns to visually show how the part affects signals and the flow of electricity. Wire traces will animate to show voltage and current traveling through them. Sockets can be selected to learn about the part and it’s role in the circuit. “Virtual Instruments” can be attached to any socket to see what the signal would look like on an oscilloscope or volt meter. The picture below is a very rough simulation of what Backlit Interactive might look like:As with the diagrams, backlit interactive will evolve through several variations before landing on the ideal way to represent useful information, and give users an entertaining and educational experience.","The purpose of this campaign is to perfect the manufacturing process and kit design. Think of it as a ""beta version"" of a future retail product. There may be minor imperfections or slight changes in the design over time, but the functionality will stay the same. Your input and feedback will help to refine the design and how it will be presented and used in the future.Possible cosmetic flawsPlastic injection molding is a new field for me. I've proven that I can produce plastic pieces with the machine I created, but there are a few variables to work out to eliminate minor cosmetic flaws like a trapped bubble in the plastic. I will likely get that all worked out prior to shipping. Manufacturing / design improvementI'm working on a different conductor clip design to improve on what the breadboard industry uses. I'm hoping to get that change into the reward parts that ship. International Shipping FeesKickstarter only offers a feature for a single fixed international shipping fee. Actual shipping cost can be anywhere from 2 to 10 times the cost of domestic shipping, so it is impossible to choose a single fee that will be fair. Since there's no way to adjust what you pay for shipping, I'm going to adjust what you get for the money that you pay instead. I will include extra parts in international kits where the fee exceeds the actual shipping cost. I'll come up with a few different ""bonus packages"" to ensure that your rewards will fairly match your pledge amount, including fees."

The rulesare simple. You must make contact at least once and knock your opponent over while remaining upright. We played many games, but this one had us hooked.EDUCATIONThe software is written in C/C++ which, according to IEEE SPECTRUM, is the computer language most in demand by recruiting companies. The software is free for you to download, modify or completely rewrite. If the campaign is successful, we will be setting up a forum for you to share your code with the community. We recommend the Arduino development platform. Check out the S4A project too!HARDWARET-BOTS use a combination of accelerometers and gyroscopes to precisely measure the tilt. This information is used to calculate the necessary motor response for the robot to maintain its balance. There are numerous ways of achieving this; both simple and complex.The T-BOT has an ultrasound distance-measuring module for eyes, providing the user with scope to write algorithms for the robots to interact with their environment or each other.The bluetooth module allows you to control the robot using your smart phone or PC. See Joystick Bluetooth Commander.Technical SpecificationsCREATET-BOTS have been designed to inspire creativity. From designing your own T-BOT skins, inventing your own games, learning to program using the Arduino development platform or Scratch (S4A), understanding the physics of balance and dynamic stabilization, all the way up to advanced control theory. Or you can just assemble the robot, download the software and play! T-BOTS are an excellent example of a STEAM product that is genuinely fun!A T-BOT was used to help film the campaign video! The model for the dolly adaptor can be made freely available for 3D printing.The design is complete, we have working prototypes, the quotes and lead times are in! We are ready to go on completion of a successful campaign.Why £100k. The short answer is, economy of scale. The long answer...I’m a scientist and I have three children. I wanted to inspire them with a project that would teach them about science, mathematics, electronics, programming, product design and even explore concepts like artificial intelligence.  So I designed a robot called Robie (see below).When their friends saw Robie, they wanted to know if they could buy one. Until that point, I hadn’t even considered selling robots. Robie was much too complicated to launch as a first product with no infrastructure in place. So I set out to design an endearing  robot that would be affordable for as many people as possible, and so the T-BOTS were born! When setting the target I considered two things. First, I did some market research to gauge people’s response to the T-BOTS. People were both intrigued and charmed by these little chaps, so I new we had a saleable product. Second, I explored options to make them affordable while maintaining the highest quality. This is where the economy of scale comes in. For example, the chassis will be laser cut and the wheels will be injection moulded. When seeking quotes I discovered the obvious - the cost drops significantly if you order in bulk. The cost per unit for a thousand was significantly less expensive than 500 and 2000 was significantly less expensive than 1000. But of course, this must be balanced against the likelihood of finding a higher number of backers. I looked at other products that had been launched on Kickstarter and thought that selling 2000 T-BOTS seemed achievable.","Inevitably, manufacturing a new product carries with it risks of delays in production due to the supply chain. We will be open and honest in our communication in the event that any delays arise.KLiK ROBOTICS and Kickstarter both stress that this platform is not a traditional store, and hope that you understand that you are joining a journey. We're confident that it will be one you enjoy.

The new design is eye-catching, innovative and because they are produced with laser cutting and finely formed injection moulds, they look stunning! The clear acrylic showcases their inner workings and control modules, igniting that spark of curiosity. The T-Bot is built around a specially designed motherboard making assembly of the electronic components elegantly simple and satisfying.We have completed the supply chain and already have 50 T-Bots waiting to find their new homes (all accounted for now)! Our suppliers are on standby; ready to ship when the new orders are placed. We will be shipping the main order in December for Christmas deliveries, but the first 50 Early Birds will have theirs sent in November!InspirationOur T-Bots are designed to inspire and introduce the next generation of scientists, mathematicians, engineers and technologists to the world of robotics. One of the most exciting advances in robotics is dynamic stabilisation. This is fancy terminology for actively stabilising things that want to fall over.This is the principle which underpins reusable space rocket technology, as beautifully demonstrated by SpaceX's Falcon. It is also true of the latest line of advanced robots produced by Boston Dynamics. We want to show these ideas are not just for rocket scientists, but accessible to everyone who is willing to have a go. The key to understanding is starting at the right place. Explore our online tutorials covering dynamic stabilisation, the inverted pendulum, Kalman filtering, data extraction, proportional integral derivative control (PID) and more. Remember, this stuff isn't as complicated as it sounds.We have had great feedback from backers along with some great ideas! One idea that stood out in particular was to explore collective interactions such as flocking and formation control. T-Bots are well suited to these kinds of experiments. You can try programming some simple rules such as search, pursue, avoid, and see how this is expressed in a swarm!BuildWith easy to follow step-by-step, detailed instructions on the KLiK Robotics website,T-Bots are fun to build. ProgramLearn to code in Python, the top programming languages of 2018 (IEEE SPECTRUM), and arguably, the most important programming language in science. You will learn to extract and analyse data from the T-Bot across serial and Bluetooth. Develop your own machine learning software using Genetic algorithms. Again, it sounds fancy but you can do it!You will learn to program the T-Bot in C++, the second top programming language of 2018. You will learn to establish communication between the numerous hardware components, such as the motor driver board, ultrasound module, gyroscope, accelerometer and Bluetooth module.T-Bots are an exciting way to enhance the practical component of the STEM (Science, Technology, Engineering and Mathematics) teaching programme and the National Curriculum.PlayUpload the code to your T-Bot, install the Android controller or run the Python controller from your PC and you're ready to play!Invent your own games like T-Bot maze runner, T-Bot football, or T-Bot wars. T-Bot wars is still our favourite, we even built an arena!What's in the box?If we meet our £20,000 stretch goal we will also include 1.5 mm and 2.0 mm Allen keysand a 3 mm straight edge screwdriver for assembly!Customise the python controller. Change the colours or change the artwork completely! Just modify the images in the Python controller folder.  Shaggy carpet!This might look perfectly simple but something remarkable is happening. The signals used by the T-Bot to maintain its balance are coming from a gyroscope and accelerometer. These are getting bounced around as the T-Bot rolls over the carpet, yet the T-Bot is still able to cope!

After several years of studying and earning my degree in engineering, I decided to take a chance and go all-out on my true passion in life - music. I moved up to San Francisco to start my adventure and began recording in mid-2010.Now I'm almost ready to put out my first full-length album and am in need of funding to get this thing off the ground! I've always been big on doing a lot with a limited budget - Borrowed keyboards, a cheap mic from eBay, a home-built desk, and low-end audio interfaces populate my bedroom studio. But none of this has stopped me from achieving high-quality results, as you'll hear in my music. One thing I can't get around, however, is the massive cost of CD duplication! I need your help not only for duplication, but for printed materials, internet media, and anything and everything I can use to channel my music to the masses.About ""Those Bloody Yanks!"" - We originally started out as DJ/Producer duo, but now the group simply consists of myself (I now do the DJing as well!).

And yes, you can get all that is pictured below for the $20 pledge - how cool is that?I'm working on my third album, silly. I've really nailed down a wonderfully refined sound that features soul-inspired vocals, funky synths, driving dance beats, and the occasional searing guitar solo. I've tested out my tracks at open mics, private events, house parties, a plethora of San Francisco clubs, and even Burner parties, and people seem to really love them! Through these outings I've discovered that my music knows no distinction between the tone of your melanin or the configuration of your DNA.I really want to make this release special by shipping it with premiere packaging and accompanying it with a big release show.Image is pretty important - You gotta look good for people to notice you. But ultimately, content is King. Focusing on the inner self is what I believe to be the best thing for any artist to do - and music as an auditory creation allows me to think only about what you hear. Music takes me to a place where none can be judged by their outward appearance, and it has the power to bring so many different types of people together - that's why I love it so much.Funding for this album can be broken into 2 main categories:While digital distro is nice, I strongly believe in the value of having a physical album that one can own and appreciate. A package can show an artists' care for his/her own work and assigns a sentimental value with the musical content. Here's a mockup of what it will look like:..and a breakdown of the contents:Hell yeah!

About 2 years ago, I had started working toward a goal to bring dedicated people to their dream jobs. It all started when I met a young make up artist, making extraordinary orcs and mythical beasts out of regular people. Unfortunately, this didn't go too far, because she ended up back working as an esthetician, scrubbing feet and what not. She strived for a goal, and the industry spat her back. She was TOO good for mediocrity. This started Persistant Night Productions, a proud 'All-Canadian' team. A team of people willing to do whatever it takes to achieve their dreams. So far, I've funded everything out of my pocket. I'm willing to spend every cent so my team can reach their dreams, it's still not enough for our time line. We plan to make a better pitch trailer to present to Netflix, Global, HBO, Showcase, Space, Teletoon, ANYONE who will help us make an on going TV show. All these funds will go to resources to make a movie quality Trailer for the pitch. As you see, we have the skill, we only need the resources.

I was born in Brazil but I have lived in Italy over the last 25 years. Since I was 10 (when I built my first “pinhole” camera with a shoe box) I have had a passion for photography and cameras.I have used cameras since when they were analog with “12, 24, 36 films” and I have always wished to use them again but with the possibility to get the photos right away without expensive films and developing time.But it was not enough. So I started to think of a simple way to turn them into digital devices for an easy and immediate use.With this in mind, after destroying four digital cameras in my attempts,I decided that the easiest way would be to opt for an electronic open source and that there was no better solution than a Raspberry PI B3 (for its dimensions and power).So I started this project and, after one year of hard work in search of a solution, I finally managed to solve the problem.The area of the photo is smallest of the whole real camera area, due to the focusing Screen. Instead of 24x36mm, will be held 26x18mm.Stop spending your money with rollers and revelations (4 euros for the 36 photos roll + 10 euros for their development). With I’m Back, you can use all the possibilities of the Raspberry Pi form and, besides the possibility to take photos, you can also:Transfer your photos directly to the Web through the browserSend and receive emailConnect via bluetooth (mouse, keyboard and and more)Connect to the network via Ethernet cableAccess the function of this “small computer” via the TFT screenFor the Raspberry lovers, all the possibilities of their imaginations! It uses the latest Raspberry Pi camera module 8 megapixel Sony and it is based on the picture taken from the focusing screen with fresnel focus which conveys the image a sort of “grain texture” typical of 200 or 400 asa film.Open source software and hardware (Raspberry PI B3 with Linux and Python as programming code) with the possibility to use Raspberry PI B3 for other projects using the touchscreen TFT display and its USB ports.Photos are saved in a pen drive.“I’m Back™”works with a great number of models and it has a Z X Y regulation which allows to adjust the F stop (24X36mm) which is placed behind the shutter.XYZ axis to adjust the exposure hole“I’m back”works with a great number of models and it has a Z X Y regulation which allows to adjust the F stop (24X36mm) which is placed behind the shutter.The camera is linked to the device through a Flah Sync cable. To take a picture after adjusting the camera, all you need is to turn it on and choose one of the three picture options from the menu. Normal color, dim light color and black and white. The software is not fully developed yet as I need more time to have it fully developed by a Python programmer.As regards the exposure, since the necessary amount of light is measured by the camera module, the camera must be set to B (Bulb) speed. After focusing the object, the shutter button must be pressed for 2 to 4 seconds according to the light. I am considering solving this problem and make the camera capable to auto adjust the exposure time, but now that’s the way it works.The file is saved in the USB flash unit which allows transferring the photos to a PC or even to a cloud server.I need your input to make the next step, which is to large-scale production, but first I need to redesign for plastic injection, verify and improve the prototype software and photo.PS.: The design and components mentioned above may be subject to changes and improvements to product delivery. Due to the Raspberry Pi availability issues, and in order to respect delivery times, if necessary, I will use a different open source hardware with similar characteristics.             Very important:  The photos taken by I’m Back presented here were treated with Picasa, because, as already happens with modern digital devices, tiny hair or dust can disturb the images. It is very important, before you take pictures, to make sure that the surface of the focusing glass which will record the image is clean. But bear in mind that you should always treat these photos as taken with a film camera and not with the latest generation of digital cameras! ;-) in order for you to have an idea of how the photos come out, I have inserted a photo still untreated.* Raspberry Pi, Adafruit and Sony Trade Marks.","My main preoccupation is the number of motherboards I have to buy from Adafruit as these are, as many of you already now, of a very good quality, but they are not always available. Therefore, as a precaution, if this should be the case, I will have to redesign it and opt for an Open Source card from another supplier. If the project is successful, I may even design my own board which will make much easer to deliver the product without delays.As well as the motherboard, also the delivery of the pieces to be assembled depend on the suppliers. However, since the components are simple, I don't think I will have problems in delivering them on time, as I can always choose a different supplier.If, as it always happens, it is a ""great success"" and I will have to produce on an industrial scale, I will adopt a plastic injection system and I will hire a team of experts to assemble them. I am used to last minute solutions in my job, but I must admit this is the first time I am proposing a product that I have designed myself and I will be responsible for the deliveries.

While creating the rewards for those giving, I realized they were only for the person giving support and those receiving for the show. Then it hit me, “you gotta give to enjoy your life Mr. Scrooge”. Yes, it does cost a bit to produce a production, but we have to be willing to take a part of the support and give it to those that are less fortunate over the Christmas/Holiday Season.I am very excited because, each reward level includes purchasing blankets to cover some beds at some local shelters in NYC and or boys/girls winter coats for New York Cares, which is an organization that hosts major coat drives.

To make this happen, we are asking for your support in securing the venue, props and costumes, and advertising and marketing.Venue - is costing us $3,800, which we found to be reasonable. Our rehearsal and performance dates are secured.Costumes/Props - $1000.00. The center piece to the show that I would like to keep as a surprise will cost a bit as it must be made by hand. Costumes/props should be reasonable because ""A Christmas Carol"", A New Musical is set in today’s time period. We will do whatever we can to find pre-existing costumes at a reasonable rate. We will require some funds for the differing time periods.Set design & Props - $800.00. We have managed to keep scenery to a minimum, but with style. A show is not complete without props to bring things to life.Marketing/Promotion - $1,000.00 for social media marketing, posters, and flyers to get the word out.As you can see the budget is more than we are asking, but that's okay because we are giving from the heart to bring this project alive.

Crowd funding has been around even since Renaissance times, to support and enableart to be created and culture moved forward.Thanks Again For Your Support!. . .Portland, ORI was Born & Raised in the green hills & two street lights of Wilmore, Kentucky haha. I moved out to Portland after graduating High School to pursue professional skateboarding. Those were very crucial formative years for me. At 20 years old, after 11 years of pursuing skateboarding professionally, I saw how short-lived a career in skateboarding was, so I quit pursuing a career in it, to dive deeper into my fascination with music. I was thinking more longterm, about career, & happiness. For the first couple years of pursuing music I was only partially happy with my life. I was working 2 jobs while music was on the back-burner and daydreamed about it being in the forefront. I felt like I was always letting someone down though, wether it be my bosses, showing up late to work cause I was working on music, or letting down myself because I wasn't devoting enough time to my music. I knew what eventually needed to be done, but I was still afraid to do it fully.So I halfheartedly faced my fears, & I Gradually gave less time to my job I didn't love, & more attention to my music. I was playing more open mics and more on the street.However I knew eventually I would have to completely face my fears and chase my dream fully or i'd die with unforgivable regret. So in the Summer of 2015 I planned to quit my job and move away to California to become a musicianby the new year. I chose California because its nice weather would allow me to play on the street year round to make a living. Then in the fall of 2015 I was fired from my job before I could quit, for lack of speed & zeal, which helped that along hahaI was finally a musician. I would make CD's & hit the road on the new year.My last album ""Swimming"" was recorded my last month living there in December of 2015 and was a culmination songs about coming of age, letting go of unhappiness, & following my dreams.The First Day Of 2016I have a thing with symbolism haha So with a wagon with a bed in the back, a guitar, and some Swimming CD's, I left Portland OR on the first day of a new year, January 1st 2016I took the long way to California by heading east to Kentucky, Alabama, Florida, playing shows along the way, & then finally headed west towards California.Becoming MeI drove into California after 11 hours of driving from New Mexico, on March 6th 2016. I spent the night and slept in my wagon near Joshua Tree. I woke up with a feeling like anything could happen. The sun was coming up barely over the mountains to the west, while I sat on the roof of my wagon, guitar in hand, to watch the sunrise.I filmed this time-lapse to remember my first sunrise in California.It was a surreal feeling, the wind turbines rolling in the distance being slowly illuminated by the sunrise, the warmth and light growing nearer.I started to feel everything... peace, wonderment, change, calmness, and sound. I wrote a new song. About Becoming Myself, Slowly.It was conceivedfrom a moment of surreal bliss that you can certainly feel in the song itself, & this particular moment set the tone for the rest of the EP.Not to get too zen on you, but It is my belief that there's a point to this.it is Love.It is another hope of mine that you sense that in these songs.What I really need Is Time.As a lot of you know,I not only sing & write, but I am also a Producer, & Visual Artist.With your support, I would be able to spend less time playing on the street and more time in the studio, recording & working on the art. Funds would also go towards involving other artist and musicians to collaborate with on the EP!After getting to LA with $10 due to car troubles in Texas, I have workedcontinuously, &incredibly hard.I can now afford to rent a studio space while ALSO having a car. I am beginning to see the fruit of all my labor.I have been supporting myself from just music for the past year and a half, Playing on the streets relentlessly hustling my Swimming CD's when I wasn't playing open mics, coffee shops, & anywhere else that would let me.It's a near 24/7 job just to maintain. I am still sleeping in my car and eating canned food, however with enough work I know i'll be able to afford an apartment one day too. I will continue to sacrifice everything for this art because I truly believe it is worth it.Like I said before; Your Support = Less time on the street & More time in the studio.

https://www.kickstarter.com/projects/2114765394/antimatter-propulsion?ref=discovery_category_newest,2114765394/antimatter-propulsion,"In 2002 we were funded bythe NASA Institute for Advanced Conceptsto perform preliminary work on an antimatter-basedpropulsion system. This campaign seeks to fund a continuation ofthe design and experimental validation of an antimatter thruster capable of reaching (or exceeding) 5% of the speed of light. The goal is to enable interstellar travel, with the initial requirements of accelerating, decelerating, and studying a nearby solar system all within a human lifetime. It is nowtime to advance this concept from an idea and onto the drawing board.Below is a brief sketch of our proposal.For a more complete presentation and adetailed look at our past work, go to http://www.antimatterdrive.organd view our ever-growing body of content.Antimatter has the highest specific energy of any source known to man. At nearly 10^17 J/kg, it is two orders of magnitude larger than fusion and ten orders of magnitude larger than chemical reactions. Although currently produced and stored in small quantities using Penning traps, antimatter must be stored in much higher densities to be applicable for interstellar missions. Currently, research is underway around the world to develop high-capacity storage of antimatter in smaller, lighter electrostatic traps or in the form of antihydrogen. However, even if proven successful, no propulsion system has been demonstrated that would efficiently convert the antimatter into usable thrust.Fission is the process by which an atomic nucleus splits into two or more daughters, multiple neutrons, alpha particles, electrons, and gamma rays. Most of the energy released by fission is in the kinetic energy of two daughters. Invoking conservation of momentum, a nucleus at rest produces two daughters of equal momentum travelling in opposite directions. The kinetic energy of each daughter is approximately 1 MeV/amu (1 million electron volts in each proton and neutron).Assume a thin sheet of depleted uranium U238 upon which a carbon coating is applied on the back side. When antiprotons (physics symbol P with an overhead bar) drift onto the front surface, their negative electrical charge allow them to act like an orbiting electron, but with different quantum numbers that allow the antiprotons to cascade down into the ground orbital state. At this point it annihilates with a proton or neutron in the nucleus. This annihilation event causes the depleted uranium nucleus to fission with a probability approaching 100%, most of the time yielding two back-to-back fission daughters. A fission daughter travelling away from the sail at a kinetic energy of 1 MeV/amu has a speed of approximately 13,800 km/sec, or 4.6% of the speed of light. The other fission daughter is absorbed by the sail, depositing its momentum into the sail and causing the sail (and the rest of the ship) to accelerate.Instead of creating a standard nuclear rocket in which hydrogen gas is heated and expelled as thrust, we have created a lightweight nuclear rocket wherein the uranium is the fuel and the antimatter is the spark plug. This dramatically reduces the needed amount of antimatter, making this the first proposed antimatter-based propulsion system that is within the near-term ability of the human race to produce.In 2002 we received our first funding of $75,000 from theNASA Institute for Advanced Concepts. The design mission was to deliver a 10 kg instrument payload to 250 AU within 10 years. The 10 kg payload was assumed based on work done at JPL [Deutsch, L.J., Salvo, C., and Woerner, D., ""NASA's X2000 Program - an Institutional Approach to Enabling Smaller Spacecraft"" and Hemmati, H. and Lesh, J.R., ""A Combined Laser-communication and Imager for Microspacecraft""]. The mission was assumed to be a fly-by mission although the ability to tack or to stop at the final destination was within the capabilities of this concept. As you can see in the figure below, this corresponds to heliopause, the solar gravitation lens focus, and the Kuiper Belt.The result of this work is shown in the figure below. The spacecraft has a sail that is composed of two layers- a carbon backing (sail) and a uranium coating (fuel). The entire sail is 5 meters in diameter. The carbon layer is 15 microns thick and the uranium is 293 microns thick. The total mass of uranium is 109 kg. The large area of the sail removes the requirement for active cooling. The sail is assumed to dissipate waste heat passively via black-body emission. We assumed an emissivity of 0.3 for both the carbon and the uranium. The steady state temperature of the sail would be 570C, well below the melting point of uranium.A second round of funding was granted by NIAC to experimentally investigate one of the open issues that was raised. Unfortunately, due to the abbreviated funding from NIAC, this investigation was never completed. It is one of the goals of this campaign to complete the experimental apparatus and prepare it for exposure to an antiproton beam.When a pulse of antiprotons annihilates against a small section of uranium foil, the foil picks up the momentum from the fission daughters. Because the antiproton intensities presently available from Fermilab are too small to cause foil velocities large enough to produce a measurable elevation jump, some sort of pendulum geometry is required. A highly sensitive geometry is a torsion balance (shown in the sketch and picture below), in which foil velocity is translated into amplitude of an angular oscillation.Assuming a pulse of 1 billion antiprotons on the uranium foil, the following parameters and values have been translated into a design that was built. Below is a table containing the parameters of this torsion balance.Note that the oscillation period of the torsion balance is approximately 10 minutes. In order measure the angular position of the balance over many periods, the effects of air friction must be avoided. Hence, the entire torsion balance is housed within a vacuum chamber.While it is our intention to progress this work to the point that we can consider manned missions, for this current campaign we are restricting ourselves to exploratory unmanned probes.At present physicists like us know of no shortcuts (like warp drive, wormholes, or star gates) to traverse the immense distances between stars. Nor are there any tangible theories that could provide such shortcuts. Therefore, we are going to have to use good old Newton's Laws and Einsteins Special Relativity to get us to these destinations.There are two propulsion technologies that are within the current or near-future technical ability of humans that can generate velocities capable of reaching the nearest candidate solar system (4.3 light years) in a single life span. A spacecraft travelling 5% of the speed of light would require 90 years to make the trip. Note that our fastest spaceships currently leaving the solar system would take over 80,000 years to cover that distance.Of course, one technology is antimatter. The other approach that is currently garnering widespread press reports is Breakthrough Starshot (http://www.breakthroughinitiatives.org/). They envision using powerful lasers to accelerate tiny solar sails to 20% of the speed of light. Their mission profile calls for a 20 year trip and a high-speed fly-by of the target solar system.While we encourage a diversity of approaches for reaching our mutual goal of reaching the stars, there are many problems inherent in accomplishing mission goals with a fly-by at 20% of the speed of light. For example, such a high velocity coupled with the expected light levels at Proxima b (their stated destination) requires that any reasonable camera shutter speed would produced smeared images, The same is also true of almost any current sensor technology, such as magnetic field measurements. Also, at this velocity the protons in solar wind near Proxima b would have an equivalent incident energy of 21 MeV, more than enough to transmute the probe materials, generating radioactive isotopes that would mask any radiation measurements.Therefore, one of our mission requirement is to decelerate the spacecraft just before entering the target solar system and going into orbit about that star. There are serious implications for spacecraft velocity when the requirement of deceleration at the destination is imposed.  Either drag, or some other mechanism, needs to be invoked at the destination, or enough extra fuel must be accelerated and stored in order to accomplish a comparable deceleration.  A staged spacecraft architecture is envisioned wherein a more massive booster accelerates the spacecraft and a smaller second stage decelerates into the destination solar system. It is the design of this new spacecraft architecture that is another of the goals of this campaign.The first portable storage bottle for antimatter currently resides at our headquarters. Pictured below, it can store either positrons (the antimatter partner of electrons) or antiprotons. Bottle, which operates at liquid helium temperatures and a very hard vacuum, can store up to 1 billion particles.Another form of charged antimatter particle storage are particle accelerators called storage rings. The picture below shows the construction of the last antiproton storage ring in the United States featuring campaign proponent Gerry Jackson. Gerry led the design, construction, and commissioning phases of the project. Called the Recycler ring, it is still an operational ring.For the purpose of interstellar missions, the quantity of antimatter is too large to store as charged elementary particles. Therefore, we propose to transport the antimatter initially in the form of antihydrogen (an antiproton with an orbiting positron). Eventually, an optimum form of antimatter might be antilithium. During this campaign we will develop an detailed design report describing the construction and performance of a long-lived antihydrogen storage bottle suitable for spacecraft. The storage mechanism will be similar to that employed in the classic Millikan Oil Drop experiment. We will also devise a storage test to be funded in a subsequent campaign in which the storage of cryogenic solid hydrogen will be maintained for years at a time, demonstrating the reliability of such a bottle.The formation of individual antihydrogen atoms is quite difficult, and the subject of several ongoing experimental collaborations. While the generation of positrons is comparatively simple, the large-scale generation of antiprotons is currently quite expensive. Research and development into the efficient and cost-effective production of antiprotons is required.The above graph shows global annual antiproton production since their discovery in 1954. From 1980 until 2011 the Fermi National Accelerator Laboratory (""Fermilab"") antiproton source was the dominant source of antiprotons in the world, culminating in a production rate of 2 nanograms per year. Sytematic antiproton production only takes place at CERN at this time, and only at 1% of the peak Fermilab rate.The antiprotons needed for the Fermilab particle physics research program had very restrictive requirements that limited the yield of antiprotons from a target upon which high energy protons collided. We plan to redesign the antiproton production at Fermilab, generating a design report that can be used as a basis for renewed and improved antiproton production operations.In summary, we plan to reignite our previous development effort on antimatter-based propulsion. The new goal is to produce a viable propulsion system for an unmanned spacecraft to a nearby solar system. A mission requirement is the decelertion and orbital insertion of an instrument package around the destination star. The specific campaign goals are:Please support our vision for the future.","The goals of this campaign are purposely restricted to tasks that do not require permission or cooperation from external entities such as NASA or Fermi National Accelerator Laboratory.  Instead, we will concentrate on designs and reports aimed at bolstering future campaigns, giving us the necessary time to reestablish such relationships.Because we are new to crowdfunding, we have also not promised any rewards that require shipping or handling.  All deliverables will be electronic in nature, allowing us to concentrate our efforts on the science.  If there is a significant demand for items such as T-shirts, mugs, or other tangible items, we will consider expanding our rewards categories appropriately.",https://www.kickstarter.com/projects/2114765394/antimatter-fuel-production?ref=discovery_category_newest,2114765394/antimatter-fuel-production,"In 2002 we were funded by the NASA Institute for Advanced Concepts to perform preliminary work on an antimatter-based propulsion system.

Our standard response is that humanity has already been able to produce 2 nanograms per year at the Fermi National Accelerator Laboratory (""Fermilab"").  In fact, one of our lead scientists worked at Fermilab for 14 years on antimatter production, storage, and usage.  In fact, that scientist led, along with Bill Foster (now U.S. Congressman IL-11) [http://www.billfoster.com/], the approval, design and construction of the antiproton Recycler ring pictured below.By rotating the assembly the radiation damage could be spread out.  By translating the assembly perpendicular to the beam direction, the depth of material seen by the protons and antiprotons could be varied in order to optimize antiproton production.Antiprotons sometimes form for when a proton disintegrates upon collision with a target nucleus.  The resultant particle shower sometimes includes an antiproton.  For every million protons on target, Fermilab was able to capture 15 antiprotons.  The thicker the target, the more protons can be converted into antiprotons.  But as the target depth is increased, the newly created antiprotons are increasingly annihilated before exiting the target and scattered into a very diffuse cloud.  In order to capture as many antiprotons as possible, a lithium lens was placed immediately behind the target to focus that cloud.  One of the Fermilab lenses is pictured below.After travelling through the lithium lens the antiprotons were directed into a pair of particle accelerators called the Debuncher and the Accumulator. The purpose of the Debuncher was to reduce the large energy spread of the antiprotons. The purpose of the Accumulator was to ""stack"" antiprotons into a tight beam. An important technology employed was stochastic cooling, the invention of which earned the Nobel Prize for accelerator physicist Simon van der Meer in 1984.  These accelerators are shown in the picture below.This state-of-the-art antiproton production infrastructure was designed to produce antiproton beams used in the Tevatron proton-antiproton collider in order to perform high-energy particle physics experiments, such as the discovery of the Top quark.  For the purpose of fueling an interstellar mission, an optimized antiproton production infrastructure will be quite different.First, instead of a thick target, a very thin target will be used.  While this geometry will produce fewer antiprotons per accelerated proton, the antiprotons that come off the target will form a much tighter beam.  The anticipated yield of antiprotons per proton is expected to be close to 1%.  By utilizing multiple targets the same number of proton interactions can be generated.  Therefore, the increase in antiproton intensity is expected to be near a factor of 1000.Second, the number of protons can be increased.  A relatively modest proton intensity increase factor of 5 is assumed.Third, instead of the use of synchrotrons such as the Main Injector, linear acceleration for the same proton beam current yields an increase antiproton production factor of 200,000.  Applying all of these improvement factors, the antiproton production rate can be increased from 2 nanagrams per year to 2 grams/year.An antiproton production rate of 2 grams/year is sufficient to fuel an interstellar mission every decade or so.  During the course of the research supported by this campaign further upgrades will be invoked to decrease the mission fueling time toward the goal of less than 4 years.But at 5% of the speed of light, it would take 90 years to reach the nearest confirmed planet Proxima b. We have concluded that travelling through a solar system at this velocity would preclude any measurements that would yield useful information. Therefore, the spacecraft would need to decelerate and go into orbit around either the star or Proxima b itself. To decelerate from this velocity, antimatter would need to be transported across the interstellar void.The storage of antihydrogen for this period of time would be quite problematic. Like its normal matter cousin, antihydrogen has a high vapor pressure even at cryogenic temperatures. This means that antihydrogen molecules would continuously boil off the surface of the solid antihydrogen snowflakes that were originally envisioned. We need a fuel with a much lower vapor pressure.So the answer comes down to producing nuclei containing antineutrons. After considerable study of the literature, the proposed first step in the process of nucleosynthesis is the reaction in which two 70 MeV antiprotons are collided to produce an antideuteron (an antiproton bonded to an antineutron) plus a negative pi-meson. In actuality the two antiprotons would not be at the same energy so as to produce the antideuteron with a kinetic energy high enough to be efficiently captured by a third storage ring.As seen in the sketch below, half of these stored antideuterons are then collided with antiprotons to form antihelium-3 (one antiproton plus two antineutrons). The other half of the antideuterons are collided with half of the antihelium-3 nuclei to from antihelium-4 (two antiprotons bonded to two antineutrons). This reaction also produces an antiproton that is trapped and used over again. The last stage is to collide the antihelium-3 and the antihelium-4 nuclei to from antiberyllium-7.There are a couple of points to note in this nucleosynthesis plan. First, all of these reactions are well measured with their normal matter cousins. Second, collision energies and partners were chosen so that theoretically no antimatter is lost in the entire process. The loss is restricted to mass-less gamma-rays and low-mass pi-mesons.Once the antiberyllium-7 is produced it is decelerated and stored in an electromagentic trap. By itself, the antiberyllium-7 nuclei are stable. But the next step is the introduction of positrons to form atomic antiberyllium-7. By cooling the antiberyllium-7 nuclei into a crystal lattice wherein their mutual repulsion creates coupling between the nuclei, this positron capture will be enhanced.Once converted into atomic antiberyllium-7, positron capture decay will occur with a 53.22 day half-life. Eventually all of the antiberyllium-7 decays into antilithium-7, which is stable.The long-term storage and manipulation of grams of antillithium will be addressed in a future campaign. The current campaign will concentrate on designing the specific particle accelerator hardware and detailing the production rates at each step of the above process. Cost estimates of the equipment and operations will be generated. Basically, we will produce a design report that can be used to build an antilithium factory. This design report will also be used as the basis for future experiments (funded by future campaigns) wherein this entire nucleosynthesis plan will be tested using normal matter (to keep expenses down).","The goals of this campaign are purposely restricted to tasks that do not require permission or cooperation from external entities such as NASA or Fermi National Accelerator Laboratory.

Pledge now and let's get this thing done!By the way, we prefer to get our album done on black vinyl (kind of a purist, I guess you could say), but there is an option to do a random color (using recycled color from the previous color pressing), where each album will be different and have slight variations of red and pink mixed with black.

My name is Ryan Smith, cartoonist behind fantasy comic series Accursed Dragon and scifi epicBanished. My FIRST cartooning project, however, began In 1999 with a simple humor webcomic called Funny Farm.The best way to describe Funny Farm is a slice of life series where some characters are cartoon animals for no reason.These characters all live together under one roof. Ront and Mewn's roof, to be exact. They're owners of a boarding home and due to various circumstances all these other folks decide to move in and put down roots. There are personality clashes, a bit of stalking and the occasional kidnap and rescue, but that helps bond these strangers into becoming friends. Family.Quirky misadventures are the least of their problems once the corporate despots, artificial intelligent megalomaniacs and masked terrorists begin showing their faces. A variety of perils await our protagonists as the stories progress and evolve.The tone is light, but with just a little bit of action and drama to keep you on your toes. All of it presented in newspaper style black & white dailies; Sunday color features.After officially ending on August 30th, 2008 very little in the way of printed material was ever produced.That is what this Kickstarter is hopefully going to correct as we self publish the first mega collection of Funny Farm!Our book will be 300 pages, full of as many comics as can possibly fit (ranging in material from 1999 to 2001) and printed on glossy paper stock.Here are what they will appear as:We'll be doing a small print run; that's why only $3,000 is requested. No frills or extras. If we surpass our goal, almost all the money will go towards making the book even better.(I say ""almost"" because the rest would go towards STRETCH GOAL bonuses!)Interested in including our Accursed Dragon and/or Banished books to your order? Follow these instructions:We are really excited to bring this Funny Farm collection to you early winter! Thank you for checking us out!Music for the video provided by Matthew Pablo. Visit his website for more of his great music!www.matthewpablo.com/","We've successfully printed three Accursed Dragon books, one volume of Banished and a Banished comic book on time; no complications. We will be using a printing company in North America, so little to no delays with customs are anticipated. If problems arise, everyone who pledges will be notified.As with any campaign of this nature the postage is expensive. The costs ($5 Canadian, $15 US, $20 International) involved help go towards a swift delivery and tracking (when available).Note: International orders will still take about a month for delivery.",https://www.kickstarter.com/projects/1985603883/accursed-dragon-the-winter-dragon?ref=discovery_category_newest,1985603883/accursed-dragon-the-winter-dragon,"Accursed Dragon is an ongoing webcomic following Coven, a hero cursed into the form of a dragon as he quests to become human again. Available at accurseddragon.com you can read how this journey deviates as noble allies and fierce villains cross Coven's path.Coven's tale turns for the worse as the kingdom is saved in no small part by him, but he's also separated from his close comrades.Almost a year later In an isolated town Coven meets up with Wylla, a tavern singer who has a plan to get famous by recounting Coven's exploits in song.Much to his chagrin, Coven accepts his new ally and together they embark on a brand new journey...which leads them to discover an ancient enemy the likes the realm has ever imagined.This kickstarter's goal is to assist in supplementing the costs of printing the fourth Accursed Dragon volume. Our project will collect this exciting 120 page story in a beautiful color perfect bound softcover book.If we surpass our initial goal we will create more rewards for you!In the event our project surpasses our initial goal, we are prepared to include additional bonuses for everyone who will receive a copy of their book in the mail.future stretch goals TBA...Ryan Smith is a Canadian cartoonist.

A user-centered product means that  it is technically challenging to develop but extremely easy to use. We are seeking for funding in order to collaborate with IT specialist around the world and to perform a user-based evaluation in order to complete this challenging but promising project.,https://www.kickstarter.com/projects/ebiostatistics/software-for-ethical-authorship-in-medical-journal?ref=discovery_category_newest,ebiostatistics/software-for-ethical-authorship-in-medical-journal,"Academic authorship of journal articles is a means of scholars making intellectual contributions of their work, communicating their findings, and building their reputation among their peers.There are many issues concerning authorship that are still controversial, with qualification as well as the order of authorship remaining the main dispute in the majority of collaborative work worldwide.With the interest of promoting the highest ethics in medical and science publishing, the aim of this project is to develop an open access web-based software for the objective qualification and order of authorship in medical and science journals, in an attempt to reduce or even eliminate such disputes.The items of the recommendations of the 2006 consensus statement on surgery journal authorship including; conception, execution, and documentation of research will be used to design the first part of the software, focusing on identifying and differentiating individuals whose work qualifies them as authors and those as contributors (Figure 1)The second part of the software design concerning the order (Figure 2) of the qualifying authors will be based on the well established Analytical Hierarchy Process (AHP) method, as it is the most suitable for objective multiple criteria decision-making and ranking (Figure 3).Authorships.org is, to the best of our knowledge, the first open access web-based software to  objectively qualify and indicate the order of academic authorship in medical and science journals.The output results of Authorships.org may become obligatory for submission as a separate document along with a manuscript, as nowadays more and more journals request the authors to indicate the various types of contributions to their work.For the completion of the development of Authorships.orgwe will require:","In every project there may be risks and surely challenges involved. We are not concerned about the technical part, we have already successfully developed complex software (e.g. eBiostatistics.com). The most important challenge is to ensure that the software is being used ethically. This means that it should not become a tool to eliminate disputes regarding authorship and at the same time reinforce unethical publishing. Thus, the most important part of the project will be appropriately implementing the software in the process and develop safeguards for honest and ethical authorship qualification."

Two of those albums feature the Legendary Bassist PERCY JONES! We are in the process of recording our third album with him. Unfortunately, there is no label or financial backing for this release. So we need your help to put this CD out independently. The goal is to raise $5500.00 to cover mixing, mastering, manufacturing and digital distribution costs. This may sound like a lot of Money, but we really hope to exceed this goal because we really want to give you something special in return for your support... So any extra funds will go towards making the final product much better. Maybe even a 2-CD set with lots of bonus music or a limited edition Vinyl!

There are also some very Cool special guests:David "" Fuse "" Fiuczynski, Michael Manring, Percy Jones, Scott McGill & Tim Garton. The album title is WEEK & it contains 9 songs. Kickstarter looks like the perfect place to pre-sell & also answer some questions: 1) How many people will pay for this album? 2) Do these buyers want a CD or Download? 3) Should it be 1 disc or 2? Since everyone knows me as a drummer, the fact that I only play drums on 3 songs might be a problem. So I am offering a second disc as part of the rewards. This additional disc will have 8 songs with drums & a solo drum piece. The rewards start at $2.00 and go to $500.00 for the Executive Producer Credit!

Anyone can happen across it; it brings theatre out of the closet of bricks and mortar and into the big outdoors. Among our accolades last year was the following, 'You have brought magic down to the marshes'. Help us switch the Mysteries' magic back on.We want to roll our show out into the mixed-up beauty of natural wildness and urban paraphernalia that is Walthamstow Marshes.So, on 5th and 6th September, what will you see?Many splendid things - a dragon fight, a singing cow, a dancing mill and a game of cards - a fantasy mix of dream-scenes from Walthamstow's past, with a mini-Mummers' play as the grand finale. So far, we have generous funding from Lee Valley Regional Park and Churchill Estates, but there is still a shortfall, which we're hoping to plug with this campaign.A successful campaign means we can pay the artists creating the art, from the designers of our posters and costumes to the director, musicians and actors, as well as the writer/producer. It means that we can keep this production free to the local community.We have a talented and professional team to realise the work. Please visit our Facebook page for further insights:https://www.facebook.com/WalthamstowMysteriesThe Walthamstow Mysteries team would especially like to thank Pinny Grylls and Zed Nelson for lending their footage of the dress rehearsal of the show.","The main obstacle to success really is lack of funds. Assuming we're successful in our campaign there are two others: the weather and health and safety. This is England and rain happens. The performers are used to outdoors site-specific work and we have discussed the weather issue (in fact, it is wind rather than rain that brings us difficulty). We have agreed that as far as possible the performances will take place, unless it's blowing a tempest, in which case we will have to re-schedule. Last year, there was one performance where it was overcast and mizzily but this actually contributed to the atmosphere of  The Mysteries' ghostly apparitions.The other risk is that the audience intermingles with the performers in a site of rugged terrain. We might have falls, scrapes and who knows what else. Last year we wrote a detailed risk assessment of the route and area, and so we launch this production with an improved knowledge of the stewarding/crowd control/health & safety. A first aid kit will be on hand for any mishaps. Additionally, the site is prepared beforehand, with the help of Lee Valley Regional Park with mowed grass pathway and hazard tape to cordon off identified obstacles.",https://www.kickstarter.com/projects/262609765/the-knitting-pattern-play?ref=discovery_category_newest,262609765/the-knitting-pattern-play,"VENUE: Theatre503, The Latchmere, 503 Battersea Park Rd, London SW11 3BWDATES: November2017 (three performances with possible additional dates)ABOUT THE PLAY:The Knitting Pattern Playis the deathbed reverie of an 18thcentury French aristocrat who visits the Three Fates whoknit, measure and cut a human life and who double as Les Tricoteuses at the guillotine. Purl requests these crafters of destiny to restoreher pattern of lifelong privilege disrupted by the French Revolution.By conveyingthe rigid and ritualised nature of society through the activity of knitting andthe fashion codes of the time, the play explores the idea of patterns - what itis that governs our behaviour - and suggests we might not be as free as wethink. ‘Found’ texttaken from a knitting book finds new meaning within the context of the play.PREVIOUS PRODUCTIONS:The Knitting Pattern Playwas written in 2012 and performed at Goldsmiths College, London in 2013. It was later showcased in the Words over Waltham Forest Festival and local knitters contributed the props. Since then, it has been substantially developed using research on Marie Antoinette, the court at Versailles and the momentum of events leading to the Reign of Terror in 1793.Previous What More? Productions include this shadow puppet show on plant life in Waltham Forest:What the audience said:""...We were fascinated throughout - very enjoyable. It's the first puppetry performance I've been to. The frisson of finding what nature chooses to reveal of itself was captured wonderfully.""""...Really professional, beautiful, funny and scary...""""I enjoyed this marvellous form of theatre, for being so imaginative and different to anything seen before.""WHY WE NEED YOUR HELP:We need your support to ensure that the creative team - the director, the performers, the lighting technician, the designers and the writer are paid for their involvement in this exciting project that will grow the work and experience of each of the creative team.IMAGES FROM PREVIOUS PRODUCTION:",RISKS & CHALLENGESAn excellent team is assembled to deliver the Knitting Pattern Play. Sophie Ruth Donaldson will design the costumes; students from Chelsea School of Art are knitting the props and set. The main challenge is to raise sufficient funds to pay those involved in the project. With a successful Kickstarter campaign we are confident of paying the creative team well and realising a beautiful and visually dramatic theatrical production.

Be one of the first to be ready to pass the FAA exam on day 1!INCLUDES L1 CERTIFIED COURSE CONTENTWhy Flying IQ?With our experience in the aviation training industry we are frequently asked if we are going to develop training in the exciting field of UAVs. Hence, L1 Cert and L2 Cert.We feel these courses provide pilots a greater sense of fun and a possible career path in the exciting and world-changing UAV industry. While drones can seem intimidating these courses provide any individual a low barrier to entry into this amazing world of drones. We are seeking backers to help provide us with funds to be able to develop robust, interactive, online, gamified drone training platforms.This certification platform is being aligned with the current FAA UAS regulations in mind that will be deployed in September 2015.As another reward opportunity we are providing access to our amazing and robust ground school course for manned aircraft. This opportunity is easily the cheapest and most accessible way to learn how to fly manned aircraft. This allows UAV operators to know the rules and regulations of the skies and will put them miles ahead of the competition. Not to mention ahead of the curve as more regulation will be imposed on UAVs in the future.We are expecting to finish our L1 Cert and L2 Cert courses and will have them available June 2015. The accompanying Flying IQ Private Pilot course will be available September/October 2015. With your backing, more possibilities for future specialty trainings and innovations in the UAV/UAS/Drone training world will become attainable.",One of the challenges is content acquisitions regarding the rules and regulations of the FAA. We are constantly contacting and checking what users of our program will need to know to be legally up to date with this fast evolving environment.Thanks for your investment!Team Flying IQ,https://www.kickstarter.com/projects/flyingiq/online-aerial-photography-course-by-flying-iq?ref=discovery_category_newest,flyingiq/online-aerial-photography-course-by-flying-iq,"Flying IQ is a provider of online specialty courses for aspiring and professional drone operators and aviation enthusiasts. Our Online Professional Aerial Photography Course is a career driven course that teaches the art of capturing the perfect shot from underneath a drone with master level skill.The Aerial Photography captured with the use of UAVs is changing the way we see the world and improving our ability to tell stories. Images that were previously only reserved to high-budget Hollywood films are now possible for all UAV photographers. However, at Flying IQ, we firmly believe that just because you have a camera and a drone, doesn’t mean you are an Aerial Photographer. We push your skills to a level that will distinguish your portfolio from the amateurs.The Online Professional Aerial Photography Course will be delivered and powered by Dynactive Software’s technology platform. Dynactive believes learning is more meaningful when it is fun and engaging. Dynactive uses a brain-based teaching methodology that works by maximizing learners engagement with over 20 interactivities, conversational writing style, and gamification. Through the use of games, the Online Professional Aerial Photography Course will help captivate and involve learners in a way that webinars, instructional videos, or classroom lecture don’t.As you journey through the course material, you’ll feel included in the refining process needed to mold you into a knowledgeable expert in the career of Aerial Photography.The expert behind all of our content is Dave Terry from Silverhawk Aerial Imaging. Dave has been flying model and full-scale aircraft since he was 9 years old. He earned his pilots certificate at 16. He has also been flying drones for years. He has the FAA 333 exemption to fly commercially and he has consulted for companies such as FLIR, GoPro, and 3D Robotics. He is a member of the AUVSI and Mountain West Unmanned Systems Alliance. Most notably, Dave has a working relationship with the Discovery Channel and has contributed as part of the team that gets breath-taking shots on Survivorman.Here is a great example of Dave's work at Snoqualmie Falls in Washington State in the USA.As you can see in the waterfall video above, amazing shots happen for those who hone their craft and carefully execute planned shoots.There are common errors that occur in aerial photography. The video below is an example of an aerial photography shoot that was very close to being great, but has a few mistakes.Flying IQ's Online Professional Aerial Photography Course teaches all the mistakes and pitfalls that happen with aerial photography, why they occur and what situations tend to cause these miscues.Flying IQ is an online aviation and drone pilot training source. This means the Online Professional Aerial Photography Course, will be delivered to backers via email once the project is complete. Backers will receiver login credentials and a username and password to login at FlyingIQ.com.Once logged in, the Online Professional Aerial Photography Course is available for the user! We anticipate that the course will take 10 hours to complete.","Since we’ve started this company, we’ve become experts in staying up-to-date with the changes in UAV regulation and technology. As these changes occur, Flying IQ is equipped to react and adjust our courses to reflect those changes as quickly as possible.With our Online Professional Aerial Photography Course, as with all of our drone courses, we’ve designed everything to be as user-friendly, stable and accessible for our customers. Naturally, there may be minor hurdles with the servicing of the courses. However, we can’t foresee anything that would jeopardize the project at hand. Our team is very experienced in the world of online education and are eager to bring the Online Aerial Photography Course to your computer screen."

The gallery will add a new flavor to Reno's art scene, as well as connect with our younger generation and, hopefully, inspire creativity. “Formal Proposal” My latest body of work will focus on post-societal naturalization, exploration, and discovery. All work will be created using digital painting and will be replicated, unframed, around 16” x 20”. The project will consist of eight-to-twelve pieces of artwork, each illustrating a different piece of music from Jim Guthrie’s “Sword and Sworcery LP – the Ballad of the Space Babies”. The collection will be presented in May alongside a performance with arrangements of the album.Not-quite-so-formal ProposalMy name is Bob Schuler and I'm an illustrator, conductor for the Reno Video Game Symphony, and general artist. I originally started this project for a class, but I soon realized that this could be an amazing endeavor and, given the right structure, I could really create something awesome here!The project is being worked on diligently, every day, and I will be providing literally (well, figuratively) constant updates on where I'm at on my Twitter, Facebook, and deviantART accounts, as well as right here on Kickstarter. If you're interested in backing this Kickstarter, I am very thankful! This project is occupying 100% of my time (not even school or work stops me from working) and I would love to see it reach so many more people than my close-knit circle here in Reno. I have arranged for quite a few rewards to be distributed by the following mantra: ""what would I want if I pledged this much?"" I think the results are pretty cool, so go ahead!What will these funds be used for?I have broken down the individual costs for this project. The funding provided by this Kickstarter will be used almost exclusively to print work. If I wind up with much more than I expected, then even more work will be printed, or more gallery showings will be opened up -- it all depends on you what you donate! I'd also love suggestions via Twitter, Facebook, etc. Video and music composed by myself, aside from that tasty drum set back-beat -- props are to Jay Larson for that. All artwork and photographs seen are my own. ""Sword and Sworcery"" and ""Sword and Sworcery LP: Ballad of the Space Babies"" are both trademarks of their respective owners. I do not lay claim to any music created by Jim Guthrie. ","There are few risks that are involved with this project:First, the scale is rather large (12 *full* pieces of artwork in three months comes out to about 4 hours of work a day (based on the amount of detail I am putting into each piece)). I am tackling this issue by renting out an office in my area to devote some weekdays to ""studio"" time. Not only this, but I am constantly sketching out ideas that translate very easily to the digital work whenever I'm away from my computer. Second, getting the work done on time can be a veritable foe. Again, I am surprised I've taken as much time as I have to type out everything here -- I could be working!! It's all about getting the work done, which is something I plan to do.",https://www.kickstarter.com/projects/1461611818/reno-video-game-symphonys-first-album?ref=discovery_category_newest,1461611818/reno-video-game-symphonys-first-album,"(Video coming soon!)Let's take a second to get to know each other. You're a fantastic human being or super-intelligent pet browsing Kickstarter while your humans are out shopping. You love to support talent. It's nice to meet you!We are the Reno Video Game Symphony. This program is a not-for-profit, soon-to-be-bonafide-Nonprofit that teaches music using video game scores and arrangements. We aren't just an orchestra -- we're an organization of enthusiastic musicians and video game fans that work together to brighten our community with a constant barrage of video game music performances (and much more!). Hey, while you're here, check out our Facebook page!...back? Ok, good, let's continue.We want you. We want everyone with a passion for music or games to join us, either in our audience or on our stage. We don't turn people away because of skill level, we don't charge our members a dime. Our ensembles are open to the schools and to the community. What are we doing: (untitled) Album Release!One of our Orchestra's goals (and season finishers) in 2014 was to show our musicians what it was like to be professionally recorded as an orchestra. With the wonderful, fabulous (wonderbulous?) help of Tom Gordon and the University of Nevada, Reno music engineering department, that became reality. That was really exciting!We rehearsed from the start of the Fall semester to the end and showcased our talent in October to prepare for this endeavor. But now what!? (other than finding a proper title...) There's a lot of work that goes in to building an album (and, oh boy, is there still work to be done!), from design and production to distribution and marketing. We would love to show everyone the dedication and love our musicians put in to create this music. What music, you ask?The Set List:(More audio clips to come!)•Opening (Super Smash Bros.

Bob SchulerThe following are unmastered audio clips:SwedenStickerbrush SymphonyThe Sinking CountryAnswersWhat is your money paying for?The goal we have chosen is very specific and includes the following costs:$91.00 Licensing costs for 7 songs$700.70 Royalties (for 1000 copies)$1,373.16 Digital distribution costs (for 1000 copies)$50 Physical distribution costs (we're shooting kinda low here!)+a little bit to cover the Kickstarter fees & Payment fees. The goal:We want to show you the beautiful music we worked to create. What happens if we make too much money?Let's start by first saying: we are strictly volunteer. No one in our organization receives any salary or commission. We've all put in our time and our own money to teach and create. So, if we get too much money, it'll go back into the organization to pay for more recording sessions (the Jazz Band kind of got stiffed last year, so they're next), stands and equipment (lookin' at you, Vibraphone of my dreams!), or performance costs (performance halls cost upwards of $4,000 to rent for the day - yeesh!). When we reach $5,000, we will be adding an additional album, courtesy of one of our smaller ensembles (Tomo Club) to every backer reward $25 and above, regardless of when you pledged. More details on this album will be announced soon. We would like to thank the following for their help with the Symphony program:Tom Gordon and the UNR Audio Engineering programThe University of Nevada, Reno for letting us rehearse weeklyAll of our wonderful musicians who put this together...and you, for checking us out and seeing what we're all about!Want to get involved with the Symphony?Visit our website to get ahold of us!","Our largest risk on this project is the reality of live sound and the mistakes that come with it. Being an educational, open-to-community, audition-less group, not all of our musicians are playing at Carnegie Hall (although one of them is!). When you listen to the raw, unmastered recordings embedded above, you'll be able to hear this magical reality yourself. However, this is also one of my favorite things -- the humanity behind real, live music!However, as far as producing an album is concerned, that's it! The recording is done! All that's left is mixing (to be done between February and March) and physical production (that's where you come in!)."

Other portions are earmarked for artists that will be drawing sticker designs & issues 5-6. Lastly printing the books themselves. When we're done we should have 40 copies of the Graphic Novel, and 100 copies of each issue #5 and #6.What IS the book about?“Sidereal Apogee” is a cyberpunk noir anthology book with a rotating Rogues Galleryconstituting the cast. It is set in the 25th century in a Solar System that is heavily colonized from themoon to Mars to the outer moons and to the deepest reaches of the Oort Cloud. Earth itself is scarcelypopulated in this age, because of centuries of disease and radiation –though about 20 major cities stillexist inside the confines of giant domes that shield them from the ruined atmosphere.Each issue contains two to three self standing stories, a bonus art content section and aletters page. The installments average 30-36 pages. The stories follow outlaws and bounty hunters in afuture that is ruled by corporations. These tales take place on the edge of society. In deep shadows ondistant asteroids. On the dirty floors of scummy barrooms in the colonies orbiting Jupiter and Saturn. Aconstant theme of these shorts is “Bad guys versus the really God awful types” and the bad guys don'talways win.Of the characters that will recur there is a band of scavengers in post-apocalyptic North Americaknown as The ScnG, there is Camille Dentrmont a cyborg rebel from the 23 rd century who has recentlybeen awoken from cryogenic imprisonment, there is former getaway driver and current holosoft knifefight champ Aurora Phlox, and Master Gunnery Sargent Satsuki Hitori is one of the top assassin/mercsin the system who works for the richest most powerful man alive: Randon Blackmoore. Their tales areinterwoven across the 2450s-60s. Some characters show up only for an issue. Some will be back often.One of the uncommon aspects of the series is what I call the “90% B&W format”. The book isdone mostly in Black & White/greyscale, with occasional punctuations of color. I am also seeking tomaximize use of CGI modeling when possible, additionally we often plug in actual public domainphotographs to enhance and make it weird artistically. As a result of the very nature of the stories andcharacters it is an adult book, with graphic nudity, violence, language and drug use at times. Not everystory contains all of these elements, but at the very least adult language is pretty constant.Thanks for your interest in my Indie Comic Book venture!!!","I have been putting a lot of my time and effort into this title for the last three years. The fact that I pay out of pocket from my fixed income has seen me literally be homeless for some months while making sure I still paid my art team to keep grinding out the first 4 issues. I work with an international team of artists located in Asia, Africa Hawaii & other locations. Sometimes it's hard to stay connected with such a varied team, but we have a private FB group where we confer and share design work.If I am not able to raise this money to push towards completion of issues 1-6 this summer, it is likely to be another 2 years to grind out the next 3 as I vie for a publisher that can afford to put our book out.Eitherway, I'll remain hard at work & dedicated to these tales!",https://www.kickstarter.com/projects/13thmoon/13th-moon-halloween-anthology?ref=discovery_category_newest,13thmoon/13th-moon-halloween-anthology,"Last year I was part of an Anthology project that funded here on Kickstarter, which gave me the confidence to put together a Halloween book for 2020. I have slowly accumulated 7 stories ranging from hellified to sci-fi that will shock and horrirfy. We have a diverse and talented team that hails from all over the globe that I am very proud of. We even have been fortunate enough to have had the Bram Stoker estate accept our ""Dracula: Lord of the Future"" story as actual Count Dracula cannon, thanks to our talented colorist/writer Chris McAuley!!This is absolutely an adult book, with graphic violence, and adult themes/language. There is a comedic horror story and several that are much more grim, making it a perfect Halloween Anthology purchase!A lot of people have worked very hard to get this volume ready for publication and I think you're going to be pleased with the end result. If we get the funding we need for this Volume, then expect #2 to be ready by October 2021!!The cover story was written, drawn & colored by Bayron Calderon, with script assistance & lettering done by Phoebe A. Xavier. It follows one of the Devil's daughters on her quest to break free from her cell in Hell and arise as a heavy metal guitar goddess on Earth. This one has both action & comedy with incredible art!""Inexorable"" is a tale of a thief who has crossed the wrong people at the absolute worst time. It was written by Vesa Vltlkalnen and drawn/colored by Juho Sivonen. They both hail from Finland! The story is a twisted one like many in this collection are.Both ""One Way Ticket"" and ""Patient Xero"" were done by the same creative teams: Phillip Butehorn as writer, Juan Manuel Almiron on Lineart, Chris McAuley as colorist and Phoebe A. Xavier on letters. The first is a tale of a demon and his host on a train destined for Hell. The other is a one page pandemic tale that hits very close to home in 2020.Written by Juan Bertazzi , drawn by Hernan Gonzalez & colored by Chris McAuley, ""The Damned"" is another quick story that packs a werewolf clawed punch. Hernan & Juan hail from Argentina, while Chris represents Ireland & Canada.Written and lettered by Phoebe A, Xavier, drawn by Renan Balmonte and colored by Chris McAuley, ""ESC POD"" is a karma slap sci-fi horror short.Our other sci fi horror short ""Dracula - Lord of the Future"" is the debut of a chapter in Dracula's epic that takes place far in the future, in a dystopian starscape. It is written and colored by Chris McAuley and drawn by the incredibly talented Collin Maxwell. This pair of Irishmen will continue the story in a one shot in the future!123GO!","At this point the book is 80% done , with mostly just some coloring and lettering to be done. Several of our artists did their lineart on the promise of pay from the Kickstarter, so about 50% of our cost is going towards paying our team, while the rest goes directly to the website's fee & publishing/shipping the books to you.I will pay my team out of pocket if I must but I really think there is an audience out there for this book."
https://www.kickstarter.com/projects/706219863/not-so-tiny-folding-house?ref=discovery_category_newest,706219863/not-so-tiny-folding-house,"What is it? A shipping container-sized unit that expands to a double-storey, 800 square foot house... with a garden in the roof! The design uses a set of bespoke brackets to simplify the construction for DIY assembly, with the rest of the structure comprised of structural timber and standard off-the-shelf materials and components to make it as affordable as possible. Why a folding tiny house? “I loved the idea of the tiny house lifestyle, and minimalism by necessity, but I wanted more living space. Also I wanted to design something that goes beyond a tiny house just being a smaller version of traditional housing – I wanted to be able to make water, grow food and recycle waste all under one roof – to provide a completely self-sufficient, mobile, off-grid solution.”Richard Perkin - Project founderSpace – there is enough space in the NoHA BiOS not to feel claustrophobic.  There are two rooms downstairs and two upstairs, each 20ft by 10ft (6m x 3m), with a ceiling height of 7ft (2.2m) downstairs and a ceiling height tapering from 8ft (2.4m) at the centre to 5ft (1.5m) at the eves.  There’s also an open plan kitchen and a simple bathroom with ample space – and these two areas provide a reasonable amount of storage for furniture and belongings when the structure is folded down for transport.   If living a mobile lifestyle, restrictions on storage space inspire a minimalist lifestyle, which was part of the intent of the design. Obviously there could be additional storage space afforded by a tow vehicle, but the point was to have a bigger tiny house with a feeling of space, rather than one that was filled with a whole lot of clutter! Mobility – if you don't like the idea of being tied to one place, put it on the back of a truck and go somewhere new whenever you like... this is one aspect of tiny houses that has made them so popular.Affordability – be that for a primary residence, a secondary suite on an existing property, a holiday house or an office. While zoning laws and building codes may prohibit one or more of these uses in some areas, growing interest in the tiny house movement has meant increased support for the revision of these laws to accommodate the changing social and economic landscape. After all, not everybody has the means or desire to live in traditional housing these days. The cost of the NoHA BiOS (without any internal systems/finishes) is around US$20,000 based on a DIY build… pretty affordable compared to traditional housing of a similar size! Low-impact living – sure, there might not be flushing toilets and unlimited water and electricity, but a lot of utilities are needlessly wasted in traditional housing and urban lifestyles. It is surprising just how little energy and water is actually needed to maintain a good standard of living when you become aware of what you are using and how to use it efficiently. Solar power systems are increasingly affordable, and one of the goals for the project is to design a solar-powered water generator that condenses water vapour from the air just about anywhere, to provide the option of being completely independent. Presently there is also a vast amount of food wastage across the world, let alone the energy wasted in producing, storing and transporting that food. Growing most or all of your own fruit and vegetables means getting the freshest produce and knowing where it's come from, while also encouraging less wastage. The vision for the NoHA BiOS is to design a growing system for the roof of the house that can provide fruit, vegetables and herbs for a family of four, all year round. Sustainability and independence – To be able to make water from thin air (anywhere that there's sunshine), to be able to grow your own food where you live and to recycle all your waste and water... now that would be a truly sustainable and indepedent way of life. Realistically, how much longer can existing infrastructure and systems support increasingly resource-intensive urban ways of living? If there’s going to be much of a planet left for future generations, lifestyles will need to change to become less about consumption and convenience, and more about efficiency and necessity. What’s behind it? One mechanical engineer, a dream, two years’ of design and simulation work, and three months of hard labour to build the prototype.Why pledge now? I’ve spent pretty much all of my personal savings on designing and building the prototype.  I need additional funding to finish cladding the structure, and for components and materials to complete the kitchen, bathroom and rooftop garden. The funding target reflects the minimum amount I need to finish the house, and to produce the necessary documentation for the plans and assembly instructions (otherwise I’ll have to go back to work, and then I won’t have the necessary time available).  If the target is exceeded, then any additional funds will be used for further development of the design of the structure and the interior systems, with a view to making these designs available (for DIY) for a nominal charge, or bringing them to market as products in the most affordable way possible.  Initially, this could mean building a second prototype – a “production unit” – which will incorporate design improvements that were identified during the construction of the first prototype, in order to make the structure lighter, easier to assemble and more affordable. Based on people’s feedback, the design for a second prototype might be reduced in size to a standard shipping container height (rather than the “hi-cube” format used for the first prototype, which is a foot taller than a standard shipping container). I welcome any and all feedback and suggestions, which can be submitted through the website – www.noha.lifeProduction timeline Though I’ll endeavour to ship the physical rewards (beaded keyring, illustration print, desk tidy) earlier than the September 2017 date specified, I have allowed this leeway because I will be the one coordinating their production and shipping, and during the first half of the year I will be very busy completing the shell and interior of the prototype, as well as preparing the documentation for the plan and assembly instruction set.  So the delivery for the physical rewards could be as early as April 2017, but I will post updates here and on the website (www.noha.life) to keep backers informed of progress. The production of documentation for the plan and assembly instruction set is already underway, as some of the material has been produced in the process of designing and building the prototype.  However, getting the documentation into a complete, clear and concise specification – with all the information necessary for a DIY build - will require a significant number of man-hours. I have a lot of experience producing specifications in my work as a professional engineer, so I am well placed to assess the work involved and the amount of time required to finish the documentation package. I feel a delivery date of September 2017 will give me sufficient time to produce a high quality plan and assembly instruction set. Check out the full story and follow the progress at www.noha.life!","With the prototype already working mechanically according to design, there is no real risk with regard to proving functionality.  At this stage, the only risks that can be identified in the development going forward are:– Weather sealing interfaces between panelsThis should be quite easy to complete, so can be considered a low risk. The roof and side panels overlap each other so that rain will run off, but the roof panels for the rooftop garden will need a flexible flashing strip installed around the perimeter to direct rainwater away from the top frame.  Similarly, the mating surfaces between all the gable end panels will need gasket material applied to make the joints weatherproof.  Gaps bewteen the upper gable end panels/windows  and the upper central frame (you can see these in the photos) will also need to be closed with rigid or canvas filler panels. –  Air tightnessThis is important for the thermal performance of the structure, though initially less critical than weatherproofing. There are openings at floor level to allow for passive cooling in hot weather, so these will need flaps fitted to seal the space in colder weather. This should be a straightforward element to complete, so is seen as low risk.– Structural strength At this stage, the strength of the design has been assessed for a wind speed of 60mph (100 km/h) and has a good factor of safety.  Some modelling has been carried out up to wind speeds of 100mph (160km/h), but additional work is required to properly assess the behaviour of the structure under these loads.  While there are construction standards for traditional mobile homes, there are currently no such standards for tiny houses - only guidelines.  One such guideline for tiny houses is conformity to ASCE/SEI7–10 (Minimum Design Loads for Buildings and Other Structures), which recommends the structure be designed and built to withstand a wind speed of 130mph (210km/h), in addition to other combinations of applied loads.  Due to the geometry of the design, increasing the strength of the structure can not easily be acheived by increasing the thickness of the structural members - this would require a complete redesign of the folding geometry, and would reduce the space available for essential services in the centre of the structure (bathroom, kitchen rooftop garden etc.).  For this reason, the only practical measures, in order of preference, are:- Stating a limit of usage on the structure for a wind speed of 60mph (100km/h) or whatever the maximum safe wind speed is finally determined to be, preferably through practical testing of a prototype or production structure.- Using stronger materials for structural members. However, using materials like steel would likely make the structure too heavy to be easily transportable (towable), and using lighter materials such as titanium would increase the cost of the structure significantly.- Reducing the size of the structure.  For instance, changing the form factor to standard ISO container dimensions (rather than using the ""hi-cube"" dimensions used for the prototype) could be done quite simply, and would reduce the area of all panels, thereby reducing the forces on the structure for a given wind speed, as well as reducing bending stresses in the panels (due to shorter structural members).While it is desirable to certify the structure for as high a wind speed (and combined inner loading) as is possible, initially the approach will be to set a cautious limit on the structure - say 60mph (100km/h).  This means that there will be no immediate risk to the delivery of the plan and instruction set as part of this kickstarter.  With further development, modelling and prototype testing, it should be possible to increase the safe usage limits in future.",https://www.kickstarter.com/projects/706219863/usb-wrong-usbrite-a-tool-to-fix-loose-usb-connecti?ref=discovery_category_newest,706219863/usb-wrong-usbrite-a-tool-to-fix-loose-usb-connecti,"Every device with a USB socket ends up with the same problem… after inserting and removing USB plugs hundreds or thousands of times, the socket becomes loose, making the connection unreliable. This can be infuriating when you’re right in the middle of doing something and drives disconnect, apps crash, or peripherals stop working.  This problem had bugged me long enough that I had to design a tool to fix it.USB has been around for more than 20 years, and while there are newer connectors coming to market, the original USB-A connector is the most common and is still being fitted to most of the latest laptops and workstations. It’s also still used ubiquitously for all manner of devices, peripherals and interfaces. USBRite is designed to slide into a USB plug and punch out a raised profile that closes the gap between the plug and a loose socket. The tool can be used on one or both sides of the USB plug depending on how loose your sockets are. And that’s it… plain and simple.End the irritation of having your USB devices disconnecting or falling out.•	USBRite is constructed completely from stainless steel, making it recyclable, durable and rust-free for life.•	The patent-pending design has been optimised so that the punched USB plug fits firmly into any socket old or new, but is not too tight or difficult to insert.•	The tubular handles make gripping the tool comfortable, and the handles are long enough to allow the tool to be operated without needing to squeeze too hard.•	USBRite has been designed with a limited opening width to stop any little fingers getting into the punch accidentallyEnd your USB misery with USBRite (or put someone else out of their misery…makes a great gift!)( P.S...All parts are fused together using a TIG spot-welding process, and this can result in weld spots showing some colourful discolouration, as can be seen in the photos. In some cases the finished product may have such discolorations, though it does compliment the industrial design look! )","No risks, no challenges... this is a low-tech solution to a low-tech problem. The price of the laser-cut parts reaches its minimum at quantities greater than 350 units, so that’s what’s determined the price per unit and the funding goal."

https://www.kickstarter.com/projects/950053754/interalia?ref=discovery_category_newest,950053754/interalia,"Hi,I’m Richard Bright. I’m the Founder and Director of The Interalia Centre and I’d like to tell you about an exciting new project I’m involved in, and would love you to be involved as well.First, a little bit about The Interalia Centre.After studying art and physics I formed The Interalia Centre in 1990 to provide an international forum for the exchange of ideas, exploring the relationships between the arts and the sciences, regarding each as an open and systematic inquiry into the deep structure of human consciousness and experience. Its aims are based on the belief that far from being mutually exclusive activities, they represent different yet complimentary ways of looking at and understanding ourselves and the world.Since it began, through innovative events, The Interalia Centre has successfully established a dialogue between art and science at a level accessible to all. By bringing together recognised experts in the fields of art and science, to address a common theme in front of wide ranging audiences, Interalia has exemplified that a greater understanding and awareness can be created by crossing the boundaries between the Arts and Sciences.Those involved in The Interalia Centre’s events have included James Turrell, Antony Gormley, John D Barrow, Ilya Prigogine, Liliane Lijn, Martin Kemp, Brian Cox, Steven Rose, Alan Davie, Satish Kumar, Helen Storey, Richard Gregory, Andrew Miller, Lindsay Clarke, Mary Midgley, Brian Goodwin, Anish Kapoor, Leroy Little Bear, Andy Goldsworthy, Danah Zohar, F David Peat, Sarah Bohm, Basil Hiley, Max Velmans, Ansuman Biswas, Sacha Abercorn, Colin Tudge, Nicholas Humphrey – and many more.(More information on the work of The Interalia Centre can be found at www.interaliacentre.org)And so, after many years of exploring the interactions between the arts and sciences we now feel it’s time to widen the scope of our journey and I am inviting you to join us.We are planning to launch the INTERALIA magazine in March 2014, the first issue being on theme of Celebrating the Imagination.‘The imagination is an instrument of liberation, one to which we all have access and which serves to celebrate and enlarge our common humanity’ Lindsay ClarkeINTERALIA – the MagazineI was delighted tohear from Richard Bright, Interalia's creator, that this inspirationalorganisation plans to launch a monthly magazine.My admiration forInteralia's motivation and activities has been unceasing since my earlyinvolvement in its Edinburgh Interactive Event on the theme of 'Space -Inner and Outer'.The INTERALIA magazinewill be a joy, allowing much more continuous contact with like-minded folk inthe wonderful space of arts/science/philosophy dimensions than Interalia eventsalone permit.ProfessorJohn Brown (Astronomer Royal for Scotland)Consistent with The Interalia Centre’s aims the INTERALIA Magazine will offer knowledge and inspiration from the world's most exciting thinkers to a community of the curious to engage with ideas and each other.An important aspect of the magazine will be to foster new ideas from around the world and promote further discussion.Ideas make a difference. It is the power of ideas that change attitudes, lives and the world. People who put ideas into action can inspire the rest of us to go and do the same. More importantly, WE will ask questions.We will look for contributions from people whose creative and imaginative thinking and work has expanded, and invites us to further expand, our notion of who and what we are.The magazine will be MONTHLY, with 2 levels of access - part free content with full content by subscription. Subscription will be based on making the magazine accessible for a general readership without trivialising its content.For this Kickstarter campaign we are offering an annual subscription of £30 (normal annual subscription will be £40) plus a reduced price 3 year subscription and the chance to become a Sponsor and Patron with your name listed on the INTERALIA magazine website.Each issue will be focused on a particular theme. Proposed themes to be covered during the first year include –Celebrating the Imagination;Transition – Towards an Ecozoic Era;Time, Space and Scale; Complexity, Emergence and Information;Identity and the Self; Celebrating the Rational ; Alchemy and Metaphor; Contemplating Inner and Outer Space; Visions of Light;Naturally Creative?; Mirror and Shadow; Intuitive Rational Thinking;Fashion. Science. Future.Future themes will evolve as further inquiry and discussions are created. There will also be opportunities for invited ‘guest editors’ to take over an issue theme (with suggestions for themes welcomed from subscribers).""The very title – art/science/consciousness magazine – awakens my appetite.Never has there been a time when it has been more necessary to take us all outof our cognitive silos.

Author of Colliding Worlds: How Cutting-Edge Science is Redefining Contemporary Art.)With 25 years experience of exploring the interactions between the Arts and Sciences, The Interalia Centre launchedINTERALIA MAGAZINE in 2014.INTERALIA MAGAZINE is a unique, online publication, dedicated to exploring the interactions between the Arts, Sciences and Consciousness. We look for contributions from people whose creative and imaginative thinking and work has expanded, and invites us to further expand, our notion of who and what we are.INTERALIA MAGAZINE offers knowledge and inspiration from the world's most exciting thinkers to a community of the curious. An important aspect of the magazine is to foster new ideas from around the world and promote further discussion.Ideas make a difference. It is the power of ideas that change attitudes, lives and the world. People who put ideas into action can inspire the rest of us to go and do the same.The magazine is MONTHLY, with 2 levels of access - part free content with full content by subscription. Subscription is based on making the magazine accessible for a general readership without trivialising its content.Within theINTERALIA MAGAZINE you will find -·Articles; Interviews; Audio and video content; Blog; Library of contributors publications; Generation Next (specifically for 'young thinkers'); and a Free Email Newsletter.EMERGING IDEASInteralia Magazine is the new terrain for disrupting many of the silos between art, science and consciousness. The new Emerging Ideas section will not only broaden our understanding of the world, it will move towards transforming it. -Elaine Whittaker (Artist)The aim of this new section is to showcase the work and ideas of emerging artists, photographers, scientists, and writerswho explore the interactions between the Arts, Sciences and Consciousness.Emerging Ideas supports those who are the principal creators of new work, and:•	who take risks and embrace challenges. •	whose developing voices reveal significant potential.•	who are rigorous in their approach to creation and production.Contribution options will be –•	Up to 5 images or 1 video + artist statement (100 words max) + website link•	Article – fiction or non-fiction (500 word max) + contact/web linkA further option will be that a selection of Emerging Ideas contributions will be regularly drawn upon for full article or interview in the main magazine.Emerging Ideas will be FREE to access for readers of the INTERALIA MAGAZINE.My personal involvement in Interalia magazine is one of the most exciting journeys I've ever started. It is an opportunity to express my thoughts and broaden my thinking by accessing other's ideas. I hope to one day go into science writing as a career, and report on the absolute precipice of understanding; the experience I gain by helping such a magazine is invaluable. - Fynn McLennan (student)Interalia Magazine is a vital source of information about the rapidly changing discourse between the arts and natural sciences. Whether one’s interest is in brain research, consciousness studies, or developments in transdisciplinary practice and research, Interalia Magazine provides a unique platform for artists, scientists, writers and thinkers to discover and explore the cooperation and conflicts between disciplines that are too often portrayed as resting comfortably at opposing poles. For those emerging artists who are deeply engaged with the unique dialectic between art, philosophy, and science, this new section would be a welcome addition to a publication already bursting with some of the most fascinating and pressing interrogations of our time. - Jared Vaughan Davis (artist, MA Art and Science at Central Saint Martins College of Art and Design)PREVIOUS CONTRIBUTORS TO THE INTERALIA MAGAZINEThe first year of the magazineinvolved contributions from the world’s leading artists, scientists, philosophers and writers, together with a rapidly growing global readership.

One might assume the Interalia Magazine is just one more example, but Editor Richard Bright was at the forefront of this trend. The Interalia Magazine, with its sophisticated, wide-ranging treatment of topics from poetry to neurology to changing society is leading the way, and expanding minds in the process.Jacquelynn Baas (Author and co-founder of the arts consortium, Awake: Art, Buddhism, and the Dimensions of Consciousness)Most people agree that new insights into reality and the human condition come from two cultural sources – from hard disciplinary work and from the inspirations of inter-disciplinary thinking. Interalia Magazine fills out the latter role by creating an inspiring venue for a network-based thinking. It’s all about reaping from the insights of cutting-edge established thinkers, and it’s all about weaving together the works of scientists, philosophers, artists, and others into a vibrant open-minded think-tank. Read it – and be enlivened!Niels Henrik Gregersen (Professor of Systematic Theology, University of Copenhagen)I am pleased to write on behalf of Interalia Magazine. I have had the good fortune to be represented in their publication, and its aims are high and important to us all.Professor Stuart Kauffman FRSC (medical doctor, theoretical biologist, and complex systems researcher)The Interalia Magazine is for anyone who is interested in the cross-disciplinary nature of art and science. Contributions come from scientific academicians and researchers, practicing artists and others. You never know quite what you are going to get, but it's always going to be provocative, fascinating and off the beaten track.Maureen McQuillan (Artist)I believe that the Interalia Magazine is an important voice in our rapidly changing intellectual and social landscape.Dr Seán Ó Nualláin (Author of a book on the foundations of Cognitive Science: ""The Search for Mind"" and ""Being Human: the Search for Order"")The proposed ""Emerging Ideas"" section of Interalia sounds like a fantastic initiative to provide a forum for new ideas and to spread the word about exciting new work in the field of art and science. Interalia Magazine is a great publication and seems to be going from strength to strength. I look forward to seeing more!Anna Dumitriu (Artist)I can strongly recommend Interalia Magazine. Richard Bright has created an excellent vehicle for exploring the interconnections between science and the arts, as well as reflecting on the nature of consciousness. The magazine's contributors are leaders in their fields.F David Peat (Physicist and Author. Director of the Pari Center for New Learning. Books include Science, Order and Creativity (with David Bohm) and Blackfoot Physics: A Journey into the Native AmericanWorldview) In a time of accelerating change, an online magazine opening up imaginative exchanges on such fundamental issues as those proposed by the Interalia Centre will provide a vital service to the evolution of human consciousness – an evolution on which the decent survival of our species and the wider welfare of the planet may ultimately depend.Lindsay Clarke (Author. Winner of the Whitbread Prize for Fiction – The Chymical Wedding.)Interalia magazine is an apt and timely development. More than ever we need to explore our relationship with reality through both science and art, without artificial boundaries.In order to understand the human condition we must study not only through empiricism but also through the products of our imaginations.Interalia is a valuable platform for these important explorations and I wish the magazine every success.Peter Randall-Page (Artist)The very title – art/science/consciousness magazine – awakens my appetite. Never has there been a time when it has been more necessary to take us all out of our cognitive silos. The Interalia Centre and its magazine does just that.Raymond Tallis (Philosopher, cultural critic, poet, novelist and a retired medical physician and clinical neuroscientist)","Publishing a new magazine is both a challenging and rewarding experience for writers and readers alike. Although the first year of the INTERALIA MAGAZINE has been a great success, involving contributions from the world’s leading artists, scientists, philosophers and writers, together with a rapidly growing readership, we are fully aware of the challenges that face the continuation of the publication.  The challenge for myself as editor is to continue to set the tone and voice of the INTERALIA MAGAZINE, and to present the work of others in a way that fosters an intimacy between contributor and reader.I've been working at the intersection of the Arts and Sciences for over two decades and have a huge network of people who can help. People involved with the INTERALIA MAGAZINE are all experts in their fields. We have been building up a team of dedicated people who we can draw on for help.

That if the hurt is bad enough, the hero willbreak. They’re wrong. That’s just what makes a hero. They’re the ones who takethe pain. Stand in the gap. Take on more hurt than they deserve and then takeon others pain as well. ~ Uncle CagneyWhat is A Hero’s Curse:The shortanswer: It's the first of a trilogy of fantasy middle-school books in The Unseen Chronicles.From www.psbroaddus.com/a-heros-curse/:For nearly ten years a strangedrought has consumed the Kingdom of Mar. Essie, her sarcastic cat Tig and hersecretive family are struggling to survive on their small farm nestled againstthe forbidding cliffs of the Valley of Fire when a rebellionagainst the cruel interim ruler is sparked.Forced to fleefor their lives Essie and Tig lose themselves in the twisting labyrinth of theancient lava flow. But the Valley of Fire is known to bethe home of cunning rock basilisks and packs of hungry arcus vultures. Thereare even rumors of deep caverns where arcane evil lives.When Essiefinds proof that the missing King Mactogonii may be alive, she must find thecourage to help locate him. However, this is no easy choice. Essie is blind.She hasn’t seen blue, or watched a rock basilisk hunt and has never run. Tosave her family and even the kingdom she must face the greatest challenge ofher life.Why I need your help:You might be thinking Essieand Tig's story is just another YA fantasy tale: a scrappy heroine, a feistysidekick, a dangerous quest, a risky rescue. And you would be right—and wrong.In one way, this is “just” another adventure story. Like Suzanne Collin’sGregor theOverlanderseries, it’s thestory of a reluctant hero (this time a girl) assuming the role of a hero.Similar to Brandon Mull’sFablehaven, it’s a humorous adventure with colorfulcharacters.Butit’s not just another fantasy story.It’s an adventure tale of a girl who doesn’t let her blindnessslow her down. It’s a fun filled and magical book with snappy lines and asarcastic cat.It bucks the genre norm witha female protagonist who is blind, but doesn't let that get in the way ofadventure. There are no wimpy girls in need of a rescue here. Just strongcharacters, real pain and challenge: a challenge to be a hero in spite of loss.I have beenwriting for several years now. I recently had a piece published in LodestoneJournal, which you can find here. I am working on aMaster’s degree in Digital Storytelling and will be attending Sundance FilmFestival in January. I finished A Hero'sCurse in 2013 and started querying agents. Since that time, I've received someinterest and several positive comments from agents. A big part of the queryingprocess in traditional publication is attending writer’s conferences. I havenever had the opportunity to pitch AHero's Curse at a writer's conference—until now.Next month is the NC Writer'sNetwork’s Fall 2014 Writer's Conference. This is where you come in.With your help, I can attend the conference, pitch themanuscript and getfeedback from an editor or agent with a leading publisher or literary agency.We are workingto see that the contacts, networking and exposure generated at the conferencewill lead to publication—a physical book in your hands, and your kid's hands.A unique intersection of opportunity, talent andsupport:This conference representsthe opportunity that A Hero's Curse hasbeen waiting for. It is an excellent story that is both encouraging andchallenging for middle school readers. I have been working on A Hero's Curse for over five years now,and have vetted it with an editor, a coherence/story structure critic, and amnow working through the manuscript again with a large and diverse writinggroup, chapter by chapter, week by week. You represent the support.Without you, this never happens. The pitch gets made, but impersonally, withthousands of other pitches over email. The story is told, but not distributedto the hundreds of middle school kids who struggle with pain, who want to be ahero but don't know how. Withoutyou, we have fewer heroes in the world.Budget:•$350 (full conference three dayconference – no hotel)•$160 for Manuscript Mart•$150 for Critique Service•$100 travel to and from Charlotte, NC(Friday, Saturday, Sunday)•$100 print manuscripts for conference•$86 Fees to Kickstarter and Amazon= $946Stretch Goals$1500 - Additional artworkWe will commission two pieces of additional artwork that capture either a crucial moment or the spirit of A Hero's Curse. Those that meet the Kingdom Protector pledge will receive the additional original artwork as desktop backgrounds.","Given the nature of traditional publishing, we cannot guarantee that the story will be published with a traditional publishing house. We feel we have done the hard work to give this story the best chance possible. We have put in countless hours of marketing work and research. We have kept the budget trim to minimize the risk to investors. And we have ensured that the rewards, for the most part, are readily available whether or not A Hero’s Curse is picked up by a traditional publisher at the conference.Given that there are so many different rewards and add-ons available in this campaign, there is always a risk of delays. But we will take every precaution to avoid those risks.",https://www.kickstarter.com/projects/341899667/nightrage-rising-a-fantastical-mystery-for-young-r?ref=discovery_category_newest,341899667/nightrage-rising-a-fantastical-mystery-for-young-r,"Our publishing team has worked hard to get here, because we believe stories can do more than describe the world that is.Story can show us what could be.When I think of daring and imaginative, I'm not thinking of vampires or zombies or angsty love triangles or whatever the latest trend happens to be. I'm thinking of something different altogether. Something that makes a difference. Something that challenges the status quo. That doesn't always mean flying ships or even talking cats (although, to be fair, talking cats are pretty awesome).I believe good stories inspire hope in the face of darkness. I'm thinking about the way story can reflect the good, the true, and the beautiful, making it easier to find in our own lives.Now that's daring and imaginative.We're here because we think you believe the same thing. That stories are meant to show more than what is. They show us what could be.Nightrage Rising is a street-level fantasy-adventure novel with a healthy splash of Nancy Drewish mystery—mixed with a dollop of wit and snark. It is a fast paced, first-person, present-tense story of a girl discovering self-worth, courage and friendship in the face of an unstable kingdom, magical inequality, and a dangerous, seductive cult. If you grab a copy off the shelf and flip to the back cover, here's what you'll find:""Essie Brightsday is blind. But that hasn’t kept her from curses, dragons, or rock basilisks in the past. Now her family lives in the bustling capital of Plen, a far cry from their small farm tucked against the Valley of Fire. Little does she know that a secretive cult is growing in the city, guaranteeing this adventure will be just as eventful as the last…""Nightrage Rising is the sequel to A Hero's Curse, but was written to stand on its own. If you missed the first book, don't worry, you can still jump in, right now. (You can find out more about a A Hero's Curse here).Nightrage Rising is about 76,000 words, similar to the word count for Harry Potter and the Sorcerer's Stone. It's perfect for kids between 7-13 years old, but as C.S. Lewis said, ""A children's story that can only be enjoyed by children is not a good children's story in the slightest.""Nightrage Rising is complete and ready to print. By picking your favorite reward level, you not only get the signed book and other fantastic awesomeness, you make the story better for others too.Kickstarter is a special place. By setting up pre-orders here, I can sign copies, include illustration, write notes to backers, and be personally involved. And by being involved at every stage, from printing to packing, you get more.Here on Kickstarter we're providing an exclusive, ""Hero's Edition"" of Nightrage Rising.(A Hero's Curse will be an exclusive ""Hero's Edition"" if ordered here on Kickstarter as well). The book is a slightly larger one, with a heavy cream paper of a quality that Amazon simply can't match. To mark these stories as different, Tig has put his paw print on the front of each one.On top of the quality mentioned above, every book comes across my writing desk. I sign each one, and we carefully wrap and package the rewards to ship to you. I always ask who you want your copy signed to.That said, you could wait and get Nightrage Rising on Amazon sometime in December. The price will probably be around the same as A Hero's Curse: $12.68, or about $18.86 with shipping. (I don't have final say over that price). If you have a free shipping option, that may be your preferred method.But here on Kickstarter we're offering something special ~ something more. And not only are you getting more as a backer, you're advancing the story for others! Making it better for others! And maybe, a reader somewhere will be inspired by what could be.Us too! That's why we're doing a couple of special things with this story. First, check out our cool map below. I don't know anybody who doesn't like a map to go with an adventure. Second, we're running a contest this year to involve more artists! If you're an artist, or know an artist who would want to do a sketch, let them know! There are great rewards and riches to be had for the finalists.I loved the older books in the house growing up - the ones that had sketches in every chapter. Tom Sawyer, Treasure Island, Alice in Wonderland, and a copy of Greek myths were favorites because they had so many! Newer books today rarely have those sketches of old. Publishers often have to weigh cost and return and decide that most stories can't be illustrated. That's one of the unique advantages of being on Kickstarter. It is about creating something you love. Something your kids will love. A story you can pick up and flip through, just to look and wonder and laugh.The neat thing is, by choosing a reward level you join the team and help bring this compelling and beautiful story to life. So put your name in here too!It is hard to mention all the people who have worked hard to breathe life into this project. My local writer's group has heard and encouraged Nightrage Rising, a few pages at a time, one Friday at a time. My fellow SCBWI members have poured over the story into the late hours at our regional conference.Our editor, Brittainy Anderson, has a fantastic eye and has dedicated hours to the manuscript, polishing and refining.Our illustrator, Danny Kundzinsh, has a passion for the story and brings years of experience working on games, comics and magazine illustration. He is currently the lead illustrator and comic artist for the SOS Children's Safety Magazine. We love the way he is bringing the characters to life.Nova Nightingale is a brilliant audio narrator and the voice of Essie in all of our promotionals. Elizabeth Phillips did a fantastic job narrating A Hero's Curse audiobook. (If you haven't heard her, please check out her voice on Audible). Leah Ervin lent us her talent and ability to capture Essie in our promo video.And then there's me, Parker. I've been writing for a while now and I'm passionate about the art of storycraft. You can read more about me under the ""About"" tab here on Kickstarter, or on my website.I love working with a young audience, helping them to recognize their own strengths. In a big way, this story is an extension of that same passion: it encourages us to work through our own strengths and weaknesses so we can be a hero for someone else.  Any extra money pledged goes directly into the manuscript, instilling added awesomeness for everyone. Check it out:Elizabeth Phillips, our fantastic voice artist and narrator of A Hero's Curse has worked around a new toddler to record Chapter One of Nightrage Rising, for you. (I love that you Kickstarter backers helped pick Elizabeth out of a talented crowd).Please like us on Facebook or follow us on Twitter or visit our website where you can subscribe and find more of the story! #aheroscurse #nightragerising #unseenchronicles","The novel is complete, so the risks are relatively low.We want to make this book extra special. Not just another novel, but a friend that's a part of your family. We want every word and witty line and illustration and sketch to be enjoyed and shared. A book that you would read with your kids, share for years to come, and read again to your grandkids.With your help, we can finish this in style and amazingness. And we can give that story of hope and courage to others.Of course, acts of God or mistakes could delay our printing and delivery schedule, and we will keep Kickstarter backers updated if we do encounter any delays."

These items play with the fetishization of the artist and all that she touches.Sherry has performed throughout the US and Europe, in galleries and theaters, and the Sherry Truck will be a new platform to enable more direct interaction with her audience.The “Sherry truck” will be an eco-friendly mobile performance space hosted by my character, Sherry. It will be converted from a used bread or ice cream truck and run on bio diesel and solar power. The truck will be versatile performance space and a working coffee truck.Phase 1 - Truck Baby: Goal $13,000We are raising $13000 to purchase the truck, get it ready for action, and get it out on the street. We will need to get the truck mechanically sound (tune-up, repairs, etc..) and we will need to renovate the interior of the truck to Sherry's specifications. We also need to purchase a truck fridge, latte machine, and Sherapy couch.Phase 2 - Eco Boost: Goal $25,000We would like the truck to be Carbon-Neutral and self sufficient. We would like to install solar panels on the roof and a generator to power the latte machine, fridge, lights, sound system, etc of the truck. We would also like to convert the truck to run on bio-diesel. These upgrades will cost an additional $12000.Phase 3 - Sherry Dream Truck: Goal $50,000This will be the full realization of Sherry's dream: an eco-friendlyvendingtruck that includes a carefully designed hand crafted interior for optimal Sherapy and Sher-cut conditions, a Sherry Lounge on the roof (including baby pool/skylight, bubble gum machine and small herb garden), and expansion of merchandise.Phase 4 - Transcontinental Sherry: $100,000We make a twin truck, that will reside in Europe, and facilitate our travels through Europe, Africa, and Asia. The original truck will travel to Europe on a limited basis, because it needs to be sent in a shipping container. Two trucks = more time for Sherry Truck on the road = Sherry lattes and Sherapy sessions.Phase 5 - Sherry on the Moon: $10,000,000Sherry Truck gets converted to Sherry Space Truck.

We will present and installation and series of performances.We are creating an installation centered around a food truck that offers coffee, cake, and performative therapy.The centerpiece of the installation will be the Sherry Truck. This is a mobile sculpture and performance platform that offers an always changing and incongruous array of merchandise, such as pink lattes, cakes, t-shirts, high heels, ""therapy"" sessions, doll lamps, and sculptures from Sherry's life. These items play with the fetishization of the artist and all that she touches, and the mobile sculpture/performance platform provide a way to connect with new and different audiences.Sherry has performed throughout the US and Europe, in galleries and theaters, and the Sherry Truck will be a new platform to enable more direct interaction with her audience.The “Sherry truck” will be an eco-friendly mobile performance space hosted by my character, Sherry.

https://www.kickstarter.com/projects/gorenoir/gore-noir-magazine-horror-without-the-hollywood?ref=discovery_category_newest,gorenoir/gore-noir-magazine-horror-without-the-hollywood,"Gore Noir Magazine is a quarterly (eventually monthly) print magazine that sprung from the imagination of a horror fan aimed at creating new horror fans. We here at GN magazine are not some corporate entity looking to leach off of the horror culture. We are looking to make horror more vibrant and show people all the awesome work that is coming out of artists, tattooists, models, musicians, etc. Our overall goal is to create new horror content for you to feast your eyes on, not to ""review"" movies that all the other magazines are already reviewing.. THAT'S BORING! I'd much rather see a celebrity I didn't know was a horror fan in a nice refreshing horror shoot with an interview to go along with it than I would like to see another horror movie review.As we gain more exposure and our budget increases we will be able to expand and show people that horror isn't just for fan boys. It's a normal human impulse and we aren't a bunch of crazy looking satanists. We are artists looking to explore what it means to be human.Why a print magazine?While we plan to launch a digital download version of our magazines soon, print magazines are our lifeblood. You can bring it with you where ever you go and it won't vanish if your hard drive crashes. You can put it out on your coffee table for others to enjoy. You can tear the pages out and frame your favorite images. It's just more tactile than anything else.When are you launching?We've already launched our first issue and it's available on www.gorenoir.com. With print magazines the cost of printing and the amount of issues it takes to get distribution is high. Our first issue was self funded with help from friends and was not distributed. We have a distribution company interested we just need the money to produce the amount of copies necessary.Why should I fund you?Gore Noir Magazine would like to be available at newstands, book stores, and convenience stores around the world. In order to bring people a high quality product we need funding to cover the costs of making such a product.What will you do with the $6,000? While we hope that the funding will go above $6,000 dollars the goal of $6k will cover our printing costs to produce the minimum amount of magazines it takes to get our issues into distribution. Along with distribution we'd like to advertise our magazine which realistically would cost quite a bit if it weren't for the availability of easy advertising on the internet and through word of mouth from our growing fan base who is excited to see where our magazine will go.Should I keep funding you after you meet your goal?Of course! While $6,000 is the minimum amount we need to get our magazine out there, it's going to take more than that to get the kind of exposure we really need to make Gore Noir a success! We all want to succeed and be a part of something that becomes great. This is your chance to possibly be at that first Rolling Stones or Jimi Hendrix gig and to be able to say ""I was part of making that magazine what it is today!""",,https://www.kickstarter.com/projects/gorenoir/gore-noir-magazine?ref=discovery_category_newest,gorenoir/gore-noir-magazine,"WE LOVE YOU! Thanks for taking the time to visit our ghoulish Kickstarter page! All businesses need to be funded in one manner or another right?

Who knows your friend could be the one that decides to plop down the money to tattoo anything they want on my skin. YES! I'm surrendering my own FLESH and BLOOD for this magazine! That's how much I've loved creating Gore Noir Magazine over the last 6 years.. Horror is a labor of love for me and all it takes is picking up a issue of the magazine to see that.So PLEASE please PLEASE don't let another horror magazine go the way of Fangoria.. We want to help grow the community with your help, input, and your collaboration! This is a call to arms for all your horror ghouls!Scroll to the bottom for our STRETCH GOALS! If we hit the goal associated, the currently blacked out item will be ""illuminated"" and you'll either get the item FOR FREE (so share this page often!) if you meet the criteria OR you'll be able to add it to your order for a small fee! Many of these are Kickstarter exclusives and will be sure to be COLLECTORS ITEMS Gore Noir Magazine has been around for 6 years and from the beginning we were looking to merge our love of HORROR CULTURE into the magazine world.  With a strong emphasis on Horror Artwork in all it's forms and a goal of giving this magazine a real personality above all, we set out to make it all a reality.  Gore Noir Magazine embraced it's ability to do the things larger magazines couldn't do.  Gore Noir brought the world the first coffin shaped magazine, all black and white, paying homage to the magazines that set the bar for everything we see today.  We also put out things like a scratch and sniff Tarman (Return of the Living Dead) cover, a full array of They Live (stark white with black lettering) covers taken from the magazine shelves of the movie, as well as various limited edition covers.Along with our magazines we love attending and vending at conventions all over the states. When we aren't attending other's events we are throwing our own. Gore Noir's brand of events are very much like our magazine: a little bit different. We usually have bands that range from psychobilly, rockabilly, metal, or in between, along with sideshow and burlesque. To add the cherry to the top most of our events feature either BLOOD or slime wrestling! It's come to be our ""calling card"" if you will..  ","We've already taken the risk 6 years ago and created a PRINT Horror Magazine in the middle of this digital age.  People are all skeptical of printed media, of analog media in this digital age.  What have the people said to these skeptics?  It's been a resounding..  F%@&K YOU!  We've started buying more records, VHS tapes, music tapes, and embracing the tactile feeling of holding something awesome and amazing in our hands.  Can you let a friend borrow your digital copy of our magazine?  Can you be one of only 200 people to own on of our coffin shaped issues if it was digital?  Can you scratch n sniff a digital magazine?  NO!!"

Teatime is multigenerational and international. It is ancient and yet constantly innovative, adapting to the world with new offerings but remaining constant in a basic core value. Tea brings people together in a meaningful way.Many people who have only known it as a big-brand-name teabag or iced tea are thirsty to learn more. For this reason, we feel there is a great need for ITSS. We like to compare it to a Tea Festival - a virtual tea festival.At tea festivals like the one in this video, tea lovers of all kinds of teas and styles of brewing come together for a day or two to celebrate. At an upcoming festival in Los Angeles, ITSS will offer a live pre-launch opportunity to the thousands of guests who gather at the Asian-American Museum on December 5-6. Incorporating the festival with this Kickstarter campaign, we hope to expand that invitation even further to prepare for our official launch on January 1st.ITSS will use the tools of the Internet and advanced community-building software to create a virtual festival. Tea businesses and professionals from around the world can introduce themselves and their products to the entire community. Community members will have access to the Tea Sipper library, Events Calendar, Business Directory and updates along with interactive materials in the monthly Newsletter and will be offered special discounts, additional values and special events.ITSS will be a portal to the large and fascinating world of tea, commissioning articles about the history and culture of tea, extensive how-to's for all preferences as well as art and craft projects, serving a wide range of interests for all ages and brewing experience.One recent commission is this simple tea song. We want more than just ""I'm A Little Teapot"" and will actively be developing more for use at home and at parties for young children.Future plans also include live events as our membership grows! When The Kettle WhistlesIn addition to the original content we will commission, our Tea Sipper Librarians are researching sources of tea information and entertainment in the public domain, making it easily available for members.          View A Selection Of Sample PagesWe've designed this funding campaign to support the purchase of more content from respected writers and artists for our launch. ITSS members will all have access to the entire library.Here is what we would like to invest in projects for our launch and first few months.Anything over our $4500 goal will be used to commission additional original content and to move forward with projects for the benefit of our subscribers. In this way we intend to recognize and support tea writers and creative spirits to provide the richest possible experience for members.The 2015 Month of Tea was so well-received that we chose this January as our official launch. With a completely new and different format we will celebrate the 31 days of Hot Tea Month (U.S. designation). But, if you would like to catch the highlights of last year's event, all the videos are now live on the ITSS website:               Month of Tea 2015Our main reward is a limited time subscriber category available only until the official launch on January 1, 2016. This is a lifetime membership, Charter Members. As you will see, there are options for individuals and for business members. Just for fun, we're combining membership with some of the following physical items.Pads of Post-It Tea Notes & It's Hip To Sip Button Books By Babette DonaldsonFun With TeaThe Everything Healthy Tea BookThe Emma Lea Books, Hardbound SetThe Soul & Spirit of Tea (contributed an essay)","ITSS is an ambitious, long-term project with enormous potential to serve tea lovers, tea educators and tea entrepreneurs by creating a community in which every member finds special value and meaning. As ancient as the cultivation of Camellia sinensis (tea) is, awareness of the big picture in many Western countries is still very new. And even in countries of origin where tea grows, the global picture is limited. We have much to learn from each other. And we might even discover that, by sharing our various cultures of tea, we are more similar than we ever imagined. The success of the International Tea Sippers Society will not be measured in profits or numbers of subscribers - but rather in what the community can do to promote the potential to connect with family and friends. And then beyond, around the entire world. It may not be anything as global as World Peace. But millions of small peaceful moments might add up to a value we have no way to predict. This belief inspired the project. Remaining true to the idea that tea is more than a beverage is what we believe will sustain us during the challenges of our first few years and will continue to inspire for a long future. Our team will always look for ways to show appreciation to the Charter Members who bring their support to ITSS now, even before the January 1st launch. We look forward to sharing our dream with you.Thank you for your interest and for your support.With Gratitude, Babette Donaldson, Founder",https://www.kickstarter.com/projects/teasipperssociety/sip-for-peace-2018-a-month-of-tea-celebration?ref=discovery_category_newest,teasipperssociety/sip-for-peace-2018-a-month-of-tea-celebration,"“Come along inside . . .

The International Tea Sippers Society has grown out of this experience with a dream to help connect newcomers to the tea experience with this huge and fantastic world. My favorite experiences have been when teaching ""Tea 101"" or introductory classes that students leave with a sense of amazement. By focusing on thirty-one different regions selected for this event, I believe we will create something very close to the OMG moments I've enjoyed in live classes.There are several challenges for me, both personally and professionally. The first is that I often hear a bias that tea drinking beyond the brand-name teabags is complex or that a tea lifestyle is economically out of reach. It is my professional challenge to demonstrate the meaningful and fun elements of becoming a Sipper. Personally, I'm committed to saving the art and craftsmanship of producing whole leaf teas. There are many factors disrupting this industry. Factors that may severely limit the quantity and quality of teas in the marketplace. This would have a tragic socio-economic and cultural effect. I believe that ""Sip for Peace"" can make a positive difference in this regard for everyone from the farmers to the consumers by promoting understanding and confidence. Using our virtual platform, introducing viewers to international tea cultures, we can help develop a sense of being ""local"" with greater confidence in international products as if we are neighbors. The challenge is to introduce, educate and inspire the tea loving public to expand their own understanding and use, to create a larger demand for the field-to-cup experience and to forge relationships that will break down some of the barriers incited by political prejudice."

Built from the trees that surround me in the Scottish highlands.What makes this entire project unique, is that it will fill a relatively empty gap in the market of tourism to the Highlands.Every year someone asks me if there are small boats for hire in the area, as they want to spend a few hours out on the water with their family and friends. Besides the common Kayak, a water craft that doesn't offer much in the way of comfort, the answer is always a disappointing 'no'I aim to change this.((((((( Postage costs, due to their fluctuating nature will be worked out and quoted when items have been made and packaged.I don't seek to make any profit on delivery, you will pay what I am paying to send items to you, when the item is ready to send.You must pay this cost before your item is sent to you, through Paypal transaction or BAC transfer.In the event you are able to pick up your reward from me personally, you can do so at no extra cost. Following any Covid health rules set by the current pandemic))))))))We have struggled immensely with the Visa system of the United Kingdom. It's a difficult country to get in to, the rules are puzzle and we have been left without many options to take.Any pledge you make will help to secure our future together- as the only thing we're short of now is the income, from my business, to prove we can support ourselves.We came very close, 2 years ago and I had arranged all the work needed for this year to see it settled once and for all. But then.. ((boom))... a pandemic struck. Causing most of my contracted work to fall through.Bryia has written a little on the subject. Some words she would like to say about her experience meeting me.My name is Bryia, I am a Canadian by birth but my heart belongs to Scotland.5 years ago, I met the man of my dreams through a chance meeting over the interwebs. Before we met, I was lost. My life was without direction. That was, until I found John.He showed me his beautiful world, and through the eyes of a lens, I was inspired.I grew more and more in love with him and this magical land of Scotland, which he called home. Within a few hours we decided that we should meet in person. There wasn’t a day or night we didn’t speak with each other, each conversation was more infatuating than the last.Naturally, there was doubt from family members. They figured this was just another crazy idea, never to come to fruition.But with hard work and dedication, I got my passport and was able to book a ticket. I took a leap of faith and said goodbye to my family and friends to begin this new chapter of my life.When I finally arrived in Scotland, I was overcome with a sense of belonging. John and his family welcomed me with open arms and gave me a new outlook on life.Reflecting back, My first 6 months with John were like living in a Utopia. I was shown the world in which John grew up and when he introduced his friends and family, I felt like the luckiest girl in the world.I grew very fond of his Granny, between her wit and welcoming nature, I always looked forward to Sunday dinners at the cottage.One day, during the first week of experiencing my new life with John, we picked blaeberries on a cliff face, a stones throw away from a beautiful waterfall - but not before being chastised about my city slickin’ footwear not being appropriate for hillwalking. I still have the wellington boots Granny gave me for the journey. On my Birthday, John took me to comb the shoreline for shellfish and sea glass. We found many whelks, razor fish and John even found a monstrous crab!I will never forget the bonfires on the rocky shores of Loch Duich and of the first night we held each other, by the waters edge. The loch was a plane of glass, reflecting every star in the crisp autumn nights sky. With the looming majesty of the 5 Sisters of Kintail watching over us.It was a very difficult time returning to Canada after experiencing this life, which is the polar opposite of the life I had lived, not knowing when I would be able to come back.I couldn’t wait to reunite with my true love. So with careless planning and a lot of faith in the immigration system, we booked another ticket to Scotland for the day before our anniversary. After a 19 hour flight, I was ready to envelope my man. But tragedy struck when I was then pulled off to the side and detained by the London immigration officers. You see, I was told in Canada that Canadians did not require a visa when visiting the UK. But the Immigration advisor I spoke to didn’t know my travel history and that I had already been to the UK just 6 months prior. So when I landed in London, I was corralled into a cell and it felt like my rights as a human being were stripped. Although John was only a few doors down waiting for me to enter the gates, we were not allowed to see each other, even for a brief goodbye. Devastation washed over me and I fell into despair. I spent the next 24 hours, aching, waiting to be sent back.Just as I was about to fall asleep in that cold 24/7 lit room, I was taken without warning to a different facility across the airport.The only “kindness” I was shown was the infrequent offering of a hot beverage whenever I spoke to an officer. I have to say that this is the single most distressing experience I have lived through to this day. Never have I cried so much.Now determined more than ever, I made it my mission to do whatever it took to get back to the loving embrace of my life partner. Another 6 months went by but this new plan of action gave us two years to plan our future together if executed properly.So diligently, we gathered the mandatory means to acquire the Youth Mobility Visa and off I was back to the land of wild roaming haggis’.Again, however.We faced another misunderstanding of the rules within the arguably archaic immigration system of the UK. In regards to the ‘proof of maintenance’ requirements for the next visa in line, the tier 4 family visa.I won’t bore you with the details, as they are exactly that … boring. In short, we missed our chance to roll on to the next visa by a fine margin. Due to technical reasons and not being able to combine various sources of income.We are now, once again, facing a long distant relationship. And John is left entirely on his own to meet the required income to prove that we can support ourselves and that my being with him will not be a drain on the system of the British government.We need help. Now, during the world’s climate, more than ever.We have so much to offer but this inability of being together is really holding us back from achieving our goals. We desperately want this visa chaos behind us and all we need is this one last push. Whereafter I can re-enter the UK with the right to work.With our previous experience and knowledge of the visa system, we can then meet all the requirements for future applications and finally put this visa chaos behind us.Thank you for reading our story, with your help there will be much more to come.Much love,Bryia.","The stand-out challenge is time. I will always choose quality of work over quickness of production.The bottom line is, every pledge will be honoured. And each piece will be as unique as it is beautiful.The target dates of delivery declared 'December', have priority*- as I expect them to be targeted by Christmas shoppers looking for stocking fillers.The building of the Skiff itself raises few risks. I already have the timber, milled up and curing.I have set the goal at £2500- not because this is the value of the skiff, but rather the value of the remaining materials I will need to bring her to life.My time, in this sense, is my own investment toward the project. And once the build begins in September/ October, I will become obsessed in it. Lost amidst a cloud of sawdust and the perfume of burning resins.Whereupon the only risk I face is remembering to eat and sleep. Both of which I am very fond of, so, not a risk likely to come to fruition."
https://www.kickstarter.com/projects/906649970/the-challengers-almanac?ref=discovery_category_newest,906649970/the-challengers-almanac,"// THE STORY SO FAR...Three years ago my wife Emily and I started a small production company in Cornwall (UK). Through word of mouth our client list quickly grew and we found ourselves working for increasingly high profile clients around the world (usually ghost producing content on behalf of other, larger agencies).At the end of last year, the experience of working for one particular multinational corporation woke us up to the fact that we had let our business become something that we never intended, something we didn't believe in.Everything suddenly came into focus; we had let the pursuit of cash and the simple day to day 'stuff' that comes with running a business get in the way of the big ideas that we had when we started.This project ispart ofthe change we want to see.We run a small, busy business and we knew we couldn't ever make the project happen without a little help, so we recruited the talents of Meg who came onboard to help bring the idea together.Over the last six months we've researched and collated content and talked to a huge number of people about the project. As a result, we now have an absolutely brilliant team of creators and contributors ready and raring to bring the Almanac to life.Here are a few of the faces from the team...Now, we just need you to join us...~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~Initially, the Almanac will be available in print as a beautifully produced book. We also aim to make it available online as a website / series of short films and in the 'Real World' as a community of like-minded people.Like a sailing Almanac it will be jam packed with useful information and inspiration to help businesses navigate their business journey. It will bring together brilliant thinking as well as showcasing examples of businesses that are challenging the way things are done.We want the Almanac to be the resource you turn to for reassurance. As an entrepreneur you often have moments of uncertainty, moments where you wake up with a cold sweat worrying about a decision you've made, or times when you feel you're letting your ideals slip to keep your head above water.The Almanac will stand up for doing things differently; showcasing new thinking and examples of people that have managed to blend doing things the right way, along with being financially successful.It's not about imparting our opinion. We are conscious that we have made loads of mistakes in business and we aren't claiming any expertise. Instead this project is about bringing together the sort of thinking that inspires us and what we want to see in a resource like this...ONLINE CONTENTWe want to support the Almanac content by producing short films from many of the featured thinkers / businesses. Here is a short edit of our interview with David Hieatt, inspirational thinker and founder of Hiut Denim and The Do Lectures:~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~WE BELIEVE THAT BUSINESS, AS THE MOST POWERFUL HUMAN FORCE ON THE PLANET, HAS HUGE POTENTIAL TO BE A FORCE FOR GOOD.~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~There are 4 ways you can help to support the Almanac:~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~We have put together some brilliant rewards for you to choose from (below) but to sweeten the deal even more, we have 8 further incentives for you to back the project...Select this reward to follow exclusive project updates and receive 1 inspirational article via email when the project is complete.Select this reward to follow exclusive project updates and be able to download one of our digital wallpapers to use on your computer / tablet or phone.Select this reward to be sent the unique Almanac tote bag printed with our favourite quote from Steve Jobs.Select this reward to be sent a digital version of the Almanac.Select these rewards to be sent a copy of the Challengers Almanac, hot off the press.

A perfect set to set you on your way to inspiration!","// Bringing the content for the Almanac together Over the last six months we have talked to people, researched topics and compiled a huge amount of content for the Almanac. We have brought together a brilliant team to make the huge task of bringing this information together into a cohesive and engaging form much easier.  This includes magazine editors, copywriters, photographers, designers and illustrators.// Getting our American friends to back the projectWe have always been frustrated by the large postage costs that get added onto rewards for projects based in the States. Obviously postage between the UK and America is very expensive (£14 for the Almanac!) We have worked really hard with our costings and negotiations to be able to include the cost of shipping into our rewards so that you guys don't feel put off by high shipping costs. The only problem with this is that it doesn't leave much of a contribution from our American Backers towards content creation...  So our plan, if support from America is high enough is to get the rewards for American backers created in the States. This will save postage costs and air miles. So basically to cut a long story short; don't feel put off that we are based in the UK - we need your support!!// Reaching our targetThe target we have set is high but this represents the quality of the content / products we want to produce. The vast majority of the budget covers the minimum print run of this quality. With a small budget left for unavoidable costs such as photographers travel expenses etc. We have also accounted for the Kickstarter fees and left a 10% contingency for unaccounted costs to be on the safe side.We can only set the target at the level we have because of the support of the Almanac team who are all prepared to donate their time to see the Almanac come to life.THANK YOU!",https://www.kickstarter.com/projects/906649970/the-challengers-almanac-0?ref=discovery_category_newest,906649970/the-challengers-almanac-0,"** After Kickstarter ends you'll be able to buy the Almanac and find out more information about the project over on our website ** www.thechallengersalmanac.co.ukWe believe the playing field has been levelled. That the future of business belongs to people who are prepared to challenge the status quo.We are a small, passionate team whose own business experiences lead us to seek out a different type of inspiration. Our journey revealed a World full of people with incredible stories to tell.  People with ideas that turned us on.  People who won't take no for an answer.  Who have stuck to their guns and created businesses worth so much more than the money they make.With this project we want to bring these people together to inspire others as they've inspired us.'I'm thrilled to have been included in the creation of the Almanac, if I wasn't I'd be itching to be part of the next issue.  An inspiring and insightful book featuring a brilliant collection of the brightest people challenging the way business is done today.'Helen Redstone, eatbigfishThe Challenger's Almanac is a new annual business publication.It isn't your run of the mill business book. It hasn't been created by men in suits or business experts with 1000 years experience. Instead it's been brought together by us.Over the last year we've collected Challenger's stories and the advice from experts who have helped build Challenger brands.We've never written a book (let alone a book on business!) But, thanks to the power of an idea and the warmth and generosity of all the people who have contributed, we now have something that we are proud to present to you on Kickstarter.The Challenger's Almanac features thinking fromThe design of the AlmanacWe aren't claiming to be business experts ourselves, so we didn't want to project our own opinions onto the readers of the Almanac. For that reason we have kept the design as clean and simple as possible. We haven't written introductions for our contributors. We haven't dressed them up in costumes or got them to strike posses to reflect their 'personality' (although there did happen to be a giant red monster at the Peppersmith office the day we were there!)Instead we have presented each article exactly as it was written and have taken photographs exactly as we found our contributors. Our aim with this approach was to allow our readers to draw their own conclusions from each article and to make the Almanac as simple to navigate as possible.Where we couldn't take photographs or where we wanted to visualise ideas within articles we have utilised the skills of tattoo artist Josh Vyvyan to create some really special illustrations. Printing the AlmanacWe couldn't create a publication about doing business differently and then get it mass produced on the cheap in China! Instead we will be printing the Almanac as sustainably as we know how. It will be:// Printed in the UK by John at Anglia Print Ltd, using waterless technology// Printed lithographically to create perfect colour and depth in the photographs and illustrations// Printed using vegetable-based ecological inks// Made using recycled paper produced via wind power from GFSmith// Hand-bound and finished// Beautifully packaged in recycled materialsThe Almanac is a not-for-profit side project. All support gathered through Kickstarter will go towards printing the first issue. If we exceed our target it will secure the future of a second issue. Everything is ready to go, we just need your help to bring it to life.The Almanac is ready to go, all we need now is paper and ink! The paper is on hold. The button on the printer is waiting to be pressed. We've been in conversation with our suppliers and producers since the beginning so they're just waiting for the nod. That's where you come in.We are looking for 100 like minded people to help launch the Almanac. There are a number of benefits to getting involved:// You will be one of our founding partners and we will credit you in the first edition//By supporting the project you will get the Almanac before anyone else// You can get other great rewards as well (please see details of each of our rewards below)// You will get your rewards quickly - each reward will be hand-packaged by Meg and sent out to you around a month within the end of the campaign.Reward #1A copy of The Challenger's AlmanacReward #2We teamed up with Print Club London to produce a limited run edition of our four favourite quotes.

However we have already tackled the majority of production challenges facing us:The paper has been sourcedThe printers have been foundAll of the content has been gatheredNow our biggest challenge is getting people to believe in / back the project. So WE NEED YOU to back the project but also to spread the word to other like minded people to help us reach our goal.

Everyone loves my marshmallows. When I bring them to work they disappear in seconds.I love being creative so I decided to start a business doing what I love. When you find something you are passionate about and make it your life's work....that is true happiness.I have already secured licensed kitchen space to create my product and am looking to get funds to get this off the ground.The funds that I get from this Kickstarter campaign will go for purchasing supplies and packaging materials for my confections. It will also allow me to have a storage area for my dry goods. The money that I raise will allow me to also get a small retail location in the Downtown area of Juneau, Alaska. This will put me not only in the best location to sell my treats but also to have my own area for production.Additionally the funds will go towards purchasing the equipment needed torun a full scale operation. As some of you may know, running a retail location is not cheap and the equipment to make confections properly is not either. At a minumum I would need a commercial grade chocolate tempering machine, enrober and prep tables. It would also help cover some of the costs for the initial 6 months of start up.I have already started securing clients locally. Juneau is a big tourist town and I want to make sure that everything is in place for the start of the tourist season in April.I am currently working with several businesses who would like to stock my items in their stores. Production will be small to start but I will be able to ramp up production. I currently have the capacity to make roughly 500 pieces weekly. If I can secure the funds and get a location I will be able to increase production to 1500 pieces weekly.Once I am able to get my product in stores locally and selling on my site, I will expand to the larger regions of Alaska like Anchorage and Fairbanks. Many parts of Alaska have very large tourist activity and everyone loves something made in Alaska.After initial start up I also have plans to expand the offerings to toffee, taffy and assorted other confections.","The biggest challenge that this project faces is finding the right suppliers in Alaska. To get higher quality chocolate I ned to have it shipped from the lower 48. I have a local supplier for small quantities but once production ramps up I will need additional suppliers.  Currently I am limited to about 100 pounds per week.The other challenge for this product is getting my product accepted in the local stores before tourist season.  If this can be accomplished I should be able to sell my maximum production quantity weekly.Finally the last hurdle is I work a full time job.  Since this project is just starting out and not bringing in a full time income, I still need to work.  I do have a great support system of friends and family that are willing to help me with production.",https://www.kickstarter.com/projects/690986060/jcp-confections-needs-a-spot-to-call-their-own?ref=discovery_category_newest,690986060/jcp-confections-needs-a-spot-to-call-their-own,"JCP Confections is a small batch candy company located in Juneau, AK. We make marshmallows from scratch and cover them in chocolate. We currently have many different flavors of marshmallow and 3 kinds of chocolate. Currently we are working out of a rented kitchen and are looking at getting a small spot to call our own. If I can raise the $2500 it will allow for first, last, deposit, improvements and DEC inspection fees.Currently I am selling wholesale and retail. I have done roughly $600 in sales and am looking to hear about my first wholsale deal in the next few days. UPDATE: I have secured a deal with a large candy company in Anchorage and they will be stocking my treats in their stores this summer!!!!I have also recently been given my Made In Alaska Certification so I am allowed to use the logo on my packaging.I really need my own spot so I can increase production. Currently I only have my rented kitchen for two days a week and I cannot keep up with demand. I can currently produce about 30 lbs of product a week and by having my own spot that will increase to about 100 lbs a week.Tourist season is approaching quickly and once I get a facility then I can ramp up the production in order to meet demands. I am hoping that this will turn into a full time success story.This has turned into not only a mission but a passion of mine. I love coming up with new flavor combinations and creations. Last week I made my first Peanut Butter Marshmallow. It was a bavarian cream marshmallow that was topped with a creamy peanut butter layer. It was a huge hit for my quality team (my employees at my day job).","The biggest challenge is ensuring that the location will meet the requirements of the DEC inspectors.  This will involve installing a 3 compartment sink in the location.  I have already priced it locally and it is almost $500 just to get that part done.Once the sink is installed, I can get DEC approval and start making candy in my own location.The next challenge is getting this all done before tourist season which will be my big order time.  Tourists start coming in around the middle to end of April.  I have picked a location already that will be perfect for production and will take little improvement to get up and running."

Think again. Infusing a fresh and hip spirit with multicultural and international roots into a classic clarinet ensemble, Four Play clarinet puts a new twist on clarinet music and makes the instrument a la mode with a modern and sophisticated style. We seek to combine our virtuosic classical training with a passion for pop and electronic music, pushing the instrument in a new direction that explores all of its unconventional possibilities.We originally formed in 2012 at California State University, Fullerton while some of us were still students at the university. In January 2016, we took our music to the next level when we made our international debut on YouTube with the cover of the acclaimed hit “Lean On” by Major Lazer. Our popularity on YouTube continued to grow as we continued to put out cover videos of music by Calvin Harris, Justice, and Eurythmics. With over 10,000 subscribers and hundreds of thousands of views, we've made our mark as an ensemble connecting the gap between the classical and popular music cultures.WHAT WE NEEDWe want to continue to keep putting our music out there in every way possible, so what better way to do that than to put on live shows? We've frequently performed outside the lights at LACMA, but we’ve been looking to expand and play at various types of venues in Los Angeles – bars, clubs, events, you name it. We’ve been connecting to local promoters and friends who work in the industry to help us in that department, so we’re really excited about being able to make our music more accessible to the public. As we prepare to create live shows, we want to enhance the way we perform and the way you hear us. Acoustically, clarinets don’t project on a stage as well as a guitar, bass, or drums. The obvious solution would be to mic us, but we’ve found that for the clarinet to project the best at the type of venues we want to perform at, we need a specific setup. This is especially important because we will have electronics playing behind us as well.So after doing some research, we’ve finally found a set up that works well for us.

Next we go into post production and C.D. design. Up to this point, every musician involved in this project has worked for free. It has been a true labor of love. We have pooled our resources to use top notch recording equipment that we set up in our homes, creating a relaxed and intimate atmosphere. Each member involved has dedicated large chunks of time to assure that we get only the best takes, at times spending hours on just a few measures of music. This will no doubt be our best effort to date and we can not wait to share it with you! One of the more exciting aspects of this project has been the 'in studio' creation of original music. For the first time, we have been using the tools of the studio to create new music from the ground up. Most of the pieces have come from hours of improvised recordings that have been whittled down to just the best stuff. For good measure, we have also included some traditional folk music right from India, and it sounds incredible!The funding we receive will go directly towards producing and promoting the C.D. The costs will include:1. Hiring a professional to do the mastering of the audio.2. Printing and packaging theactualC.D., posters, and other merchandise (this is the most expensive part!)3. Fees associated with Copyright, UPC coding, Digital Distribution, and promotion.4. Producing a great C.D. Release Party.Thank you for your time and help with this project!-Sumkali",

https://www.kickstarter.com/projects/archwingllc/eos-the-worlds-first-all-terrain-hoverboard?ref=discovery_category_newest,archwingllc/eos-the-worlds-first-all-terrain-hoverboard,"It all starts with an idea; a seed planted in your mind. One seed may grow a tree, but many grow a mighty forest.Be a planter today, and see your dream flourish tomorrow.Watch The Kickstarter Interview above!!The Hoverboard ""EOS"" is the World's First All-Terrain Hoverboard, using conventional hovercraft technology, EOS creates a friction-less environment underneath your feet in the form of a compact board.Hovercrafts have been around for years, the science is solid. Unlike quantum levitation or electromagnetic levitation, EOS is bound to no tracks or special surfaces. EOS can ride across any material the board can pressurize against.Our current prototype model is capable of about three minutes of ride time with our setup, four 4400mAh lithium polymer batteries. However, with more ""lipos"" hooked up, ride time can easily be lengthened!With the Kickstarter backing, we will be able to overhaul the functionality (lift system/electronics) using the knowledge gathered developing the prototype.The current prototype design needs to be taken to the next level. By making a contribution to Archwing, we can complete what we’ve started. Right now the prototype is made out of heavy material and roughly assembled. We want to change that. The final version will consist of a low density, light weight fiber glass body, giving the board the strength it needs to support a person and overcome rough obstacles. The skirt will also be professionally redesigned and stitched, which allows the bottom to be resistant to ware and tear. The new skirt will also be able to be zipped on and off for easy replacement. The look of the board itself is going to be slightly altered. To significantly improve stability we are going to manufacture the platform to be wider, giving the user more control. The power systems, one of the most important features that makes the board possible, will be having the biggest overhaul. The currently un-insulated turbines will be insulated in order to achieve as much noise reduction as possible, the electrical components will also be coated in weather resistant material so the board can operate on land and over water. The board’s Lithium-Ion Polymer batteries that currently only give us a little over a three minute charge, will be potentially replaced with Nano-Particle Batteries with a higher voltage density, and fast charge capability. This will give the board much more flight time. Since Nano's are still experimental, this change may remain pending. If, however, they make it past the experimental stage, they can always be implemented onto our hoverboards in the future!  Our vision is to have a product that is as much as a method of transportation as it is a sport, and we can only get there if we can continue to fund our research.","Project: EOS is a prototype, and prototypes sometimes come with technical difficulties.  Our hoverboard is powered by high voltage electronics that sometimes fail depending on the craftsmanship of electrical components.  Completing EOS wasn't easy, finding the right components to power the board warranted many variations.  Once we found the right combination of components, the project finally started to see the light of day. Sometimes things need to be replaced, just like parts on your car overtime.PROBLEMAs you may have watched in the video, one concern for this project was balance. In order to have a true hoverboard, you have to consider one main scientific law: friction.  Friction in everyday life helps us balance when standing. It's what allows our feet to be stable on the ground.  When you remove friction, you are left with a considerable learning curve to overcome.  SOLUTIONI have learned from this project that in order for this product to be fun and stable for all learners, the width of the footing deck will have to be expanded outward so not only will your feet have more room, but balancing becomes an easier task overall.  Additionally, when you increase surface area in pressure statics, you also increase lift!!  The key is finding the balance between aesthetics and functionality.      When we build the backer's hoverboards, we will test the hoverboards before they leave our possession and make sure that everything is working smoothly.  If, by chance, something were to fail on the hoverboard, the backers are always welcome to contact us after the fact and we will work with them to find a solution to their problem.  We strive to create a strong trust with our backers so they are always satisfied.LIMITING FACTOR ($$$)In the making of this project, the creator had little funding as a full-time engineering student.  Using what life-savings he had at the time, he created EOS, and had only one shot at it.  Redoing the whole project to fix what problems arisen the first time around was not an option.  With this funding, we will be able to make the best prototype possible.  Disclaimer:  The term ""all-terrain"" suggests free travel among most relatively smooth surfaces.  We do not condone riding our prototypes over bodies of water due to the risk of drowning your hoverboard and causing an electrical short within the circuitry.  In the future, this may, however, be improved upon so bodies of water may be safer to cross with research in weather-proof coating!",https://www.kickstarter.com/projects/archwingllc/sharktooth-12-in-1-tactical-utility-pendant?ref=discovery_category_newest,archwingllc/sharktooth-12-in-1-tactical-utility-pendant,"""Sharktooth"" is one of our first designs in our Tactical Apparel venture. Initially designed to look like a fish, I decided to go a more practical route with the concept of an arrowhead/tooth. Some obvious functions can be noted about Sharktooth, but many will discover more when they receive theirs. You are the survivor, after all.Sharktooth Dimensions: 1.775"" x .906""In this tool's design, I added a feature that most manufacturers would fail to replicate, a ""micro-tooth"" saw. This feature allows the user to achieve very fine clean cuts with an extremely-fine tooth edge. Archwing, LLC prides itself on supporting local business. Not only are you supporting new product development, you're supporting small business growth, which is good economics.Sharktooth can be worn as a utility earring as well as a necklace.Note to Backers:When design meets functionality, you open up new doors to possibility. With funding, not only are we creating this product, you are enabling us to venture into new engineering frontier. For that, you deserve the biggest thanks of all.Why does this need a Kickstarter?Your funding will be used for a manufacturing contract where custom parts may be created under ""bulk-order"" so the manufacturer can allocate time and space to create the new parts in high-production for a low price, passing the savings onto you.  ","The most difficult part of this project was the redesign.  Initially, this design was a mess of extraneous details, some of which had no functional capability.  I wanted to be strict with what I put into this design, so only the useful details remained. The second most difficult part was finding the right manufacturer for my engineering needs.  In my past I interned as an engineer in the aerospace industry and frequently had to work on a professional business level with contractors to get things done, so eventually I found the right company with the right mechanical capability."

The program allows a small group of artists and scientists to pursue personal projects in a collaborative environment encountered by very few.I’m developing three sub-projects for the trip: 1) 3D scanning of sea ice fragments, from which molds will be created for fabricating cast glass replicas, and for creating replicas in various media with 3D printers. 2) ""Crossing into the Polar Eternities"", a continuation of a current project using experimental cartographic technique to map environments in the service of art and science. 3) Using MIT ""Sea Perch"" remotely-operated underwater vehicles (ROVs) to explore around and below the sea ice (e.g. 3D scanning, stereo photography, video, water quality data), for use in experimental videos and cartographic maps.The project's skeleton budget includes the costs of travel to/from Svalbard, the participation fee, and additional required clothing. Additional funding via grants will be used to acquire used 3D-scanning equipment, mold and 3D-printing materials, glass batch for casting, kiln time, Sea Perch ROV and video/sensor array, map printing, and more.I am actively seeking exhibition and outreach opportunities for after the residency, both as part of a collaborative with other members of the expedition, and as an individual. There is incredible potential for public outreach opportunities given the nature of the project.",,https://www.kickstarter.com/projects/benbray/meridional-overturning-circulation?ref=discovery_category_newest,benbray/meridional-overturning-circulation,"The Earth’s climate is a focus of my current work as an artist and scientist.  Climate involves a multitude of systems spanning vast scales of time and space, which art is especially good at articulating.  We can better comprehend such a vast system if we study the science, experiment with perspective, and express our understanding through mediums of abstraction.Science facilitates knowledge of the Earth’s climate, and art facilitates our perspective. Earth’s Meridional Overturning Circulation (MOC), often referred to as the Thermohaline Circulation, is a climatic process affecting the entire globe.  The MOC regulates our climate, affects fisheries and food availability worldwide, and influences global biodiversity. The common visual representation is geographically-based, and shows a series of connected loops and straightaways resembling a roller coaster at an amusement park.  But that doesn’t convey a strong, physical sense of scale, nor the taste of the ingredients driving it.  Through sculpture, I want to express its scale, balance, energy, chemistry, and fragility.The goal of this kinetic art project, for which I am seeking funding, is to express the fundamental mechanics of the MOC using glass tubing on a large horizontal scale. I’m developing a lever-balance system where cold, salty water on one end if the tube of flowing water is heavier than warm, fresher water on the other end, which causes the lever to twist and the cold end to rest at the lower height.  This gradient would encourage the flow of water and organic matter through a horizontally-stretched circuit.  Organic matter would cycle via a smaller loop, reflecting the latitudinal zone of highest surface ocean productivity.  The flow rate would be very slow, controlled by both conservation of mass and by a data-driven propeller, whose motion is directly influenced by a long-term geospatial dataset of wind for a particular region of the ocean.  At each extremity of the sculpture would be a listing and map of upwelling and downwelling sites globally, reflecting recent peer-reviewed literature. Viewers could find their location on the map.While the initial concept is a response to my education in oceanography and past literature on the subject, the project will reflect current research. I’ll also utilize the insight of my student colleagues in the MIT Architecture and Oceanography departments for conceptual and technical insight. Modern in-situ and remote sensing techniques have affirmed some long-held conclusions about the strength and location of upwelling and downwelling zones, and the currents that connect them, but have affected significant shifts of understanding in many other cases.The context of oceanography is ""nutrient-rich"" with relevant and interesting scientific concepts, and this artistic process will involve a diverse array of conversations, locations, and thoughts. I want to develop this in a way that's symbiotic with its environment from the beginning, where input from the audience coincides with output and outreach by the artist.  The Council for the Arts at MIT has graciously provided seed funding to allow me to start the project, and I want to use Kickstarter as both a funding source to complete it, and a medium through which project outreach and interaction can grow.  In return for their contributions, donors will receive exclusive reports that express the artistic and scientific conceptual development of the project through unique visuals, sounds, renderings, and writing.  Funds are needed for borosilicate tubing, custom glass parts, digital flow control parts, mounting parts, professional sketches and publicity, signage, and studio space.$25 ..

https://www.kickstarter.com/projects/bshotsauce/bs-hot-sauce?ref=discovery_category_newest,bshotsauce/bs-hot-sauce,"Since 2015 we have been making hot sauce as a hobby. One day my wife and I, we bought way too many jalapenos and we did not want them to go to waste, so on Halloween night, we threw it all together and made our first sauce, Jalopeno Lime. After having our friends and family try our sauces, the feedback was endless and amazing and eveyone said we should go into business making hot sauce.In 2018 we finally made it happen and created BS Hot Sauce LLC. We have done multiple events and festivals and have been told numerous times that we have been the most popular table at the event. Our flavors are unique and custom and we love to play with different flavors (sweet & spicy, savory spicy) and give ourselves a challenge. We use local farms and farmers markets for our ingredients. We grow our own peppers as well for those that we cannot buy fresh. Fresh is always best.Our Kickstarter campaign will help us create more flavors, larger batches, upgraded equipment, rent in a commercial kitchen to cook, and we will be able to do more festivals. We are so excited for this journey and hope to have your support with our project. If you support us, and take this journey with us, you will not be disappointed.Who we areMy name is Brian Stark. My wife Samantha and I have 2 amazing children, Antonio turning 3, and Autumn just turned 1. We hope to one day show them how we do things at BS Hot Sauce. We are locals in South Jersey, and bring our best flavors to our customers. Challenges help us grow and only make us better at what we do here. I cook the sauces and my wife marries the flavors together. We are all about teamwork, husband and wife and as a family.Every season there are special releases of hot sauces that we do that we engage our customers in helping us choose the flavors we will do.Why we need your helpBS Hot Sauce is growing bigger and more customers want to be able to taste our flavors. We are as for your support in making this happen. Newer and bigger equipment is needed so we can cook bigger batches. Ordering our bottles in bulk will help our bottle cost so we can keep delivering the best flavors we can and keep our prices the same, which is huge for us and can help us significantly. Festivals are right around the corner and we want to have everyone taste the best hot sauce in South Jersey. We teamed up with a commercial kitchen so that we participate in the larger events and deliver the best quality that you have ever tasted. That is a big step to getting our sauces in more stores also and expanding our business. More efficient equipment will help us produce faster and get our operation running smoother.BS Hot Sauce is growing rapidly and not stopping anytime soon. We have great ambition and are willing to to what is needed to deliver the best for our customers. I’m proud of our accomplishments so far and where we are in such a short amount of time. Cooking hot sauce is my passion, and you can taste that in all of our sauces that we make. BS Hot Sauce is a company that is family built and operated. We as a business are always looking for more ways to grow and succeed and the options, flavors, and opportunities are endless, and we hope to be able to deliver our message with our sauce. We hope to have your support and have you take this journey with us.","Scaling our recipes have been a challenge. Sometimes more of an ingredient needs to be added here and there to keep the perfect quality and taste of our recipe. It also gives us a chance to try out new hot sauces also. We taste every sauce before it is bottled to ensure quality. Production will be a challenge, as of right now our biggest batch has been 100 bottles, but we feel we can overcome this challenge and keep up with our production and fulfill all orders and still have plenty for our festivals. We are determined and at times we have stayed up until 3am to get the job done.Another challenge is New Jersey not having cottage food laws. We solved that by teaming up with a commercial kitchen that we are going to cook out of and adhere to FDA and New Jersey laws. We test our sauces ph levels and make sure the quality is on point and perfect.Our risks are always making a new flavor but it keeps our followers enticed and coming back to try the new, no matter what the flavor is. It is all about how we market it and give our customers ideas to do with each sauce. Our sauces have endless uses.",https://www.kickstarter.com/projects/bshotsauce/that-sauce-is-bs?ref=discovery_category_newest,bshotsauce/that-sauce-is-bs,"Hello and welcome to our Kickstarter! My wife (Samantha) and I (Brian) are the founders/owners of BS Hot Sauce. It all started out as any good business does, a hobby. My wife and I have been cooking hot sauce for 5 years now, although BS Hot Sauce was officially founded in 2018.Every business has a story, ours is simple! My wife was pregnant with our son and was craving bacon wrapped jalapeño poppers. We bought way too many jalapeños and could not see the rest going to waste so we made our first sauce, Jalapeño Lime! The feedback was endless, and well, here we are today. We have a continuous line-up of 6 flavors all year round, and we have seasonal flavors too. Our six all year round flavors include Garlic Habanero, Jalapeño Lime, Brown Sugar Mustard, Horseradish Mustard, Pineapple Mango Ghost and Chipotle Apis. Our flavor stands out, that is what is important to us, and we love that our customers can taste it in every bottle. Think of us as a microbrewery but with hot sauce.Once a seasonal flavor sells out, you must wait till next year. With all our sauces we use local fresh produce to make sure our customers are getting the best quality we can produce.There is a saying, ""if you love what you do, you'll never work a day in your life"" and well, our love and passion for cooking hot sauce can be tasted in every bottle. We cook out of a commercial kitchen, handcraft each sauce, bottle, label, and seal them all by ourselves.Our first sauce we want to get research and developed is our best seller; Garlic Habanero, followed by Jalapeño Lime and then Horseradish Mustard. These flavors are our top sellers and we feel that they show a good variety of what our brand can do! Our goal is set to have 1 sauce researched and developed so the more money raised, the more sauces we can get done. The stretch goal is to raise enough to have 3 sauces done (roughly $5000).Research and development is a multi-step process and it takes time to complete. The time that it takes to get a sauce fully researched and developed doesn’t allow us to provide our backers with those sauces; resulting in the sauces that will be delivered as a part of the rewards to our project backers are the ones that we cook in a commercial kitchen, seal, bottle, and test the pH level.Here is an example of the process our sauces must endure to make it to stores near you!Not only do we want to grow so we can make our sauces more accessible, we want to grow our family business. We have 2 kids currently and 1 on the way, due in July. We want to create a family business that we can hand down to them when they are old enough to run it. Our first step to grow our business for us and our children which begins by starting with a Co-Packer. Although, that is not our only long-term goal. Our final long-term goal is to eventually have our own facility to produce the complete line-up of hot sauce that we make.Thank You for your support,Brian & Samantha Stark","The challenge here like all small hot sauce businesses is scaling production. Scaling production with a Co-packer will help lower bottle cost and help us to increase margins to grow. With the money raised we will be looking to start research and development. Our goal would be to only do our year round line-up of 6 hot sauces for research and development. We want to start by having a Co-packer for our top 3 sauces, which frees us up to work on new or seasonal sauce flavors that our customers love to see us do, as well as increasing sales!  We want as many people to enjoy our handcrafted flavors and to experiment with the variety of ways to use them."

I have just completed recording my 10 track sophomore CD - LOVE WILL FIND A WAY. I have also penned a book entitled SPIRIT TALK /SOUL WALK. I am likened to Johnnie Apple Seed; spreading my SEEDS OF LIGHT every where I go and in every thing I do. SEEDS OF LIGHT flow through my music, my books and my WORLD CITIZEN tee shirts! I am an INDIE ARTIST with an eclectic blend of WORLD/POP/ROCK/ JAZZ.Spirit and music merge together for me. They are one and the same to me.This is the very first single off my sophomore effort entitled: RUNAWAY! CD PRODUCED BY: KAMAU SEITU. I wrote the music and lyrics co/produced and played acoustic rhythm guitar while Kamau played electric and acoustic guitars and beautiful killer solos! Mike Tarpley rounded out the music beautifully playing Soprano and Tenor Sax. I am very committed to living a life that fulfills my purpose on planet Earth. That purpose is making great music that stirs the heart and provokes thoughts that will challenge people's consciousness and wake them up. I write and sing words that entice, invite and open unconscious eyes to see the bigger purpose of our lives; to think outside ourselves and help fill in the cracks of our sleeping souls with COMPASSION, HOPE, ACCEPTANCE and LOVE! My greatest love is music! It is my oxygen and it is my medicine. Music, being universal can speak to every heart that has an ear to hear and a soul that can perceive intention. My pure intent is to be a LIGHT in a dark space for someone who is searching. Through my words and music, I am very confident that I am on track with my mission. I desire to create a grass roots movement of LOVE - (60's Flower Power) through the power of love, by way of compassion through my world conscious music.SPIRIT TALK/SOUL WALK is the heart of my spiritual journey. It was written to inspire and empower souls who sojourn on earth seeking higher realms of understanding and light. As a seed germinates, springing forth and sprouting, this book is such. It is simply an outpouring of ""seeds"" from enlightened moments on my personal spiritual journey. Throw away the traditional table of contents and let your heart lead you throughout the pages of SPIRIT TALK/SOUL WALK. Let it mine the unconscious ground of the soul and it will become a sacred pearl in a treasure chest of wisdom. Cover Art by Veta Walton-Rice    IF GOD LOVED THE BIRD...On this dark night of my soulI feel disconnected and I’m cold.Everything I’ve tried to doHasn’t happened yet and I can’t make it through…I find myself silently questioning what do I do now? IS GOD STILL WITH ME? Yet, before I can finish writing this question, I know the answer. YES…YES…YES! My flesh is screaming because I don’t have a clue what I should do .A very, very big part of my soul knows that this is something I must just work through while the smaller part is looking through the eyes of logic. The house is about to cave in by the huge tidal wave outside the window of my soul. I hear the winds blowing and pounding against my heart. The waves are blowing against the shores of my mind. HELP ME! HELP ME LORD!I cry but it seems like no one hears me… I am frozen in pain. My tears gather like blocks of ice. They won’t flow down my face to release the pent up emotions of FEAR, which summoned them to begin with. What do I do now? I ask again… GOD again has shown HIS mercy in the smallest way by bringing me back to gratitude. I happened to look outside my window and in the midst of turbulence and sorrow I saw a huge white bird sitting on a branch. He looked so peaceful and content sitting all alone in a world all his own. He didn’t have one care in the world.Suddenly, I thought if that bird could be so content, why wasn’t I? After all, GOD created me above birds and he wasn’t worried about how he would eat or where he would sleep. He knew his needs were met. I began to ask myself, what is wrong with this picture? Again GOD came through me like a ray of sunlight on a cold drizzly day. How can doubt play into my mind? How can I think GOD will abandon me at this juncture? STRETCHING MY FAITHMy feathers are too wet to fly. I can’t get off the ground. I can’t seem to find the way to flap my wings and fly. My soul is so heavy. It’s so hard to see the LIGHT. Yet, I know its there but I don’t have the strength to raise my head up to see it through the window of hope today.I have great faith but it is now being stretched beyond my comfort zone to take me higher. This requires a stretching in the area of trust. They go hand and hand. My soul hurts…It cries a river of tears that have now turned to sand. I wait on the Lord. I know He will not fail me! Yes, I am weary, tired, disappointed by all that I am facing without answers but, I still TRUST GOD! With all I am facing … no answers in sight. I still hold on even though I can’t lift my head off the pillow. My heart is resolved to just hold on!I may have slipped a minute but I didn’t fall down. I am confused and befuddled, I don’t know what to do BUT I hold on to GOD'S unchanging hand. HE will lead me and HE will not forsake me! I have seen God’s hand move many times in my life, so I will myself to be strong and courageous until this stronghold breaks and I can fly again. I will not back down no matter how long! If it takes my last breath. THE SPIRIT OF A LOCKMy Beloved locked the spiritual LIGHT into each strand of my hair today. As he intently twisted, every hair into a lock upon my head, I was being made aware that I had been given a unique opportunity to consciously commit to utilizing this action as a ceremonial rite. I had chosen, unconsciously, to dedicate my locks to the sharing of LIGHT; to create an opening for a dialogue for the curious. People who find themselves drawn to the uniqueness of my hair discover a little spiritual rain falling upon them. They are given an opportunity to bathe in the light of GOD. As hair is a woman’s crown, I have chosen to dedicate my locks as a symbol of LIGHT by way of demonstrating my personal commitment to serving the LIGHT; as a KEEPER OF LIGHT and by walking with CHRIST in the LIGHT. I pray to be a good example of living a CHRIST conscious lifestyle worthy of the call. Through my poetry, writing, music and song, I pledge my alliance.WORLD CITIZEN tees are""Wearable Art 4 The Cool At Heart"" . I am very committed to living a life that is worthy of my purpose on this planet. I have created a collection of tanks and tees that bring to light love, unity and peace on earth through WORDS! Words are containers of energy. The soul can be stirred by messages of love or hate; for words are impressionable to the senses. Through a limited collection of hand painted tees and tanks, LOVE becomes light! People read subliminal messages every day. Why not plant seeds of love... light... compassion... unity and acceptance? Why not celebrate our differences and strive to be a part of the hand that is hope in humankind? After all, we are all citizens of the planet Earth. YES! We are WORLD CITIZENS! While the tees are for every age and size, my main focus is on our children. They are the future of the planet, so why not begin with them? Spreading SEEDS OF LIGHT through my music, words & tee designs, a tapestry is woven throughout the message of my music, book and my tees. I want to shine LIGHT that unifies all cultures through celebrating our differences and diversities. After all.... We ARE WORLD CITIZENS and my world music, words and tees frame our lives in a setting that is rich and inspiring, deep and desiring to be more. LOVE WILL FIND A WAY! My heart is saying add 2 more tracks. I love the number 3, so here ya go! On SHE NEVER ASKS (written by Dorie Pride/Kamau Seitu), we added Ed Robinson on keyboards and Tomaree Tarpley onbackground vocals.ALL I WANNA DO (words & music- Dorie Pride). I am glad you asked! I need financial support to finish these projects! I am completely out of resources. The CD - LOVE WILL FIND A WAY has been recorded but needs to be mixed, mastered and duplicated, as well as art work, promotion and marketing cost. Every contribution matters! Every single dollar makes a difference! I understand the value of a penny. It is the same energy that makes up a million dollars! You can't have a million dollars without a penny first! So I don't despise the small beginnings because they mount up to big successes! From my heart - THANK YOU ALLfor whatever you are lead to contribute to my grass root movement of A LOVE REVOLUTION! SPIRIT TALK/SOUL WALK has been written and art work completed, but I need to be formatted andprinted.

I am also an Author. I have just completed recording my 10 track sophomore CD - LOVE WILL FIND A WAY. In addition I have also penned a book entitled SPIRIT TALK /SOUL WALK. I am likened to Johnnie Apple Seed; spreading my SEEDS OF LIGHT every where I go and in every thing I do. SEEDS OF LIGHT flow through my music, my books and my WORLD CITIZEN tee shirts! I am an INDIE ARTIST with a cool eclectic blend of WORLD/POP/ROCK/ JAZZ music. Spirit and music merge together for me. They are one and the same to me.RUNAWAY is the very first single off my sophomore CD PRODUCED BY: KAMAU SEITU. I wrote the music and lyrics, co/produced and played acoustic rhythm guitar while Kamau played electric and acoustic guitars and beautiful killer solos! Mike Tarpley rounded out the music beautifully, blowin' his heart out on Soprano and Tenor Sax.    Click arrow below to hear The Single! - RUNAWAY: I am very committed to living a life that fulfills my purpose on planet earth. That purpose is making great music that stirs the heart and provokes thoughts which will challenge people's consciousness and wake them up. I write and sing words that entice, invite and open unconscious eyes to see the bigger purpose of our lives; to think outside ourselves and help fill in the cracks of our sleeping souls with COMPASSION, HOPE, ACCEPTANCE and LOVE! My greatest love is music! It is my oxygen and it is my medicine. Music, being universal can speak to every heart that has an ear to hear and a soul that can perceive intention. My pure intent is to be a LIGHT in a dark space for someone who is searching. Through my words and music, I am very confident that I am on track with my mission. I desire to create a grass roots movement of LOVE - (Ala 60'sFlower Power Movement) through the power of love, by way of compassion through my world conscious music.My heart is saying add 2 more tracks. I love the number 3, so here ya go! On SHE NEVER ASKS (written by Dorie Pride/Kamau Seitu), we added the flavorful keyboardstylings of Ed Robinson and powerhouse Tomaree Tarpley singing background vocals on SO MUCH TROUBLE IN THE WORLD and CHEAP THRILL.ALL I WANNA DO (words & music- Dorie Pride). I am glad you asked! I need financial support to finish my work! I have re-launched my LOVE WILL FIND A WAY PROJECT breaking it down into three individual entities. I want to bring clarity to what I am attempting to do through this new campaign.This Love Will Find A Way CD Campaign (Phase 1) is different than my Love Will Find A Way Project. The first campaign Love Will Find A Way Project encompassed three in one as 'A Project' covering 3 different things: CD - Love Will Find A Way, Book- Spirit Talk/Soul Walk and World Citizen merchandise as one entity and Reward..The ($21,000) asking pledge covered the cost of all three under PROJECT.The LOVE WILL FIND A WAY SOPHOMORE CD(Phase 1) has been recorded but needs to be mastered and duplicated, as well as art work, promotion and marketing cost. I have reset my pledge goal to a bare minimum pledge of $2,500 (as this is an all or nothing campaign) to hopefully ensure a successful outcome that could spill over and possibly cover the additional cost needed to complete the promotional and marketing cost.of the CD. Phase 2 will be my book - SPIRIT TALK/SOUL WALK (promotion & marketing cost are needed) and Phase 3 is the- WORLD CITIZEN merchandise. All three projects will have separate Rewards which will be honored within the time frame designated. Every contribution matters! Every single dollar makes a difference!

https://www.kickstarter.com/projects/536587459/priscilla-and-her-magic-socks?ref=discovery_category_newest,536587459/priscilla-and-her-magic-socks,"Meet Priscilla, a beautiful, young golden retriever.  She is a puppy at heart, sweet and innocent. She enjoys spending her days napping, eating and playing.  That is until one day, when playing outside, a band of squirrels decides to make it their mission to torment her, hurling acorns and generally being just plain mean. When Priscilla gets a visit from her Fairy Dog-Mother, the tables are finally turned.  The gift of a set of Magic Socks gives Priscilla the ability to hop through the trees and rid them of the bushy-tailed bullies.Priscilla and Her Magic Socks is a unique 2D platforming adventure featuring painted storybook graphics, hand drawn traditional cel style animation and a light hearted original storyline.  With the sensibilities of a children’s animated adventure, Priscilla and her Magic Socks is a game for everyone. Simple touch gameplay makes it accessible for anyone to pick up and try, while its depth and challenge will keep the big kid in all of us coming back for more.Priscilla and her Magic Socks is designed to take advantage of the touch interfaces of mobile and tablet devices and is planned for initial introduction for iPhone and iPad.  With your help, Priscilla and her Magic Socks will be wrapped up in time to launch in November 2013.Traditional platformers come hand in hand with what has become the standard control scheme; a directional pad for movement, a button for jumping, another for shooting.  While this is great for console games and experienced gamers, it does present limitations when it comes to the mobile market.  And how much fun can a game really be if it is difficult just to learn how to play?When I say that Priscilla is a simple dog, I don’t mean that as an insult in any way.  She enjoys her toys, loves to be pet, and will do anything for a treat.  Pretty nice, huh?I thought that playing with such a simple dog should be, well, simple.  Priscilla and her Magic Socks can be played with one finger.   Imagine the intuitive gameplay of a certain disgruntled avian franchise incorporated into a platforming game.  It doesn’t get any easier. No onscreen joystick. No jump and fire and power-up buttons. Just a simple touch interface that makes this a game that can be played anywhere, on screens large and small.Yet, while the gameplay is simple, the game itself is rich and immersive.  Players can play however they want.  Just want to complete a level?  Go for it.  Want to try to get all of the level specific achievements?  They are there for the taking.  Beating time limits, knocking out squirrels, collecting dog treats, power-ups and more give this simple dog a lot to do.  Throw in a variety of mini games and Priscilla’s adventures stay fresh and exciting.A dog can’t spend all of her time chasing squirrels.  So, what does she do with her down time?  And what does she do with all of those treats that she’s collected during her adventures?There’s no place to take a rest quite like the comfort of home, and, for Priscilla, that means her dog house.  Go inside to go through toys that she’s collected, take a look at her level statistics (boring!), and even go shopping.  Visit her favorite store to spend the treats you’ve accumulated to pick out new toys - tennis balls, squeak toys and more.  Collecting toys makes a dog happy, and a happy dog can generally do more.  Acquiring collectibles enable you to enhance how you play the game.  Make power ups last longer.  Jump higher.  Increase your score multiplier.  All of her toys help her along on her adventure.But one little dog house can only hold so much, so Priscilla can spend some of her treats to upgrade to a bigger, better house.  Houses come in different themes and sizes,  and each theme opens up new toy possibilities.Throw in the aforementioned mini games and Priscilla has a chance to get even more treats to spend.  Reaching certain level goals unlocks these, introducing new gameplay mechanics to an already rich world.With all of these options available, as you help Priscilla through her story, it becomes your story as well!Fish Potato Games is Alan Thomas. I’ve been working as a designer and programmer for the last 16 years, working on projects with companies like Marvel Comics, Children’s Television Workshop and more.I grew up playing video games. I love them. I still play them to this day, I am not ashamed to admit. I find them to be a great way to unwind sometimes after a hard day's work. Deciding to take the plunge and become an indie game developer was really a no-brainer for me. To be able to take advantage of the current marketplace and create games that others can enjoy is a dream come true. To potentially make a living doing so would be gravy. Delicious gravy.The other love of my life (aside from my wife. Sorry, Dear!) is Priscilla, the real-life inspiration for this game. She is an endless bundle of joy, sometimes even when she is sleeping. She loves everyone and everything. Except squirrels. My god, this dog hates squirrels! I don’t understand why. But, on one of our walks, as yet another squirrel got away and up a tree, I thought to myself, “There is a game in this.”  The seed was planted and Priscilla and her Magic Socks was born.I launched my first game, BigFish, earlier this year to positive reviews. GameSkinny described it as “...quick and fun. The play is one part action and two parts thinking, which is my kind of style. A +.”I’ve taken the lessons learned then and am applying them here. Up until now, I have been entirely self-funded. I’ve taken the time to experiment with gameplay mechanics and character design to develop what I feel is the solid foundation for a great and unique game. And, while I have come a long way, I need help for that last push to successfully finish and help Priscilla reach her full potential.The funding will go a long way.  There are certain things that I can’t do without it, things like the in game music and some of the marketing.  And, of course, I need the time to do all of the programming, level design, illustration and animation necessary to complete this.Kickstarter takes a small cut from my total and so does Amazon. I also lose a bit to Income Tax and making and shipping physical rewards costs a bit of money, but I've accounted for all of these in my minimum goal.While the game is initially slated for iOs release, additional funding will go towards the hardware and other resources needed for converting this for the Android platform.What you see in its current form is the culmination of about a month and a half of work.  I am confident that, with your help, this game will be a fine polished gem that anyone would be happy to play.I appreciate your contributions towards making Priscilla and her Magic Socks a reality, and I’d like to give you something in return.  In addition to getting a free copy of the full version of the game, I want to honor all contributors by listing them in the game’s credits.As the pledge amounts grow, so do the rewards.  Each pledge also receives the rewards from the previous tier! So, a $250 pledge will get a signed art print, a t-shirt, the digital art book, the in game add-on pack, plus the full version of the game and your name listed in the game’s credits.  All of this, plus the satisfaction of knowing that you helped bring this labor of love to fruition.","Developing a game is a very fluid process, and bringing a game from initial concept to its final form is very often a process of discovery.  Technical limitations and hurdles invariably arise, and ideas need to evolve when this happens.  Sometimes, these unexpected challenges wind up inspiring new ideas.  But the time that this takes affects a small, indie developer more so than a large company.A clear vision is perhaps the most important part of any project.  I’ve done my best to define the game’s most unique and difficult features first.  I’ve also set a high standard for the graphic style of the game in order to insure the unique, high-quality experience that I’ve promised.  I will remain dedicated to that promise and be transparent throughout the whole development process.",https://www.kickstarter.com/projects/536587459/sweet-revenge-tilt-tap-swing-and-shoot-candy?ref=discovery_category_newest,536587459/sweet-revenge-tilt-tap-swing-and-shoot-candy,"Get ready for all out action and fun as Mack Masher, 80’s action movie star (and tooth) goes on a quest for vengeance against the candy that killed his best friend! Rappel down building after building, unleashing a flurry gunfire and explosions, collecting coins and lottery tickets along the way. Revenge was never so sweet!Sweet Revenge will be available end of December 2014/January 2015 for iOS devices.Making a game like this is a labor of love with a twist of demented humor and a pinch of programs stuff. It costs money to make. Not always a lot, but precious moola nonetheless.Once it is made, the hard part is getting people to see it. Hundreds of Flappy Bird clones hit the App Store every day, so it is tough to get a game like this to stand out in such a crowded marketplace.The solution? Marketing. And marketing costs money. And that is where you and your generous contribution come into play. A small marketing budget, like what I am trying to raise here, can go a long way. There are people and companies out there that are quite good at getting exposure for quality games like this. Your money will come to me and I will use it to make Sweet Revenge the success that it deserves to be.Other things, like music and sound effects, also play a big part in a game like this. A portion of the proceeds from this campaign will be dedicated to that.And just think! When this takes off, you'll be able to tell your friends that had a helping hand in making this game soar.Thanks for taking the time to check out Sweet Revenge. Thanks even more if you contributed! And be sure to share this campaign with your friends. Then check back for updates and news on the inevitable release date.Thanks again!","This project is currently in the beta phase and is tentatively scheduled for a release some time in the next month.With that, there really is no risk that this game won't be released.  A large part of the success is going to be getting the marketing exposure that the game needs.  That is where the challenges lie and why this funding is so important."

But in the end it would prove to be a dissatisfied and empty life.

https://www.kickstarter.com/projects/1168717316/cuba-branded?ref=discovery_category_newest,1168717316/cuba-branded,"Hello! My name is Emily Lozano andI’m a freelance graphic designer in Chicago specializing in Print and Package Design. Cuba:Branded is a project that explores that state of Branding in a communistcountry where everything is owned by the state. I plan to travel to Cuba andphotograph examples of branding including Packaging, Printed Materials and Storefronts. From these I’ll create a set of 20 full color4 x 6 postcards.My parents were born in Cuba in 1930.My Dad was one of two kids and my Mom was one of 9. While I was growing up Iheard countless stories about what it was like in Cuba before Castro. The food,the parties and the freedoms which we would consider normal. My Dad also told me about how he waspart of the CIA’s attempts to overthrow Castro. He did this for about 4 years, two years on the island and two years living in Florida and traveling secretlybetween the two countries. Finally he decided to escape in a little boat withmy Mom and 2 older sisters. Their lives very nearly ended that night. Thesestories were thrilling to me as a kid and still are and they kept Cuba alivefor us.Eventually my family moved to Chicagoand settled in to American life. A little later I came along. I grew up likeany American kid surrounded by branding. Like a lot of kids I was told to cleanmy plate because there were starving children who would be grateful for food.But for me that kid was my cousin Anabel. She was about my age and news fromCuba always brought news about what Anabel was doing. I grew up always thinkingabout her parallel life in Cuba.Cuba:Brandedis an extension of my curiosity about Anabel’s parallel life. I grew up here,surrounded constantly by brands with new ones popping up all the time and evenhelping to create some. I spend a lot of time thinking about brand loyalty andhow consumers make choices based on brands. But what is Anabel’s experience ofbrands?In a country where the state owns andmakes everything, what happens to brands? One interesting example is Bacardi.It was a Cuban brand that moved to Puerto Rico after the revolution. But theyare still making rum at the old Bacardi location. What does that label looklike? While I’m there I’ll take photos ofCuban “brands” including product packaging, printed materials and storefronts.I’ve taken a few sample photos around Chicago’s Logan Square neighborhood togive you a feel of what I plan to do in Cuba.I expect to find some established,well-executed brands and a lot of Mom and Pop type brands. I’ll collect onlyCuban made products and will try to meet with the artists who work on thebrands, if I’m allowed.I also want to talk to Cubans abouthow they make choices and if brands enter into that equation. Do they have morethan one kind of product? Are some brands better than others? There are manybrands of Cigars, but is there more than one kind of coffee? Sugar? Doesbranding influence choices or is it all about price and availability?Since I’ll be photographing thebrands we’ll get to see what the aesthetics are. Is the look of brands stuck inthe 50s or have other countries influenced the commercial art there? How is theart made? What’s the design process like? The finished product will be20 4 x 6 postcards printed on 100# recycled paper (cardstock) and collected into a box with a full color sleeve.I plan to print these in May or June of 2012.I plan to travel in the Spring of 2012 and I hope to stay one or two weeks. Mysister will be joining me to help with legal questions and translating, and sothat I am not traveling alone. I’ll keep an online blog while I’m theredocumenting what I find out and post photos and videos along the way.Your funding will help with:• Travel expenses to Cuba (flights areabout $1500)• Travel within Cuba (taxis, car rental etc)• Photography supplies (memory cards etc)• Hotel stays (while I can stay with family in Matanzas I’ll need to spend some time in Havana as well.)• Product purchases to photograph (I’ll need to purchase food and other  householditems to photograph the packaging)• Printing costs for the postcards and box (about $3,000)Anything above the goal will helpprovide a longer stay, better equipment, more product purchases, better quality paper for the cards and possibly morepostcards for the set. Right now I plan on printing 20 but I could up that to 24 per set.I realize this project is very expense heavy because of the travel. I've tried to make the rewards fair without breaking my budget. If you contribute at $500 or more I will bring back an awesome souvenir for you — something I will find it hard to part with!If you'd like to have extra sets of the 20 Postcards please add on $5 for each set. At the end of the funding cycle you'll have a chance to indicate the quantities you'd like.Please add $5 for shipping to Canada.Please add $10 for shipping outside of US or Canada.I’m sure I will come back with morephotos than I can publish at one time so this may lead to a Volume Two. Feel free to contact me with anyquestions and please help spread the word.

The final product will be a book ofphotographs that will give the reader an idea of what daily life inCuba is like.As an American-born Cuban I grew upsurrounded and influenced by brands before I could even articulate what a brandwas. From the cereal we eat to the cars we drive our lives can be roughlydescribed through the brands we prefer. Coke or Pepsi. Cubs or Sox. Democrat orRepublican.My plan is to document Cuban lifethrough these very broad brand categories. It’s a chance to look at Cuba in away that has not been done before — through branding. I’ve taken a few samplephotographs around Chicago (as well as some stock photos of Cuba) to give youan idea for the layout of the book.HistoryCuba is in a very special time in itshistory. Changes are slowly starting to happen. Bigger changes are bound tocome, as inevitable as death. I want to capture ordinary Cuban life before theend of this era. I want to talk to Cubans about what life has been like underCastro and document it before it becomes history.When the inevitable happens, the USwill be called upon, or feel compelled to act but first we need to educateourselves about the island we’ve been forbidden to visit. We need to see whatthe reality on the ground is so that we can act appropriately. My part in thisis small, but with your help it can be a step towards better understanding.Parallel LivesMy cousin Anabel was raised on theisland. The thought of her always fascinated me because she was living myparallel life in Cuba and I was living hers here. When I was admonished tofinish everything on my plate because there were hungry children, it wasAnabel. When I was reminded to be grateful for awful tasting medicine becauseothers were going without, it was Anabel. To me, she is the face of Cuban life.While I’m there I’ll spend time with her and talk to her about what choicesshe’s able to make and see how they compare to my life. I’m betting thatbecause we’re family she’ll trust me enough to give me honest answers and notthe propaganda Cubans are taught to give to tourists. Hopefully this will leadto truths that most American travelers would not discover.How To PledgeThank you so much for taking the timeto consider this Kickstarter.

Along with giving thanks for our own blessings, we take time to remember the plight of those less fortunate than ourselves.There are many reputable humanitarian organizations engaged in projects worthy of our support. In addition to the focuses of these conventional institutions, this is also when punk rock can be the most sorely needed in many communities.In the milder months many bands take to the road to alleviate the ennui and feelings of alienation of the younger generation, but as the cold sets in and roads become more perilous, many of these musician-altruists are forced to return to their menial day jobs and rehearsal spaces to wait out the long dark months.And so, in our mission to deliver authentic and high-quality rock and roll to the youth, this winter Dislich will be embarking on a hibernal outreach mission, but WE NEED YOUR HELP!Our route","This is where your help comes in.Because of Dislich's dedication to providing pure, unadulterated punk with negligible commercial potential, we rely on the support of conscientious individuals to aid in our efforts. We are entirely a Not-Profitable Organization*. And as such, our risks and challenges are mostly financial.This means that beyond the dedication and pitiful optimism of band members, a rock tour requires significant input of tangibles such as gasoline, auto-parts and repair, and of course, sandwiches. 100% of your donation will help us to pay for fuel, rations, and equipment vital to our relief effort.We expect to require 15 tanks of gas to complete our planned 4275-mile excursion. Necessary upgrades to our '96 Dodge Caravan mobile command center will be a new radiator (which was destroyed by a renegade deer), a set of snow tires, and a towing hitch. And the acquisition of a small trailer would provide space in order for us to bring along amplifiers, greatly increasing the efficacy of our delivery.

Currently, the collection is at over 500 copies (we haven't counted in awhile; it's boring).To this end, the WSP purchased its very own bus in 2012 with the express purpose of converting our bus into a small scale replica of the bus in the film Speed.This bus will be used for a national tour wherein the WSP will display the collection at gallery showings, county fairs, diy punk basement shows, collector's conventions, and the like; as well as hunt for VHS copies hidden all over the U.S. and World.Project 2525: The World Speed Project Bus Conversion, then, is the first phase in the overall project. Through Project 2525, we hope to raise the funds necessary to complete all the repairs and painting to convert our bus into a likeness of the bus from the film. Hence Project 2525, is a derivation of the bus number in the film.The WSP's bus is a 1988 Dodge Ramvan B350 van converted to a bus. The van was originally used as a patient shuttle for a small outpatient clinic in Spokane, Washington. The van has seating for 14 passengers, as well as a genuine bus door that must be operated using a handle by the driver. In other words, it's a real bus.Currently, the van needs a few minor repairs to prevent its overheating a la vapor lock. It is estimated that the $2,500 we're asking for will cover both the engine repair and the paint job. Any additional funds accrued will go solely toward upgrades on the van, as the $2,500 is bare minimum needed to repair the engine and paint the van alone.In addition to the engine repair and paint job, the van needs new tires, a new engine cover, holes in the floor sealed, various repairs to the body, and the windows tinted to protect the copies from sun damage during travel. Every donation goes toward things of this nature.We at the World Speed Project are asking you to help us complete the first phase of our project.

https://www.kickstarter.com/projects/cartycinema/the-shark-feature-film?ref=discovery_category_newest,cartycinema/the-shark-feature-film,"Inspired by the sharksploitation films of the 1970s and 80s, THE SHARK (scheduled to shoot June 2016) is an action packed adventure story about a man, a shark, and a thirst for revenge. Written by Brannon Carty and story by Carty & Dylan Dang, this thriller shark feature will bring the genre back to reality, have a more practical approach, and stay far away from the likes of SHARKNADO. A RetroVision Entertainment, LLC Production.It's JAWS meets JAMES BOND in this action-packed suspense thriller. Vicarstown has been invaded by the ultimate predator -- a ten foot Great White shark! Upon the death of a loved one, local Marine Biology professor, Peter Diller, is accused of murder. His initial cry of “shark” is disregarded by the unconvinced law enforcement, but suspicions change as more locals begin to disappear and the body count climbs. Together, they fish for clues related to the townspeople's deaths. With a mayor on temporary leave, and his pro-tem assistant, Mr. Lewis, in charge, the deaths are covered up to keep the townspeople from prying into what’s hidden beneath the surface: a sunken treasure. As Peter and the sheriff, Frank Hammer, discover the secrets related to the shark and the sudden presence of the certain suspicious figures, they also realize there's more to the situation than meets the eye. It all leads up to a spectacular showdown between the town and the shark.What initially began as a 12 page short-story, became a 120-page finalized screenplay in a matter of years. Carty, obsessed with the shark-film genre, decided to revitalize and regenerate the 'Summer of the Shark' with his very own entry to the film world: THE SHARK.Instead of utilizing an overload of JAWS homages and a plague of CG, Carty went a different route and handpicked the most notable elements from the past 40 years of shark films and combined them with new, innovative ideas.Unlike more recent entries in the genre such as SHARKNADO, GHOST SHARK, and the upcoming HOUSE SHARK, this film is not relying on a gimmick; rather, THE SHARK will offer a much-needed breath of fresh air for fans of the genre. The story is full of adventure, drama, and thrilling suspense!Here we are, four years after the initial conceptualization of the premise, and the time has come to put paper onto film. With your help, together we can bring seriousness and quality back into the shark-film genre.This film is not meant to swim in the shadow of the ultimate shark film we all know and love. Rather, it is to pay tribute to the legacy of films that came before it, while presenting a new path for shark films with NO CG-elements and focus on deep, emotional character development.Mike Malloy (Sumarai Cop 2) as PETER DILLERLover of the ocean and its creatures, Peter Diller is a marine-biology professor at the local university. While not his dream job, he's happy with his life and soon-to-be wife, until one fateful day when a shark terrorizes his world.L.J. Sargent (Every Dog)as SHERIFF FRANK HAMMERSheriff Frank Hammer is an experienced headstrong officer of the law on the hunt to find two men who harmed his family many, many years ago. While up to his neck in the investigation of the shark attacks, he realizes that the two men are closer to him than he thinks.Amanda Cook(One Tree Hill) as KIRA DILLERSister of Professor Diller, she's the hands-on one in the family. Having been the role model for Peter, they both went into Marine Biology -- albeit different fields. While more extroverted and tactful than her brother, they both share an equal love for the ocean. Little does she know, she's going to change her brother's life.W. Scott Parker III (The Polar Bear Club)as DR. IAN WESTA world-renowned marine biologist ruined by his poor life choices, Dr. West is on the run trying to remain hidden from men who want him dead. However, it will be much harder than he could have ever possibly imagined.Keith Rafalko (Iron Man 3) as MICHAEL SORENSONDrunk by day, passed out by night; Michael (Mikey for short) is the go-to local fisherman. While famous in the town for his tall-tales of his daily catchings, he's a short man with a short temper that will detonate if pressured. Despite his unpleasantness, he's the best there is and will even sabotage others to make sure it stays that way.Gary Pezzullo (Fix It In Post) as SAM R. LEWISA man who's heart is where his wallet is, Sam Lewis is the mayor's right-hand man who is in too deep, and too much of a pushover to change his ways. While the mayor is on vacation, Sam decides to try to run the town himself, even if it means covering up the shark attacks.Lucas Cardona (Holy Matrimony) as MATTHEW BOYDBrother and henchman to Franz Boyd, Matthew is a combative businessman who is sent to Vicarstown to collect some money from a not-so-honest friend. Upon arriving in town, his criminal record begins to slowly catch up with him.Michael Forest (The Shark Hunter)as DON JENNINGSVicarstown's famed controversial radio personality -- Jennings is known for hitting where it hurts his interviewees. Amidst the mystery of the shark, he uses his wit to keep his listeners informed, even if it means some rather tasteless jokes.ALSO FEATURINGEnzo G. Castellari and his very own son, Andrea Girolami, are signed for the film in soon-to-be-announced roles! More information will come over the course of the Kickstarter.While modern 'shark films' rely solely on CG to simulate their aquatic villains, THE SHARK went a completely different route and commissioned a mechanical shark prop from Mike V. Schultz of SHARK CITY OZARK. The first part built was a 5-foot tall shark head with movable jaws. Second, a life-size dorsal and tail fin were molded and built. Finally, to top it off, a full 4-ft long miniature shark was also molded. All three props will be used to let the actors interact with an ""actual shark"" and make the performance much more believable. We're going entirely practical, no CG!THE SHARK is not only pioneering the microbudget shark-film genre, it is also one of the few feature films to be shot entirely on the Blackmagic Cinema Camera in 2.5k RAW. This camera is revolutionizing independent cinema by allowing filmmakers to shoot industry quality video for a fraction of the price!The man behind this revolutionary camera will beTHE SHARK's talented Director of Photography: Darin Holiday. Having been experienced with a variety of Blackmagic Design's cameras, Holiday is the perfect man for the job.The film's aspect ratio will be 2.39:1, and due to shooting non-anamorphically, vertical resolution will be lost when cropping. It is imperative to shoot in 2.5k to make a high quality 2k DCP in the end.Brannon Carty - Writer & DirectorBrannon Carty is a fresh, new name to the expansive film world. In 2013, he founded RetroVision Entertainment, LLC, an independent film production & distribution company that has been involved in the production and global distribution of three independent features. Carty has also been involved in the production of over a dozen local shorts, HANK VS. THE UNDEAD; LIAR; GREAT WHITE: THE LEGACY; and namely his German short from 2015: MAN VERSUS MURDER, based off the crime films of the 1970s. That same year, Carty won second place in a national film competition conducted by SkillsUSA and placed first in the regional competition. For over three years, he has been penningTHE SHARKscript while majoring in film studies at UNCG.Mike Malloy - Screenplay Consultant & ActorMike Malloy is an acknowledged expert on tough-guy movies, having been interviewed in cinema documentaries & written film books; this led to opportunities in acting and screenwriting. He also put in a draft for the official, upcoming sequel to the legendary DJANGO film, and also produced/starred inTHE SCARLET WORM, which featured four Spaghetti Western veterans in the cast. His cameo in SAMURAI COP 2 is currently playing theatrically, and his role in the feature HOT LEAD HARD FURY pairs him as cop partners with '70s kung-fu star Ron Van Clief. He has other action screenplays under option by producers. He brings years of writing and acting experience to the role of Peter Diller and to his function as screenplay consultant.Dan Sellers - ProducerDan Sellers is a director and producer based out of Greensboro, NC. His company Wreak Havoc Films has been responsible for three independent projects so far:HANK VS. THE UNDEAD, DARK HEAT, SAMMIE THE COMIC BOOK MAN. He will take on the producer role of the film. Seller's experience with meeting production deadlines and asset management will bring a timely schedule to the film's production.Michael McCormack - ComposerMichael McCormack arranges, performs and customizes original music for film, television, internet and video productions. His scoring capabilities span a variety of genres ranging from classical, romantic symphonic to modern ""electronic"" music. McCormack's portfolioincludes Universal Studio's recently licensedJAWS documentary: THE SHARK IS STILL WORKING, LAMP POST LANE, THE AGONIST, and the 2015 Godzilla documentary HAIL TO THE KING! Michael will provide the original score for THE SHARK.Mike V. Schultz - Special EffectsThe Schultz family of SHARK CITY OZARK have been in the SPFX business for over 20 years quietly sculpting, molding, and casting museum quality pieces for satisfied clients demanding nothing but the best. The most recent focus of SCO has been the legendary Great White Shark. Mike's credits include SyFy's GHOST SHARK, BEAST OF THE BERING SEA, andRAGIN' CAJUN REDNECK GATOR. For the film, Mike and his family have provided the titular Great White menace and a many other additional props for the film.ALSO FEATURINGThe funds you are graciously donating towards this ambitious production will go towards nothing BUT the production. With the camera, some equipment, and shark props already paid for, more money is needed to help keep our actors paid, fed, and motivated to make for one hell of a movie.The money will also go towards storage as the 12-bit RAW files take up humongous amounts of space! To future proof our work, it is imperative to shoot in a resolution higher than 1080p. During post production, storage will be huge asset!Additionally, lighting is very important in film. We are going to put the funds raised into purchasing better equipment to light our film properly, as it won't look any good if lighting isn't paid any attention to. This also helps out faithful DP, Darin Holiday, create the mood of the image through the density of the shot.Finally, the funds will go towards additional equipment to improve the quality of our production such as better microphones and better rigs to keep the camera steady.From my own wallet, I have already invested over $10k (camera, software, equipment, etc) into this film over the past years, and now, I ask for your help to assist me in finishing what I started.Let us bring back the Summer of the Shark once again -- and put an end to schlock CG nonsense!Your time and donations are sincerely appreciated.Brannon CartyFollow #THESHARK online!iMDB: The SharkFacebook: SharkFilmWebsite: RetroVision Entertainment","No matter what poses as an obstacle to our production, my team and I are 100% confident and will do anything in our power to have a final cut by December 2016 (when the perks will be delivered), ready for a full-scale release by Spring 2017. We are starting this campaign early to help us prepare and have funds to make sure we are well prepared. You can also pre-order your personal copy of the film by contributing $20.During production, we may have issues working with our shark prop.

LET'S SEE IF WE CAN REACH OUR FINAL STRETCH GOAL OF $7,500!THESE EXTRA FUNDS WILL ALLOW US TO FUND OUR AUSTRALIAN UNIT, SO WE CAN INCLUDE FANS FROM AROUND THE WORLD.WE HAVE ALSO ADDED BRAND NEW PERKS ($5, $25, $35).(The video above is a short teaser for the film, featuring music by composer Will Wilkie.)You know the stories, but do you know the fans?“Thomas & Friends” began as a series of books in the 1940s, albeit under the formal title of “The Railway Series.” Wilbert Awdry, the author, created these colorful characters to educate children around the world on the inner workings of railways. Come the 1980s, the books were then adapted for television and became an instant success. Since then, “Thomas” has remained the most iconic children’s television series to date. No matter where you are in the world, you will always find someone who knows the iconic blue tank engine.Despite being aimed at younger audiences, the television series garnered the following of a very unlikely demographic: adult men and women.Yes, you read that right. Adult men and women.You’ve met the Bronies, now meet the Tankies, Bro-comotives, etc (the hypothetical fandom name is still a point of contention). The adult “Thomas” fandom found an online presence in the early 2000s through sites such as Sodor Island Forums. As both the internet and fandom evolved, they banded together and flocked to YouTube and TV.com, growing more and more prominent every day.Fast forward to 2020, the community has not stopped growing and is a force to be reckoned with. Fandom meetups are occurring all over the world, fans are preserving props from the television series, and some have even managed to work on the series itself as both writers and railway consultants.Their passion is strong, their love is unapologetic. They are ""Thomas"" fans.Who are these people? Where did they come from? Do they feel normal?These questions prompted me to make a documentary on the origins of this rather unlikely fandom. Through my travels, I have met some extraordinary people from every corner of the world. Each fan brings something different to the table. Some are railway enthusiasts, some are hardcore collectors, and some are even aspiring filmmakers. No matter their background, they all share a common bond: an undying passion for “Thomas.” This documentary will examine the reasons behind their continued love of the franchise as well as the societal repercussions of being an adult ""Thomas"" fan.But it's not just fans that are sitting down for the film, there are one or two surprise guests that have worked on the series itself.This is where YOU come in.For the better part of a year, I have been traveling the entire United States to witness these meetups and interview fans, all self funded. I've been able to shoot a total of 24 interviews, assemble a rough cut, and hire a composer for the film. But the story isn't complete.Being that the fandom is all over the world and ""Thomas"" is of British origin, I simply cannot include only American fans. In an effort to be as comprehensive as possible, I am currently gearing up to travel to the United Kingdom in May to finish off the last set of interviews. As one can imagine, solely producing this documentary has proven to be an expensive venture. Hotels, flights, camera equipment, crew pay, etc.With your help, I can finish shooting the film without sacrificing quality. My plan is shoot a handful of interviews in the United Kingdom, where ""Thomas"" originated.There, I will sit down and talk to key players in the development of the fandom such as Ryan Hagan of Sodor Island Forums -- a vital component to this documentary. I will also be visiting the ""Thomas"" theme park at Drayton Manor, and also make a pilgrimage to the home of the creator himself: Wilbert Awdry.Then and only then, will I have what I need to finish editing the film, and get it ready in time for its August 2020 release date.The money raised through Kickstarter will go towards the following: recouping various travel costs to the United Kingdom, long term storage of all the footage shot, and final post production work (i.e. mixing, scoring, color grading, etc).A percentage of funds will also be allocated for sending the final product to film festivals, so the world can find out about the adult “Thomas” fandom.We want to reward you for helping support our cause. Below is just a sample of some of the perks we will be giving backers.There's more to come as we reach August 2020. Stay tuned!Okay, let's back up for a second. Let me introduce myself.I'm Brannon Carty, a 23 year old independent filmmaker with a BA in filmmaking from the University of North Carolina - Greensboro. My skill set lies in both cinematography and directing, but I love all aspects of the process.Since childhood, I have always had a camera in my hands, filming whatever I could find. This love for filmmaking has taken me on journeys I never thought I would experience. To say that filmmaking is my passion would be an understatement.Currently, I run my own production company titled Requiem Pictures LTD, which specializes in documentary production. This film is the first of many to come under this banner. Not to mention that there is also a Spaghetti Western documentary on the horizon...!If you are interested in seeing more of my work, please visit my site www.cartycinema.com.Your contribution goes a long way in helping make this film the best it can be, and I promise you that you’ve never seen anything like this before!Thank you, and please -- be a really useful engine and spread the word about our cause!","We are currently aiming for an August 2020 release date. That being said, films always run the risk of not being finished on time. To keep everyone motivated and happy, I will be posting various post-production updates through Kickstarter, as well as posting exclusive clips from the final film."

Initially, I had an idea of how this deck would look, but I felt this deck has developed a mind of its own and she has been very strong at showing me people and experiences that she wants me to be influenced by and apply to the deck. I also noticed that whenever I would begin to work on a new card, I would experience the very essence of that card, and sometimes that message was a difficult one, making me realize things I hadn't noticed before. It's been a very spiritual experience creating this deck and I feel honored to be her creator. I can truly feel her energy and spirit and the messages she has to share are very powerful. She is taking me on a very profound personal growth journey!ABOUT ME:I was a graphic designer for apparel for over 10 years doing graphic t-shirt designs and allover textiles that sold in Victoria's Secret, Target, Disney, JCPenney, Nordstroms, Walmart and many more. Since becoming a full-time mom 4 and a half years ago, I have been on a new spiritual journey and I have fallen in love with oracle cards. This is my third card deck, my most popular was the My Quality Time self-care activity deck which was funded last year on Kickstarter.The deck is currently 56% complete (25 cards done out of 44) and that does not include writing the guidebook.This deck was born because growing up, I had really low self-esteem and self-worth. Even now, in my mid 30's I realize, I still struggle with self-worth. I also noticed many of my friends who are well beyond their 20's and 30's, have major self-esteem and self-worth issues. This inspired me to do something about it.I wanted to show women how beautiful they are inside and out and how unnoticed it is by them. We often look for confirmation and validation from others that we are beautiful or worthy, but it truly has to come from the inside.44 cardsTrump size (2.45” x 3.95”)400 gsm matte finishGilding (stretch goal; color to be determined)Magnet box (stretch goal)Guidebook (little white booklet/deck size) includes Personal Power Affirmations, Oracle message, Journal prompts***********NEW!

This is a very exciting time for us and we hope that you will consider joining us on our journey. Our fundraising efforts are almost complete and we look forward to sharing this historic moment with our friends in New York City. Please demonstrate your support for as little as £10.Combining theatre and spoken word, OUR FRIENDS THE ENEMYtakes place on The Western Front during Christmas 1914, when not even a World War could destroy the soldier's Christmas spirit. Private James Boyce tells a very different kind of Christmas story, of how, on a frigid Christmas Eve of World War I, British and German soldiers stopped their fighting and emerged from their trenches to spend Christmas together. They sang songs, exchanged gifts and even played a friendly game of soccer, only to go back to fighting one another days later. Our Friends The Enemy takes us on a magical and haunting journey through the remarkable 1914 Christmas Truce.British writer, Sir Arthur Conan Doyle, most known for his stories about Sherlock Holmes, described the Christmas truce as:'One human episode amid all the atrocities which have stained the memory of the war'.The Christmas Truce was a deeply moving moment of humanity in the most horrifying of circumstances. Fighting soldiers put down their weapons, defied the laws of man and defined humanity, just three months into a war that would eventually claim over 15 million lives. It is an important story which must not be forgotten as it still holds significant relevance in today's world, where conflict and war still rage throughout. We want to be able to share this story with an American audience in the hope it will bring the same level of reflection and inspiration which it has done already in the UK.""We all grew up with the story of soldiers from both sides putting down their arms to meet in no mans land on Christmas day 1914 - when gunfire remarkably gave way to gifts. It remains wholly relevant today as a message of hope and humanity, even in the bleakest of times. It is vital that 100 years on, we keep the Christmas Truce story alive'.- HRH Prince William“This is a Christmas story that I assume most Americans are not as familiar with, but it is a very relevant story to which we can all relate. We are thrilled to bring this important story to New York audiences'.- Producer, David AdkinOur Story So Far ...Having been fascinated by this story since childhood, Alex Gwyther, actor and playwright, began researching the truce and realised how undocumented these incredible stories were in popular media. Realising that the truce was more than a game of football with many more unbelievable stories and accounts across the Western Front, Alex wrote a spoken word poem entitled '24th December 1914', capturing some of these stories. Invited to write a piece of theatre, Alex developed the poem into a narrative poetic storyand Our Friends The Enemy premiered at the New Wimbledon Studio in 2013. The play went on to enjoy sell out runs at the Theatre 503 and the Edinburgh Fringe Festival before embarking on two UK tours, playing more than 70 performances to over 8000 people. It also included special performances in Ypres, Belgium for The Premier League.

It explores why 96% of all male rape cases go unreported and the pressures put on young men to live up to outdated ideals.It will premiere this summer at the Edinburgh Festival Fringe and I couldn't be more excited to share this important story with audiences! I will be presenting the show with the internationally renowned Underbelly in their Cowgate space 'Belly Laugh'. Other solo shows that premiered with Underbelly include Fleabag, Dust, Fabric and Anthony Rapp: Without You, so I am in good company.I have been developing the characters, story and script over a number of years and am now ready to share this creation with the world.After being raped in an unprovoked attack by a stranger, Jack steps into the absurd world of modern masculinity. We follow Jack's explosive, blistering journey as he tries to transform himself into a ‘real man’ in the hope he can deal with his trauma. How long can he convince himself that nothing happened? Will his past ever catch up with him?""The script is varied in its tone from comical and funny to poignant, harrowing and emotional. Some parts were fun to write, others required a very different mindset. I was fortunate enough to speak with Duncan Craig, the CEO of Survivors Manchester who confirmed statistics and provided me with a wealth of knowledge and understanding which was incredibly useful for the play, particularly with the more harrowing scenes."" Interview with Alex GwytherWe hope that RIPPED will instigate important discussions surround masculinity and dispel the stigma attached to male rape. It is an incredibly important story to tell, and Jack's journey is, unfortunately, not an uncommon one. 1 in 6 men have been sexually abused or assaulted at some point in their life and the vast majority of them choose not to come forward and speak out. We hope RIPPED will encourage more men to open up about their trauma.I am a writer, actor and poet based in London. RIPPED is my 4th play and is the 2nd play I have taken to the Edinburgh Fringe.When my first one man play Our Friends, the Enemy premiered at the Edinburgh Festival back in 2013, we were thrilled with both the audience and critical response the production received. The show, directed by Tom O'Brien, went on to tour the UK twice and subsequently enjoyed performances throughout Europe followed by a season at Theatre Row in New York City. Since then I have written two other plays, The Cost Of A Player (commissioned by The Premier League) and Eyes Closed, Ears Covered (shortlisted for 3 Off West End Awards).Director - Max LindsayMax is a brilliant director with credits including Angry (Southwark Playhouse), Foreign Goods 2 (Theatre 503), Consensual & The Odyssey (Nuffield Theatre) and Jimmy Jimmy (Omnibus Clapham). He has worked as an associate and assistant director to Daniel Evans, Rufus Norris, Blanche McIntyre and Tinuke Craig at venues such as The National Theatre, Chichester Festival Theatre and Plymouth Theatre Royal. He will soon be directing Tracy-Ann Oberman in Mother of Him at Park Theatre.Producer - Robin RaynerRobin Rayner is an experienced producer at the Fringe - this will be his fifth year. He has produced FABRIC, which won The Scotsman Fringe First Award and ventured out on a UK Tour. Last year he produced the five star cabaret hits TORI SCOTT IS #THIRSTY and ICONIC: A BRIEF HISTORY OF DRAG. In 2016 he produced hit comedy Foiled which was named five star Pick of the Fringe in The Stage, going on to become a major radio series for BBC Radio Wales. Robin is the Associate General Manager on the Olivier Awards for Society of London Theatre. He also produced the debut production of Our Friends, The Enemy so it's great to be working with him again.Press Manager - Alison DuguidAlison is a highly regarded PR consultant who has worked for Kenny Wax Family Entertainment Ltd, Society of London Theatre (Olivier Awards/Kids Week), Royal Court Theatre, The Union Theatre, Pauline Quirke Academies, PQA Studios, Ferris & Milnes, Ida Girls, West End Stage, Cardboard Citizens and Guildford Fringe Festival Theatre Company.We also have the brilliant Jack Weir as Lighting Designer and Jim Whitcher as Sound Designer.We are so pleased to have developed the show in collaboration with Survivors Manchester, an organisation that supports men who have been raped and sexually assaulted. We are also working with Break The Silence in Scotland throughout August.As I'm sure you are aware, it's very expensive to bring a show to the Edinburgh Fringe. I am looking to raise £2500 to go towards a total budget of £15,000. I have secured some other funding and I am personally putting in a lot of the money myself, but in order to give the production the best opportunity it deserves, I need to raise this bit more. That is where you come in! The below list includes just some of the things I need to spend money on.In return for your support we have an array of treats, gifts and experiences on offer, from signed retro posters to postcards and framed poems. We have tried to make the rewards as interesting as possible to ensure you receive something that is both enjoyable and 'one of a kind'.There were over 3400 productions last year, so we need all the help we can get to spread the word about RIPPED, sell some tickets and get people in to see the show. If you can support financially that is truly wonderful, but it is also extremely helpful to us if you just tell your friends about it! You can follow, talk about and share the show on social media >>FACEBOOK | TWITTER | INSTAGRAMThank you so much for taking the time to read, watch, share and support. Please help me take RIPPED to the Edinburgh Fringe so we can instigate important and constructive conversations surrounding masculinity. I look forward to taking you on this journey with me!With love and appreciation,Alexx","The main challenge with a show at the Edinburgh Festival, is getting an audience in to see the production. That said, with the team's extensive experience at the Fringe and having worked with Underbelly, Out of Hand, street teams and social media, we are in a strong position to face this challenge head on!"

After a lot more research on the subject it became quickly apparent that the various practices of using sound during  meditation, especially those around the chakra subtle energy system, actually make use of the sounds resonating vibration to “tune and balance” . While no real ""modern science” exists around this practice, its history is written in thousands historical documents that span many belief systems on a world wide scale.I made this for Myself out of curiosity and found it helped me.

https://www.kickstarter.com/projects/1983944424/deconstructing-the-world-one-levitation-at-a-time?ref=discovery_category_newest,1983944424/deconstructing-the-world-one-levitation-at-a-time,"Hi, I'm Nick Layton, a photographer from the south of England. I approach a shoot with the objective of creating stylish, contemporary, sometimes provocative and usually unique ART. For the past 6 months or so, I have been assembling a collection of my best images printed in one large book for the first time. The subject matter covers levitations, and chapters on freelensing and tasteful glamour. While I was writing the book, I realised not only did I need to show the images as large as possible on the page, but also to give some indication of how they were shot and edited, simply because if I were another photographer, I would want to know this. Hence the title, as I unravel the mechanics (with examples) and guide the reader through the process. However,whatever photographic technique is employed,there is no doubt that the real stars of the book are the models themselves.The book strikes a balance between image and information, for those who wish to pick up a camera and try out their own ideas, or those who may want to just enjoy the pictures. There are never before seen images, some behind the scenes, and a wealth of material - over 120 images (including screen shots). All of the images are sourced from the original files and many are displayed across two pages. And as a bonus, some of the images are available as postcards, posters, and canvas prints, via a range of offers on the right. English wise, the tone is lively and conversational, but also clear and straightforward forPhotography students and experts alike, covering the mostbasic Levitation to a shoot involving multiple elements.  Originally, the offering was to be a smaller softback, but the subject matter works best large. So I opted for a large coffee table book with a high quality paper offering. The sample I have is beautifully printed with a dust jacket, and the images look great. Everything you always wanted to know about levitation and other technically challenging photography but were too afraid to ask is right here. I'll show that armed with just an enquiring mind, a sense of adventure, and of course, a small step ladder (plus camera, tripod and friend if possible) you will have all you need to create these shots and have some fun on the way!  Levitation photography when mastered well is extremely rewarding. Putting this thing together has been an absolute labour of love. While I was writing, I was worried I would run out of stuff to say, actually, it was more a case of not being able to shut up about any aspect of the photography. I started shooting levitations intensively in 2011 and there are images dating back further. There is an awful lot of fun and passion, and an awful lot of me in it.  I know the target is high, most of that is printing costs which are down to the low numbers of copies. I really hope it meets that target. What will happen to funds?After printing, postage costs and storing the books are covered, what is left over will get re-invested into further shoots. If orders really take off, (600 book copies or more) I can afford a bigger print run (1000 as opposed to 750), invest in some additional equipment and pay an additional payment to ALL the models who appear. So, you wouldn't just be helping me but them as well. There are a fair amount of low and medium value options, but the book is the main event and I believe it is keenly priced for its size, finish and content. And who knows, it could even become a collector's item. Who is Nick Layton?I'm a Portrait, Event and Food photographer who also writes, edits and directs video. My work has been published in Canon marketing brochures, appeared on buses, on posters, web sites and magazines. I worked as a portrait studio photographer for a while but now I like to take my lights and find inspiration in the real World, whether a kitchen sink or a spare room or the forest.  ","I shot my last image for the book in a snooker hall on Thursday and this will be added to the book in the next week.  So the book is laid out, subject to very minor tweaks and final touches.Just a quick word on my thinking on the printingWhen I originally scoped this project, I ordered two copies of the book.  One which was 25 x 20 cm and an almost twice the size 33cm x 28cm version.  When I sat down with the smaller version, I just knew I wasn't doing justice to the images, whereas the larger one had images that popped off the page but the hardback cover was pushing up costs.  I wanted something that wouldn't sacrifice quality - give the images due reverence, without breaking the bank.   So, I have decided to concentrate on paper stock and image quality over a heavy hardback cover.  The final images will benefit from better paper, and postage costs will be reduced.  Packing costs are also being reduced by recycling cardboard used in the delivery of the books.  Finally, I have settled on a large landscape book with a luxury soft cover, a dust jacket and a high GSM high quality paper.  Importantly, the book will open flat as many images are printed across two pages.  I am weighing up my final printer selection based on the quality of the offering as costs are similar.   If the target amount is raised, the printing press will fulfil the orders comfortably within the target dates specified.  Left over copies will go on sale for a higher amount - possibly another third over the quoted prices here.  There is no 'if' involved with any of these offerings.  There is only 'when' and I have allowed plenty of time to make sure that all orders will be fulfilled in a timely manner.  I started writing the book about 6 months ago when I decided to go with kick starter.  At the same time I also began sourcing all the photography from the highest available original PSD or TIFF files.  In its current state, the book stands shoulder to shoulder with anything you might buy in a book store, and I am adding to the content everyday.  If it doesn't pass a common sense benchmark for its capacity to convey pertinent information, it certainly will do by the time it goes to print.  The three acrylic prints in the final reward are also already printed, and these are extremely punchy images.  For those interested in the Workshop, the last one I held was a lot of fun. The postcards, posters, and other speciality  prints will be ordered to meet expectations.  The framed prints of the 'The Ad Men' will be set in quality frames, and I will source those from a local frame making shop.I intend to keep people up to date if there are problems, but from here on in, I expect only very minor tweaks.  People will get their copies on or before the delivery date.",https://www.kickstarter.com/projects/1983944424/deconstructing-the-worldone-levitation-at-a-time?ref=discovery_category_newest,1983944424/deconstructing-the-worldone-levitation-at-a-time,"Concept, Levitation and Freelensing. The HOW, WHERE & WHYI shoot images that are displayed in businesses and homes both in England and abroad. What makes my story unique? What makes my images different? They usually feature a simple or complex 'concept' element. The Images themselves either have a strong narrative or a fine art bias, or both.It's always very tricky trying to quantify what you think your own work is in one sentence, but I think I would probably say this: Think of me as a film director - probably with little budget - and my images are individual frames from within a very unusual film.  Levitations, Concept and Freelensing all have their own special niche in photography, but I think this is growing as people get an appetite for being more adventurous. But you don't need a fancy camera or the latest photoshop suite (up until recently, my version was 4 years old) to try these out, and another definite bonus: anyone wishing to follow the tips and tricks from this book can just as easily apply them to more conventional photography.I've returned to Kick Starter with a greatly revised book, and an e-Book version.I sat down over the past 10 months and really thought about what other Photographers starting out on this journey and trying out their own ideas might want from a book like this. The book has been extensively rewritten from the top down and is a stronger proposition.  Each page is richer in content; with more lighting diagrams, clearer set up descriptions; sections devoted to post production, more behind the scenes images, and of course the addition of new images. The writing is conversational, but clear and straightforward for Photography students and experts alike, starting with the most basic Levitation and progressing to a shoot involving multiple elements shot over two days.But it isn't all technique. For those who just who just enjoy surreal or concept images - many are displayed across two pages.  And certain images are available as posters, calendars and prints, via a range of offers. Of course anyone who spends over £8 will automatically receive the digital copy.Talking of which, for those who don't have the funds for a printed book, the e-Book will have the same access to information and images. Because of its rich photographic content, this will sit comfortably on high quality readers, tablets, PCs and MACs.You'll journey through environs such as a billiard/snooker hall, a typical high street, a bank interior cashpoint and onto a lake at 4 am.Every image is technically annotated, with full lighting descriptions. The HOW, WHY and WHERE and everything in between. For the last nearly 2 years, I have lived and breathed this Book every single second of my spare time, working on images or writing and revising and laying out the content. It's difficult to put into words how much love has been put in, and I believe totally in its artistic heart and the value it brings. I am sure everybody who takes up a kick starter challenge puts their heart and soul into it. Not many come back for a second go with a reduced financial target and a brighter, bolder - and more clearly thought out offering.  If you're a photographer, a lover of the surreal, a lover of images, even if you're looking for a collectible book with a very short print run, this offering is jampacked with goodies!","My funding goal is actually almost the figure I achieved last year. I set a big target last time (and didn't achieve) because I fretted over the cost of a big print run.  This time I am going on a 'print on demand' model based on orders.  The e-Book changes the plan slightly, as it allows me to set a very favourable figure for both.  Both versions are more or less ready, bar some last minute tweaking.  For the e-Book, I will release the PDF over a concentrated short period and ensure I am contactable if there are download problems.  As I said above, this is an offering which is rich in photography, graphics and text, and having checked the PDF output on newer readers, tablets, i-pads, PCs or MACs, I can confirm it looks great.  It is not designed for the early 'grey scale' style text only Kindles.For the printed version, I have decided to concentrate on paper stock and image quality over a heavy hardback cover. This book is large: 33cm x 28cm with over 100 pages.   Last year, I printed smaller sizes and rejected them.  The images have more 'UMMPHHH' when printed large on good quality paper.  I will weigh up my final printer selection based on the quality of the offering as costs are similar. After quotes are collated, and quality assessed, the chosen printers will fulfil the orders comfortably within the target dates specified, and I have allowed plenty of time for this to happen.  All the photography is sourced from the highest available original PSD files. When I got a draft pilot copy of the first edition (only a single digital print), it quite literally blew my socks off.  I don't expect any delays for the other printed offerings as I regularly outsource work to outside companies on a regular basis.I am going on best guesstimates for postage to countries like Thailand, Malaysia and the Philippines.  If postage costs are cheaper, I will refund via paypal.  I've also had it pointed out to me that reward number 4, the early Bird special is slated for delivery on December 2016, which should of course be December 2015!  Also, there is no reward for both e-Books and the printed book.  If you wish both just add £6 to the total cost for reward for number 8.  Any problems let me know.  Thanks, Nick"

This pattern of light is used to coach your breathing pattern, which encourages your breaths to become longer as time progresses. To ensure that enough light is delivered, I put four LEDs on the device; however, the maximum brightness is adjustable to allow for different user tastes. In order to cater to varying heights of nightstands, the device is able to pivot to encompass a wide range of scenarios. For those who sleep with a partner, I added side-shields to concentrate the light's focus, reducing stray light that may annoy others.I chose laser cutting to make the kit easy to ship and mass produce. With the target order volume (around 1000 units) in mind, laser cutting proved to be an affordable way to create a custom design.The circuit board was designed with fritzing, and the logic and programming were done with arduino, which are both open source tools.All aspects of the design (arduino code, circuit board designs, mechanical design files, website assets, photos, and documentation)are open source and are available for download on my github page. I will continue to refine the design and produce more prototypes using the Kickstarter funding, and during the development time, I encourage advanced users to fork the repository and provide me with suggestions and ideas to include in the final product!The Sleep Sensei uses light to help you fall asleep, so I wanted to make sure that the light reduces any negative impacts that late-night light can have. Blue/white light actually keeps you awake, while green light has a similar effect and cansuppress your melatonin output. This leaves red light, which ""has the least power to shift circadian rhythm and suppress melatonin."" It's recommended to adjust the Sleep Sensei's brightness such that you can just barely see it through your eyelids, ensuring that the intensity is low enough to avoid any negative effects.The Sleep Sensei works by reducing your breathing rate, causing increased relaxation and bringing your breathing pattern closer to the reduced breathing pace that is typical of sleep. It also has the benefit of giving you something to focus on for an extended period of time, which can be helpful for those with sleep issues due to active minds.Using calming red light, the Sleep Sensei produces a sine wave pattern of light that you follow with yourbreathing.As the light begins to brighten, the user inhales, and as the light dims, the user exhales. As time passes, the breath length increases up to the maximum length specified by the user’s settings. It is a very gradual and unnoticeable change that happens progressively over time.The Sleep Sensei primarily helps those with sleeping problems caused by stress or an overactive mind at bedtime. The current design of the Sleep Sensei is primarily designed for users that can lie on their side or stomach to fall asleep; however, if you prefer to fall asleep on your back for medical or other reasons, you can still use the Sleep Sensei on an elevated surface to point down towards your eyes.Bright and Directable LightThe main innovation of the Sleep Sensei is its use of bright light that is capable of being seen through the eyelids in order to make it visible with the user's eyes closed. Other similar products are just not bright enough to achieve this and require open eyes.The Sleep Sensei has a pivoting base which allows you to shine the coaching light directly at the eyelids no matter how tall, short, or non-existent your nightstand is.Adjustable BrightnessThe maximum brightness of the Sleep Sensei can be adjusted at any time using the adjustment wheel. This allows you to shine the Sensei's light on a wall for eyes-open coaching, dim it a bit if you are sensitive to light, or stare right at it for a meditation session.Customizable Breathing PatternAnother unique innovation of the Sleep Sensei is the user's ability to program custom breath lengths to suit their preferences and breathing rates. The user can choose initial and final breaths ranging from four to 20 seconds in duration. Defaults are available as a starting point.Simple DesignWhen I set out to make this project, I was determined to make the final design as simple as possible to keep the price low and to make using the Sleep Sensei simple and easy.When I first created the Sleep Sensei, I used it on myself for several weeks resulting in a general feeling that it was helping me to fall asleep faster. I wanted to quantify this somehow, so I began tracking my sleep using a sleep tracking app on my smartphone. After seeing a significant positive trend in the amount of time it took me to fall asleep using the Sleep Sensei, I decided that I wanted data from more users to see if the device worked for others. Thus I started the Sleep Study.The hypothesis was simple: “The Sleep Sensei will reduce users’ average time to fall asleep.” I made posts on reddit’s /r/insomnia, /r/arduino, and /r/quantifiedself subreddits asking for volunteers for the study using this advertisement (The device was initially named the Sleep Coach). Of the five volunteers who replied to the advertisement and participated, all of them showed some improvement in the time it took them to fall asleep. The full report can be found here, and the raw data from the study can be found here.Some comments from the study participants:“I think the quality of sleep has been improving, and I think that’s the Sleep Sensei. When I start having issues again I pull it out and it does help” – Alice S, TX“I was really impressed with the Sleep Sensei- it cut the amount of time it took me to fall asleep by about half … based on the survey, I basically don’t have insomnia anymore and it feels that way”Marijke S, MA“The Sleep Sensei allows me to fall asleep in at least under 30 minutes, sometimes even as few as 7 minutes, which is great for me! I would definitely recommend this device to anyone who is on the search for something new to help them fall asleep, someone who perhaps has tried every other sleep aid without finding anything that truly helps yet. The Sleep Sensei is awesome!” – Kate B, GA“I’ve noticed a HUGE decrease in how long it takes me to fall asleep which has been wonderful! I really like the machine.  It’s easy to use and works well.” – Kelly P, LANow I want to reach a much wider audience with the Sleep Sensei by launching this Kickstarter. Hopefully it will help others as much as it helped the study participants!Featured by:I have trouble falling asleep at night. I used to take over-the-counter remedies, and I've tried prescription stuff, but these either made me feel groggy the next day or had side effects that were not worth the benefits. I then stumbled upon some smartphone apps and devices that use a rising and falling pattern of light to help you fall sleep by training your breathing. I tried these with some success, but I found that they all had one major flaw: they required your eyes to be open. Who in the world tries to fall asleep with their eyes open?!Using my arduino skills, I set out to create a device that will help coach my breathing to ease myself to sleep with my eyes closed. Thus the Sleep Sensei was born, with its pivoting base and four ultra-bright red LEDs that can shine through eyelids, it was created to address the problems of similar apps and devices.After receiving such positive feedback from the sleep study, I wanted to bring the Sleep Sensei to the masses, but I knew I couldn’t continue spending hours just to produce a dozen devices. Thus I have turned to outsourcing the circuit board manufacture and assembly as well as making the mechanical components by laser cutting. I secured multiple quotes and found that I need to produce at least 1000 Sleep Senseis in order to make them economically viable. For example, a batch of 100 circuit boards costs over four times more per board than a batch of 1000 boards!Assuming the Kickstarter is fully funded, this is the plan to make Sleep Sensei a reality:Note: the Sleep Sensei is still under development, so the images below will differ from the final product.The bare board:Just the board. Provide your own electrical components and soldering skills to complete the board, or just hang it on your keychain as a token of appreciation for helping this project become a reality.The Sleep Sensei Kit:Includes laser-cut parts, assembled electronics board, battery pack (2 AA batteries not included), hinge hardware, and all other necessary hardware (TBD). It should take less than 5 minutes to assemble and will include easy to follow instructions.The Assembled Sleep Sensei:The completed Sleep Sensei fully assembled by yours truly.Logo designed by RMRDesign","The main risk of this project is not getting enough backers to keep the price low. If I do not gain enough backers, but there is still a positive response, I will look into other ways of producing Sleep Senseis in smaller volume; perhaps reverting to making them by hand (if the demand is reasonably small).Another risk is if the demand is too high for me to be able to ship all Sleep Senseis myself and still meet the promise dates. If this does happen, I have a couple of shipping logistics companies that I have received quotes from to assist in packaging and shipping the orders. This will cost me more, but if the volume is large enough, cost per unit will decrease and I will not go into the red.The lead-time for the circuit boards to be produced and assembled is about 1 month, and I have conservatively estimated another month for shipping to my doorstep. I have quotes from 3 different board manufacturers, and I have high confidence that I will be able to meet the deadlines, but unforeseen events can always occur causing the dates to slip. I will update backers with news both good and bad about the progress of Sleep Sensei production. I will also test each Sleep Sensei before I ship it to ensure that all orders are fulfilled right the first time.No FCC certification is required as the Sleep Sensei is a digital device that runs at 1 MHz (per 15.103 of CFR47, FCC certification is required at 1.705 MHz and above) and does not connect to AC power lines (it is powered by two AA batteries).",https://www.kickstarter.com/projects/1999114877/the-sleep-sensei?ref=discovery_category_newest,1999114877/the-sleep-sensei,"The Sleep Sensei is a device to help people fall asleep faster using calming breathing training. It's for people who have trouble falling asleep, due to insomnia or an active mind at bedtime.The Sleep Sensei produces a sinusoidal pattern of light that you follow with your breathing. As the light increases in brightness, you inhale, and as the light dims, you exhale, and the light is bright enough to be seen with your eyes closed. This pattern slows throughout the session, guiding your breathing to become slower, calming you down and inducing sleep. Also, if your mind tends to race at bedtime, the Sleep Sensei gives you something to focus on to help you fall asleep.As the sleep coaching session progresses, the breathing rate very gradually slows down. This change is quite subtle; you'll hardly notice that you've gone from 10 breaths per minute to only 6 by the end of the session!The Sleep Sensei can be put on a nightstand or on your bed, and it works for back and side sleepers.Bright Red Coaching LightThe Sleep Sensei has 4 ultra-bright red LEDs, which allow you to see the coaching light even with your eyes closed.Smartphone apps just aren't bright enough for this.The max brightness of the Sleep Sensei can be adjusted on-the-fly to suit your comfort level.Why red light? Blue/white light actually keeps you awake, while green light has a similar effect and can suppress your melatonin output. This leaves red light, which ""has the least power to shift circadian rhythm and suppress melatonin."" That's why apps like Flux change your screen to a more reddish hue towards the end of the day. Customizable Coaching ProfilesYou can change the length of coaching session, initial breath length, final breath length, and brightness. These settings are saved to profiles that are stored in the Sleep Sensei, even when the batteries are removed.The hinged design allows you to aim the Sleep Sensei so you can most comfortably see the light in your usual sleeping position. You can also adjust the stiffness of the hinge.The bamboo Sleep Sensei body is 100% renewable and biodegradable.The Sleep Sensei is built on the open-source Arduino platform. All aspects of the Sleep Sensei, including the circuit board design and Arduino code, are freely available. Check out the GitHub page!Get the Alpha edition and have a custom message added to the front and/or back of your Sleep Sensei! You can add 5 lines of text, 15 characters per line (including spaces) per side. Add your name, or your personal mantra like ""Tomorrow is a new day."" ""Smile, breathe, and go slowly.""When I first created the Sleep Sensei for my own sleep issues, I found that it helped me fall asleep faster. I decided to see if the Sleep Sensei could help others as well. I recruited users online through the Reddit insomnia and arduino communities to participate in a sleep study. Each participant received a prototype Sleep Sensei, and used a smartphone app which tracked their movements in bed to determine how long it took to fall asleep. They logged their sleep with and without the Sleep Sensei coaching their breathing.Above you'll find a sample of the results. The study showed that it helped nearly all users fall asleep faster, and the feedback was overwhelmingly positive. This inspired me to turn a hobby project into a consumer product, and that's why I have launched this Kickstarter!Most of the funding will cover material costs, shipping, Kickstarter fees and credit card processing charges. The rest will go to recoup the development costs and fund future projects.If the number of orders resulting from this Kickstarter is fairly low, I'll be making the Sleep Sensei boards myself. If demand exceeds expectations, I have made initial arrangements with manufacturers who are able to mass-produce and assemble the circuit boards, ensuring that orders are fulfilled on time.As some readers may know, the Sleep Sensei was a Kickstarter project last November. It was unsuccessful, mainly due to a funding goal that was too high.Since then, I have made many changes:Height: 6""Width: 2 1/16"" Depth: 3""Weight: 1.5 oz (bamboo) 2.5 oz (acrylic)Battery life: 6 months estimated when used daily for 7 mins/day","Since the Sleep Sensei design is already completed, tested, and validated, the main risks will stem from delays in parts and production. To ensure that parts are delivered on time, I have both primary and alternate vendors for all the Sleep Sensei components. The circuit boards will be ordered from a trusted vendor who has manufactured the boards for all the latest prototypes. Each Sleep Sensei will be manually tested for function and quality before shipment.If the demand for Sleep Senseis exceeds what I can produce myself, I have made arrangements with several manufacturers that will be able to manufacture and assemble all the circuit boards. The laser-cut body components are already handled by a manufacturer, and I have an alternate in place if they cannot meet demand in a timely fashion.If any delays present themselves, I will be transparent with the backers of the project and aim to resolve issues as soon as possible."

We also need funds to create canvas wrap art prints, photo prints, art post-cards, and eventually a prototype of the book. Some money will go to supplies, like hairspray, combs, electricity, digital storage space, etc.This is a collaborative project between a writer (Greg Heinzman), a photographer (Matt Green), and a stylist (Cash Adolph).  Help support our artistic habits and passions.At its most basic level, this project is an experiment in multi-genre composition from 3 guys with pretty different backgrounds and talents. There are images and stories that will appeal to a broad audience, and we hope you'll help us by supporting our project with a money contribution in return for a tangible piece of art and by spreading the word to friends.We are scheduled to present the storytelling aspect of this project during Storyfort, the literary branch of the Treefort Music Festival in late March in Boise, 2016. Photos, anecdotes, readings and other surprises will ensue. Maybe even high jinks.Special thanks to Angie Heinzman for braids on the Willie Nelson and Pippy Longstocking styled hairdos.

And for me, finding time to write is difficult with a full time job, 2 small kids, and a wife in grad school with a full time job. If it were possible to literally buy time, that's what we would do. We are looking for help in buying some time for all of us to get work done without cutting too deeply into our abilities to pay bills and take care of familial obligations. It's difficult to find days in which all 3 of us are available at the same time to knock out multiple hairdos in one session, but it becomes significantly more efficient if we are able to buy each other's time.

And my favorite so far: I f***ing hate your man-bun, man-bun man.","The main, maybe the only, significant challenges we face for Part 1 are time and money for prints. We all have families and busy lives. This Part 1 fundraiser will help buy some studio time and the first round of prints for the Modern Art Event May 5th, 2016.It will also pay for the creation of the stickers, post cards, and prints that are rewards to contributors. If it were possible to literally buy time, that's what we would do!We have around 35 hairdos right now and would like to reach 50 as soon as possible. Funding this Kickstarter project will help us reach our Modern Art deadline. It would allow us to move forward and work on Part 2, which would include gallery showings, and Part 3, which is the culmination of all the hairdos and the collection of short fiction I'm writing based on ""characters"" I see in photos of myself with different hairdos. The end goal is to publish a literary photo book."

The great individuals, moments and locationsthat have shaped our nation have always intrigued me. Throughout my life, I have taken many tripsto our country’s great historical landmarks, enjoying the feeling of touchingsomething tangible that connected me to that past time or place.It saddensme to know that much of our history is being lost to time. I now spend my days trying to rescue, reclaimand repurpose natural materials from these great locations by creating historicheirlooms that will help those who already love history connect to our pastwhile also serving as teaching tools and keepsakes for the next generation ofhistory lovers. Most of the materialsare wood (we call it Witness Wood®). The Witness Wood® products that wesell help us to save more materials from other historical locations, whileproviding great gifts and conversation pieces to others with an appreciationfor history.For example, our company, HistoryPens.com, LLC has recently acquired ORIGINAL construction WitnessWood® from Independence Hall. This Witness Wood®includes pieces of beams that supported the floor when boththe Declaration of Independence and the Constitution were debated andsigned. These Independence Hall Witness Wood® beams and railings that had oncefelt the footsteps and touch of George Washington, Benjamin Franklin, Thomas Jefferson,and John Adams, among others, were torn up as part of a renovation. We acquired the wood, and we are developinga Limited Edition series of heirloom quality, precious and semi-precious metalfine writing instruments and cuff links that will present this historic WitnessWood® with the reverence and respect that it deserves.All of our silver and 18K gold pens will be delivered ina Cherry engraved or custom-made presentation box. Each box will be individually engraved tocorrespond with the details of that specific pen. The Limited Edition silver and 18K gold rewards will begin arriving to our backers approximately 45-60 days after funding is complete.The presentation boxes will be made from Blue StainedColorado Pine that is not harvested but killed by the Mountain Pine Beetle. The200-400 year old pine used is already felled do to beetle infestation.ProvenanceCompleted in 1735 it took two years to build Independence Hall home of the 1st Continental Congress and the Declaration of Independence and where the Constitution was debated and put to paper.During the renovation of Independence Hall in 1897-98, 16 of the original beams holding up the floor on which the giants of the era debated the future of the 13 Colonies along withgallery railings and the railing to the steeple were replaced under the supervision of the project manager and superintendent of the Independence Hall, Samuel Reeves. Rather than discarding the beams and railings, Reeves retained possession of the old timbers.In 1912 Reeves sold the beams to John S. McQuade a builder and member of the Philadelphia City Council for the purposes of cutting them up and making “relics”, but McQuade stored the beams for 12 years and in 1924 sold them to two brothers Walter and Clarence Deisroth owners of a paper box company in Philadelphia.The Deisroth’s reduced some beams to 100,000+ slivers and sold them as souvenirs during the Sesquicentennial Exposition of 1926.In 1956 the Deisroth’s company went into bankruptcy and at auction Mr. Henry Gouse a retired sales engineer and the Mid-Atlantic Tennis Champion of the 1940s bought the wood at auction. Along with what was left of the timbers some chips and 20 gallons of sawdust, byproduct of producing the 100,000+ slivers was included in the lot.Grouse stored the beams in a barn on his property on the outskirts of Philadelphia where he made gavels out of some of the beams and presented them over the years to: President Eisenhower, President Nixon, Winston Churchill, Charles de Gaulle and other political leaders.  Grouse also gave 4 of the beams to Independence Hall and the National Park Service, confirmed in aNational Park Service letter acknowledging “the gift”.In 1975 Gouse was in his 80’s and his ex-wife “reluctantly” sold the remaining woodpile to an artist and attorney from whose estate we have been able to acquire the wood for this KickStarter project.Mrs. Grouse only sold the Witness Wood® because of the high cost of living and her economic situation, she simply could no longer afford to keep them and sold the Witness Wood® with the understanding that it would not be desecrated.The new owners subsequently cut up much of the wood again into slivers, producing thousands of history cards and memorabilia that were sold during the Bi-Centennial in 1976 all over the country and in many major department stores.The remnant wood has remained drying out in storage since the 1970’s until our recent find and acquisition.  _____________________________________________________________________________________We hope you will join us in our efforts to ""Keep Our History Alive"" for current and future generations as we strive in our small way to ensure America’s culture and history is preserved.HERE ARE SOME PHOTOS OF OUR WORK and other projectsEven as we salvage Historic Witness Wood®, fate sometimes can not be altered. Here are images from the February 2015 fire we had at one of our 2 shops where we lost everything including some wonderful woods we had previously saved. Your support as we get back on our feet is most appreciated.","After Funding:Because all the components for this project are handmade by our Master Pen Maker, Artisan Woodcrafter and Silversmith, obviously we are constrained only by time.

These custom handcrafted razors will feature a Gettysburg Union Field Hospital Witness Wood® handle and a blade that will be created using a Civil War recovered (dug/excavated) Cannonball!Along with stabilizing the above 237 year old Witness Wood® beam, so that it can be cut and worked into the razors handles, our other big challenge is using the low carbon Cannonball to create an edge that meets the necessary standard required to be functional.In order to create the necessary edge, Joe will incorporate the Japanese San Mai knife/sword making technique. San Maioffers a practical and visible advantage of a superb cutting edge of modern high carbon steel, with a corrosion-resistant exterior. For this Project the metal blade construction/metalwork, San Mai refers to our knife blade that has the hard steel (modern high carbon) forming the blade's edge, and the iron cannonball forming a jacket on both sides.We hope you will join us in our efforts to “Keep History Alive” for current and future generations as we strive in our small way to ensure America’s culture and history is preserved.The DANIEL SHEAFFER FARM remains a prominent Gettysburg landmark, whose original property was a 300+ acre land grant from William Penn, first surveyed in 1763, and referred to as 'Wolf's Walk'. There was, at one time, an Indian camp on the property southwest of where the main house was later built. The house (the first brick house in Adams County) was built in c.1780-81 and was originally used as a tavern 'under the Sign of George Washington' from 1808-1815. During this period the green in front of the house was used as a site for military muster and drills and in the 1840's the house was used as a place for abolitionist meetings, and was a stop on the Underground Railway for slaves fleeing from neighboring Maryland, only a few miles away.  At the time of the Battle of Gettysburg, the property was owned by Daniel Sheaffer and his wife and consisted of the brick house, several outbuildings and a sawmill located on White Run Creek. Occupied by a portion of the III and XII Corps of the Army of the Potomac, with baggage trains resting in the fields, Gregg's Cavalry Division camped on the farm on July 2nd and Reserve Artillery occupied the fields southwest of the house. During and following the Battle of Gettysburg nearly 3,000 Rebel prisoners, many taken during the famous 'Pickett's Charge' were kept on the property southwest of the house, near the stream. When the wounded began to arrive, the Sheaffer's' were asked to leave. The surgeons performed amputations on every available surface and as the piles of severed limbs grew outside, holes were drilled in the planking of the floors on the downstairs level so that the blood could be washed into the cellar.  The most famous patient at the Sheaffer House Field Hospital was the controversial General Daniel Sickles who was wounded in the leg by a projectile, smashing the bone. In a later claim for damages, Mrs. Sheaffer recalled that ""on the second day of July 1863, Maj. Gen. Sickles was carried to the house in consequence of a wound which resulted in the amputation of a leg--he remained overnight."" Sickles himself wrote in 1882: ""In a moment I was removed from the ground to the field hospital on the Baltimore Pike that night, in the gloaming, Dr. Calhoun cut off the useless limb."" A young neighbor of the Sheaffer's, J. Howard Wert wrote that he ""saw the noble chieftain borne with shattered leg to the sombre brick house on the Baltimore Pike, at that time occupied by Daniel Sheaffer."" On one of his visits to the Battlefield in later times, the General was quoted as saying that he had requested champagne after the amputation. When that wasn't available, a bottle of wine was found in the baggage train. He wouldn't drink it warm, so it was put down the stone-lined well beside the house for an hour. Sickles drank the wine at one mouthful every five minutes, and passed the night and was later carried to the train and taken to Washington to complete his recovery.The property was used as a Union Field Hospital for over two weeks. During that time the sawmill by the creek provided lumber for bunks and coffins for the III Corps. In 1868 Daniel Sheaffer put in a government claim for property damage due to the use of the property as a field hospital, stating the items taken or used by Federal troops included nearly 3000 fence rails, 2926 feet of board lumber, 80 bushels of wheat, 24 bushels of rye, 90 bushels of oats, 180 bushels of corn, 12 tons of hay, 50 lbs of bacon, towels and table linen, 2 shirts, 2 pr. shoes, 4 pr. stockings, 1 pr. pants and 1 lot of poultry. Daniel Sheaffer had also done his own gathering of items. A military telegram of July 19th, 1863 states that several Army items were discovered at ""Shaffer's, the Dutchman, which included ""300 shirts and drawers, 50 blankets, 28 guns, some artillery harness and etc. They were secreted in a well dug under the house and in four large sinks filled with water. The guns were hid under piles of board along his fence and in the garrets. Every care seemed to have been taken to prevent detection. I worked the Dutchman hard fixing up & loading the property that is not sufficient punishment. What shall I do with him?""  Since 1983 the property has been owned by John & Betty Pannick. During a remodel of an upstairs room, the original bloodstained planking was discovered. It was hardly a surprise as several other rooms in the house bear bloodstains on the flooring, and a room on the lower level adjacent to the kitchen still has the small round hole bored in a plank to sweep the water and blood into the cellar. There is also a disruption in the brickwork on the northeast corner of the house where it was struck by a shell, along with scorching of the beams in the attic from another artillery strike. Although there has been limited remolding and some planks and beams have needed to be removed and repaired, the house remains as it did during the time of the Battle, a silent witness to the turning of the tide of the Civil War.PLEASE NOTE: Our $65 Reward is for the LETTER OPENER! We apologize for the 2nd paragraph that states:""Backers will receive a Nouveau Handcrafted Single Barrel Twist Ballpoint Pen made from Original Construction Beam removed during maintenance and upgrade by current owner of the Gettysburg Union Field Hospital - Sheaffer Farmhouse.""That paragraph is for the $145 Reward and was inadvertently inserted in $65 Reward.We apologize for any inconvenience.Thank You for your support and helping us ""keep History Alive""","After Funding:As we already own and have in inventory the requisite Witness Wood® and other materials necessary to execute and complete this project and since many of the components for this project are handmade by our Master Pen Makers, Artisan Woodcrafters, Jewelry Makers and Silversmith, we are constrained only by time.

I work hard for the privilege of working in this industry and want to share a small piece of that with everyone out there.Full funding of this project will allow me, as an independent artist, to produce my first full-length album made up of music that comes from my heart. It also allows me to bring together my favorite musicians to share the stage for a night of musical banter and pyrotechnic exchanges. The budget has been researched to include the recording, mixing, mastering, and duplication of the album, as well as a nation-wide promotional release of this album. Backers can be assured that every penny is meaningful and necessary to present the best product possible and to ensure its successful launch. This project has been a long time coming and I plan on sharing this event with those that have continued to support me over the years. I am offering up signed copies of the CD, private serenades, and even ""Executive Producer"" credit just for pledging your support at the appropriate levels.Please help me to fund this project by pledging your support, and by passing on this information to your friends and family so they can be a part of this album as well.","Taking the time to thoughtfully plan out the details ahead of time and including them into my budget is how I am working to minimize any potential oversights with this project. I am also working very closely with my team to make sure that the steps leading up to the recording date, from finishing up arrangements to making sure the mobile recording rig is ready, are all taken into account. I have made sure that there is more than one venue available should a last-minute scheduling conflict arise. More than one recording outfit has been contacted to ensure the appropriate recording equipment is available and at the session on the planned date. All charts will be rehearsed and ready to go with my musicians. Should there arise an issue with one of them, I am lucky enough to have a number of capable backup musicians to ensure the highest quality of performance on the session.Should any other issues come up then I will do what I have always done: Improvise and execute to the best of my abilities, and rely on the excess of talented musicians that I am lucky enough to get to work with, day in and day out.",https://www.kickstarter.com/projects/johnnyscotch/working-out-the-kinks?ref=discovery_category_newest,johnnyscotch/working-out-the-kinks,"For the past 30 years John Dover has been honing his craft on the trumpet. Performing everything from chamber orchestra to rock bands. When John moved to Portland Oregon 8 years ago, it was his dream to create an album of original content that tapped into all the various experiences he has had both musically and personally. ""Working Out the Kinks"" is the result of the past 8 years of writing and it is in it's final stages of production leading up to being released into the wild.Utilizing the amazing talent within the JDQ (John Dover Quintet), John has pieced together a series of instrumental works that highlight the individuals as well as the ensemble. This is achieved through the expert execution of the musicians and recording team, along with the fabulous arranging talents of John's bass player and friend, Thomas Barber. Together the album goes from playful, to sultry and many flavors in between, while keeping a singular voice as well as paying homage to the various styles and musicians that have helped to shape John's musicianship through the years.Along with John Dover on trumpet, ""Working Out the Kinks"" features:Thomas Barber on Bass and ArrangingCharles Neal on Drums and Recording EngineerMike Doolin on GuitarClay Giberson on Keys and PianoSpecial guest, Pete Petersen on Tenor SaxThe project is in the final stages of mixing and this Kickstarter is being launched to tie up the final pieces necessary to bring it to the listeners. John is using this promotional outlet to secure pre-orders for those that look to support independent projects and to give backers an opportunity to share and promote the projects they love with others in their social media circles.Thank you for taking the time to learn more about John and this project. We appreciate all your support and look forward to delivering this project to you at the completion of a very successful campaign.","The risks in the music industry abound. John has met multiple challenges bringing this project to life including the challenge of trying to initially record it live. What that taught John were where the holes were that needed to be filled musically and that the best avenue to follow would be a studio recording.Currently the risks are in the promotion of the final project which John will be launching a wide on line campaign as well as promoting the sale of this project along side his upcoming travels to a number of music festivals in the coming year as well as in conjunction with his work as an artist and clinician for Bach trumpets.The main risk to backers is in the delivery time. John's sights are set on an official launch and release part/concert in August. Once this project is funded, that will tighten up the release date and even help to secure an earlier release rather than delaying it further."
https://www.kickstarter.com/projects/1294047674/k48ickstarter?ref=discovery_category_newest,1294047674/k48ickstarter,"Hi, my name is Scott Hug, I’m a NYC artist and K48 is my fanzine that I founded ten years ago as my thesis project at Pratt Institute. K48 is the quintessence of publication-as-synthesis, embracing music, fashion, art, and design as it disregards genre in the pursuit of an aesthetic of sensory overload. Its name evokes the inscrutable codes at the loose in the culture (on pharmaceuticals, automobiles, electronics, and weapons). Each time capsule is a CD-size block, containing contributions from dozens of artists, friends and heroes, each with an accompanying CD soundtrack.I started K48 to shake things up — to bridge the gap between different communities and since then, the impact has been monumental. K48 has inspired and launched the careers of some of the worlds most talented contemporary artists like RYAN MCGINLEY, MATTHEW DAY JACKSON, TERENCE KOH, FISCHERSPOONER, HANNA LIDEN, SLAVA MOGUTIN, KELLEY WALKER, WADE GUYTON, MEREDITH SPARKS, RICCI ALBENDA, RACHEL HARRISON, LUCKY DEBELLVUE, SCOTT TRELEAVEN, DEARRAINDROP, DEVENDRA BANHART, TELFAR, HRAFNHILDUR ARNARDOTTIR aka SHOPLIFTER, ASSUME VIVID ASTRO FOCUS, and the list goes on and on…We take a year or more to nurture each issue going on studio visits, developing stories, creating music, and making art works. Issues frequently appear in conjunction with installations, a thematic fusion of space and object, the two pieces at once freestanding yet inseparable like the ""Teenage Rebel: The Bedroom Show"" which traveled to agnès b.’s galerie du jour in Paris, ""Kamp K48"" at Yerba Buena Center for the Arts, San Francisco, and ""Is There Anybody Out There,"" at Hiromi Yoshii Gallery in Tokyo, just to name a few.Themes are in response to previous concepts: for example the expansive travel of issue 2 led to 3’s introspective teenage bedroom, which was the point of departure for Kult K48’s investigation of religious cultures in issue 4. The natural environment encountered by the Boy Scouts became the theme for issue 5: caged animals, taken from nature, inspired the prison issue. As a liberation from this enclosure, an outer-space theme for issue 7 was launched.The eighth edition of K48 will continue to explore contemporary culture with ‘magic’ as a central theme of the issue. Once again, deploying a well-known penchant for combining an electric mix of artists drawing from various disciplines, K48 unveils the unknown territory of the supernatural. With 196 pages of collaborations by BRIAN BELOTT, ALEX DA CORTE, ROBERT SUMRELL, OLIVER LUTZ, ONE-HALF NELSON, AUREL SCHMIDT, PAUL MPAGI SEPUYA, AMY GRANAT, JOSEPH WHITT, DIS MAGAZINE, ROBERT BITTENBENDER, TIMOTHY HULL, SARA GREENBERGER RAFFERTY, OLAF BREUNING, and a custom R-U-In?S spread compiled by KARI ALTMANN called “Similar Image Haul: Magic Eye XD” among others. The issue will feature an exclusive interview with the band SALEM and a full length CD mixed by BOOKWRMZ including original tracks made by HOUSE OF LADOSHA, LIGHT ASYLUM, BRENMAR and MIRROR MIRROR – it’s an indulgent foray into realms of mystery, enchantment, surprises, and illusions that are at times ethereal, and at other times staggering.We need to raise the rest of our printing costs: approximately $12,000+. K48 is no ordinary fanzine. The best printers are used and a number of special offset printing techniques are applied like ‘tip-on’, holographic foil stamping, dusted edges, die cuts, silver Mylar inserts, posters, stickers, fold-outs, spot colors, soy-based inks, recycled acid-free papers, etc. Each limited edition K48 time capsule of 192+ pages is a collector’s item.For your pledge, I will match each amount with limited edition K48 multiples, signed copies of out of print back issues and unique artworks. Not only are you supporting hours of hard work and a very awesome endeavor but also you will be receiving special limited edition artworks that will increase in value over time.K48 throws some of the best parties NYC has ever seen and we want to bring it to you!

Every year I participate in the annual Printed Matter New York Art Book Fair - this year taking place from September 19th - 22nd. It is my goal to launch my new artist's book project, The RISE of the EROTIC FLOWER WRAPPED in BLACK at this event. I've decided to make it an offset publication with a limited print run of 400 copies.Picasso once said, ""I show what I have found, not what I am looking for."" My inspiration comes from Dada, Fluxus, Post-conceptualism, Neo-pop, Appropriation, Political art of the 80s, and Relational art of the 90s and early 00s. My artwork interrogates an apathetic national audience obsessed with newstainment. I examine the big issues of our times by exaggerating my source material with sometimes disturbing humor and biting analysis.I make artworks in a variety of mediums including artist's books, paintings, sculptures, collaborations, site-specific installations, and curatorial projects that address current social-political issues.My shows have been reviewed in the New York Times and my work is in prominent collections. I love artist's books and have an extensive knowledge about them and have taught a class, Book as Art at NYU. From 2000 - 2011, I self-published my famed countercultural collaborative art fanzine, K48 now in the collection of MoMA. www.k48rules.comIn 2008 I was selected by artist AA Bronson of Printed Matter to create a unique edition for the New York Art Book Fair.  I'm working on a new artist's book titled, The RISE of the EROTIC FLOWER WRAPPED in BLACK made from altered found images & texts mined from discarded consumer media. I love making artist's books. They are the world's most accessible art objects - inexpensively priced and fun to collect with a panoply of purposes and ideas. I have predetermined to make my new book an offset publication with a limited print run of 400 copies. While more expensive than print-on-demand technologies, I believe that offset is superior in quality to digital printing and that the object of the artist's book has more value printed in a finite edition making it more collectable. The RISE of the EROTIC FLOWER WRAPPED in BLACK will mimic the size and format of a mass-marketed paperback: Pocketbook-sized 6.875 x 4.25 inches, 304 pages, interior black ink on 55# natural, cover: black + 2 Pantone spot fluorescent colors, edition size: 400. Copies of The RISE of the EROTIC FLOWER WRAPPED in BLACK will retail for $30 at Printed Matter NYC, OAK Brooklyn, and Art Metropole in Toronto. Sequence, juxtaposition and editing are all important to me and help create a unique visual-reading experience. The mass-marketed paperback form alludes to pulp-fiction, science-fiction, and self-help digests like: How to Manage Your Stress in Today's World, or How to be a Champion, etc.. There will be plenty of mystery and suspense in The RISE of the EROTIC FLOWER WRAPPED in BLACK. I need to raise $2,800 to cover my printing costs. I will be ready to go on press the first week of September. I'm excited to launch my new book at the opening of the NY Art Book fair 9/19 with a book signing on 9/21 - my birthday :-) from 2-5pm. Thank you for taking the time to learn about my art and my new artist's book. I hope that you will pledge — I have AWESOME rewards :-) ",I feel confident that my project will be successful. Presently I am 2/3 of the way towards completion of my book. I will be ready to go on press the first week of September and will have 3 weeks for press and shipping time in order to meet my book launch deadline at the New York Art Book Fair on September 19th. I will send out all pledge awards at the end of September to arrive in early October. I don't foresee any set backs. Thank you for your support.

Motherhood is hard. And brave. And beautiful.

Add to that the darkness of loss, depression, and anxiety, which threatens to drown us when we are supposed to be the happiest and most fulfilled, and a girl can lose sight of who she is and of the God who loves her there. I did. But I am learning to find myself again, little by little.I’m a mama to three beautiful kiddos, a singer-songwriter and worship musician, and a former high school English teacher.

Writing music has helped hold a light for me in darkness when I had to return to full-time work after each baby, when my son was taken to the NICU, when my body betrayed me with the crushing weight of darkness, and now, as I stay home with my children, and my husband works two jobs to make ends meet. In fact, the words of my own songs, sung back to my heart when I feel like I'm drowning, keep me moving, one step at a time. And although I've prayed for instant healing, I believe that like Joshua, trusting and fighting his way into the Promised Land to reclaim God's promise to him, perhaps it is God's loving design that I walk through this hard, beautiful season, carrying the light in the dark, and fighting for other women who are lost through these songs.I would love for you to join with me in creating a full-length album of music, called ""Brave is One More Step in the Dark,"" to shine light into the darkest places of motherhood, womanhood, and our identities, so we can find each other... and the One who has been holding us all along.It still feels like a dream that I had the honor and privilege of being mentored this fall by my musical hero, Sara Groves, and that we were accepted as applicants into Chip Gaines's #chipstarter 2.0. Both of these recent chapters in our story helped to lead us here, to this new dream: that we would be able to use the funds from this Kickstarter community to record, mix, master, and distribute an album of thirteen original songs that tell my story of the valley of PPD and the hope that came to find me there. It is our prayer that this music helps weave us together and shines light in YOUR story too. We will be partnering with local artists and musicians to bring the hope to life musically and visually, and we love the idea that the project will represent YOU and your story too because of your contribution and support. You are holding a light for us, friends. And we want to hold a light for you. ""When the Favor of God rests on you, Heart, don't be afraid...

Motherhood is hard. And brave. And beautiful. And not at all what I expected.Determining who are each uniquely made to be as women, in the middle of what our culture tells us, and the voices of our own experiences, can be overwhelming. Add to that the darkness of loss, depression, and anxiety, which threatens to drown us when we are supposed to be the happiest and most fulfilled, and a girl can lose sight of who she is and of the God who loves her there. I did. But I am learning to find myself again, little by little.I’m a mama to three beautiful kiddos, a singer-songwriter and worship musician, and a former high school English teacher. My husband Keith and I live in the cornfields of Illinois. And I struggle with postpartum depression and anxiety.

Pretty sure it was in 2016 when I was at the mall and I thought of a found-footage, first-person film in the perspective of the storm troopers in search for Yoda, but a horrible virus overwhelms the storm troopers who escape back to their Star Destroyer. The virus spreads aboard the ship and Darth Vader tries to put a stop to the virus.I don't know when or if I went any further in 2017 or 2018, but then comes 2019 with the release of Resident Evil 2 as a nice inspiration and 2019 is where all the ideas formed. Here comes August 4, 2019 where I originally thought Yoda's Nightmare as two parts.Part 1 - Star Wars: Yoda's Nightmare and Part 2 - Star Wars: Deathtroopers, but then I wanted them to be one full length feature film. I had to choose the titles between Deathtroopers and Yoda's Nightmare and we all know which one I chose.After writing down most of the story, I came to a stop, writer's block if you must and I had to ask myself a serious question. On August 11, 2019 I asked myself writing down, ""What is Yoda's Nightmare?"" I wrote down a non-spoiler answer based off of Yoda's situation.""The good is wiped out and Evil takes it's place when a new Evil begins and the previous evil is the norm and the good is no more.""As time flew by to now in December 2019, a lot of epic ideas formed the legendary Star Wars masterpiece that is Yoda's Nightmare. This movie will spawn many sequels and crossovers as a major crossover will be a big part of Yoda's Nightmare, including an after credit's scene teasing it's own future film.If anyone of you awesome nerf herders have respect for this new Star Wars movie and I, then you shall not refer to this as a ""fan-film"". All of your support will make this film come to life.I am Freddy. Born in 2000. I grew up with Star Wars all my life. I feel the Skywalker saga is far from done and Lucasfilm is making a major mistake.Remember the end of Revenge of the Sith, well imagine the next scene is the beginning of Yoda's Nightmare. When I say this movie takes place right after Revenge of the Sith, it really does. The rewards mostly consist of on-set helmets and the quantities are unbelievably low. Start supporting Yoda's Nightmare now!","The challenge these rewards bring are that some of the helmets are going to be used by stunt doubles and their release dates as rewards are in late 2020, so we'll have to shoot their scenes before they will be released or push back the release dates.",https://www.kickstarter.com/projects/1427077015/star-wars-yodas-nightmare-movie-posters?ref=discovery_category_newest,1427077015/star-wars-yodas-nightmare-movie-posters,"Starting small, the goal of this exciting campaign is to simply raise funds for the movie posters for Star Wars: Yoda's Nightmare.Star Wars: Yoda's Nightmare is a feature film set when Yoda takes refuge on Dagobah, a swampy, misty, and remote planet from Order 66. This refuge leaves Yoda in apparently total isolation; however, he is not alone. Rising from the swamps are the indigenous Sith Witches of Dagobah who taunts and haunts Yoda. Unfortunately for Yoda, the new Galactic Empire tracks down his escape pod and clone troopers and stormtroopers commanded by Grand Admiral Thrawn are sent to Dagobah before Lord Vader has time to deal with Yoda first.I am Freddy and it is my pleasure to present Star Wars: Yoda's Nightmare. From what you have read about the story above was way different in the past. This story first developed around 2016 or 2017 where the story was originally in the eyes of the stormtroopers who were sent to find Yoda and I really loved the idea of this being a horror, found footage film type of movie. Think Cloverfield or End of Watch. The stormtroopers never find Yoda, except a disease which takes the lives of some troopers causing the remaining troopers to flee back to their ship. Unfortunately the disease spreads on the ship and there is no other solution except for Vader eliminating everyone, including those who were not infected. Vader acts as the Tyrant/Mr. X (Resident Evil 2 2019) in covering up the whole thing and making sure word does not get out about this.Many years gave room for countless thoughts and inspirations to cultivate the story into where the story is now. Including the many years before this film came into thought where I was just a kid, a profound Star Wars fan just like the rest of you. Courtesy of George Lucas and everyone responsible for making our favorite Star Wars stories come to life. I was born in Washington State on an Army base and grew up in Tucson, Arizona in the United States and I am grateful to be in the position of joining the many Star Wars storytellers in telling the next Star Wars story. Star Wars has a great way of bringing us together and has a groundbreaking community.The movie posters are a great way to let people know how their beloved, epic Star Wars characters will look like and spread awareness about the film itself. This project will succeed with the help of generous backers and die-hard Star Wars fans!The exciting posters will be protected when being shipped because the slightest tear or damage will break our hearts knowing that the poster was unsatisfactory to you, our beloved backers and Star Wars fans. To read more about the safety of the posters, please scroll down to Risks and Challenges.The movie posters will be made from scratch and depict the characters in amazing detail on 24 x 36. The posters will be delivered in May and this is the first Kickstarter campaign for this film as it's goal is to raise funds to mass produce said posters for the film. Backers of this project will get the posters of their choosing as a reward.May the Force Be With You.Thank you,Freddy.","Posters are very delicate so it is extremely important that they do not suffer from even the smallest rip or tear. Wrapping it in protection will ensure safety from damage. We deem it very important for people to know when their posters arrive, so tracking IDs will be provided in case if your desired posters have gone missing, we will replace them for you.Please comment on any risks that you may think will affect the quality of the posters. Thank you."

It's said that if you can stare down the length of the Illchester Tunnel for an hour, without blinking, precisely at midnight, Peeping Tom will appear. Once you've seen him, he can't be unseen. Every time you blink, he gets closer and closer, until he's the last thing you see.Butterfly Kisses is available on Blu Ray and is streaming free on Amazon Prime.With a tale as rich and open as what filmmaker Erik Kristopher Myers has created in Butterfly Kisses, it was easy to see the potential for more stories delving into the legend of The Blink Man and the history of the haunted Illchester Tunnel. I talked it over with Erik and fortunately, he agreed. So we started talking to writers, both here in Baltimore and abroad, and we've put together a collection of amazing stories, each set in a different time period, that weave together a kind of history of the horror unleashed in that tunnel.You'll read about the fate of one of the men who helped construct the tunnel in 1903, a blaster with the unlikely name of Thom.There's the story of a professor, brought to Ellicott City to lecture on the history of Flimmerngeists and their possible connection to Carcosa and the court of the Yellow King.A troubled man's life takes a turn for the worse when a local shopkeeper leads him to a terrifying encounter.Folklore expert Matt Lake receives a mysterious old poem that appears to tell the tale of someone who once encountered the Blink Man.A cheating husband's attempt to bid a permanent farewell to his wife descends into madness and death.A holy man with one eye scarred and always open journeys to the Illchester Tunnel and sees an awful figure off in the distance.Caught in an eternal midnight, a reckless teen questions the choices that brought him face to face with his own destruction.A man traumatized by war turns to a hypnotist for relief, but the hypnotist learns the true cause of the man's trauma and makes a horrifying decision.A student decides that her favorite teacher's untimely death wasn't suicide, but rather the result of a meeting with the Blink Man.Police detectives investigate the disappearance of a survey team at the site of the Illchester tunnel.An English archeological survey of the tunnel reveals some startling anomalies.And a local man explains to the police how a seemingly accidental car accident ties back to the Illchester Tunnel and the infamous Blink Man.William Couper is an author of a variety of short fiction available at Amazon.Jacob Le Doux is the star of the film 8 Ball Clown and the frontman for the band Crimson Orchid.K. Patrick Glover is the author of the graphic novel A Wicked Little Town and the publisher of Roxton Press.Seth Adam Kallick is the star of Butterfly Kisses and the author of American Nightmares.Matt Lake is the author of the books Weird Maryland and Weird Pennsylvania.

Spring-heeled Jack (London), Cropsey (Staten Island), or Slenderman (Waukesha). In 2018 Maryland’s terrifying legend of Peeping Tom was brought to light with director Erik Kristopher Myer’s award winning horror mockumentary Butterfly Kisses. With Myer’s efforts as well as the tireless investigatory work of documentary film maker Crane Peeping Tom aka The Blink Man is finally becoming a household name and a warning to anyone who ignores it. Now, we are very lucky to have been given the opportunity to have an authorized collection of stories and experiences on The Blink Man that explores and expands on the years of research and first hand accounts by historians, authors and survivors. All of the stories are expertly written and ready to be bound in our beautifully designed book making it the most perfect and definitive tome on an urban legend to date.Released in 2018, Butterfly Kisses is an award winning and critically acclaimed horror film / documentary that deconstructs and reinvents the found footage genre. It documents the journey of Gavin York, an aspiring film maker who stumbles across footage left behind by two film students who faced a monstrous urban legend and were never seenagain. Butterfly Kisses has a growing fanbase and worldwide distribution through Gravitas Ventures.In Elliott City, Maryland, there is an old railway tunnel, The Ilchester Tunnel, and if you manage to stare down to the other for an entire hour up to midnight, without blinking, it will summon Peeping Tom, The Blink Man. Once summoned, The Blink Man will watch over you, standing silently but getting closer each time you blink until his eyelashes are touching yours.""According to playground historians, if a person stands at the far side of the trestle spanning the Patapsco River at exactly midnight, and if he or she possesses the strength of will to stare into Ilchester Tunnel without blinking their eyes for one uninterrupted hour, they will see Peeping Tom appear at the tunnel's far end.""Throughout history many people have been foolish or unfortunate enough to cross paths with The Blink Man, but who is he, how long has he been here and why, the questions brought up in Erik Kristopher Myer’s Butterfly Kisses, can finally be revealed.Since the release of Erik Kristopher Myers' award winning mockumentary more and more stories and experiences of The Blink Man have emerged and thanks to the efforts of an international group of writers, poets and historians we have managed to combine all these stories into one passionately constructed tome.Several tales inspired by local history, legends and superstition surrounding the cursed Ellicott City.A professor, brought to Ellicott City to lectureon the phenomenon of 'flickering spirits'.A troubled man's life takes a turn for the worse when a local shopkeeper leads him to a terrifying encounter.Folklore expert Matt Lake receives a mysterious old poem that appearsto tell the tale of someone who once encountered the Blink Man.A cheating husband's attempt to bid a permanent farewell to his wife descends into madness and death.A holy man journeys to the Ilchester Tunnel and sees an awful figure off in the distance.A reckless teen questions the choices that brought him face to face with his own destruction.A man traumatized by war turns to a hypnotist for relief with horrifying consequences.A student has good reason to believe that her favorite teacher's untimely death wasn't suicide.Police detectives investigate the disappearance of a survey team at the site of the Ilchester tunnel.Research into the tunnel reveals some startling anomalies.And a seemingly accidental car accident ties back to the Ilchester Tunnel and the infamous Blink Man.The artwork to In The Blink of an Eye is created by Ilan Sheady, a specialist in horror.""I've been a huge fan of Butterfly Kisses and the idea of The Blink Man since the first moment I watched it. Found footage can be very polarising subgenre but when it is done right it can make a huge impact. Similar to Blair Witch and it's mysterious stick figures Butterfly Kisses offers enough visual iconography that it's frighteningly easy to expand on that world. As rich, dynamic and enticing as the cover is, it is constructed purely from the key elements of the legend repeated over and over again demanding to have more added to it until it becomes a struggle to stop.""The paperback anthology book will be beautifully but eerily designed by Uncle Frank Productions, a specialist in producing artwork for the horror genre.An audio version of In The Blink of an Eye is being heavily considered with the voice and audio talents of Head-cinema Productions Mariam M. Draeger.

It ran on a station whose parent company rhymed with “Fear Flannel”. The folks at the radio station ""loved us"". It was 3 hours of talk every Saturday…unless there was a Baseball game or anything else that might preempt us. During our second year there, we got “permanently preempted"".In February of 2006, we re-launched the show as a podcast and expanded our focus. We brought in writers, scientists, comic book artists and more. Our cast has morphed and changed over the years in size and interests but we have retained the one core value from our origins, talking about cool stuff we like.I have always been fascinated by the writing process. Over the years, one of my greatest joys on the podcast has been the opportunity to talk to writers about their books, ideas and processes.  One day, I was up in the attic of my mother in law's house when my wife and I came across a box of old tintypes. Unfortunately no one had any idea who they were. I wondered not only who they were, but how those pictures got to be labeled “Family”.A few years later I was at a convention sitting in a pub with a group of writers, listening to them discuss their latest projects. I said to them, “Hey, I have this idea….” And began to outline an idea for a book of short stories about a fictional family based on those tintypes. Many of those present that afternoon are included in this collection. From that pub meeting 3 years ago, I am pleased to present “My Peculiar Family”, an anthology of 16short stories from writers and friends of Sci Fi Saturday Night, the Podcast.This anthology features original never before seen stories by:Christopher Golden and James A. Moore,Stacey Longo,Jason J.Mooers,Robert Mayette,William Meikle,F. Allen Farnham,Samantha Boyette,David Schechter, Rob Watts,Kristi McDowell,Karen Gosselin,George O'Conner,Derrick Belanger,Bracken MacLeod,John PallisanoandTracy Hickman.Original artwork byPeter Vinton, Jr.andSara RichardThe individual stories are based entirely on a package each author was given containing a tintype, a name and an occupation/fact about that person. And yes, some of those tintypes are the ones we found in the attic that fateful day.The stories run the gamut of genres from fantasy to science fiction to horror and beyond, simply based on the the authors inspiration from the picture.This book represents the combined efforts of 18 talented writers, 2 amazing artists and a dedicated editorial staff. The funds raised will go directly to them and cover production costs. After fulfillment the book will be available for purchase on the Sci Fi Saturday night website.Join us as we discover the stories of My Peculiar Family.The Rob Watts Creepy Time RewardA signed hardcover edition of ""The Crooked Roads Through Cedar Grove"" including a mini-vinyl and CD of the soundtracksThe Derrick Belanger Sherlock Holmes RewardHis 2 volume signed anthology “A Study In Terror: Sir Arthur Conan Doyle’s Revolutionary Stories of Fear and The Supernatural""The F.

So, lets start with WOW, It’s Stretch Goal Time!!!!!!! (Dome takes a deep breath and continues)If we reach $ 3500.00 we are going to include the story Agatha by Scott Thomas. Scott Thomas is an author of otherworldly fiction. Scott loves good old-fashioned ghost stories and Agatha is a throwback “Black Widow “ tale. A devotee of John Carpenter, William Peter Blatty and Thomas Harris, Scott brings us a tale in classic tradition.Lets make this tale part of the “Family"".My Peculiar Family is an anthology of gothic horror and unusual stories like none ever published before!  Combining New York Times bestselling authors (Christopher Golden, Tracy Hickman), Amazon bestselling authors (William Meikle, Derrick Belanger, Rob Watts), award winning authors (James A. Moore, Stacey Longo), and emerging talents, this anthology unites these authors, who have sold millions and million books between them, to come together for a common cause.While the authors will be paid for their stories, the majority of funding from this Kickstarter project will go to the weekly podcast Sci-Fi Saturday Night.  Our goal with this project is to provide the seed money for Sci-Fi Saturday Night and Belanger Books to produce projects in all realms of media. Together, they will create a line of extraordinary horror and science fiction books, everything from steampunk to splatter house.What makes this anthology so original?  A woman by the name of Chyna Dale discovers in her attic a box of old tintype photos.  Each picture features a mysterious portrait of a single person. Who are these people?  What are their stories?  What makes them so…peculiar? Each author had to answer these questions in their unique tale.  All of the authors received one of Chyna Dale’s tintypes, a name for the photographed person, and the person’s occupation.  Some of the stories are more on the horror side, some more paranormal, some science-fiction/fantasy, but all are linked together by Chyna Dale’s discovery.  Here are just some of the authors included in the anthology: Christopher Golden and James A. Moore start off the anthology with their co-written Chyna Dale story.

Both men have tales to tell and secrets to reveal.”“When Dome asked me to be a part of this project, I jumped at the opportunity.

It can be hard to find the time or the money to join a gym; and if you do, you have no idea how to use all that fitness equipment and how build an effective program without hiring a personal trainer. Getting educated also takes a lot of effort because most websites overwhelm you with information and make it difficult to find the practical help you need.Having faced these challenges myself, I launchedWorkoutLabs – a website with simple tools and resources to help make fitness more accessible. Since launching the website in January, nearly half a million people have used our free tools andloved it.With your help, the Exercise Cards will extend the reach of the WorkoutLabs project (self-funded so far) and create another tool to make fitness simpler and more accessible.DESIGNI put a lot of time in the design of the cards – from optimizing the layout and illustrations' size to making sure the text sizes and spacing is just right. I am very happy with how they came out and I think you will love holding them in your hand.PAPER CHOICEI purposefully chose to have the deck printed with the US Playing Card Company instead of using traditional digital printers. The Bicycle® card paper is designed to last through extensive handling and wear and with rounded corners, you will be able to take a few cards in your pocket and not worry about them getting bent or damaged.DELIVERY FOR CHRISTMASI look forward to giving the Exercise Cards deck as a Christmas gift to a lot of my friends and I know you would like to as well. I have planned the production timeline to finalize the artwork with the USPCC and be ready to place the order by the end of this campaign. Assuming there are no delays with the printing, I will get the delivery in early December with enough time to get them to you by Christmas.PROCEEDSAny proceeds beyond the cost of production and shipping will go towards further developing WorkoutLabs – extending the website content and functionality and possibly creating additional exercise decks for the gym, yoga and others.I am a New York based entrepreneur with a design background and a passion for simple and quality products that make lives better. I am lucky to have found a project that I love and one that reaches so many people in a positive way.A HUGE thank you for supporting this project and sharing with your friends!– Artem","There are risks and challenges with every project that can occur outside of my control no matter how much planning has been done.

Every detail was given extensive thought and attention.Available in Men's and Women's versions, the deck contains 54 beautifully-designed plastic cards that add up to a comprehensive training suite:In your bag, purse or pocket, you can take your EXERCISE CARDS deck everywhere life takes you – business trips, vacation or just a trip to the park.Each exercise card is professionally illustrated to show correct form and movement so you don't have to worry about remembering the exercises by their names. Need more guidance? Targeted muscles and written instructions are on the back.If you are just getting started or want guidance, we've included 5 easy-to-follow workout routines adaptable to all fitness levels and more will be available online for free download.Worked through the included routines and want to change things up? Shuffle the deck and build your own workouts with your favorite exercises. Endless possible combinationswill keep your workout sessions interesting and challenging.Made entirely of plastic, the EXERCISE CARDS keep their shape, don’t tear and you can wash them if soiled – so your deck will stay in top shape…like you! The tuck box stock also has an extra layer of thin glossy plastic for added durability.The EXERCISE CARDS deck will be available in Men’s and Women’s versions featuring their respective illustrations.This is my second Kickstarter campaign for the EXERCISE CARDS project. The original campaign wasn't successful because my plan was to print the deck with the United States Playing Card Company with their 2,500-deck minimum (5,000 total for Men's and Women's versions) – so the funding goal was difficult to reach. It's actually great that it didn't work out because it lead to me discovering the other printing company and their plastic cards. Here is the video from the original project:I createdWorkoutLabsto make fitness simpler and more accessible for myself and others encountering various challenges in making fitness part of their life –whether it’s lack of time or money for a gym, not knowing how to build effective workouts or being overwhelmed by cluttered fitness websites that require a lot of effort to dig through for practical information.Since launching the website in January of this year, nearly half a million people have used our free tools andloved it.With your support, the EXERCISE CARDS will be another simple tool for everyone looking for ways to lead a healthy lifestyle.I am a New York based entrepreneur with a design background and a passion for simple and quality products that make lives better. I am lucky to have found a project that I love and one that reaches so many people in a positive way.A HUGE thank you for supporting this project and sharing with your friends!Find me on Instagramor Facebook!– William (Artem)","As with any project, there are risks and challenges that can occur outside of my control. Potential issues can involve delays in production or shipping and other unknowns such as natural disasters. I will deal with any issues promptly and as best as possible, while keeping you, my backers, updated while they are resolved."

I will be roaming the countryside determined to prove to the world that music is more than just some random chords and a gimmick to sell lunch boxes or blue jeans; it is the universal language and our most cherished form of self expression. This self expression is imperative to our survival as in desperate times a modest song can be the voice of an entire nation, an entire world. A few notes can achieve far more than any war, as war only knows how to destroy. Whereas a simple melody can inspire the masses and I hope to capture it all on tape.On a daily basis I will be filming the first hand struggles of an unknown artist traveling the country, determined to beat the odds and survive as a traveling one-man musical show. My goal in 2012 is to play over 200 shows nation wide and interact with a tremendous amount of people. All in an attempt to develop both a fan base and an extensive catalog of video recordings based around these people expressing their love for music and their opinions on how the music industry has changed in their lifetime. I will take you underground as we unveil the not so glamorous lifestyle of a lone voice lost in a sea of pink noise.......from back alley load-ins to a strangers couch at 4 A.M... you will get to see first hand the trials, tribulations, conversations and midnight revelations of a starving artist.Regardless of the films success, I am confident I will capture many life times worth of memories and perspectives that will sculpt me into the person I am yet to be. This is what I would like to share with the world. Regardless of how long I survive or how many miles I wander, each step is meant to motivate and inspire people of all ages to take a chance and manifest their dreams into reality, regardless of the odds or the sacrifice required.As I travel, hopefully some of you out there would like to participate in the film and share your thoughts on the modern music industry, the music of your past or any hopes/ideas for the future. I think it would be incredible to capture all these viewpoints and make a film that simply amplifies exactly how important music is to all of us.All money raised will be used to cover touring expenses and equipment cost. This is a year long project, thus all corners will be cut in an effort to utilize every penny and keep the overhead costs to an absolute minimum ensuring the efficiency of the project.. My van will act as my home and will shield me from the elements as I travel from city to city. Meals will be sparse, showers will be haphazard and sleep will be non-existent.Over the course of 2012 I am hoping to gather thousands of hours worth of video, not to mention a landslide of pictures, stories, faces, ideas and pure geological beauty to be compiled into a no longer than 90minute film documentary entitled ""WILL SING FOR FOOD"". The details above have presented an atmosphere for the film, but the actual content and theme will remain completely unknown. I have no idea what I will find, who I will meet or what difference will come from any of it.............but I cannot wait to find out.",,https://www.kickstarter.com/projects/1490388300/the-wandering-madman-2014-album-52-songs-of-saluta?ref=discovery_category_newest,1490388300/the-wandering-madman-2014-album-52-songs-of-saluta,"If successfully funded, this project will help pay for the food, water & gasoline I need to survive the winter. Not having to worry about my next meal will eliminate much time that is wasted busking for the pocket change that typically keeps me afloat when I am traveling. This freed time will be spent working on my original live-looping music which can be experienced at the following link.http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qJVHr3gu9L0I'ld love to be the reason for hundreds of smiles every single day.How incredible would it be to hear a classic song on your iPod, only to realize it's good 'ol jeffro behind the wheel, taking you for a stroll down memory lane....For those of you who don't know me, my name is Jeff, everyone calls me ¡FRO! and I am ""The Wandering Madman"". I live in a box truck (2 years now) that I personally converted into a mobile home/music venue. I travel the country, typically playing for free & I always offer free CD's at every show. Then I do my best to live off of the donations I receive but it is the smiles and support of the people I meet that truly keeps me going, regardless of how much coin is left in my pocket. I do this to inspire, I do this to motivate & I do this to tear down the walls of social standards that can keep even the most beautiful person trapped in a box of loneliness & uncertainty. I'm here to remind you that you are beautiful, and when you believe in yourself you can accomplish anything you set your mind to.This project is to help make 2014 possible in the land of The Wandering Madman. These funds will help pay for food & gasoline as I continue to expand my touring turf as well as gear up for a MASSIVE & LONG OVERDUE release of original/live looping material in 2015. I still have much work to do but your donations will help me dedicate 24 hours of every single day to recording & mixing instead of pan handling for my next Subway sammich! In another years time I will be releasing a plethora of live-looping music videos that will take the world by storm, and you guys are the ones who will make it all possible!In return for your support, you will gain access to a huge library of jeffro jingles. Classic songs done by your truly on the piano, 52 in total.From Pink Floyd to Pearl Jam!Amazing Grace to Alice In Chains! From the Foo Fighters to Frank Sinatra,Beatles to the Eagles. I promise something for everyone!In addition to the audio tracks, other rewards will include..... access to all 52 correlating music videos, T-shirts, Web Shows, House Parties & the chance for me to sing you happy birthday! Thank you guys for your support! At times it is the only thing that keeps me going. The fact that I can single handedly bring my music & my love to the entire world without a ginormous Pepsi or Hardee's logo on the side of the box-truck makes me extremely proud. You guys are the ones that make it possible, thank you!****Several of the rewards have options to choose from. You can email me (TheWanderingMadman@gmail.com) to let me know which options you are choosing, or once the project has ended, Kickstarter allows me to send out a questionnaire to find out what options you prefer. The only exception to this is the reward to choose one of the songs to be recorded. If you choose this reward I ask you email me (TheWanderingMadman@gmail.com) and let me know ahead of time which song you want to hear so I can have it ready by the Jan 1st release date. Thanks!","The journey is only as beautiful as the obstacles you've overcome.It has been quite an adventure to reach this point. I feel oh so very close to finding some success & finally gaining some recognition for my music, but it has taken me over 20 years of practicing music, 10 years of working as a traveling roadie/audio engineer/event producer, 8 years of performing in bands, 5 years as a dedicated loop artist, 3 years living in my vehicle and 2 years living in this magnificent box truck/mobile home/mobile venue/recording studio to finally reach the place I find myself now. It has been such a wonderful journey filled with so many people I love. I am lucky to have so many fond memories that asking for even one more seems slightly absurd.Though it can feel overwhelming to pave a new path for yourself, my true fear has always been of falling complacent in a life so abundant with adventure, joy & curiosity. I'm here to assure you that when you follow your dreams there are no risks because everything else is worth the sacrifice. I have met some incredibly talented people in my life, and I know for a fact that most of the people reading this have incredible dreams of their own. I greatly appreciate your support of my shinanegans but please understand at the end of the day this is all designed to help you believe in yourself and follow your own vision of what your life should be.  Love what you do, do what you love. Leave the world better than you found it. You & I can only do so much, but together we can accomplish anything.I do everything I can to live efficiently so never underestimate how a simple $10 donation can make a huge impact on my life. Thank you!"

The long term aim is to produce a vast range of Personality and Diorama's from both the Book or Mormon and the Bible.They are available both as Fully ""Hand Painted"" Collectors figures, or as Unassembled and Unpainted white metal kits.Wood Plinth Bases are available as an option during the Pledge Manager Phase, if desired.These fully painted figures are great for Collectors, as Gifts for Loved Ones, for Temple Visitor Centers or Stake Center Displays, or for helping to introduce the Scripture Personalities to people.If you are a Hobbyist, and like to paint your own stuff they are also available as a plain metal kit. Great for class hobby projects, or even to paint and sell yourself.These ARE NOT TOYS, and not recommended for people under the age of 14.I am running this campaign to fund bringing the range into full production, to help fund the next set of figures, and to help pay for product packaging.Each Original Miniature is sculpted by hand from 2 Part Resin Epoxy Putty by Edward Spettigue. When dried this hardens like metal, so you have a limited time to work with it. This is a time consuming process using lots of specialized tools.Each figure is a work of Love, Faith and Inspiration.Miniatures are crafted from just putty, or sometimes from a mix of wire, ""metal dolls"", and putty. Below is a work in progress, John Baptizing Jesus Christ.Once the original Sculpt is completed, it is placed in a rubber mold, which ultimately is used to create a ""Metal Master Miniature"". This is done by applying heat and pressure.Multiple Master Miniatures are then placed in another Mold to create a Production Mold.The figures are then cleaned and filed to remove any excess metal, or Mold Lines. They are then primed with a base coat, and painted with Love and Care by hand using a wide variety of paints and colors.The First miniature in the range is Joseph Smith. This figure is dedicated to Sister Hannah Pugmire, who's Faith, Calm, and Guidance is a constant source of Amazement to me. She is a shining example of all that is good.D&C 12:1""A great and marvelous work is about to come forth among the Children of Men""The Second miniature in the range is Moroni. This figure is dedicated to Sister McKenna Creager, a new source of Light in my Life, and a welcome Friend.Moroni 1:3""And I, Moroni, will not ""deny"" the Christ; wherefore, I wander whithersoever I can for the safety of mine own life"".They are available Individually or as a Set.The Third miniature in the range is Lehi. This figure is dedicated to Sister Erika Ray, without who, I would not have made it these last few months. She is my source of Inspiration and Hope, and will be missed dearly when she leaves our Ward. Her Faith is Relentless, more than she knows herself. May she be safe in all her travels and doings.1 Nephi 1:14-15""And it came to pas that when my Father had read and seen many great and marvelous things, he did exclaim many things unto the Lord;such as:Great and Marvelous are thy works, O Lord God Almighty!Thy throne is high in the Heavens and thy power and goodness, and mercy are over all the inhabitants of the earth; and because thou art merciful, thou will not suffer those who come unto thee that they shall perish"".""And after this manner was the language of my father in the praising of his God; for his soul did rejoice, and his whole heart was filled, because of the things which he had seen, yea, which the Lord had shown unto him"".The Fourth miniature in the range is a Pillar of Fire.They are available Individually or as a Set.The Fifth miniature in the range is Nephi. This figure is dedicated to the Mary Hill & Mitch Kauffman. Friends for Life, they have given without thought of gain, and guided me in my Journey.1 Nephi 4:6""And I was led by the Spirit, not knowing beforehand the things which I should do"".The Sixth miniature in the range is Laban lying Dead. This miniature is dedicated to all those who are cut off from God, and do not see the way.They are available Individually or as a Set.The Seventh miniature in the range is Samuel. This figure is dedicated to Bishop Thomas. Though small in stature, he is mighty of God, his presence the size of a Mountain, his Words and Faith, an Inspiration to all. May God Bless he and his family always.The Eighth miniature in the range is Moses. This figure is dedicated to my Uncle Arthur. My life long hero, a true man of God, and a person I can only aspire to be. I will never to be able to Thank him for the ""unknown"" influence he has had on me.This picture shows all 8 Miniatures together.Unpainted FiguresIndividual Unpainted Miniatures are $15 each.Pick any 4 Unpainted Miniatures $52 (one figure is Half Price!).Complete Set of 8 Unpainted Miniatures is $105 (one figure is FREE!).Painted FiguresIndividual Painted Miniatures are $35.00 each.Pick any 4 Painted Miniatures $122 (one figure is Half Price!).Complete Set of 8 Painted Miniatures is $245 (one figure is FREE!).If you would like additional miniatures, please add the appropriate amount to your pledge. This can be done at any pledge level.NOTE THAT WOOD PLINTHS WILL BE AVAILABLE DURING THE PLEDGE MANAGER PHASE AT AN ADDITIONAL COST.A shipping charge of $8 is built in at each pledge level. Shipping charges above this amount will be collected prior to shipment of your figures.Complete Sets of 8 Painted figures will ship for FREE!If the Project Reaches $7,500 in funding backers pledging $52.50 or more will receive a FREE Unpainted, John Baptizing Jesus Christ Miniature.(If you would like to have this miniature painted instead, please add $20 to your pledge).","The biggest risk in this process is simply time, depending on the success of the project. All the figures have been sculpted, and mastered. The delivery of painted figures will take time for obvious reasons, where as plain metal figures are available almost immediately.Health and all the normal distractions of life will get in the way as normal, but that's just life!Otherwise this is just production and business as normal.",https://www.kickstarter.com/projects/862832883/28mm-metal-sci-fi-dwarf-miner-warriors-and-their-enemies?ref=discovery_category_newest,862832883/28mm-metal-sci-fi-dwarf-miner-warriors-and-their-enemies,"This is the first New Line of figures being added to the Battle Valor 28mm Sci Fi Line. It consists of Warriors of the Dwarf Miners Guild and some of the many Alien Species they encounter during their explorations of the tunnels and caverns below the surfaces of the planets they settle.Some of these Aliens are friendly. Some not. Some start of friendly and rebel. Some are conquered and put to work. There are many species.All the miniatures have been Sculpted, and many have been Mastered.There are 54 unique figures in the Miners Guild range. They are extremely characterful, and armed with a wide variety of weaponry and equipment. All are ready to confront the horrors of the darkness.The Aliens are unique in that there are 11 different heads, and 8 different bodies. You get to pick the bodies you want, and a set of heads to go with them. This gives you a huge variety to choose from. You can create all kinds of unique monstrosities. All you have to do is unlock each one!Many more figures will be added to each range, with a wide variety of new alien Bodies and Heads to come. Both ranges will get equipment, accessories and more.I am running this Kickstarter to fund bringing these awesome figures into production.Here are the Miner packs.During the Pledge Manager Phase, you will be able to choose a single type of head to go with each Alien Body pack you order, so they could all have the same one, or every pack could be different.The following are Unlockable ItemsIf we get this far I will add additional Unlocks.You can add on as many packs as you like. Just total them up and add that amount of money to your pledge. Note, Add On prices per pack change at each pledge level.During the Pledge Manager Phase Backers will have access to the full range of 28mm Battle Valor Sci Fi, Pulp and Fantasy Figures, which contains over 200 different codes.All shipping charges will be collected when you package is ready to go, before it is mailed.All orders over $200 will ship for FREE!US Customers below $200 will pay actual shipping cost.UK & European Orders will be shipped to Dragonfrog in the UK who will forward them.A flat fee of $7.50 will be collected prior to shipment for these orders.I will pay the additional shipping and customs for you, unless you asked to be shipped directly, in which case you will have to pay your own customs and shipping fees.International Customers below $200 will receive a 50% discount on the actual shipping cost.","Everything is basically ready to go, and what isn't will be by the time the KS ends. Miniatures will be stock piled and shipped within 21 days of receiving pledge managers.The only real risk is the effects of COVID, and delays in shipping. As I will be doing everything from home, and will probably be on lock down again or still, it should keep me very focussed."
https://www.kickstarter.com/projects/blackcatmoto/blackcat-motorcycles-and-coffee?ref=discovery_category_newest,blackcatmoto/blackcat-motorcycles-and-coffee,"BlackCat Motorcycles & Coffee: Unifying motorcycle enthusiasts, artists, and coffee connoisseurs under one roof. We wanted to create something that spawned an atmosphere that appeals to all ages, a place that doesn’t feel exclusive to someone with little knowledge of coffee, motorcycles, or art appreciation. Together, with the help of all of you, Costa Mesa can have a space that encourages people not only to patron our shop but to stay and absorb the overall experience of the culture and community as well. BlackCat will build relationships through local artist showcase, community involvement, and local influence and outreach as well as give back to our community in more ways than just a cool spot to grab a solid cup of coffee. About the Partners:Nick Galaura:I was born in Hawaii and raised in LA. I’m a musician, an artist and I love motorcycles. And coffee. And all caffeine. I started “Black Cat Boys Club” with 3 of my best friends in 2013. Just a group of friends that were into music, art, tattoos, everything. The idea behind the BlackCat name was that all of us at one point in 2013 had a stint of just the worst luck-Loss of a job, end of a serious relationship, I had given playing music up completely; But instead of just being bummed out, we decided as a group to just embrace it. What better way to embrace bad luck than the embodiment of bad luck itself: the black cat. Once Cory and I started riding and getting into motorcycles, it kind of got bigger than that. What's cool about motorcycle culture is that ""brotherhood"" that unspoken friendship-you see a guy riding on the other side of the street, you throw the two down and give the nod, and you're on your way. It's something that I thought was so rad. I think that idea is really what makes this project personal for me. You like coffee? Cool. You like motorcycles? Awesome. Music? Art? Wicked. Come through. It's not a biker stop. Its not a venue. It's not a coffee shop. It's all of it. It's everything we love, pick something you like about it and that's why you're there.Cory Linman:Growing up I always found myself feeling like I was on the outside of a lot of friend groups. I kinda just had my own way of doing things, and found myself gravitating towards people who did the same. When Nick and I met in college, I knew we were one in the same-we just had this mutual understanding and respect for the other. That's what BlackCat is to me: a unity of individuals who can come together and share their enthusiasm for the things we all love. I think that is what resonates within people and why after telling everyone what we’re trying to do, the idea is met with such enthusiasm. BlackCat is going to be a place of community. We want you to feel like once you come through the doors of BlackCat, you’re already a regular, you feel welcome, like a part of the family. You belong here.Why a coffee shop?In this day and age, for most people, drinking coffee is a daily routine: on your way to work, on your way home, all-nighters, early mornings, study sessions, and social gatherings. Not only that, coffee is used as a vehicle for conversation-Grabbing a cup of coffee with a friend, potential boss, or potential business partner is now a way of life. It’s easy. A coffee meeting can be as formal or as informal as you want it to be.Why motorcycles?Like most motorcycle enthusiasts: men and women who ride, we love working on our bikes. Customizing each bike to make them our own. The tricky thing about that is finding parts, sure there’s the local Harley or Moto shop around, but we want to carry companies that maybe most people haven’t heard of and the ones you have, you can only get their gear by ordering it, waiting a couple days and hoping the Postal Service doesn’t lose your package. Buying gear is all about the experience: being able to hold that one piece you’ve been eyeing in your hand and physically comparing it to its competitor. What’s great about motorcycle culture, we think, is the camaraderie: bike nights, camping trips, group rides and the friendships you build through events like that-ALL centered around motorcycles. We want to bring that culture to the shop.A venue? As musicians ourselves, we understand finding venues to showcase your band can be a struggle especially if you’re not selling out shows all over the state. It is equally difficult as an artist to showcase your work if you can’t feature your work in a gallery. We want to bring opportunities to local musicians and artists to be heard and seen and eventually establish BlackCat as a music/art destination, where artists and musicians can be featured and receive recognition within the city. What happens next?We love our city. Costa Mesa has felt like home for us since we came to live here after college. However, Anyone that lives here or in any part of Orange County can’t deny the fact that the homeless population isn’t a small one. The 2015 annual estimate for the unduplicated number of homeless people in Orange County was 15,291 persons and even though Orange County has a 10 year plan to end homelessness, it’s up to us our community to help. Once BCMC is funded and the doors to the shop are opened, we will be partnering with a local homeless shelter, soup kitchen, charity, or all three to provide care, job training, and food for homeless singles, parents, and their children. We are constantly thinking of ways to help our community and the families in it, we want everyone we know to be a part of this project so if you know of a company-even your local church/house of worship that shares a passion for the homeless or the local community-we want to know what and specifically who they are and how we can help. Even if you can't donate financially to BlackCat, telling people about the project and what we are trying to do is involvement we welcome and are incredibly grateful for. We want to create a company that supports the people who support us.Why we need your help:What we need now is a boost; backers who are going to help us establish this creative space that also gives back to the community. We love coffee. We love motorcycles. We love music. But most of all, we love people and this project is an investment in the people of Costa Mesa and hopefully beyond just the City of Costa Mesa. If you can share this vision and you want to see it manifest, contribute what you can; show your support. Where will the money go?We've designed this Kickstarter goal as starting point in the vision of BlackCat. None of your money will be landing in either of our pockets. Your support will allow us to lease our building, bring it up to code to allow us to serve you, sell gear, and allow performances, music events and shows. The budget will also allow us to fill the shop with all of the required equipment to bring everyone a high quality cup of coffee, audio equipment, and overall BlackCat Experience. Finally, your contributions will allow us to stock some of our favorite brands that we ourselves wear and use including but not limited to Ruckus Apparel, Repop MFG., Biltwell, and Grifter USA.Where? Costa Mesa, CAThe BlackCat Motorcycles & Coffee team have found a building in Costa Mesa near Triangle Square. Over 15,000 people drive through this part of the city-to work, the beach, and local entertainment every single day. This building we want is one of the few locations that has a large enough parking lot allowing us to not only have ample parking for customers but to open th door of possibilities for events like monthly Bike Night, outdoor shows, and community fundraisers. We plan to open our doors in the Summer of 2017.Rewards:We tried to make our rewards system as simple and straight to the point as we possibly could. All of the rewards you receive as donors are pieces from our online store (www.blackcatmoto.com). You will be receiving these shirts/mugs/patches/stickers the same time as the customers that have pre-ordered the same gear. All of the proceeds of both the shop and this kickstarter go to funding the BCMC project.","Once the project is funded, the biggest challenge we know we will face is how to create a space that is not only comfortable for everyone to spend time in but a place that will house everything we plan to do within the city of Costa Mesa. We have found several potential buildings-all in prime locations-that have the capacity and zoning capabilities, the trickiest part is bringing those buildings up to code to not only serve food and sell products but to allow live performance as well.",https://www.kickstarter.com/projects/blackcatmoto/help-blackcat-moto-go-mobile?ref=discovery_category_newest,blackcatmoto/help-blackcat-moto-go-mobile,"ABOUT USBlackCat Motorcycles & Coffee was built upon our passion for community and love for people. Cory and I started BlackCat 2 years ago with plans to build a brick and mortar shop, make a bunch of cool gear, great coffee, and live out our lives as coffee shop owners doing what we love and never leaving the comfort of our potential shop.Plans change.Plans grow.Plans become plans within plans. Welcome to the newest phase of BlackCat Moto: A mobile coffee shop bringing you all original clothing, accessories, and in-house roasted coffee to any and every motorcycle show, parking lot sale, campout, wedding, bar mitzvah, and birthday party we can say “yes” to. We began as two friends, working to build something that gave back to the community. In Nick’s apartment in Fountain Valley, CA we learned how to screen print clothing, press pins, roast coffee and use every skill we had or could learn to provide not only quality products, but become part of the motorcycle community that we loved.We are still here, as friends and business partners, to take what we've built and expanded it further than we ever thought was possible. So far, we have “figured it out” and ""Yes’d"" our way into events like Biltwell’s 2017 Kernville Kampout, Aidan’s Ride 2017, and the 2018 Biltwell Annual Parking Lot Sale with gear that we didn’t own, on chances we didn’t deserve to get above anyone else.We've been given opportunities and made such incredible connections and friendships through this entire ride so far. This is why we need your help.BlackCat is completely funded out of our own pockets. The profits from the products that are sold during events and from the online store (www.blackcatmoto.com) are poured right back into the shop for more product, sellers permits, all of our required maintenance for our hardware, and put towards our commitment to donate 10% of all of our coffee sales, both in beans and drinks during events, to the Orange County homeless population.GOALSOur goal is simple: we want to be able to meet you-- all of you. We want to be able toprovide an experience with gear that we own ourselves and with a vehicle that is completely up to code.We have gear. We have the vehicle. Now we are asking for $3,000.00 to finish outfitting the truck we've lovingly named the CatMobile.$3,000.00 does not cover everything that we need (actually, not even close). But, it is a small starting point to cover the basics and set us up for success on our journey to become completely self-sufficient.Your money will be put into the following: 1. Water filtration system - Water filtration and reservoir tanks will be mounted underneath the truck, allowing us to separate our clean from our gray water (pretty important, right?).2. Upgrades to The Cat Mobile  -	This includes installing a 3-drop sink and hand wash station within the truck itself, the installation of the water filtration system, and coffee machine installation (ie. espresso, kettles, grinders, etc.).If we exceed our goal of $3.000:This is purely conditional on the success of this Kickstarter. BlackCat does not own an espresso machine: the cornerstone of any successful coffee shop. If we are able to exceed the $3,000.00 mark, the proceeds will then go towards purchasing an espresso machine and fast-tracking BlackCat's completion of building-out a fully operational, mobile coffee truck.We can't thank you enough for joining us on this journey. For sharing our story, for your heart for helping others, and for your desire to see a love for motorcycles, coffee, clothing, art, and people intersect.SPREAD THE WORDWhether you believe in the mission behind BlackCat, are an obligated friend or family member (hi, Mom), or want to help us get out into the community more so we can all hang out, we've made it easy for you to share this project with others online.

I've always wanted to name my own #coffee roast. http://kck.st/2FpjfR6","Every project comes with its own unique risks and challenges. We have faced many. We understand that just because we have the money does not mean that we will be successful. However. Every challenge that we have faced, we have faced head-on. We understand failure, but we also understand perseverance. Our biggest challenge is purely logistical. It's a paperwork challenge: Receiving the seal of approval through the county in which we submit our plans. Right now, we are looking at Orange County as being our largest location of operation. We are willing to do the work. We know there is a lot. There will always be a lot of work and we are so excited to do all of it."

With cutbacks and lack of funding for the arts, your generosity is the only way to provide our dancers with this necessity to ensure a successful launch and continued growth of the performing arts. We have 6,000 square feet of dance space that needs sprung floors and marley. Your donation is greatly appreciated!We have an amazing artistic director in Servy Gallardo and incredibly talented dancers here in St. Petersburg as well as coming in from around the country, but just need a floor for them to perform on.","Without assistance with purchasing our floors on time, we run the risk of losing our opening window, which will slow down the progress of the conservatory.",https://www.kickstarter.com/projects/spbc/dance-floors-needed?ref=discovery_category_newest,spbc/dance-floors-needed,"The St Petersburg Ballet Conservatory is busy cultivating partnerships and sponsorships to provide funding for flooring, additional marketing and costumes. We have two performances lined up already, and no dance floor to rehearse on. In order to train pre-professional dancers, you need high quality flooring. This project is getting so much support, but the financial backing takes time to finalize and we need to get the floors ordered in time to begin our season so our dancers don't miss any studio time in their training and dance education.","By not raising funds to continue our progress, we run the risk of not having the proper training for our dancers before performances that have been lined up for us to propel us forward into the performing arts community."
